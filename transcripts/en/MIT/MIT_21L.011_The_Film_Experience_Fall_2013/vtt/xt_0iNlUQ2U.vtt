00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.040
PROFESSOR: My intention
tonight is primarily

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.360
to provide you with some
suggestions, framings

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.210
that will help in your
viewing of these two films.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.930
And we'll also,
at the same time,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.330
reinforce and extend
some of the things

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.420
I was saying this afternoon
about Hitchcock's work

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.045
more generally.

00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:45.550
And about the recurring
preoccupations,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.370
themes, obsessions,
strategies that

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.460
are characteristic of his work.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.957
And I want to begin by
adding one note to what I

00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:55.040
was saying this afternoon.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.660
You remember I began this
afternoon by talking about

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.780
the relationship between
Hitchcock and what I call

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.890
the "Genius of the System"--
borrowing on that famous

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.489
passage from Andre Bazin,
who said Hollywood is very

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:08.530
interesting, and there
are interesting directors,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.750
but why don't we talk about
the genius of the system--

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.680
the way the system itself
encourages or enables complex

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.260
forms of narrative.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.930
And we've already talked
several times earlier

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.910
in the course about this topic.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.520
But there's another
way in which one

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.360
can think about this issue
with regard to Hitchcock.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.120
And I think it's
helpful in clarifying,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.520
so I want to mention it again.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.750
One way to think
about Hitchcock is

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.880
to think of the Hitchcock film
as a kind of genre unto itself.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.380
Right?

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.963
The Hitchcock.

00:01:38.963 --> 00:01:43.100
Just like the Western,
or the screwball comedy.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.080
Broadly, Hitchcock belongs
to the broad category

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.040
of what might be-- well, of two
categories-- the horror film--

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.280
although, he's a strange
director of horror.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.450
He certainly is
incredibly influential.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.070
In fact, when he made Psycho,
he publicly announced,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.150
"This is my first horror film."

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.280
Even though there are
elements of horror earlier.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.600
And it made something
of a publicity splash

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.780
when he said that.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.840
So one way to
understand Hitchcock

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.120
is to think of him
as participating

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.990
in at least two categories
of genre or subgenre

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.380
that are more and more
widespread than Hitchcock's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.330
work itself.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.860
And we might call that the
horror film and the mystery

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.670
film.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.590
And even that's a bit of
an oversimplification,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.570
because within the
category of mystery,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.030
you can have different
sort of subcategories.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.140
One of which is the sort of
romantic adventure of the sort

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.480
that North by Northwest.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.260
The chase film
starring Cary Grant

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.690
that Hitchcock made that
ends with characters

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.590
climbing across the
face of Mount Rushmore.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.490
So that's one sort of
action-adventure version

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.830
of a mystery story
that Hitchcock makes.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.950
Another version-- other versions
are examples of the films

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.330
that we're seeing tonight.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.800
But my point is that although
one could fit Hitchcock's film

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.060
into some sort of larger
category-- of mystery

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.970
or mystery and adventure,
something of that kind--

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.480
it's also the case that once
you begin to look closely

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.170
at Hitchcock's
films, you can see

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.530
that there's such a profound,
almost obsessional coherence

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.030
in them.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.280
They keep returning again and
again to those dominant themes

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.940
I talked about this afternoon.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.230
That one can see that
they, in some sense,

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.230
constitute a kind of
category of their own.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.430
If we think of-- so if
we think of the Hitchcock

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.520
as a kind of genre, even
within that category

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.000
we can discover
immense variation.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.340
So that Hitchcock's
example itself becomes

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.590
a kind of crystallized,
or distilled example

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.990
of the principle I've been
talking about all semester

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.510
concerning the way in which
a system like the Hollywood

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.280
system could engender
variation, even as it is also

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.155
committed to giving its audience
something that seems familiar,

00:04:02.155 --> 00:04:04.280
that they recognize, that
they're willing to attend

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.390
to week after week after week.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.460
I think the primary point is
this-- in a system in which you

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.280
have any habitual, a regular, a
daily, or a weekly relationship

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.029
to the material, there have
to be elements of familiarity,

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.700
of repetition.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.980
Of a return to shared
subjects and themes.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.870
Or you wouldn't do it.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.700
You would find it
intolerable every time

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.340
you made what was a routine or
habitual connection to a text,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.970
if what it gave you was a
completely new experience which

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.120
forced you in some sense
to begin at the beginning

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.600
to figure everything
out for your--

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.090
you would find that you would
resist such an experience.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.910
It's one thing to go to a
great overwhelming theatrical

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.810
experience once or twice a
year, or once or twice a month.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.970
It's quite another thing to try
to watch King Lear every day,

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.680
or even every week.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.290
So part of the
difference has to do

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.910
with the need to what it means
to have a habitual, rather

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.074
than an occasional,
connection to the artwork.

00:05:06.074 --> 00:05:07.490
And one of the
fundamental-- well,

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.200
maybe the most important thing
about the Hollywood studio

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.660
film, and later the
most important thing

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.480
about American television
narrative forms,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.370
is the is the intimate,
regular, routinized connection

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.915
that the viewer has
with the material.

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:26.790
And in the case of
Hitchcock, what we can say

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.440
is, really from
the very beginning

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.470
of his work to the end,
there are these fundamental,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.330
emotional, and strategic,
or technical coherences,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.050
resemblances, that made
virtually every Hitchcock

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.530
film a kind of commentary
on an earlier one.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.250
And the two films you
are seeing tonight

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.500
are a particularly
rich example of this.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.390
So I hope you'll think hard
about the way in which they

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.600
are both profoundly
different from each other,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.630
and also at the same time,
strangely, mysteriously,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.920
profoundly similar.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.300
How they circle back on the
same kinds of obsessions

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.650
and the same kinds of problems.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.430
And part of our pleasure
in looking at the two films

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.720
is the simultaneous
recognition of the difference

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.080
and similarity.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.660
Well, that is an example in
small compass of the larger

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.370
principle of popular aesthetics
that I was saying needs

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.770
to apply to the way in which
we understand the audience's

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.330
relation to the
classic Hollywood film.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.010
So as you're watching these two
films and thinking about them,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.390
think both about
resemblances and differences.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.090
And you'll get some sense of
how much remarkable variation is

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.830
possible within what remains
certain familiar conventions,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:44.900
expectations-- not only about
the content of the text.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.150
But also about the way
the text is organized,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.510
about its formal features.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.320
So what I'd like
to do then is say

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.580
a couple of introductory things
about each of the films you're

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.330
going to see.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.760
And if I'm able to
keep the time right,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.230
maybe we'll pause for one clip.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.180
Maybe we won't,
depending on how concise

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.840
I'm able to be in my arguments.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.220
You'll notice that Shadow
of a Doubt and Rear Window

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.070
are 11 years apart.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.509
And I think that's
significant because one

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:19.050
of the most interesting
ways to think

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.040
about comparing the
two films is to think

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.290
about the way in which
Rear Window seizes on many

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.030
of the preoccupations
and themes that

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.410
are at the center of
Shadow of a Doubt.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.810
But deals with them in
ways that one might say

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.460
are even more
disturbing and profound,

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.940
that press more deeply into the
implications that are mobilized

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.240
in the earlier film.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.790
And maybe that
sounds too general

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.980
and abstract and mysterious.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.630
Let me be specific
about what I mean.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.450
One example is-- one of the most
interesting aspects of Shadow

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.260
of a Doubt, if you look down
to my next to the last item,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.900
is what I call the subplot.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.050
And the subplot in
Shadow of a Doubt

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:08.210
involves essentially a kind
of subsidiary story about two

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.780
very ineffectual characters.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.550
In this subplot, the
husband of the family

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.710
has a kind of-- his
main preoccupation

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.870
when he's not working
at his bank-- is

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:22.370
he has an ongoing conversation
and sort of reading group

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.020
with his friend,
played by Hume Cronyn.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.160
Also as a diminutive man,
also a man who seems to

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.585
lack masculine force.

00:08:31.585 --> 00:08:33.830
He's short, he's not aggressive.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.200
And they spend their time
reading murder mysteries.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.760
And they spend their time trying
to devise the perfect murder.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.380
So part of what's
funny about this,

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.600
but also macabre
in its own way, is

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.900
that while these
two sort of capon

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.080
like older men-- who stand for
a kind of impotent maturity,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.330
a kind of useless,
unattractive maturity--

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.710
they spend their time
and their diversion

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.920
is to try to invent or
imagine murders and mayhem.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.470
When in fact a real
murderer is living

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.920
at the heart of the family.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.900
And Young Charlie herself
is actually in danger,

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.100
even though her father and and
no one around her in the world

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.900
understands that
that's the case.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.160
Although the viewer comes to
understand it fairly early.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.410
And even Young Charlie
comes to a recognition of it

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.920
before the film is over.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.340
So in this subplot,
what's going on

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.260
is we have two
sort of characters

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.520
playing at the
diversion of murder,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.110
and finding stories about
murder a kind of escape.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.610
And in fact, one
of them is actually

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.460
trying to devise the way to kill
someone and get away with it.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.600
And what we're
supposed to feel is

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.890
that this subplot is a reminder
to us about a number of things.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.250
But most disturbingly
and subversively,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.237
it should be a reminder
to the audience

00:09:48.237 --> 00:09:50.320
of what the audience is
doing sitting and watching

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.890
Hitchcock's film.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.180
Because the equivalent of
the audience in the movie

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.360
is-- one equivalent of
the audience in the movie

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.700
are these two sort
of foolish people

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:06.410
who, immersed in, and in
some degree surrounded

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:11.370
by evil and authentic
danger are living out

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.820
their silly diversions by
reading silly magazines

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.530
about murder stories.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.450
So it's a variation on
Hitchcock's obsession,

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.400
or deep, deep recurring interest
in the space of entertainment.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.110
And what it means to want
to go to entertainments.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.470
And there's a certain sense in
which every single Hitchcock

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:39.600
film enables or is grounded
upon this experience of sitting

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.660
in the dark-- actually
what sort of equivalent

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.370
to what the Jimmy
Stewart character does

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.970
in Rear Window-- sitting in
the dark, anonymous peeping

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.630
watching the lives
of other people.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:56.064
And the idea is not only
that you're anonymous,

00:10:56.064 --> 00:10:57.730
but in some sense
there's something sort

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.170
of illicit about it.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.920
As if in the
process of doing it,

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.980
you're indulging
what are base desires

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.440
or at least not totally
respectable impulses.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.270
But you're doing it in a
space of comparative safety

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.550
and a place of anonymity.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.240
So the subplot in Shadow of
a Doubt, in a certain sense,

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.870
raises self conscious
questions about the nature

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.570
of the entertainment
that we ourselves

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.820
are watching as
audiences for the film.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.680
All right?

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.930
And it's clearly a major
dimension of Shadow of a Doubt.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:35.340
It's one of the things that make
Shadow of a Doubt a rich movie.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.300
There's a kind of cunning,
cynical complexity in it

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.450
that careless viewers, or
very superficial viewers

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.530
won't pick up on.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.840
And it's really possible,
I could really imagine,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.840
that they were viewers
who came away from Shadow

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.810
of a Doubt fully satisfied.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.280
Thinking, oh yes,
evil has been purged.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.890
What a nice mystery story!

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.630
Never fully picking up on
the dramatized elements

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.010
of the text, which
put in question

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.190
the ease with which we embrace
these forms of entertainment,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.880
the ease with which we
accept murder and mayhem

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.550
as a form of diversion.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.740
And some of the implications
of that for human nature

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.080
and for our ideas of
entertainment itself.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:23.560
So that moment when in
Strangers on the Train

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.540
when the merry-go-round
goes mad and becomes

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.410
an instrument of
terror and murder

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.310
is another example of
Hitchcock's interest

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:37.130
in the complexity and
problematic nature

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.890
of our connection to what
we call entertainment.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.382
And one of the
things you can see

00:12:42.382 --> 00:12:43.840
when you shift to
Rear Window which

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.335
you can see how these
preoccupations have

00:12:46.335 --> 00:12:49.520
been distilled and clarified.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.390
Because the entire field
becomes a meditation

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.130
on the nature of our
voyeuristic impulses.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:13:01.180
The entire film becomes a
story about seeing and not

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.750
being seen, about following--
about shadowing people,

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:13.050
about hidden impulses
or potential doubles

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.890
of our own respectable nature.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.980
And the way in
which Rear Window is

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.950
self-reflexive or self-conscious
is much more systematic

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:26.880
and much more deeply
embedded in the experience

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.580
of watching the film
than was the case

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.790
with Shadow of a Doubt.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.170
The same theme, the
same self-consciousness,

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.300
the same awareness of
the problematic nature

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.460
of entertainment,
but now much more

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.270
systematically and
fully integrated

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.890
into the formal and
thematic nature of the text.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.350
So I love Shadow of a Doubt.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.690
In many ways it's one of
my favorite Hitchcocks.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.070
But it's early
Hitchcock, and you

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.650
can feel the much greater
rigor with Hitchcock

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.330
has begun to seize
on the implications

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.420
of his own problematic
relation to his material.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.900
And his audience's compromised,
complicit relationship

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.080
to the material that Hitchcock
mobilizes in his film.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.570
So Rear Window was more
systematic in some sense,

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:15.340
more coherently conscious of
this element of its meaning.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.140
It's almost as if
by the time we get

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:22.740
to the mature films of the
'50s and beyond-- the period

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:28.710
between, let's say, 1951 in the
early '60s, when Hitchcock did

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.800
all of his most powerful work--
it's almost as if we can say

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.990
that the films of this era have
a kind of double significance.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.720
That all of these
films-- all the films

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.400
after Shadow of a Doubt are
partly about filmmaking.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.520
They're partly
self-conscious attempts

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.920
to be meditations on
the nature of movies.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.560
And it's almost as if there's
a kind of separate story,

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.530
a separate plot.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.570
There's the traditional
kind of mystery story

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.470
that, is characteristic
of many films.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.870
But then there's this meta
story, this separate story.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.320
It's the story of the filming.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.940
The story of the
making of the film.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.700
The story or the
drama of watching--

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.704
the drama of the watching,
we might call it.

00:15:11.704 --> 00:15:13.120
The literary version
of this would

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.620
be the drama of the telling.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.120
Right?

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.820
There are literary--
if you think

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.152
of a novel like-- a novella
like Conrad's Heart of Darkness.

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:22.110
I think I've mentioned
this before in the class

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.580
because it's such
a clear example.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.200
But the story of Heart of
Darkness is really two stories.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.010
It's the story of the narrator's
trip up the Congo River

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.220
when he was a young man.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.550
But it's even more of the
story of his struggles

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.577
to tell the story
20 years later.

00:15:36.577 --> 00:15:38.660
And when you read Heart
of Darkness, naive readers

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.499
hate it, can't figure out
why it's taking so long.

00:15:41.499 --> 00:15:44.040
And why it's taking the narrator
so long to get to the point.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.570
But of course, the
story is not primarily

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.610
even about the adventure
he's trying to talk about.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.820
It's about the struggle
to tell the adventure.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.800
So that there's a kind of
double plot in that novella

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.880
as there is in a lot of
great modernist fiction.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.400
As there is in
another way in a lot

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.090
of great modernist paintings,
where you are aware

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.800
not only of the subject of the
painting, but of the materials

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.330
that go into the
making of the painting.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.210
I'm thinking of the
great impressionist and

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.950
post-impressionist
painters, right?

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.520
Or of the painters
who would paint--

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.097
like Monet who would paint
50 versions of a haystack

00:16:17.097 --> 00:16:17.930
in different lights.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.391
Or 32 versions of Rouen
Cathedral in different lights

00:16:21.391 --> 00:16:22.640
at different times of the day.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.680
Why?

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.070
Well, one of the
reasons is, he's

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.120
trying to say that
reality is not stable.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.250
That Rouen Cathedral
changes depending

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.230
upon the light, depending
upon the weather,

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.739
depending upon my emotion
when I look at it, right?

00:16:34.739 --> 00:16:36.780
In other words, reality
is much more complicated.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.720
And so that when we look at
the Rouen Cathedral paintings,

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.120
we're aware of paint.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.300
We're aware not just of
the fact that a cathedral

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.750
is being represented.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.720
We're aware of the
process whereby

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:57.730
Monet went through the terrific
labor of capturing the image.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.380
And you can see there's a lot
of examples even on painting

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.870
of the thickness of the paint.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.020
When you look at
Monet's paintings,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.930
very often the paint is so
thick that if you see in reality

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.069
you want to reach
out and touch it.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.819
So you're aware of the
materials that go in-- again,

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.349
another kind of
self-consciousness

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.599
or self-reflexiveness.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.829
Well, Hitchcock belongs in
that tradition, I think.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.650
And a great many of his mature
films have this double plot.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:22.150
Right?

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.920
The second plot is
what we might call

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.240
the drama of the watching,
the drama of watching.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.320
And Rear Window was a
particularly austere ingredient

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.920
instance of this topic.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.760
Well, let me start over
again with Shadow of a Doubt,

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.100
set the context.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.990
It's World War II was going on.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:40.940
I already mentioned that
Hitchcock had already

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.080
felt ambivalent
about leaving England

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.460
at the end of the 1930s.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:50.300
And now, by 1943, this anxiety--
because the war was on,

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.780
England was being attacked.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.620
Hitchcock felt
ambivalence about that.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.820
His mother was tremendously ill,
he kept receiving information.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.320
And she couldn't
get back to England

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.660
because the war was going on.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.710
You couldn't travel there.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.650
And it was said that
he was afflicted

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:10.790
by a kind of a really
deep guilt and unhappiness

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.840
during the filming
of Shadow of a Doubt.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.072
And during the filming of Shadow
of a Doubt, his mother died.

00:18:16.072 --> 00:18:17.530
Now there are some
film critics who

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.220
say, Oh well, the
port-- well there's

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.340
one critic who writes that
the portrait of the mother

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.170
in Shadow of a
Doubt is Hitchcock's

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.660
last benign portrait
of a mother.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.970
But if this is a
benign portrait,

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.640
I'm very nervous about
what is a mean portrait.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.560
And it's a very bad mistake.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.980
I mean, it can't
be that Hitchcock

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.229
was trying to memorialize his
mother in the primary character

00:18:41.229 --> 00:18:41.770
in this film.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:46.400
Because as you'll see,
she's a magnificent airhead.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.930
The only dumber woman
in film that I know

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.740
is Annabelle Lee
in The General, who

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.400
sweeps out the
engine while they're

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.590
trying to escape their enemies.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.740
And as you'll see,
she's a figure--

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.180
she's a benign
figure in the sense

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.340
that she has not a
mean bone in her body.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.590
But she's really a dullard.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:04.840
She's really silly.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.324
And she silly in ways
the film is aware of.

00:19:07.324 --> 00:19:08.490
But we'll come back to that.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.520
So there are elements in
the film of autobiography,

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.490
but there are skewed
by Hitchcock's

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.640
own sour, cynical,
disturbed nature.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.850
And this portrait of
a family is very far

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.930
from being a
celebratory portrait,

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.290
as will say in a moment.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.730
So Hitchcock's in exile.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.140
He's feeling a bit sour,
he's feeling alienated.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:34.520
So he makes a film in which--
really his first film, or one

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.090
of his first films-- in
which an American family is

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.300
at the very center
of the story, right?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.870
But he treats this family with
an odd kind of comic irony

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.230
or distance that careful
viewers immediately see

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.940
and lazy viewers might not see.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.800
But the careful
viewers definitely see.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.580
And one way to pick
up on how subversive

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.750
his portrait of
the family is, is

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:03.100
to compare him to his great
contemporary Frank Capra.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:08.390
We've seen a Capra film already,
of course, that standard

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.960
and establishing
screwball comedy.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.000
But the more characteristic
Capra films--

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.990
all of these kinds of
film were also coming out

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.040
at the same time-- are
even more fundamentally

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.090
celebrations of American life.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.681
And maybe the quintessential
instances of this as a film,

00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.430
that anyone who lives
in the United States

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.190
for a few months
around Christmas time

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.900
becomes sick of,
what's the film?

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.570
Starring Jimmy
Stewart, who was also

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:37.750
the star of one of tonight's
Hitchcock film, Rear Window.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.220
What's the film?

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.770
It's a Wonderful Life, yes.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.150
And in fact the title tells--

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.780
Capra-- although there is
a dark side to Capra, too.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.860
But Capra's the great American
sentimental and optimist.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.820
He celebrates small town
virtues, celebrates--

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.710
and the villains
in Capra's films

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.850
are Big Business
and people who are

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.820
hostile to the values
of small town America.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.850
Hitchcock-- and one way of
understanding what Hitchcock

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.380
is doing in Shadow--
so I feel like it's

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.920
A Wonderful Life-- also,
incidentally, these films

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.370
often star Jimmy
Stewart-- James Stewart.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.520
But when Hitchcock
uses James Stewart,

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:19.790
this upstanding, perfect example
of middle American decency

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.720
and American honesty is
turned into a much more

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.340
fearful, damaged, impotent
sometimes sexually

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:35.360
perverted or implicitly
sexually damaged adult.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.020
And it was Hitchcock's version
of Jimmy-- the Jimmy Stewart

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.880
that Hitchcock draws out is a
much more disturbed and damaged

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.560
character.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.690
And part of what makes Stewart's
performances in Hitchcock's

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.480
films so powerful--
there's some people

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.750
say Hitchcock and
Stewart's collaboration

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.470
was one of the
great collaborations

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.000
between a director and an
actor in the history of movies.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.610
And you could see one great
example of it in Rear Window.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.040
But the primary
thing to recognize

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.660
is that what Hitchcock is
doing something so subversive,

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.530
because Jimmy
Stewart was already

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.850
a kind of American icon.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.120
He stood when he-- except
in Hitchcock's films--

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.280
he stood for a form of
American decency and openness

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.890
and honesty and sincerity,
goodness and even heroism.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.300
Which Hitchcock undermines in
all kinds of-- I don't mean

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.740
that he makes Jimmy Stewart
an evil character, he doesn't!

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.564
And he him his outwardly
heroic lineaments.

00:22:31.564 --> 00:22:33.980
But then we discover that there
are things wrong with him,

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.930
as you'll see in Rear Window.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.160
And he does this
again in Vertigo,

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.120
an even more dramatic example
of Jimmy Stewart playing

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.600
an impaired or a
damaged character.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.850
In Rear Window,
Jimmy Stewart has

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.520
one leg that's broken, right?

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.910
In a cast for all the film.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.700
As you'll see.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.410
At the very end of the film--
one of the outcomes of the film

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.410
is what-- in the denouement--
we see Jimmy Stewart

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.000
after the action has occurred
and now he has two broken legs.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.130
So he's back where he
was in the beginning.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.290
He's even more
damaged, and impaired,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.287
and immobilized
than he was before!

00:23:10.287 --> 00:23:12.120
And we'll come back to
this, because there's

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.930
something very disturbing about
this ending in a certain way.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.890
Even though it purports to
be a kind of survival tale

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.710
and in that sense, a
kind of happy ending.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.330
But the important
point for the moment

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.350
is that Hitchcock was certainly
fully aware of the fact

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.050
that what he was
doing was juxtaposing

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:31.140
his much more sour,
unsentimental, even

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.910
cynical vision of American
life against Capra's more

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.350
sentimental one, right?

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.070
So it's as if he's
against Capra.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.990
Or he's against Capricorn.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.670
The corniness.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.650
Get the pun?

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.400
I'm stealing it,
I'm stealing it.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.420
But the corniness,
the sentimentality

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.510
of a characteristic Capra film.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.590
And the characteristic
attitude in the Capra film

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.620
towards small town
American life.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.640
And one of the ways
to recognize this

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.855
is to recognize a kind
of recurring trope of his

00:24:00.855 --> 00:24:01.980
that I've mentioned before.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.590
Let's show it, Kristen.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.457
So here is the opening
Shadow of a Doubt.

00:24:07.457 --> 00:24:09.290
I'm giving you a chance
to watch it and then

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.664
savor it the second
time when you

00:24:10.664 --> 00:24:14.840
see it again, in 20
minutes, half an hour or so.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.330
And it dramatizes a
scene, a version of which

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.330
occurs in many Hitchcock films.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:21.420
Watch what happens.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.930
In which the effect
of the opening

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.740
is in some sense to
implicate the viewer

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.080
right at the beginning
in an act of voyeurism.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:51.745
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:51.745 --> 00:24:52.370
PROFESSOR: See?

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:53.820
A benign scene.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.730
A benign cityscape.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:25:02.590
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.367
PROFESSOR: We go
up to the window.

00:25:04.367 --> 00:25:05.825
In Psycho, it's
even more dramatic.

00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:08.080
The film actually crawls
under a window shade

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.667
that's almost all the way down.

00:25:09.667 --> 00:25:11.000
But you see what the camera did?

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:18.904
[KNOCK ON THE DOOR]

00:25:18.904 --> 00:25:19.900
CHARLIE: Come in.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.580
PROFESSOR: OK, stop.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.600
When we first see Young
Charlie in the film many,

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.750
many scenes later,
what we've just

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.910
looked at will be
replicated, shot by shot.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.340
It's an example of what
I call rhyming scenes.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.170
And I'll come back
to that in a moment.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.440
So behind any door or
window is potential evil.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.500
And the way that we
go out in the street,

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.450
that then the camera
looks up at a window,

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.640
then it goes implicitly
through the window.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.656
And as I say, in
some Hitchcock films,

00:25:48.656 --> 00:25:50.030
the slithering
through the window

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.810
is actually even more explicit.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.930
And you actually feel that
the camera has slid in,

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:59.950
as if it's a kind of unwelcome
and unobserved witness

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.510
to the event.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:04.420
And the implication is that
you are watching something

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.430
that you shouldn't be
watching, or that you

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.080
have access to worlds that
normally you would never

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.310
have access to.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.220
So behind any door window
in Hitchcock's world

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:19.060
can be evil, danger, fright.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.010
An American town,
an American family.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.820
I've already mentioned that
one of the things that's

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.410
going on in this film is a
portrait of an American family

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:33.420
that has a kind of ironic
undercutting built into it.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.410
We can feel almost
from the very beginning

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:37.920
when we first go to Santa Rosa.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.890
Our first shots of
Santa Rosa-- which

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.190
will occur shortly after
the scene you've just seen.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.731
You'll see, there will be a more
elaborated scene in which we

00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:46.570
learn a little bit more
about Uncle Charlie,

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.550
and then we shift to Santa Rosa.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.750
And the very opening
scene in Santa Rosa

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.460
shows a sort of fat, jolly
policeman in bright sunlight

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.380
directing traffic.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.480
As if nothing could be
more wonderful than the job

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.490
of directing traffic in
a small American town

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:01.850
in sunny California.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.250
What could be more noble?

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.010
But there's something
excessive about it.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.270
I mean, you almost feel,
even before you fully

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.970
realize that what the
film is going to be doing,

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.150
you sort of feel that
this is too much.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.460
And this is characteristic
of Hitchcock as well.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.610
Almost as if there's
an excess of brightness

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.090
and an excessive jolliness.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.360
As if it's more than we
could possibly believe.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:28.320
And then, as the family's
nature begins to unfold to us,

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.470
what we begin to see is
these children are horrible,

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.590
insipid children.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:33.980
They're hardly admirable.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.480
The daughter's a
nasty little bitch

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.630
who is more interested
in reading her books

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:42.380
that in speaking
civilly to her parents.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.590
Not long Charlie, but
Charlie's younger sister.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.110
There are three
children the family.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.290
Charlie's the oldest, right?

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:53.327
And then, she has a sister
and a younger brother.

00:27:53.327 --> 00:27:54.910
And the younger
brother and the sister

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.889
are insipid, nasty
little children.

00:27:56.889 --> 00:27:58.430
The boy when we see
him is constantly

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.740
saying, what-- when he
first sees Uncle Charlie,

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.906
he says, "What have you got?

00:28:01.906 --> 00:28:03.590
What present have
you gotten for me?"

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.440
And if we don't think that the
children are very attractive,

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.940
wait till we look more closely
at the fact the parents.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.630
I've already
mentioned the father,

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.180
who spends most of
his most of his time

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:18.270
with Hume Cronyn trying to talk
about ridiculous diversions

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.520
in murder mysteries.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.955
Meanwhile, his family
is in danger around him

00:28:21.955 --> 00:28:24.790
and he doesn't have
any sense of it.

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.510
But the wife, as
I've mentioned also,

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.630
comes across as one of
the supreme airheads

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.030
in American movies.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.860
There's a certain moment
when Uncle Charlie is

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.060
under suspicion,
so some FBI agents

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.170
come to town in disguise.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.940
And they suspect him but
they don't have evidence yet.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.710
So they claim they're
from a magazine,

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:45.940
and they come into the
family and they say,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.439
"What we want to
do is we want to do

00:28:47.439 --> 00:28:50.380
a story about a typical
American family."

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.520
And the mother of the
family is very proud.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.150
"Oh, isn't it nice to be a
typical representative American

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:55.649
family?"

00:28:55.649 --> 00:28:57.460
Well, who would want
to be the mean, right?

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.310
We're the mean, we're
the norm, right?

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.880
We are the typical--
but she loves this idea.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.110
And then, not only
does she love the idea,

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.100
she's really rather
a silly person.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.600
So at one point
when they're getting

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.420
ready to sort of-- I don't
know whether they're getting

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.310
ready to do still
photography in the house--

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.090
she insists on
completing her cooking

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.820
because she wants to finish
the pie before the photographer

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.420
gets there.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.940
As if completing her
cooking has something

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.770
to do with what the
photographer would find.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.650
And you find repeatedly that
she's kind of a little askew.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.950
She certainly has no
possible intimation

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.350
that her brother is a
murderer and in fact

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:39.070
a cynical nihilist that has no
respect for anything in life.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.900
And she never learns
any better, and that's

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.132
part of what makes the
film so disturbing.

00:29:43.132 --> 00:29:45.340
So what happens in the course
of the film essentially

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.920
is that this American
family is systematically

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.180
shown to be sort of
silly and foolish,

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.180
banal in its ordinariness.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.300
Hardly something that
we might fully-- I

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.550
don't mean to say that we come
away in horror thinking, Oh!

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.180
How disgusting this family is!

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:07.190
Just that we think how ordinary,
banal, silly, foolish it is.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.350
One of the ways
I've talked already

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.830
about the way in which Hitchcock
is obsessed by doublings.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.110
And by the idea
of a self divided.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.140
And one of his richest
treatments of that theme

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.490
is in the treatment of Uncle
Charlie and Young Charlie.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.320
And you'll see how explicit
the film is about that.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.180
One of the ways it's
explicit about it

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:32.180
is that Hitchcock uses
particular visual strategies

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.710
to reinforce the connection.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.020
And I've already mentioned the
rhyming scene in that opening

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:37.520
scene.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.103
Watch it, because
it's quite exciting.

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:42.060
Later, in our first
introduction to Young Charlie,

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.640
the camera behaves
identically to the way

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.890
it behaved when we
saw Uncle Charlie.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.880
And so even before Uncle
Charlie has entered the story,

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.720
even before we're
fully aware of what

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.180
the relationship between Uncle
Charlie and Young Charlie is,

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.680
the camera has told us
that they are linked.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.950
And we can say then
that in the doubling

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.310
Young Charlie represents
a kind of innocence

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.610
and part of her night--
one way to understand

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:08.310
the film is to see it
as a Bildungsroman,

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.260
as a growing up, as an
initiation story in which Young

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.280
Charlie learns
something about the evil

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.640
and difficulty of the world.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.700
She has a naive and
simplified view of the world,

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.340
and before she's
done, she comes face

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.680
to face, not just with murder,
but with the possibility

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.180
of murder.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.770
And in fact, Uncle Charlie
actually tries to murder her,

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:31.870
because he realizes she
knows the truth about him.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:33.740
So she's in danger
for part of the film,

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.029
and knows she's in danger.

00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:37.570
And part of the issue is that
she can't really talk about it.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:38.070
Why not?

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.495
Well, it's her uncle!

00:31:39.495 --> 00:31:41.120
Have you ever heard
this kind of thing?

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.830
There are actually critics who
say that although that it's

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.230
never made explicit in the
film, that one of the ways

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.857
to understand the film, and
at least in the subtextual way

00:31:48.857 --> 00:31:51.440
is to think about the relation
between Uncle Charlie and Young

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.830
Charlie as that between the
sort of perverted uncle man who

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.885
manhandles his young niece
when his family isn't watching,

00:31:58.885 --> 00:32:00.160
right?

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.000
And there actually
is in the film what

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
is a scene sometimes called a
betrothal scene in which we see

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.670
Young Charlie come
down a staircase,

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:11.670
like a traditional
bride down a staircase,

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.130
and Uncle Charlie
gives her a ring.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:17.430
So that's the film does insinu--
and that's really perverted.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.690
The film doesn't actually say
anything sexual is going on

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.000
between uncle and niece.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.160
That's not-- but there
are these suggestions

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.560
of illicit or
disturbing connections

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:32.290
that are part of the subtext
with which we experience

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:35.230
the film and with
which we recognize

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:40.480
the tangled, disturbing quality
of the connection between Young

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.420
Charlie and her uncle.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.510
So the naivete on
Young Charlie's part

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.540
is her failure to
understand or to even to

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.600
be able to imagine the
extent of evil and duplicity

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.440
in the world.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.740
And we could say
that what happens

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.020
as she comes to recognize
what Uncle Charlie really is,

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.810
and what Uncle Charlie
really stands for,

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.230
she is educated into
the ways of the world.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:07.890
But it is in many ways a very
terrible and very serious

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.420
initiation.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:15.400
And one of the climactic
instances of this

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.790
occurs toward the
end of the film

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.410
when Young Charlie and
her uncle meet together

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:24.290
in a bar called the-- think it's
called the Till Two because it

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.260
closes at 2:00,
which is very late.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.610
In the universe of
the film, 2:00 AM

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.490
is very late in Santa
Rosa, California.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:35.250
They meet in this
place, and this

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.120
is where Uncle
Charlie realizes he

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.940
can no longer hide the truth.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.840
And he talks openly
to Young Charlie,

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.434
and he says at one point this.

00:33:46.434 --> 00:33:47.600
"We're old friends, Charlie.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.020
More than that,
we're like twins.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.090
You said so yourself.

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:51.881
You think you're the
clever little girl who

00:33:51.881 --> 00:33:52.920
knows something.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.340
There's so much you
don't know, so much.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.150
You're just an ordinary
little girl living

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.412
in an ordinary little town--"

00:33:58.412 --> 00:34:00.120
You hear the contempt
for ordinary there?

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.420
Hitchcock shares some of
this, even though his villain

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.650
is saying it, right?

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:06.770
"You go through your
ordinary little day at night

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.690
and you sleep your untroubled,
ordinary little sleep, filled

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.179
with peaceful, stupid dreams.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:13.820
You live in a dream--"

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:14.995
This is a direct quotation.

00:34:14.995 --> 00:34:15.870
"You live in a dream.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:16.790
You're a sleepwalker.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:17.810
Blind.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.070
How do you know what
the world is like?

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:23.500
Do you know the
world is a foul sty?

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.860
Do know that if you rip
the fronts off houses

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.409
you'd find swine?

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.100
The world's a hell.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.120
What does it matter
what happens in it?"

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.050
Now what an extreme
nihilistic statement.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:38.810
That's what Uncle
Charlie stands for.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.699
That's the full
ugliness and disturbance

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.540
that Young Charlie--
and, of course,

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.210
a murder is speaking to her.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.270
This is also implicitly
a confession to her.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.480
"Yes, I have killed people."

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.060
So it's a tremendously
disturbing moment in the film,

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.270
and it represents
in a certain way

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:57.970
Young Charlie's coming of age.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:03.050
But the irony, or one
tremendous irony of this tale,

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.510
of this story, is that when
we get to the end of the film,

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.970
there is a profound
kind of ambiguity.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:11.150
Yes, the evil has been purged.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.340
I won't go into the
details of the plot

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.750
so as not to spoil your
experience of the film,

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:19.370
but Uncle Charlie is eliminated
from the scene in a--

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:20.890
and Young Charlie survives.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.870
It's a kind of reassuring
or happy ending.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.300
But what undercuts it?

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.640
As all, remember all,
of Hitchcock's endings

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.980
are undercut, they're
never really happy.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.454
They're never really reassuring.

00:35:30.454 --> 00:35:31.620
They go through the motions.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.050
They're conventionally
reassuring, but they're not.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.880
The moral ambiguity on
which this film ends

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.960
is maybe it's most
disturbing aspect.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.630
Because what it says--
because Young Charlie never

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.730
tells her mother,
never tells her father,

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.800
never reveals to the
community that Uncle Charlie

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.940
was this evil figure, was
the Merry Widow murder.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.720
Why not?

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.110
Well, maybe she
sparing her mother.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.530
Uncle Charlie's no longer
there, what's the difference?

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.030
There's no discussion of this.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.090
But what does it mean?

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.630
It means that when
the film is over,

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.170
the idea that evil
might lurk at the heart

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.700
of the American family
remains a reality

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.130
that no one has acknowledged.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.300
In other words, it's as if
the implications of the story

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.220
are denied bye
Charlie's silence.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.090
And we're left in the
situation at the end

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.770
of the film in which
the implications

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.840
or meaning of Uncle Charlie's
life has been suppressed.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.630
And therefore, the significance
of his pervasive nihilism

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.850
and of what it means that
such nihilism could exist

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:32.600
at the heart of a
typical American family

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.640
is never acknowledged or known
by anyone inside the film.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.820
Even though it's a
disturbing knowledge

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.710
that we take away from the film.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.080
So to conclude on this
film, one of the things

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.830
to think about as
you're watching the film

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:47.290
is how remarkably Hitchcock
is able to give us

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.080
what might be thought
in many ways to be,

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.720
and what is in many ways,
a light entertainment.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.410
A humorous and very well
put together mystery story

00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:02.720
about an American family full
of the wit and scene by scene

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.990
richness and complexity.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:10.210
A film that even naive
film goers can enjoy fully.

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.060
And yet the full
implications of it,

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.670
the moral ambiguity with
which the film ends,

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.940
and the moral ambiguity
that's a really implicit all

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.530
the way through the film,
the sense of the ominous

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:26.700
and the sense of disturbance
remains with the viewer

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.830
after the film is over.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:33.920
It's a characteristic way
for Hitchcock to end films.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.440
Rear Window, as
I've suggested, is

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.610
an even more
rigorous exploration

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:42.030
of some of Hitchcock's deepest
preoccupations and obsessions.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.930
Let me remind you
to really savor

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:47.540
the opening scene of the film.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.600
It starts under the titles,
and you get the title sequence,

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.950
and onto the title-- it's
a sequence that lasts

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.830
three or almost four minutes.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.510
And it's completely wordless.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:00.460
There is no dialogue.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.970
Watch how much what happens.

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:08.070
It's a complicated
moment in a certain way.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.360
But if you are attentive to it,
you can see what's happening.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.310
Essentially, what we see
the camera do-- first,

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:22.974
we see the blinds go
up on two open windows.

00:38:22.974 --> 00:38:24.890
And then we realize that
they're open windows,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.740
they're encasement windows
that are open unscreened.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.720
And after the blinds--
the camera is stable,

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.800
it doesn't move-- three
separate blinds go up one time.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.860
They reveal the other
side of an apartment

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.780
complex being seen through the
window of another apartment.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.200
And then, what we see-- the
camera then goes on and sort

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.180
of elaborate journey.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:53.690
You're caught in the
camera's gaze, as a viewer.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:57.775
Once the shades go up, then
the camera begins to move.

00:38:57.775 --> 00:39:01.190
It moves toward the window,
then it moves out the window,

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.960
and then it looks
down and it does

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.770
a kind of circuit of
the-- essentially,

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.520
it shows you what can be
seen from this window.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:14.990
It does a kind of circuit
of the physical spaces that

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:18.270
are open it if it looked at
this world from this window.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:22.260
And you see it might
make a kind of circle,

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.590
it's not a 360 degree turn
but it's more than 180.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:28.790
The camera turns like this,
it pans, it turns around,

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:31.870
and then it comes
back into the room.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.454
And when it comes back into the
room-- it goes out of the room

00:39:34.454 --> 00:39:36.870
and it looks around, and then
it comes back into the room,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.700
through the same windows,
backs up further,

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.200
and then you see
Jimmy Stewart lying

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.820
there, sweating in the heat.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.695
The camera then looks up
a wall at a thermometer,

00:39:45.695 --> 00:39:47.320
and you see the
thermometer is hovering

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.270
in the mid 90s someplace,
explaining why Jimmy Stewart is

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:51.200
sweating so much.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.500
But then, the camera
moves outside again

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.060
and does another circle of the
space that you just looked at.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.010
It's almost as if it wants
you to look at a second time,

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.140
to remind you of the space
of the action in the film.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.620
And of course, we don't
fully realize it at the time,

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.680
but this is a rehearsal
for the whole movie,

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.860
because we are going to
be confined in exactly

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.791
this way for the entire film.

00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:14.540
We're never going to
get out of this room.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.640
Everything we see will be
seen through this window.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.930
Then the camera come
pulls back in again,

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:21.520
we see Jimmy Stewart
again-- so it's

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.710
almost as if that
opening sequence does

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.760
the same thing twice.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.870
What it mostly does, of
course, is trap the viewer

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:30.630
in an act of voyeurism.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.600
It traps the viewer completely
in an act of spying.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.850
And then, almost the very first
words of the film, the camera

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.650
pulls back, it
looks at a few items

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.580
to tell us a little
more about the fact

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.800
that Jimmy Stewart
is a photographer who

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.290
works for a magazine,
who was injured taking

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:47.989
one of his action photos.

00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:49.780
He can't wait to till
he's out of his cast,

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.890
but he has another week to
go and he's going stir crazy.

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:56.320
And then he has a
conversation on the telephone

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.560
with his editor.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.560
And at the same time engages
in various acts of voyeurism,

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.390
including especially
a young woman

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:09.200
who is scantily clad across
the courtyard in her room

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:14.730
wearing shorts and a
very revealing brassiere

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:17.090
doing sort of exercises
and so forth while she's

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:18.430
eating her breakfast.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.140
And you see the Jimmy Stewart
character voyeuristically

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.320
savoring her as he's
talking to his friend.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.390
And then he hangs up the phone,
a knock comes on the door,

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.170
a woman enters.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:32.640
It's his cleaning lady
played by the great actress--

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.110
what's her name?--
Thelma Ritter.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:39.670
And Thelma's almost
first words are,

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.922
"We've become a nation
of peeping Toms."

00:41:42.922 --> 00:41:44.380
And I mention this
just to show you

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.720
how aware the film is,
how much the film wants

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.900
us to be aware of the
fact, that voyeurism is one

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.480
of its deep subjects, right?

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:56.130
Why do we have this desire
to watch the illicit?

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:57.880
What is it about us
that wants to make

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.110
us sort of look through key
holes and peep at people

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.000
and watch the intimate
lives of people?

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.760
So they saw the opening
scene is a scene that

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.010
dramatizes the confinement
and the voyeurism that

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.340
are at the very heart of
what the movie is about.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.230
We can say that the whole essay,
the whole film in some sense,

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:17.270
is a kind of essay on seeing.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:19.270
And in that three or
four minute sequence

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.000
in the beginning
without dialogue,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.980
the camera is the star,
in a certain sense.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.400
We become aware of the
camera, as Hitchcock

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.250
wants us to be, in
a way we would never

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.090
be in another kind of film.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.210
There are other forms
of elegance in the film.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.510
And I hope you'll watch
the way the camera behaves,

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.984
because it's a marvel of
complexity and intelligence.

00:42:39.984 --> 00:42:41.650
But there's another
way in which there's

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:43.200
an elegance of
structure in the film.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.730
As the camera in
the very beginning

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.900
makes its tour of
the building, what

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.900
begins to emerge in a very
elementary way at first,

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.130
and then as the film precedes
becomes more fleshed out,

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:56.920
is that there are three or
four basic stories about people

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:00.280
who live in the apartments that
Jimmy Stewart is looking into.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.500
And each of them tells a
separate kind of story.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.020
There's a Miss
Lonely Heart story

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.310
about a woman who was
pining for a boyfriend

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.660
and who feels very
lonely and maybe toying

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.530
with the idea of suicide.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:14.200
Then there's a story
about a composer who's

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.470
having trouble with his work.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:18.590
They're a series of sort of
subplots, mostly trivial ones.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:21.366
Except for the primary one--
what's the primary one?

00:43:21.366 --> 00:43:23.740
A murder may have been committed
in one of the apartments

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.440
to Jimmy Stewart has
been prying into.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.290
And he begins to
investigate the murder

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:30.374
and that puts him
in danger himself.

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:32.790
And the people involved with
him, including his girlfriend

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.970
Grace Kelly, get
involved in the danger

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.022
as well because he's a immobile.

00:43:37.022 --> 00:43:39.230
And Grace has to be the one
who walks across the way,

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:40.930
and does--

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:44.880
So the elegance of the
structure of the film

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.490
has partly to do with the way
in which these subplots work

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:48.440
themselves out.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.220
And at the end of the film,
each of these little subplots

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.960
that we'd seen being played out
in these different apartments--

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.590
only watching them through the
windows of the apartments--

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.420
each of them is
resolved in some way.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.610
And I want to suggest that
their resolution, while from one

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:06.020
angle is very satisfying--
there's a kind of elegance

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:06.640
of structure.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.130
We're very satisfied by
this sense of completion.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.710
But at the same time,
I think the very fact

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.150
that these stories
are all tied up

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:16.160
in such neat knots makes us
feel that there's something

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.342
a little too neat, a little
too perfect about it.

00:44:19.342 --> 00:44:20.800
In other words,
the very perfection

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.080
with which these subplots
are tied up at the end

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.740
suggests a kind of
excess that Hitchcock

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.200
wants us to be suspicious of.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.470
As if of this is
just too perfect.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.140
And of course,
there are other ways

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.790
in which the ending of this
film is deeply ambiguous.

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:37.060
And I'll come back
to that in a moment.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.300
I also ought to
mention the way it

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.970
which, in a quiet,
subtle way, this film is

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.320
an exploration of both
class and gender issues.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.010
Because there's a kind of
little sort of contest going on.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.360
Grace Kelly, who's this
elegant upper class

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:55.730
woman who gets her clothes at
the fanciest fashion stores

00:44:55.730 --> 00:45:01.520
and has food catered from
the fanciest restaurants

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.360
in the city and who reads
magazines like Vogue

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.630
and so forth-- she stands
for sort of moneyed elegance.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:11.210
And there's a kind of
tension between them.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:15.070
She wants to marry Jimmy Stewart
and Jimmy Stewart's resisting.

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.730
One reason is that he doesn't
belonged to her class.

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.450
He's more of a working
class type, right?

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.054
He's a down to
earth sort of guy,

00:45:22.054 --> 00:45:23.220
and he's worried about that.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.860
And he's also nervous because
like many American males,

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.220
especially in the movies, he's
nervous about being entrapped

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.540
by marriage, as if he
isn't already entrapped

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.060
in all kinds of ways.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.910
And in an odd kind
of way, we could

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:38.920
say that the Thorwald
marriage-- that's

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.295
the name of the
murderer and the wife

00:45:41.295 --> 00:45:43.630
he supposedly murders and
chops up, at least that's

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:45.930
what Jimmy Stewart
comes to suspect.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:47.610
We could say that
the Thorwald marriage

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.080
is a kind of double
of the marriage

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.320
that the Jimmy Stewart
character fears he will have.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.900
That his resistance
to Grace Kelly

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.730
is partly a class resistance.

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:04.140
He feels uneasy around
this aristocratic woman

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.720
because her tastes seemed
to him banal and trivial.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.530
In any case, they seem to him to
involve values and commitments

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:14.070
that are at odds
with a sort of rough

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:16.590
and tumble life of a
traveling photographer who

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:20.160
goes to war zones and
other dangerous places.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.440
But that's his image of himself.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:28.720
So his resistance to
her is partly a desire

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.090
to maintain his freedom, right?

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:32.960
And it's partly a class issue.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.800
So that both issues of class
and gender are involved.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:44.050
The gender issue has to do with
how men and women, especially

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:47.100
in the stereotyped way
of the '50s and '60s,

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.800
regarded the
question of marriage.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:55.070
And there are other
marriages or relationships

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.690
that are alluded to
in the film, and we

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.200
can say that those marriages
and relationships also

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.110
double the relationship
between Stewart and Kelly.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:05.810
So there's a kind of low
level, not exactly hostility,

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:11.410
but a low level badinage and
argument going on between Kelly

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:14.110
and Stuart all the
way through the film.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:17.210
Which is in some sense resolved,
but not fully resolved.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.950
Or resolved in a typically
unsatisfying Hitchcockian way

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:22.330
at the end of the film.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:26.480
So the very ending of the film.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.800
There is the tradition-- the
murderer is caught, is exposed.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.390
The danger to which the Jimmy
Stewart character was exposed

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:34.714
is purged by the end.

00:47:34.714 --> 00:47:37.130
Again I won't go into details
if you've not seen the film,

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.588
but I need to say this much in
order to explain the ending.

00:47:39.588 --> 00:47:41.320
And at the end of
the film, as I said,

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:46.682
there's a moment where we see
him-- the murder finds out

00:47:46.682 --> 00:47:47.640
that he's watching him.

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.017
And after a while, he comes
to Jimmy Stewart's apartment

00:47:51.017 --> 00:47:52.350
apparently to try to murder him.

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.120
Because he thinks
he's going to reveal

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.430
that he's a murderer himself.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:56.840
And it's a terrifying scene.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.610
The great climax of
the scene-- Stewart--

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:04.460
his physical
limitations some critics

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:07.900
have seen as a symbolic
embodiment of what might

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.400
be seen as a form of impotence.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.450
Both a sexual impotence and sort
of broader kind of impotence,

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.700
an incompetence because he's
crippled, he can't fight,

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.820
he can't defend himself.

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.835
He can't behave like
a traditional man

00:48:19.835 --> 00:48:21.610
in a traditional movie.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.110
And again, remember, this is
characteristic of Hitchcock.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:25.730
His men are almost
always like this.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:30.460
It's amazing, in fact, how weak,
vulnerable, damaged, fearful,

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.900
frightened his protagonists are.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.930
So there's this climactic
moment at the end where

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:39.030
Thorwald, the murderer, is
trying to kill Jimmy Stewart,

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.780
and he pushes him.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.990
And Jimmy Stewart is holding on.

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:42.100
He's on the second story window.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.510
He's holding on like
this, looking up.

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:45.020
The camera's
looking down at him.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.660
You see the fear and
horror in his face.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.980
He lets go.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.760
There's a critic,
a brilliant critic,

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.170
a French critic, who talks
about the idea of letting go,

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:59.462
of losing your grip as central
action in Hitchcock's films.

00:48:59.462 --> 00:49:00.420
You lose your gripping.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.190
You fall into a void.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:04.490
And that moment that is,
as I said this afternoon,

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:07.830
could be said to be an iconic
moment in Hitchcock's movie.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.500
So when Jimmy Stewart
actually lets go and falls.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.249
You see his face as if
he's falling to his--

00:49:13.249 --> 00:49:15.040
you think he might be
falling to his death.

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.120
But of course, he's not.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.710
He just breaks his other leg.

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:20.240
And at the end of the film
then we have a final scene.

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.140
And this is where the
ambiguity comes in.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.550
We see him with both legs, now.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:24.820
He's back where he was.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:29.230
But the Grace Kelly character
is sitting happily in the room.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:34.080
She pretends that she's
reading material that

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.470
would please Jimmy Stewart.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:36.940
But in fact, if
you look closely,

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.910
she has a copy of Vogue
hidden inside the material

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:42.280
that she's reading.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.900
And there's a very deep
sense that in this gender

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:49.570
conflict between Grace Kelly--
and also we discover at the end

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:50.960
but they're now engaged.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.660
So Jimmy Stewart has become
engaged to this woman, right?

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:57.305
So it's almost as if he's
sort of lost the battle.

00:49:57.305 --> 00:49:58.680
Or at least he's
agreed to marry.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.290
But what we feel that the end
is that his agreement to marry

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:05.420
her is still full of
the same ambiguities

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:06.890
that were present before.

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:09.720
And many people watching
the film have said,

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.380
you know the Grace
Kelly character is

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:14.190
very beautiful and very elegant,
but she's not a very attractive

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.590
person morally.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.830
She tries to manipulate the
Jimmy Stewart character.

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:21.810
She doesn't seem fully
to appreciate him.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.950
She doesn't see
why he wants to run

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:26.120
around the world in
corduroys and sneakers

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:29.040
instead of living the high
life in New York and go

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.240
and going to Le
Cirque for dinner.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.560
She can't really
understand that.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.637
So the conflict between them is
a kind of lifestyle conflict.

00:50:36.637 --> 00:50:38.470
At the end of the film,
none of those things

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:39.780
have been resolved.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:42.420
And there's the sense that
he's more entrapped than ever

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.130
at the end of the movie.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:46.100
Now, I don't want to
make too much of this.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.300
This is a light
entertainment at one level.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.300
But these subjects that
I've been talking about,

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.180
the sense of loosing your
grip, of being caught

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:56.870
in a confined space and being
terrified by forces far larger

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:00.620
than you, that you're too
weak or damage to resist.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.620
Those moments of
horror and terror

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:06.130
are dramatized with
profound authority

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:07.630
in this remarkable film.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:10.380
So what Hitchcock repeatedly
does, and especially

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.906
in these two films,
and if you can see them

00:51:12.906 --> 00:51:14.280
in a conversation
with each other

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.750
you'll understand more
fully, the fascination

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:19.480
of Hitchcock's career and
the fascination of his work.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.142
Because he keeps returning with
these remarkable variations

00:51:23.142 --> 00:51:30.530
again and again to the same set
of problems and of subjects.

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:32.720
So there's even more
ambiguity and uncertainty

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.200
at the end of Rear Window
than there was when it began.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.230
And one final point
and then I'll stop.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:40.850
One of the things that we
notice in the course of the film

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:47.480
is there's one moment in the
movie where the Jimmy Stewart

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.360
character responds to Grace
Kelly with a kind of excitement

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:50.860
and allure.

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.920
It's almost the moment
where you see suddenly

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:57.330
really desires her, really
sees her as a possible partner.

00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:59.210
And it's the moment
in which she has

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:01.330
entered the voyeuristic drama.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.080
It's the moment in
which he's watching her

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.130
through his lens when
she's gone across

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:09.260
to try to do some detective work
in the murderer's apartment.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:11.190
And there's a kind of
excitement and adventure

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:12.650
that goes on there.

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:15.040
And it's actually the
moment when they bond.

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.620
When they realize-- and there
is some sense that they're both

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:21.120
engaged in a morally exciting,
in a mutually exciting

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.270
adventure.

00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:24.980
But there's also the sense,
very disturbing in a way when

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.000
you reflect on it later, that
the moment in which Grace

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.070
Kelly became truly attractive
to the Jimmy Stewart character

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:34.290
was the moment in which he had
entered the voyeuristic drama.

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:36.640
In which Kelly was
now distant from,

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.620
which he was attracted to
her because he was seeing her

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.720
as if he were a peeping Tom.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.460
So now this is a subtext.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.110
I don't mean that I don't
mean that the film is

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:50.600
using a megaphone to remind
us of these implications.

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.420
But the number of them build
for the course of the film.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:57.310
And as with Shadow of a Doubt,
what seems on the surface

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:00.410
to be a kind of light
diversion, once we

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.630
begin to press its
details becomes

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:05.830
a much more disturbing
and powerful meditation

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:08.960
on our human impulse
to watch what we're not

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.160
supposed to watch,
to participate

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.280
in illicit activities without
being punished for it,

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.460
especially if we,
like Jimmy Stewart,

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:18.580
are able to do so in the dark.

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:23.110
And in that sense, when we
step away from Rear Window,

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:25.020
one of the things
we might recognize

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:28.540
is that we in the audience
have been engaging

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.140
in the same activity
that Jimmy Stewart is

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.490
engaging in the movie.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:37.800
That we are complicit as
viewers in the immorality

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.760
and in the murderous
tendencies of these forms

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.070
of entertainment.

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:47.500
So it's not possible if you're
an alert and self-conscious

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:53.060
film goer to watch these
apparent light entertainments

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.110
without recognizing their
deeper and more disturbing

00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:56.710
implications.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:58.260
