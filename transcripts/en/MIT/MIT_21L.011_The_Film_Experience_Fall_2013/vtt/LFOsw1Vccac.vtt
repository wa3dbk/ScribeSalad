00:00:25.572 --> 00:00:27.280
DAVID THORBURN: I want
to begin by asking

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.549
what seems an obvious
question, what is film?

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.390
I used to sometimes present it
by saying, film as, dot, dot,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.980
dot.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.810
Film as what?

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.370
And it may be surprising
to you, but one way

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.150
we could think about
film is as chemistry.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.580
Now how could that make sense?

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.224
Why would it make sense to think
of film as a form of chemistry?

00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:50.890
What this film got
to do with chemistry?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.598
In fact it's a very
fundamental relation.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.970
This is also true of still
photography, as well as movies.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.019
But what's the process
by which they're made?

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:04.525
Yes.

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:06.400
AUDIENCE: Film really
comes together from a--

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.286
DAVID THORBURN: Speak
loudly so everybody can.

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:10.770
AUDIENCE: Film is made up of
a lot of different components.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.195
You have your lighting,
your scene, your character.

00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:16.105
And that all has to come
together to make film.

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:18.287
Without even on
component of it, you're

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:19.554
losing part of the experience.

00:01:19.554 --> 00:01:21.220
DAVID THORBURN: You're
right about that.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.750
But that's a more general
answer than I wanted.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.200
There's something
much more dramatically

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.660
fundamental about the
way, about the connection

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.290
between chemistry and movies.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.144
What is it?

00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:33.870
AUDIENCE: The interaction
between the audience and.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.750
DAVID THORBURN: It
doesn't have to do

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.040
with the experience of movies.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.940
Come on.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.820
It's technical.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.845
AUDIENCE: Chemistry
had to be developed

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:39.870
before you could have it.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.340
DAVID THORBURN: It
depends on chemistry.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.010
Film is a form of
applied chemistry.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.830
Why?

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.010
Of course you're right.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.167
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:48.000
DAVID THORBURN: Yes.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.860
What is a film?

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.160
There are certain emulsions that
are put on piece of celluloid.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.250
Light actually has to
normally-- it can be any light,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.780
but sunlight is best--
act, interacting

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.010
with those emulsions,
causes the image to appear.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.790
The actual, fundamental
process by which film

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.160
is physically created
is a chemical process.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.460
And if you reflect
on for a moment,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.670
one of the things
this suggests is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.940
that then when we think about
film in a much larger sense,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.170
in the film as we experience
in theaters, film,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.690
as an engine of
economic development,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.980
as a provider of jobs,
and careers, and so forth.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.180
What we could say is that it
is a form of applied chemistry

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.320
that is among the most
profound uses of chemistry

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.680
that humankind has ever found.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.400
Because if you think about the
impact of movies on human life,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.850
it is now a global phenomenon.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.740
Is there any culture
that is free of movies?

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.410
Maybe there are
Taliban cultures that

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.230
dream of being free of movies.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.760
But to my knowledge there's
no culture in the world now

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.940
that's completely
oblivious to film.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.580
It's become a global phenomenon.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.590
And it's more than
a century old.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.880
It is the distinctive,
narrative form

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.040
of the 20th century, the
signature form of storytelling

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.230
for the 20th century.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.690
All of it derives from this
chemical reaction, when

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.780
the emulsions are
subjected to light,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.440
the image appears
on the celluloid.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.340
There are even theoreticians
of movies who have suggested

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.730
that there's a fundamental break
of a kind that is subliminal,

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.500
unless obvious to many people.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.900
But it's fundamental to
our experience of text

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.200
when we moved from real film
to digital forms of filmmaking.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.670
Because nature is
eliminated in digital form.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.930
There's something
natural, and in fact slow,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.150
about the way when
light works on those

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.644
emulsions to bring
the images up.

00:03:46.644 --> 00:03:48.560
And those of you who are
amateur photographers

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.050
will know that you can control
the clarity or the blurriness

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.870
of the image, the darkest of the
lightness of the image, by how

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.540
long you leave the film
paper in the emulsions.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.480
You can control it,
and still photographers

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.370
and creative movie
directors actually

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.840
use those use that
chemical principle in order

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.632
to create certain
kinds of effects.

00:04:12.632 --> 00:04:14.090
So one way to think
about movies is

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.450
to think of it as a form
of applied chemistry.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.540
And one of the most
profound uses of chemistry

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.630
that we could imagine
in terms of its impact

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.520
on society, in terms of
the vast number of people

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.610
who have been affected,
and continue to be

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.800
affected by this invention.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.350
So film is a form of chemistry.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.450
What I'm suggesting, these
different framings of what film

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.050
is, these different frameworks
for understanding film.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.750
One thing I'm trying
to do is to suggest

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.550
some of the ways in which
we might understand film

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.090
apart from what we're going
to be doing in this course.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.950
Now I don't know if
one could justify

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.620
persuading a
professor of chemistry

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.930
to teach a course in film.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.180
That might be going too far.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.050
But certain broad
principles of photography,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.900
and how they are linked to
other photochemical processes,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.060
might very well make a quite
exciting and complicated course

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.820
in the chemistry department.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.020
One can also think of film
simply in a historical sense,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.960
certainly, as a kind of novelty.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.990
When film first
appeared in the world,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.960
and especially in
the United States,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.240
it was seen as a novelty that
caused its first appearance

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.270
to take place in places
like penny arcades.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.870
Where people went to experience
other kinds of public novelties

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.860
as well.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.170
there would be machines
in these penny arcades

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.590
that would guess you're weight.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.341
And you put a penny
in, if the machine

00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:53.840
was right it kept your penny,
if the machine was wrong would

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.610
give your penny back.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.160
There were fortune
telling machines

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.950
in these penny arcades.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.210
In some of the more sleazy ones
there were live peep shows.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.080
Strip shows of various
moderate kinds.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.330
And of course, even at
the very early stages,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.350
film begin to replicate
those live performances.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.190
There were very trivial
forms of burlesque

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.920
began to-- women
stripping-- I don't think

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.800
there were any male strippers in
this late Victorian era-- began

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.580
to appear in the
penny arcades as well.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.770
So one could say that film
in its earliest stages

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.640
was also just a kind of novelty
item, like a PEZ dispenser

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.880
or some equivalent
kind of silly thing,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.590
or baseball cards, or football
cards, that kind of thing.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.520
More profoundly of course,
we could think of film

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.570
from another [INAUDIBLE],
a manufactured object.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.270
And this identity of film
is incredibly important.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.340
It's again, easy
for us to forget,

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.700
because when we go
to the movies today,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.190
we see these complex
and overwhelming--

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.620
we have these complex and
overwhelming audiovisual

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.840
experiences.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.850
And we might tend to
forget what in fact is

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.430
the sort of industrial base
on which movies were made

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.160
at a relatively early stage.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.180
Part of what we want at least
to be aware of in our course,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.270
even though we won't
study it systematically,

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.390
is the fact that the
movies, the film,

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.880
is one of the first
significant commodities

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.080
to become a mass-produced item.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.550
And in fact, the
same principles that

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.110
led to another
manufacturing miracle

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.290
that we associate with the late
19th and early 20th century--

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.660
the automobile-- the
same principles that

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.580
went to the production
of the automobile

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.610
also worked in the
production of film.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.340
And in fact, both film
and the automobile

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.660
could be seen as prototypical
instances of this fundamentally

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:54.010
defining industrial capitalist
behavior, capitalist activity,

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.330
which is mass production.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.220
And especially, what does
mass production depend upon?

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.430
The specialization of labor.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.600
The rationalizing
of the production

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.100
process into smaller,
and smaller units.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.730
So that particular
people can do it quickly,

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.920
and you can create essentially
an assembly line production.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.500
You can create mass production.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.220
I still find it very inspiring
and important, significant,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.490
the notion that film was
created on an assembly line,

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.570
just like toasters
or automobiles.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.930
Seems a shocking and
important insight.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.510
Because they're still
in some fundamental way

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.930
produced like this.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.070
I don't mean that the same
movie studios are churning out

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.260
500 movies a year, which
is what was churned out

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.570
during the great era of
the Hollywood Studios,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:44.820
from around 1930 through
the end of the 1940s.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.780
But the fact is the
production of movies,

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.590
the manufacture of movies still
depends on these principles

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.714
of the specialization of labor.

00:08:53.714 --> 00:08:55.880
And I'm not simply talking
about the way in which we

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.460
have actors, and directors, and
cinematographers, and grips,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:06.150
and best boys, and set dressers,
and makeup people, and script

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.280
writers, and so forth.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.390
All are relevant to this.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.790
But I'm also talking about
the way in which movies, still

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:17.470
to this day, are divided in
their production principles

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.900
in three stages, a
pre-production phase,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.850
a production phase, and
a post-production phase.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.430
And there are specialists at
each level, on each phase.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:31.780
And a vast army of
specialist is hired

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.576
to handle the problems
that are connected

00:09:34.576 --> 00:09:36.200
to the production of
every single film.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.350
So we can think of films as a
really distinctive, signature,

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.030
instance of what mass
production is capable of.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.900
OK.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.570
So we can say that the film
is a manufactured object.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.320
And not just a
manufactured object,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.175
but a product of
mass production,

00:09:50.175 --> 00:09:53.450
a product of essentially,
assembly line principles.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.150
And what makes this
so remarkable to me,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.360
still an idea that I have
trouble fully absorbing

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.050
is that the mass-produced
item that we're

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.420
talking about, unlike a
toaster or even an automobile,

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.660
managed so fully to permeate
our society and our world,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.320
that it's infiltrated
ourselves even into our dreams

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.696
and our fantasy life.

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.570
And finally, another
way to think about film,

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:16.560
and I'm going to sort
of enlarge in that.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.680
And this is a way
we'll be talking

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.390
about quite a lot in the
course of our discussions

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.830
in this semester.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.940
We can say that film, after
it's elaborated, and established

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.710
itself in culture, it becomes
a fundamental social form,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.910
a fundamental social formation.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.720
And experienced,
widely practiced,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.846
widely indulged in by
a vast number of people

00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:39.470
in the society.

00:10:42.814 --> 00:10:44.230
So that one could
say for example,

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.020
toasters are important,
but they don't

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.050
generate the kind
of social rituals

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.020
that are involved in
going to the movies,

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.120
and of identifying
with movie stars,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.010
and of generating
fans surround movies,

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:02.600
and ancillary, complex
activities that we associate

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.570
with movie going.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.520
And in fact, one might say that
the great era of movie going

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.450
is already gone.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.230
That it was really in the
era of the Hollywood Studios

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.600
when they were before the
internet and before television.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.120
So we could also think of
the film as a social form.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.360
Not when it first appears,
when it's just a novelty,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.068
but after it goes
through various phases.

00:11:22.068 --> 00:11:26.030
When it embeds itself into the
society the way the movies did,

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.720
it becomes a kind
of social form.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.160
And one might
almost argue that it

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.810
becomes one of the most
important social forms

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.120
in the society because
it's so widely shared.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.210
Most social activities
in the society

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:42.070
are relatively limited in the
circle of people they involve.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.880
Even the number of
automobile drivers

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.500
is controlled in a way that
is contained or demarcated

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.650
in a way that's less true.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.710
Movies appeal to children
as well as adults.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:56.530
And from there
very beginning this

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.988
has been true of
movies, especially

00:11:57.988 --> 00:11:59.060
in the United States.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.930
They've appealed across lines
of social stratification,

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.300
across differences of gender,
across differences of age,

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.290
across differences of race.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.660
There's one book on the film,
a rather overly optimistic one

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.910
that simplifies the pernicious
or sinister aspect of movies

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.709
called "Film --
The Democratic Art.

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:21.250
And you can understand,
even though I

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.754
think it's a simplification,
why that's an interesting way

00:12:23.754 --> 00:12:24.670
to think about movies.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:29.080
Because it reached so widely
across so many social barriers.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.090
In that sense, film
was the narrative form

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.850
that reached a wider audience
than any other narrative

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.150
system that had been invented
by human beings before it.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.450
What's one explanation for why
film would be so appealing,

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.660
be even more appealing
than printed narrative?

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.020
It also is connected
to why the movies grew

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.900
so quickly in their infancy.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.360
Why they went from
being a novelty

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.959
to being an embedded
social form so quickly.

00:12:53.959 --> 00:12:55.500
You probably know
what the answer is.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.620
AUDIENCE: That more people
could see than could read.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.170
DAVID THORBURN: Yes, that's
the real answer, isn't it.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.660
That it's mostly
a visual medium.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.870
It doesn't depend on
language to the same degree.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.690
And especially
silent film, which

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.957
did not depend-- which it
did depend on language,

00:13:07.957 --> 00:13:09.540
it used intertitles
and things, but it

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.200
depended on language minimally.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.670
Why was this important?

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.830
Because when the film was in
its infancy, there was also--

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.600
and this was a fundamental,
enabling condition

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.200
for the development
of movies-- there

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.040
was also in the United
States a vast and growing

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.790
immigrant population in all the
major cities, but especially

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:32.920
Chicago, New York, some
of the other larger,

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.140
industrial cities.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.820
And this new immigrant
population, which many of them

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.890
didn't know English at
all, had only a little bit

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.280
of money, disposable income,
but they needed entertainment.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.150
And the silent film was
the perfect answer to this.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.400
The film, relatively quickly
becomes a profoundly embedded

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.050
social form.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.110
To give you some sense
of how monumental,

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.720
and how central,
how important this

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.010
was in American society, what
I can just simply remind you of

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:06.390
is that for most of the
period in which the Hollywood

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.050
Studios were operating at
full power, roughly the period

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.100
from the advent of sound
film in the late '20s,

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.740
until the late '40s when
television intervened,

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.250
even though there's a period
when television is around

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.500
when the movie studios
retain something

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.980
of their old character,
but they begin

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.540
to decline without fully
realizing if, that occurs

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.220
in the mid '50s sometime.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.650
So in the period from
roughly 1930 to say,

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.170
1955, to be crude about it.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.380
In this period, the vast
majority of Americans

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.920
went to the movies
every single week.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.340
Think about that,
every single week.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.860
This was before television,
which supplanted

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.090
that quality of movies.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.680
In 1947 or 1948, 80 million
Americans went to the movies

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.020
every week, every week.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.630
That was like 2/3 of the
population at that time.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.090
So it was near to being
a universal experience.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.840
And not just the
universal experience

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.240
that occurred occasionally,
but a routine experience.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.720
An experience that families,
and individuals, and young,

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.450
and old, had regularly, as a
fundamental part of their life,

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.350
as a part of their
ordinary experience.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:19.170
That's what I mean by
an embedded social form.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.770
That's an immensely important
fact about the movies,

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.010
and especially about
the classic movies.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.560
And when that feature, the
idea of the movies as something

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.980
routine in people's
lives, something

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.760
they did regularly,
not occasionally.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.410
When that feature
disappears, it disappears

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.920
in part because of the impact
of television on society.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.080
Television's in
the house, so it's

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.555
a lot easier to
retain, to establish

00:15:43.555 --> 00:15:45.270
an habitual relation
to television

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.270
than it is to the movie.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.900
So the advent of
this new technology

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.140
changed movies relation
to its audience.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.100
And this is the
fact that to which

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.750
again we will return
again, and again.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.880
So we could also frame
movies in other ways.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.580
But these framings I think,
are helpful to us in part

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.830
to remind us of some things
that I'm not going to do.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.680
One could certainly
imagine a course

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.350
in the Department of
Economics that looks simply

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.570
at the film as an
economic engine,

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.780
at the number of jobs
created by movies.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.720
Not just the immediate jobs,
the people who are actually

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:23.100
producing the film, but
another kind of a accounting

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.470
that would take account
of all the ancillary jobs.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.850
The theater owners,
the popcorn sellers,

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.670
the people who create
the publicity for movies.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.310
The whole entourage
of hangers-on--

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.330
you're thinking of the
TV show, aren't you?

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.600
The whole entourage
of hangers-on that

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.280
follow the movie stars around.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.800
It's an unbelievable engine
of economic development

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.700
and economic growth.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.390
And it is arguable, given
the fact that the movies had

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.950
been a dominant industry
in the Western world,

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.540
and especially in
the United States,

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.191
since the early
20th century, one

00:16:53.191 --> 00:16:54.690
could make an
argument that it's one

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.540
of the most productive
and central engines

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.190
of economic growth that
capitalism has ever developed.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.000
And one could teach a course
in the movies that simply

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.520
emphasized its economic aspects,
its power as an employer,

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.810
its role as a
generator of wealth,

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.040
as a generator of resources.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.859
And I mention this
partly to clarify

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:18.560
the extent to which,
in our course,

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.790
we're focusing on only
aspects of what film might be.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.760
But also, in order
to remind you that we

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.780
need to be aware of this as a
backdrop to the more cultural

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.904
and aesthetic concerns
about the content of movies,

00:17:31.904 --> 00:17:33.820
and about the way they
developed, the way they

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.840
evolved, that will be
the central energies

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.915
we will be committed
to in our course.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.240
Well, one thing you
need to do in order

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.430
to experience these first weeks
of this course in a really

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.780
effective way is to try
to in a certain sense,

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.800
get outside of your own head,
get outside of your own skin.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.990
We live in such a visually
saturated environment.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.510
In which audio/visual messages
are beamed at us constantly.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.742
Some of us are connected
to apparatus all the time.

00:18:12.742 --> 00:18:14.200
We're connected to
our cell phones.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.930
We're connected
to our computers.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:22.235
It's almost as if we have audio
visual signals bombarding us

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:22.735
24/7.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.980
It's almost as if you
were entering a cave,

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.479
imagine that you're
entering a cave.

00:18:29.479 --> 00:18:32.740
What I want to do is
think away your iPods.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.230
Think away your cell phone.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.110
Literally, think them away.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.910
Imagine a world without them.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.750
Imagine a world without movies,
a world without television,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.670
a world without radio.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.780
I want you to imaginatively
put yourself back

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.890
into the era when the first
films began to appear.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.240
And try to recover
some of the excitement

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.170
and wonder that those earliest
audiences must have felt when

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.435
they saw some of these images.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.640
The most important
thing in some sense

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.650
would be that they
were immensely amazed,

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.550
they were taken aback by
the simple, shocking, wonder

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.550
of movement captured on film.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.610
It was if movement
itself, something

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.180
they associate with
reality, could suddenly

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.560
be recaptured in film.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.170
Can we show some
examples of this, Greg?

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.970
Some of you have seen
one example of this.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.260
Remember in the recitation
section, when you

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.930
saw The Great Train Robbery.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.640
Do you remember the moment
in The Great Train Robbery--

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.410
which seems unconnected
to the story--

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.740
in some prints of the
film it comes at the end.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.707
In some prints it
came at the beginning.

00:19:42.707 --> 00:19:44.290
In some prints it
didn't occur at all.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.664
Where was it in
the film you saw?

00:19:45.664 --> 00:19:47.009
AUDIENCE: Is it the guy?

00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:48.050
DAVID THORBURN: Yes, yes.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:48.640
When was that?

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.360
AUDIENCE: It was
at the very end.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.140
DAVID THORBURN: That
was at the very end.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.780
It's the moment where the
guy pulls out his gun,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.571
and points it at the
camera and shoots him.

00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:55.237
Did any of you find that odd?

00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:56.570
I mean, I think you should have.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.000
One reason is that
it had nothing

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.055
to do with the narrative.

00:20:03.016 --> 00:20:04.320
This is important film.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.530
It used to be thought to
be the very first story

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.030
film, the very first
systematic narrative on film.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.430
It's not that, there
are earlier examples.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.200
But it's one of the
very first, and that's

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.500
why I wanted you see it.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.640
It's one of the
earliest story films.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.000
It's one of the earliest film
to tell a sequential story.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.300
Although it seems very
primitive to you guys,

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.832
it's actually a very
sophisticated item.

00:20:25.832 --> 00:20:27.790
And there has been a lot
of filmmaking going on

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.112
before this film was made 1902.

00:20:30.112 --> 00:20:32.070
We'll talk a little bit
about that in a moment.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.900
So this moment where he
shoots the gun at the camera,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.580
why is that disturbing
to us or strange to us?

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.770
I'll answer my own question.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.755
One, it's disturbing
to us because it

00:20:40.755 --> 00:20:41.630
breaks the narrative.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.535
It seems unconnected
to the narrative.

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:44.410
Why would they do it?

00:20:47.665 --> 00:20:49.290
And then second,
what's going on there?

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.081
Why is he doing it?

00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:52.490
Does the filmmaker
not like his audience?

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.670
What's the reason for it?

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.900
Why do you think it's there?

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.569
Who has an idea?

00:20:56.569 --> 00:20:57.360
Why would be there?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.750
Again enter the cave.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.440
Think yourself back to
an era before movie.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.830
When people had never
seen movies before.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:04.990
What's the answer?

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.725
AUDIENCE: He couldn't engage
the audience in the film.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:07.680
DAVID THORBURN: Well,
he does engage them,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.770
but what else what does it do?

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.061
What does it call attention to?

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.830
AUDIENCE: It puts
him into a situation

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.246
that they normally would not
encounter, and probably would

00:21:16.246 --> 00:21:17.760
not survive.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.360
DAVID THORBURN:
OK, that's right.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.620
Yes, a way that's right.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.320
And in fact, there are a lot of
accounts of early films playing

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.135
these kinds of tricks,
and audiences not yet sure

00:21:27.135 --> 00:21:29.410
of what films were,
reacting as if they

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:30.970
were looking at something real.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.610
So there are at least reports
of people seeing this film when

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.693
the guy shot the gun,
people screaming and ducking

00:21:35.693 --> 00:21:37.430
down under their seats.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.895
And there are many stories
like this about early films

00:21:39.895 --> 00:21:42.520
where people would come to the--
and that's why they showed it.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.530
They showed it because
it's a very dramatic way

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:49.710
of dramatizing, of crystallizing
the difference between reality

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:50.530
and movies.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.570
And also, how realistic
movies can be.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.560
The movie's name's the
most fundamental feature

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.280
of the movies.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.892
It's a dead metaphor for us.

00:22:00.892 --> 00:22:02.850
We don't even think about
it when we say movie.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.020
But think what it means,
it means movement.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.292
Films capture movement.

00:22:06.292 --> 00:22:08.000
What don't you just
show this in sequence

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.930
while I talk, Greg, OK.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.790
These are a sequence
of early films.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.120
And you can see that all
of them have in common

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.600
is a fascination with motion.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.830
In other words, the
novelty of motion

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.960
was so great in the beginning
that the earliest film simply

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.080
did this.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.310
There's an important
principle here about the way

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.770
all media developed.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.140
In their infancy, the
first thing that happens

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.740
is that no one really much
knows how a particular medium

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.670
we should be or
could be developed.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.950
And part of the reason
for these early weeks

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.190
in the film for the first two
or three weeks in this course

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.520
is to put you back
into that situation.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.130
To try to in a very
crystallized and distilled way,

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.080
because there are thousands
of films made in this era,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.100
but in a very distilled
and crystallized way,

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.870
I'm trying to recapture some
of that excitement for you.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.050
And in the case of both Chaplin
and Keaton, what I've done

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.490
is choose some short
films they made earlier,

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.200
and then show you
a feature film.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.090
So if you watch the Chaplain,
Keaton films in sequence,

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.490
two shorts and then
a feature film,

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.630
you'll see enacted in
a kind of small compass

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.180
within the terms of a single
director's career this larger

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.070
process that I'm saying was also
enacted by movies themselves.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.580
It was this period
of the silent era,

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.710
was a period in which the movies
discovered their identity,

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.250
or such identity as they have.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.250
And I want to talk a
bit more about that.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:36.890
While all of these early,
relatively primitive films

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:41.457
show us is a kind
of-- this is one

00:23:41.457 --> 00:23:43.790
of the earliest-- some people
call this the first comedy

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:44.290
film.

00:23:48.692 --> 00:23:49.900
The first joke in the movies.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.270
The simplicity of it
seems to us weird.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.970
But if you think yourself
back, if you go into the cave,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:05.700
try to imagine a universe
without audio/visual stimuli,

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.980
you could begin to understand
why some of this stuff

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.310
was so interesting.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:14.710
Motion itself captivated early
audiences and filmmakers.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.680
Waves on the shore for example.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.430
There are a number of
films that just show

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.560
waves lapping on the shore.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.980
Many films of trains coming
into stations, and of course,

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.630
this Fred Ott Sneeze.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.200
Have we shown the kiss,
or the electrocute?

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.630
Can we do that?

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.230
There were also risque
or anarchic elements

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.180
that showed up in early
film that I want you see.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:42.460
Here is one of the most famous
and scandalous of early films,

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.490
something called The Kiss.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.520
And it was an unbelievable
scandal when it came out.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.270
It films a scene
from a stage play.

00:24:55.684 --> 00:24:56.600
Look how short it was.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.567
It was banned in many cities.

00:24:58.567 --> 00:24:59.900
It was thought to be scandalous.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.689
Do you have the electrocute?

00:25:07.689 --> 00:25:09.730
Many people would call
this the first snuff film.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:17.160
And this is a film called The
Electrocution of an Elephant.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.060
And think again
what's going on here.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.770
Part of it has to
do with this wonder

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.730
that the film can capture
actuality, in a way.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.980
There's something bizarre and
gross about this in some way.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.500
This was a rogue elephant that
was about to be put to death.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.000
AUDIENCE: She had apparently
stepped on a couple of handlers

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.324
and killed them.

00:25:37.324 --> 00:25:38.740
DAVID THORBURN:
So they were going

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.210
to electrocute the elephant,
and they brought a camera there

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:42.418
to witness the electrocution.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.790
And of course it's so dark,
because this fragment of film

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.920
survives from over 100 years
ago, more than 100 years.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:26:00.110
He's supposed to collapse
not to stand up, isn't he?

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.710
So there it is.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.210
[AUDIENCE GASPS]

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.970
Grotesque, isn't it?

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.200
But also a part of early film.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.020
This idea that film
could capture reality

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.540
was itself so--
the novelty of this

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.850
was so powerful, that
in the early stages

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.720
this was enough to cause great
excitement for audiences.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.680
One way to think
about this problem,

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.300
and to think about-- the way
I have for encapsulating,

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:34.780
or dramatizing in a
kind of a distilled way,

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.770
all the elaborate
processes that went

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.990
into the development or
the evolution of film

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.350
is by-- the way
I do this in part

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.430
is by reference to old Fred.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.800
This film used to be thought
to be the very first film,

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.160
it's not actually.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.470
But it is one of the earliest
films made and patented

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.340
in Edison's movie studio,
the very first movie

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.620
studio in the United States
in East Orange, New Jersey.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.880
Probably, this made
in 1894, at least

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.390
the copyright I think is of
Fred Ott's Sneeze is in 1894.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.920
And think of how simple it
is, how ridiculous it is.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.470
A camera sets up,
they were still

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.940
working on the technology
of the motion picture camera

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.160
at this stage, and they
were testing it out.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.010
And Fred Ott was an employee
of the Edison Company.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:19.450
And they said
different, OK, Fred,

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.635
stand in front of the
camera and take snuff.

00:27:21.635 --> 00:27:22.760
And that's what he's doing.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.450
We might think of
Fred Ott's Sneeze

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.720
as, theoretically,
symbolically, the first film,

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.220
even though there
are earlier films.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.580
Well, think of how
unbelievably simple it is.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.830
Shown it once more, Greg.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:34.660
Can you freeze it?

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.110
GREG: Oh, yeah.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.610
Hold on.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.280
I'll get it.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.279
DAVID THORBURN: So that
Fred stays on the screen

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:40.350
while we're talking about this.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.260
Look how short it is.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:41.760
What is it?

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.810
It's two seconds long.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.166
Think of this.

00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:47.790
So this film is made
in whatever it is,

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:55.790
1894, 1895, this two-second long
film was made in 1894, 1895,

00:27:55.790 --> 00:28:00.220
by the 1920s, astonishingly
complex narrative films

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.170
are being made, great works
of art are being made.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.010
What I call the
Fred Ott principle

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:11.930
is this whole complex,
social, and technical,

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:17.510
and technological,
and artistic process,

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.210
the swirling of all of these
energies going together.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:24.780
Including the demographic fact
of so many immigrants audiences

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.850
creating an
environment that made

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.800
early film a very profitable
activity, despite how crude

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.120
it was.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.340
What happens in this
period between 1900

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.800
and the end of the
'20s is that film

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.660
goes from being a
novelty separated off,

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.620
sharing a space in
the penny arcades

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.610
with other forms of
novelty, to being

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.720
one of the dominant
industries, and one

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.110
of the dominant
social experiences

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.990
of the American population.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.510
This principle is replicated in
some other European societies

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:55.260
as well, but not in all.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.930
It's an advanced
capitalist event.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.600
And it occurs in other societies
less fully industrialized

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.910
at later stages.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.420
But there is an
equivalent history

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.160
in some of the
European cultures.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.170
So in this period of
fewer than 30 years,

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.910
film goes from being the most
trivial and simplified kind

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:18.020
of novelty, to being one of the
most complex narrative forms

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.760
human beings have ever devised.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.860
What I mean by the
Fred Ott principle

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.240
is that whole complex
process that we

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.930
can go from something so
simple to something so complex,

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:31.170
from something so marginal in
society to something so central

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.370
in society in such a short time.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.670
And I want to at least
remind you of what

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.450
that principle involves.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.370
I'm talking about all
the technological,

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.760
cultural, demographic,
and economic currents that

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.770
swirl together to create the
movie industry that emerges--

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.370
really by the mid teens the
movie industry essentially

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.140
is in place.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.640
Variations will occur,
new studios will appear,

00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:03.405
but by 1915/1916 American
movies have been established

00:30:03.405 --> 00:30:04.890
on an assembly line basis.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.280
Have been established on
an assembly line basis,

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.830
and millions and
millions of people

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.760
are now making it a regular
habit to go to the movies.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.670
And the movies are
elaborating themselves

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.460
in a complex way that has to
do with the way in which they

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.710
were industrialized.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.720
There are three phases,
I think, to what

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.070
we might call-- let's go
back to the outline, Greg.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:35.310
There are three phases to what
we might call media evolution.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.790
And this is another way of
sort of dramatizing what I

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.285
mean by the Fred Ott principle.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:49.380
The first phase is a phase of
imitation and patent warfare.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.760
A new technology appears.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.820
Nobody yet knows how
it would be applied.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.470
How people will want to do.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.080
Everything about the new
technologies up for grabs.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.380
So there are
competitors who want

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.720
to sort of claim patents
on the technology.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.130
Questions about how
long should films be?

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.700
Where she feels be shown?

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.440
How should films be distributed?

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.710
All of that's up for grabs.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.870
All of that is
rationalized and decided--

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.060
I put "decided" in quotes
because no one sits down

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.240
and makes a decision.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.800
It's really a function
of the marketplace,

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.939
and of certain
economic opportunities.

00:31:22.939 --> 00:31:25.230
There's no question, for
example, that the movies would

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.960
never have developed
as they did were not

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.320
for those immigrant populations
in cities like Chicago,

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.560
and New York, and Los Angeles.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.610
And many other cities on
the East Coast especially,

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.170
where they were
very large immigrant

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.570
populations who needed.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.040
And it was that
financial infusion

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.945
that caused the immense
amount of experimentation

00:31:46.945 --> 00:31:50.650
and development to
take place so quickly.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.560
So in this first phase of
imitation and patent warfare

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.680
many of these questions
are not-- even

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.310
such simple questions as
how long a film should be?

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.370
Some of the question of
the length of the film

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.120
are technological,
the very first films

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.380
had to be only 10 minutes
long, because that

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.062
was as long as the film
cartridges in which they

00:32:09.062 --> 00:32:10.770
put in the cameras
were capable of doing.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.560
Later they were able to make
two reelers, and three reelers.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.870
That happens over a relatively
short space of time.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.010
So in this phase
of imitation, one

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.090
the most important
things that happens,

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.630
and this is the part I want
you to become attentive to,

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.540
is that all of the
ancestor systems that

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.400
lie behind the new technology
are potential influences

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.750
on the new technology.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.780
And in new films that
you've seen already,

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.930
the silent films you
saw in recitation,

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.940
you saw some examples of this.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.740
For example, do you remember--
maybe we could show this, Greg.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:46.032
The deaths in The
Great Train Robbery.

00:32:46.032 --> 00:32:47.990
Remember the deaths of
The Great Train Robbery?

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.910
Why are you smiling?

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.410
AUDIENCE: Because
there was a dummy.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.493
DAVID THORBURN: Because
they were still noticeably

00:32:52.493 --> 00:32:53.630
what, false, fake?

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:54.806
Where do they come from?

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:56.430
The guy shoots, and
the guy goes "ooh."

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.730
And he staggers around,
and then he falls.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.110
What's going on there?

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.900
Where does that tradition
of performance come from?

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:03.800
AUDIENCE: Theater.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.340
DAVID THORBURN: Yes, yes.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.780
I'll let it play behind me.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.080
Yes, it comes from theater.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.260
Makes sense that one of the
deep influences on early film

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.110
would be theater.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.740
But now in the
Fred Ott principle,

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:20.120
the most important sub idea in
this theory, and this label,

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.640
the Fred Ott
principle is the fact

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:26.840
that this process of development
involves, among other things,

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.740
the capacity of
filmmakers to discover

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.670
those features of the new medium
that are unique or special

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:32.610
to the medium.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.510
What makes the medium
different from its ancestors?

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.390
Clearly, what was appropriate
for books, or newspapers,

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.380
or theater, won't be perfectly
appropriate for the new medium.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.580
But nobody knows
what the new medium's

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.990
capable of until things
have been tried out.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.630
So that's why I call it
a phase of imitation.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.390
And what one can
say here especially

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:54.210
is that certain theatrical
styles of acting are dominant.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:58.700
Why our theatrical styles
of acting so broad?

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.452
So unbelievable.

00:34:00.452 --> 00:34:01.410
Why are they like that?

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.920
AUDIENCE: Because
you're far away.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.086
DAVID THORBURN: Yes, in the
theater you're far away,

00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:06.430
and you're in a fixed space.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:08.940
But what's one
genius of the movies?

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.000
One way the medium of the
movies is different from theater

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.610
is that the camera can
achieve a lover's closeness

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.350
to the action.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:19.010
Or it can achieve a long view
that's much longer and further

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.539
away than what.

00:34:20.539 --> 00:34:22.830
Well, it's going to take time
before this kind of thing

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.280
is figured out.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.510
And one of the most decisive
things we see an early films

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:31.949
is first, an acting style that
seems derived from theater.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.159
But some of you may have
noticed that this begins

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.120
to change relatively quickly.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.469
Can we show the fragment
from A Beast at Bay?

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.370
Remember that silly
film, A Beast at Bay,

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:44.110
that I had to watching it along
with The Great Train Robbery?

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.719
Remember the ending
of A Beast at Bay?

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:51.903
Something odd happens
in this ending.

00:34:51.903 --> 00:34:57.270
There's the monstrous,
drooling, rapist-like figure.

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.200
He's always a convict
or a low-life.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.120
There are all kinds
of social hierarchies

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.840
and established
social prejudices that

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.350
get imported into early films.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:11.320
And now we're going
to have the rescue.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.650
And so far it seems
a conventional sort

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.620
of sleazy melodrama,
in which there

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.670
is at least a hint of
something morally disturbing

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.090
in the imminence of the rape.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.490
It's as if the film makes
a kind of sleazy appeal

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.670
to its audiences.

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.810
Here's a perfect example
of such a moment.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:36.080
It's interesting in fact,
how one of the recurring

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.880
subjects of films always
seems to be not just rape,

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.860
but violence against women.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.670
It tells you something about
the patriarchal societies

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:48.690
in which films emerge that
those mythologies are replicated

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.050
in movies.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.030
So he's going to
be rescued here.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.660
And what I want you
to notice is what

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.400
happens at the very
end of this sequence.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.655
And can some of you
remember what it is?

00:35:57.655 --> 00:35:58.530
None of you remember?

00:35:58.530 --> 00:35:59.760
It was so fast.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.260
But it actually is
very significant.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.170
I think it shows us the
emergence, the beginnings

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.960
of the emergence of
a new style of acting

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.410
more appropriate to movies.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.170
And also, something
else, the development

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:14.670
of a total complexity that
had not been in movies before.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:19.290
Now the date of this film
is early, 1907, 1908,

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.800
something like that.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.150
You're going to see one other
silent film by D.W. Griffith

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:27.710
tonight, The Lonedale
Operator, made in 1912.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.470
And I hope you'll be attentive
to how much more complex

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:31.500
that film is.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.377
I'll say a few words
about that tonight.

00:36:35.377 --> 00:36:37.210
I wish we were really
just at the end, Greg.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.043
I didn't really want
to show the whole film.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.587
OK, so here we're
at the conclusion.

00:36:47.587 --> 00:36:49.420
Now this is the part I
wanted you to notice.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:49.961
Look at this.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.110
What's happening here?

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.860
The film has shifted over
into a kind of silly comedy,

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.680
a kind of gentle comedy.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.320
The woman said, kiss
me hear, kiss me hear.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.320
And in fact, if you notice
she's not she's not saying,

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.540
kiss me here!

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.140
In other words, her gestures
are more modulated to the nature

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.270
of movies.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.260
What's beginning to happen
there is two important things.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:27.350
First, total complexity
is entering in.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.760
A melodrama has turned comic.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.220
And acting style's beginning to.

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:37.000
Can we do the very
end of Musketeers?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.780
Here is the very end of
a film by D.W. Griffith

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.430
called The Musketeers
of Pig Alley.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:45.490
Some people see it as one of
the first urban crime films.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:51.420
But what I want you to watch
is this small actor here .

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.620
Watch his performance.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.400
This is the emergence
of a new kind

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.600
of acting, a non-theatrical
kind of acting.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.490
And it's happening very early,
this film appeared in 1912.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.890
That's Lillian Gish, the
famous silent film star.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:22.545
This gangster is socked
that this woman would

00:38:22.545 --> 00:38:24.975
choose his rival over him.

00:38:24.975 --> 00:38:26.100
He says, you're nuts, lady.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.120
I can't get it, but OK.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.130
Look at this strutting
peacock of a man.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.384
Watch this.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.080
He's a gangster, he's
about to be arrested,

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.720
but the good guys will save him.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.236
Oh, we lost it.

00:38:49.236 --> 00:38:50.452
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:50.452 --> 00:38:52.410
DAVID THORBURN: One good
turn deserves another.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:56.770
But you see how
much more restrained

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.974
the performances are here?

00:38:58.974 --> 00:39:00.390
I mean, Lillian
Gish became one of

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:02.890
the great silent-screen stars.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:08.680
But I think it's this
strutting peacock of an actor

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.800
who really begins to show
what you can do on film.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.280
And there are many
film critics who

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.840
have seen this as a precursor
of Edward G. Robinson's

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.740
performances.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.950
He's also a diminutive
actor, often plays gangsters.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.530
But what you see, I
think, in this moment,

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:26.160
and in this man's performance
is the emergence, the beginnings

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.410
of an acting style
that's more modulated,

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.247
that's appropriate to
the nature of the film

00:39:30.247 --> 00:39:31.830
So that kind of thing
that's happening

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.475
is not just with acting, it has
to do with all kinds of things.

00:39:35.475 --> 00:39:36.850
It has to do with
where you place

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:43.880
the camera, and such matters.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.870
So what I mean then, by
the Fred Ott principle

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:50.280
is this process of evolution
that I want you to be aware of.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.830
And really, in a
certain sense experience

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:55.640
in distilled form
in the short films

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.580
I've asked you to watch in
this first week of classes.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.840
The first phase is a phase of
imitation and patent warfare.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.230
In which all kinds of
questions are up in the air.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:07.380
How will the film
be distributed?

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.320
How will it be exhibited?

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.490
How will it be produced?

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:17.080
There's nothing inherent in the
nature of the technology that

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.884
requires the economic
arrangements that developed

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:22.300
in the United States, and then
we're replicated elsewhere,

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.760
for the distribution of movies.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.860
In fact, Thomas Edison
had a different idea

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.570
for how movies
would be developed.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.930
When he first conceived
the apparatus,

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.170
he actually thought that
movie projectors would

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:37.650
be owned by each individual.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:41.970
In fact, what he
was imagining was

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:48.084
the camcorder that occurs
in a much later generation.

00:40:48.084 --> 00:40:50.000
And there's nothing
inherent in the technology

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.590
that would not permit that.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:56.120
So one of the things we
need to be aware of--

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.030
and I'll return to this
matter either tonight

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.250
or in a later lecture.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.060
We need to be aware of fact that
the shape the technology takes

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.740
is not the only
shape it might take.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.600
It's not the
technology itself that

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.320
drives its development so
much as economic, and social,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.490
and demographic factors.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.900
And that's dramatically
the case with the system

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.430
of distribution and access that
was developed for the movies.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:23.912
It's certainly theoretically
possible for the apparatus

00:41:23.912 --> 00:41:25.370
to be developed in
a way that would

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.920
be sold to every individual.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.000
What instead
happened was a system

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.580
in which a professional elite
becomes the production arm.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:36.020
And these productions
become very expensive,

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:42.890
and they are pumped out into
the society for screening

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:46.810
at public theaters, which
people will pay money to attend.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:50.490
That economic structure, and
that basic industrial structure

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.980
is not necessary
to the technology.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.030
It's not required
by the technology.

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:57.830
The shape of film is at
least as much cultural

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.550
as it is technological.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.200
A very important point.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.680
So the second phase after
the phase of imitation

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.640
is the phase I call
technical advance.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:13.940
This phase occurs after some
of the warfare is concluded.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.650
Limited monopolies
are established.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:18.210
Some companies are more
powerful than others,

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:20.640
or come up with a more
successful product than others.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.431
And they begin to
dominate the marketplace.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.950
They drive competitors out.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.610
And what essentially happens
is a kind of stability

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:33.080
is introduced in which the
basic system is put in place.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.990
Here's how we'll
manufacture the item.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:37.590
Here's how we'll distribute it.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.010
Here's how long it will be.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.470
That sort of thing.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:43.410
And in this period
of technical advance

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.110
what then happens once
the stability sets in,

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:49.010
the particular, unique
features of the medium

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.132
begin to be explored.

00:42:50.132 --> 00:42:52.340
And these early films that
I'm asking you to look at,

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.010
what I hope you'll
watch for are moments

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:57.090
like the ones I was just
pointing out this afternoon.

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:00.930
In which you see the emergence
of a recognition of something

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:04.050
that is distinct or special
in the nature of movie making.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.640
I'll return to some of
these matters again tonight.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.840
But I want you to
be aware of them.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.470
So in the second phase, the
phase of technical advance,

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.340
the system begins to learn
what is unique about it.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.860
How are movies different
from their ancestors?

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.950
What does it mean that
the camera can move close

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:25.702
to the object is photographing,
or very far away from it?

00:43:25.702 --> 00:43:27.910
What does it mean that the
camera itself doesn't have

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:29.950
to be stable, that it can move?

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.120
You can see some of the
early Griffith films really

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:36.410
experiment with a
camera that's mounted

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.450
on something that's moving.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:44.030
And then the final phase is
the phase I call maturity.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.490
And that's the phase that
occurs really in silent film,

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.660
in the 1920s.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:51.990
When the technical advances that
are accomplished in phase two

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.510
are married to a
serious subject matter.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:56.930
The phase I call maturity is
the phase in which feature

00:43:56.930 --> 00:44:00.390
films are made, and in which
some films become works of art.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.490
And all films become more
complex forms of narrative.

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:06.260
In which particular genre
forms begin to emerge.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.052
And audiences begin to
choose particular kinds

00:44:09.052 --> 00:44:10.260
of films that matter to them.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.635
In other words,
the system really

00:44:11.635 --> 00:44:14.240
elaborates itself in
a way that suggests

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.472
an immense variety of appeal
to a range of audience.

00:44:18.472 --> 00:44:19.680
That's the phase of maturity.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.220
Why doesn't it go on forever?

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.660
What explains why the
process doesn't continue?

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.950
What stopped this process?

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:28.760
So the Fred Ott
principle encapsule

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.780
means going from
Fred Ott's Sneeze

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.220
to going to Chaplin's
Modern Times.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.260
This immensely rich,
complex narrative

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.930
film that we'll be
looking at next week.

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:40.240
What explains why that
moment of maturity

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.640
doesn't extend forever?

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.720
Why is this system
not stable forever?

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.550
The simplest answer
is capitalism

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.380
never allows for stability.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.700
But the more exact answer is
new inventions, new technologies

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.510
subvert the stability.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.470
What happens at
the end of the '20s

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:59.450
to subvert the confidence
and stability of the system?

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:00.950
AUDIENCE: The
introduction of sound.

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:02.010
DAVID THORBURN: The
advent of sound.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:02.280
Yes.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.821
And the sound film
doesn't completely

00:45:03.821 --> 00:45:06.550
revolutionize movies, but
it profoundly alters them.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.160
It changes the nature of film.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.860
And it changes the nature
of the kinds of performers

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.260
that you need in film.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.260
It profoundly enlarges and
complicates what film is.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.160
And then, something
of the same principles

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.410
that I've talked about before
happen in the sound era.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:21.590
I'm sorry I'm running
a little over,

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:23.240
but I promise you
I'm almost done.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.090
And normally, I will never
run over even by a minute.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:26.610
I promise.

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:27.590
I'll work for this.

00:45:30.319 --> 00:45:31.860
Why doesn't the
final phase continue?

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.280
Because of new technologies.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.490
Because of new possibilities.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.800
What happens at the end
of the studio system?

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.680
The advent of
television overturns

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.880
the stabilities that had been
created and the old studio era.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.490
And the intimate
routine connection

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.840
to movies that had been
established in the studio era

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.360
is finally obliterated by
the presence of television.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.280
And movies change
their character

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.390
after television comes in.

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:54.431
We will return to this.

00:45:54.431 --> 00:45:55.680
We will return to this matter.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:03.280
, Well one way I can suggest for
you to capture this imaginative

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.240
linkage, this imaginative
connection to the world

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:13.160
of early film is by reminding
you of a wonderful passage from

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.180
the Pulitzer Prize winning novel
by the great film critic James

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:21.110
Agee, which appeared
posthumously in 1957.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:25.730
And it distills for
me what I mean--

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:28.110
and I hope for you--
what I mean in part

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:32.120
by film as a social
form, film as a socially

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.820
embedded formation.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.820
It helps to explain in
less abstract terms what

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.720
I mean when I say that filled
permeated American life.

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:45.590
Listen to the beginning of,
this is from the first chapter.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.990
And we're finished
after this is over.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.990
From the first chapter
of A Death in the Family.

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.530
"At supper that night as many
times before, his father said,

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:58.070
well, suppose we go
to the picture show.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:01.724
Oh, J, his mother said,
that horrid, little man.

00:47:01.724 --> 00:47:02.640
What's wrong with him?

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.930
His father asked.

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.760
Not because he didn't know
what she would say, but so

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.010
she would say it.

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:12.860
He's so nasty, she said as
she always did, so vulgar.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.570
With his nasty little cane
hooking up skirts and things,

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.530
and that nasty little walk."

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:20.110
Who is he talking about?

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:23.430
Chaplin, Charlie
Chaplin, of course.

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:26.320
And this story takes
place before Chaplin

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.860
was making feature films.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.070
So the story takes place
probably around 1915.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:36.970
When comedy was still
being made as shorts.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.700
Comedies didn't
become feature length

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.590
until sometime late in the '20s.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:42.640
"His father laughed
as he always did.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.620
And Rufus felt that he had
become rather an empty joke.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.900
But as always, the
laughter also cheered him.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.950
He felt that the laughter
enclosed him with his father.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:53.620
They walked downtown in the
light of mother of pearl

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.910
to the majestic," nice
name for a theater--

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.030
"and found their seats by
the light of the screen

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:03.200
in the exhilarating smell of
tobacco, rank sweat, perfume,

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.760
and dirty drawers.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.784
While the piano played
fast music," right,

00:48:07.784 --> 00:48:09.450
because violent films
were never silent.

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:11.340
There was always music
accompanying them.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:14.720
"And galloping horses raised
a grandiose flag of dust.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.260
And there was William S.
Hart--" the passage then

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.910
goes on to describe a
western film with William S.

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:21.700
Hart, a silent film.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.340
"And then the screen was
filled with the city,

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:26.700
and with the sidewalk of
a side street of a city,

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.430
and a long line of palms,
and there was Charlie.

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:32.700
Everyone laughed the
minute they saw him squatly

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.550
walking with his toes out
and his knees apart as

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:36.610
if he were chafed.

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:40.050
Rufus's father laughed,
and Rufus laughed, too.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.680
This time Charlie stole
a whole bag--" this time.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.430
What does that imply
about the audience?

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:48.300
And intimate familiarity
with previous adventures

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.790
of this character, an
ongoing routine connection.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.657
"This time Charlie stole
a whole bag of eggs.

00:48:56.657 --> 00:48:58.240
And when a cop came
along, he hid them

00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.804
in the seat of his pants.

00:48:59.804 --> 00:49:01.470
Then, he caught sight
of a pretty woman,

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:03.890
and he began to squat
and twirl his cane,

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:05.060
and make silly faces."

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:05.935
I'm going to skip it.

00:49:05.935 --> 00:49:08.160
It's magnificent
prose that captures

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.950
the essence of the
film very wonderfully.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:12.910
But I don't want to keep you
longer than I already have.

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:15.490
And it shows Charlie sort
of flirting with the girl.

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:18.700
And then finally, he flirts with
her so much that she pushes him

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.260
and he falls back down.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.680
"Then he walked back
and forth behind her,

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.035
laughing and squatting a little.

00:49:25.035 --> 00:49:26.410
And while he walked
very quietly,

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:27.640
everybody laughed again.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.890
Then, he flicked hold of the
straight end of his cane,

00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:32.550
and with the crooked end
hooked up her skirt at the knee

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:36.090
in exactly the way
that disgusted momma.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:37.610
Looking very
eagerly at her legs,

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:39.797
and everybody
laughed very loudly.

00:49:39.797 --> 00:49:41.380
And she pretended
she had not noticed.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.660
And then she pushes him over.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.470
And there was Charlie, flat
on his bottom on the sidewalk.

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:50.090
And the way he looked, kind
of sickly and disgusted,

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:53.220
you could see that he suddenly
remembered those eggs.

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.470
And suddenly you
remembered them, too.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.610
The way his face looked
with his lip wrinkled

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:59.720
off the teeth and a
little sickly smile,

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.610
it made you feel just the way
those broken eggs must feel

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:05.640
against your seat, as queer
and awful as that time

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.820
in the white PK suit."

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.740
He's also dramatizing how
personal our relation to film

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:11.910
can be.

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:13.639
"When it ran down out
of the pants' legs,

00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:15.430
and showed all over
your stockings, and you

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:18.390
had to walk home that way
with everyone looking.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.700
And Rufus's father nearly
tore his head off laughing,

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.180
and so did everybody else.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.140
But Rufus was sorry for
Charlie, having so recently

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.550
been in a similar predicament.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:30.885
But the contagion of laughter
was too much for him,

00:50:30.885 --> 00:50:31.760
and he laughed, too."

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.970
And the passage
goes on to describe

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:37.360
the intimacy and the
complexity of the relations

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.140
between audiences
in 1915 and one

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.820
of the iconic figures
of the movies.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:46.890
In this idea, that
Charlie mobilizes

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:49.660
this anarchic,
liberating laughter,

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:53.930
and mobilizes this
father-son relationship.

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.720
In that idea we
recapture something

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.090
of what I mean by
the notion that

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.680
film was an embedded
social experience,

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.400
an embedded social form.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.550
I'll see you tonight.
