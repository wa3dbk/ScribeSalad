DAVID THORBURN: One
of the ways to think

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.310
about the American
musical, generally,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.910
is to recognize that it's
a distinctive, maybe even

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.520
a unique American form and with
the Western movie, the two most

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.390
distinctive contributions
that Hollywood has made

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.020
to the art of movie making.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.630
Listen to this entry on
musicals, the very beginning

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.520
of the entry on musicals from
The Oxford Companion to Film.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.250
"The history of
the screen musical

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.600
is essentially that of
the American musical.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750
The outstanding
examples of the genre

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.980
have been made in Hollywood,
and only the American industry

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.250
has consistently
produced musicals

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.240
throughout the sound era."

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.000
The book was published
in the early '70s,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.090
just as Hollywood movies were
undergoing the transformation

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.230
I've alluded to.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.460
"Indeed with the
Western, the musical

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.420
could be claimed as Hollywood's
outstanding contribution

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.800
to the history of cinema."

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.450
So that's a good
context for thinking

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.140
both about the Westerns we'll
be talking about in the next two

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.848
weeks and about the musicals
we're thinking about this week.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.310
Perhaps before we
go any further,

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.310
it would be useful for me
to give a very quick talk

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.210
about the problem of
definition because there

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.040
is music in almost all films.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.290
How do we distinguish a
musical, a true musical,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.170
from a film that contains music?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.180
And the simplest answer is
also the most obvious one.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.810
We would embrace a
definition, I think,

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.850
that would say that a film
in which song and dance are

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.440
so essential that to remove them
would leave virtually nothing

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.304
means you're watching a musical.

00:02:12.304 --> 00:02:13.720
And that would
distinguish it then

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.430
from many, many films
in which musical

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.350
elements may be present,
even musical performances

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.390
may be present, but they
are not at the very essence

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.520
of what the film is.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.390
And the film is not entirely
dependent upon those elements.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.870
So a simple,
straightforward definition.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.930
One way we can measure the
significance, the centrality,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.540
of the musical and
also of the Western,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.020
because the numbers are somewhat
similar for the Western--

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.510
the centrality of the
musical to the studio system

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.210
is to look at the numbers.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:54.140
And between 1927 and 1947,
just over 900 musical films,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.640
were made.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.460
That's approximately
48 films a year.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.000
That's roughly 10% of
the total production

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.681
of movies during that
period were musicals.

00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:07.430
And one of the things
it shows, of course,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.740
is how steady the
audience for musicals

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.500
were, how stable the system
became relatively quickly,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.680
allowing for the elaboration
and repetition of the fuller

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.650
exploration of this
particular genre of movie.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.170
And you can recognize
the decline, too.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.580
There are people who would
argue that the musical,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.400
in its exuberance, and the
American musical especially,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.960
in its exuberance and optimism,
represented essentially

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.520
a pre-war value.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.290
And there are people who
say, well, after the war,

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.230
the musical began to decline.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.750
There are other explanations
for why the musical began

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.820
its decline, and
the primary one is

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.310
the one I've already implied.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.100
The studio system
was breaking down,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.670
and the captive audience
of millions and millions

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.380
of people who went to the movies
every week was disappearing.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.810
But in the period
between 1949 and 1958,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.390
a much briefer period, only
23 films a year were made.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.201
They were still a significant
proportion of the Hollywood

00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:07.700
output, but you can
understand-- you

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.600
can see the tremendous decline.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.960
And then in the period between
'59 and 1980, only seven

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.120
films that could be
named musicals a year.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.399
The genre is virtually--
not exactly extinct,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.920
but it's now a specialty item.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.520
And musicals
continued to be made,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.510
but they are hardly part of
the regular fare of moviegoers.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.190
So we can think of
the musical as one

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.220
of the distinctive expressions
of the Hollywood studio era.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.190
And in their optimism and
in their-- maybe in even

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.670
in their relative reluctance
to engage directly

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.700
with political and
social questions,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.460
they express a certain value
or a certain perspective

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.790
that particularly illuminates
the remarkable entertainment

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.560
industry that Hollywood became.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.470
I want to just say a very few
words about the dominant themes

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.200
in these films.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.960
They're what you might expect
from this combination of music

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.210
and comedy.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.890
One recurring topic is the
theme of show business.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.040
Many musical films
have as their plot--

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.600
there's a kind of subgenre
of musical films devoted

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.970
to the question of
putting on a show.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.680
And the drama of this
subcategory of musicals

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.700
is you begin at the beginning
with the cast being assembled,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.180
and you watch the
difficulties, the internal

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.410
and public difficulties,
that the show

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.320
has getting on the boards.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.330
And one very common-- this
is derived, in some sense,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.570
from forms of
musical performance

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.720
that existed on Broadway
before they migrated

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.640
to Hollywood, before they
were adopted and adapted

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.125
by Hollywood.

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:50.670
And what's embedded in
this show business theme,

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.730
for example, are larger themes.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.610
And one of them is the
theme of community.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:01.520
In other words, you'll see
a very concrete and dramatic

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.490
articulation or dramatization
of these principles

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.090
in Singin' in the
Rain this evening.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.540
All of the themes I'm talking
about now you will find,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.610
I think, expressed, dramatized
with great authority and wit

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.590
in Singin' in the Rain.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.046
So the idea is that this
putting on of a show

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.670
means that you have a community
of people who have to get along

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.510
together, and what is discovered
in the tensions and problems

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.550
that begin to develop?

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.650
There are things
that have to do,

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.200
if we jump down in my
categories to the next one,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.980
not to high culture popular
but to the next one, to class

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.510
or position-- you can
see that, in some sense,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.940
the theme of community leads
also then, at least implicitly,

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.820
into an interest in the
relative questions of hierarchy,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.800
as against questions of talent.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.070
In other words, I'm
the important singer,

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.970
but my understudy
has the better voice.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.142
What's the tension there?

00:06:57.142 --> 00:06:58.350
What's going to happen there?

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.610
And you'll see how this theme,
with wonderful comic energy,

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.370
plays itself out in
Singin' in the Rain.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.320
But what I want you to recognize
as embedded in that theme

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.430
is what we-- not only
in what I'm calling

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.230
the theme of community,
or the theme of class,

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.710
social class or social
hierarchy or social position,

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.750
and the tension between
individual talent

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.260
and social position, which
repeatedly expresses itself,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.600
at least implicitly, in these
music-- what does this say?

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.630
That the musicals do
have, at some level,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.340
a kind of implicit
political subject matter,

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.510
that they're often
about democracy

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.080
or about how to get along.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.350
And in fact, during
the most recent crisis

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.045
of partisan disagreement
in Congress,

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:45.670
I was thinking, gee, if I could
send them a couple of musicals,

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.110
and if they pay
attention to them,

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.020
maybe they could get along, too.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.640
Probably too hopeful an idea.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.240
But there is a political
dimension to the drama,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.870
even to the confined drama
of putting on a show,

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.520
that some very good musicals
bring to the surface.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.390
Another central
theme is the one I

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.820
skipped over-- the
conflict, often a tension

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.700
or a conflict between
high and popular culture,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.530
with Hollywood and
the musical film

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.900
almost always standing on
the side of the popular as

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.990
against the moribund and
pretentiously sclerotic,

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.970
old-fashioned older forms.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.610
And they often create a kind
of cartoon of the older forms

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.540
in order to celebrate
their own energy.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.690
But this tension is a
recurring one in musicals,

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.289
and you'll see versions
of these themes

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:40.190
in both the musicals that are
on our roster for this evening.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.340
Finally, implicit in
what I've been saying

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.600
is the theme of
convention and restraint

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.980
versus spontaneity, energy, what
we think of as "the natural."

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.610
And I'll say more
about this tonight

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.740
when we talk about the
dance sequences in Singin'

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.470
in the Rain.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.550
But at the moment,
just let me emphasize

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.040
the extent to which this
principle of a kind of conflict

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.320
between what is handed
down, what is conventional,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.260
what is expected
and what is dictated

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.770
by your spontaneous needs,
desires, a sense of joy

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.920
is a constant source
of tension and energy

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.450
in many, many
musicals and is one

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.120
of the central organizing
principles of Singin'

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.830
in the Rain.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.520
And we'll come back
to that tonight

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.090
when I talk more
fully about that film.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.990
Well, what I'd like
to do with the time

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.710
I have left is try to
illustrate in a certain way two

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.110
different things.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.380
And they're partly in conflict,
and therefore, in some sense,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.660
I'm simplifying, but it's an
intellectually justifiable

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.930
simplification.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.180
What I want to do
simultaneously is give you

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.310
a kind of brief sense of
the history of the musical

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.080
but also a sense of
the different flavors

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.590
within the broad category of the
musical that might be possible.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.050
This is obviously an impossible
task in 30 minutes or so,

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.850
but we're going to
accomplish it anyway

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:05.530
in a very reduced and
crystallized way, I think.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.400
As you might imagine, the
central impetus for the musical

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.120
occurred technologically
with the advent of sound.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.920
As soon as sound became
possible, people were thinking,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.780
ah, we can sing in the movies.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.680
Music is going to be
important in the movies.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.460
And of course, that
was in fact the case.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.590
The very first sound film, The
Jazz Singer, was about singing.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.960
It had ten interpolated
songs in it

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.030
and only two lines of dialogue.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.780
In it, Al Jolson, the
famous blackface performer,

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.740
played a performer in blackface,
a Jew actually, a white man,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:46.780
who played a black,
most famously, on stage.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.620
In this particular film,
he plays a religious

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.220
family's-- the son of
a religious family,

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.310
of a Jewish family,
who wants to sing jazz,

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.510
not to be a cantor
in the synagogue.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.070
And his father's
very angry at him

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.520
because he thinks he's
betraying-- and can you

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.100
see embedded there is the
theme of, in a certain sense,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.900
high religious culture
versus popular culture?

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.830
In the very first film
that interpolated music,

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.930
that theme is already present.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:18.620
And in 1928, Jolson
again appeared

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.260
in a film called The Singing
Fool that made a great success.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.310
And what then followed in
1929 were a whole series

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.640
of musical films, of films
that incorporated music,

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.440
including, in 1929, a film
called The Broadway Melody

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.350
of 1929.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.660
And it contained
a backstage story,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.160
like the one I've
already described,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.590
about two sisters from
vaudeville who tried to reach

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.750
Broadway and star on Broadway.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.780
And therefore, the
putting on of a show

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.010
is one of the implicit subjects.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.080
But this form of
early musical was

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.750
derived from Broadway
in a very direct way.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.022
And it often did not
have a coherent plot.

00:12:00.022 --> 00:12:05.340
It often involved a series of
singing and dancing numbers

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.950
interspersed with comic dialogue
of some kind-- literally

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.370
a revue, not a play.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.730
And then some
versions of the revue

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:20.520
began to have more systematic
plots, animated, I think,

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.050
generated by this theme
of putting on a play.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.460
And The Broadway Melody of 1929
was an astonishing success.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.290
It was partly because it was the
most fully success-- most fully

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.370
musicalized film
up to that time.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:39.980
And it was so popular, it was--
incidentally, the songs written

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.420
for it were written by
Herb Nacio Brown and Arthur

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.570
Freed, the two people who
are at the center of Singin'

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.130
in the Rain.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.060
Nacio Brown's songs are
in Singin' in the Rain,

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.960
and Arthur Freed, of course,
is the great executive producer

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.660
responsible for more of the
great musicals in the Hollywood

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.530
era than any other figure.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.670
So they begin even that
early, at the very earliest

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.640
stages of the medium's history.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.980
And so then Broadway Melody was
so popular and so successful

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.740
that in 1930, 70
new musicals were

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.190
produced, mostly in imitation.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.360
And the film won an
Oscar for Best Film.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.040
So it immediately
established musical films,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.010
films with music, song, and
singing and dancing in them

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.970
as a central category.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.190
Most early musicals were revues
of this sort, very early ones.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.480
They combined-- they
used Broadway, Hollywood,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.780
vaudeville, and radio
stars, incorporated them

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.670
in lavish musical numbers
interspersed with sketches.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.800
And again, they were not
necessarily coherent plots,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.730
and most of them
didn't even attempt

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.490
to present a coherent plot.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.990
This kind of film, more
coherently plotted,

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.140
remained a subcategory
of musicals

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.470
all the way through the
history of musicals.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.920
And that's why I want to qualify
the idea that I'm giving you

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.460
a history.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.450
I am giving you a
kind of history,

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.540
but it's a complicated
history because the forms

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.956
I'm talking about
don't completely

00:14:06.956 --> 00:14:10.250
disappear and get supplanted
by the more advanced forms.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.340
They live together
simultaneously.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.710
And the question of whether
one is a more advanced form

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.950
than another might be
debatable, although I think

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.310
there are distinctions,
as you'll see, that do

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.030
suggest that there's a kind
of progression, an increasing

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.140
understanding of
what it would mean

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.290
to make a musical film
that was truly coherent,

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.160
that wasn't simply presenting
us with the joy of song

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.380
and dance in a way unconnected
to story or character.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.310
But it remained a subcategory.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.570
This revue remained
a subcategory

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.720
of musical films all the
way through the history

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.380
of the form.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.551
And in 1946, one of the most
remarkable versions of this

00:14:54.551 --> 00:14:55.050
was made.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.800
It was called Ziegfeld Follies.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.790
And again, it was
based on-- it was

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.900
a film about-- a nostalgic film
about a Broadway phenomenon,

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.849
but it was a fully
integrated film.

00:15:05.849 --> 00:15:07.890
--of a form that was
popular in the United States

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:12.330
but even much more popular in
Europe-- the stage operetta.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.550
It wasn't a full opera.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.250
It was often a kind of
smaller comic drama that

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.642
involves singing and dancing.

00:15:18.642 --> 00:15:21.100
And they were called operettas
because they were understood

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.770
to be smaller versions of opera,
more amusing, less demanding

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.870
versions of opera, I suppose,
less pretentious and tragic

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.290
versions of opera.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.020
And there were a number
of European directors

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:40.270
who, when they immigrated
to the United States,

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.950
brought their distinctive
feel to the making

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:43.960
of early musicals.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.730
And some of the most
powerful, artistically

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.350
powerful early musicals
fell into the category

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.640
not of the revue
but of the operetta.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:57.550
And I want to show you
one version of such a film

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:02.040
now, one of my favorite passages
from the great director Rouben

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:09.590
Mamoulian in 1932, a scene from
Love Me Tonight, made in 1932.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.690
It's a long sequence.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.270
I may have to skip some of it,
but let me set it up for you.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.762
In this film, Maurice
Chevalier, whose English

00:16:17.762 --> 00:16:20.220
is so terrible that you'll have
trouble understanding him--

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.090
his French accent is
so deep at this point.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.660
He became much better at
English because, as some of you,

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.610
I hope, realize, he
became a great star

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.140
in the English-speaking
world as well as in France.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.520
But in this film-- this is
one of his earliest films,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.154
if not his first English
film, and he plays,

00:16:38.154 --> 00:16:39.570
even though he's
very well-dressed

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.200
here-- he plays a working man,
a middle class-- a tailor.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.730
He plays a tailor.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.800
And he owns a tailor
shop in Paris.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.810
And in this opening scene,
one of the men that he-- one

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.140
of the aristocrats
whose clothing he makes

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.580
comes in to be fitted out
for his wedding outfit,

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.990
and Maurice Chevalier does so.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.320
The plot of the film
depends upon the fact

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.260
that Maurice Chevalier, this
middle class tailor who's

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.819
trying to make a living
in Paris in his shop,

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.900
is brought into the ambit
of an aristocratic family,

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.880
of a royal family.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.400
And because there
is an aristocrat

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.780
for whom Maurice Chevalier has
made a great many suits who

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.859
owes him money, and
Maurice chases him

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.640
to his castle in the
country, trying to find,

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.450
trying to recover his money, and
romantic entanglements ensue.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.400
And the larger part of the film
actually involves a romance

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.300
across social class between
this Parisian tailor

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.600
and a princess played by
Jeanette MacDonald, one

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.400
of the great musical
stars of the studio era.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.919
So here is a scene from very
early in Love Me Tonight.

Kiddies are romantic--

00:19:33.102 --> 00:19:35.060
DAVID THORBURN: Would
you freeze it one second?

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.099
Very quick observation.

00:19:36.099 --> 00:19:37.640
I can't interrupt
too often because I

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.473
have a lot of clips to
show you, and they're

00:19:39.473 --> 00:19:41.670
more important
than my commentary.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.200
But let me remind you that
even at this very early stage

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.050
in the history of
the musical, look at

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:51.640
how visually
sophisticated Mamoulian,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.350
and pay attention as the
film, as the sequence goes on.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.820
But look at how he's working
with the mirrors here

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.429
and how it's
doubling-- what it does

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:01.220
to your sense of
perspective and your sense

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.650
of the environment of the shot.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:06.280
This is a visually
sophisticated, very thoughtful,

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.667
artistically manipulated camera,
and it's Mamoulian's work.

00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:11.500
So very early in the
history of the musical,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.078
we're already getting
visually subtle effects.

00:20:15.078 --> 00:20:18.072
-(SINGING)-- we'll
have a troupe.

00:20:18.072 --> 00:20:21.066
We'll help the population.

00:20:21.066 --> 00:20:26.056
It's a duty that
we owe to France.

00:20:26.056 --> 00:20:30.048
Isn't it romance?

00:20:30.048 --> 00:20:32.543
-Isn't it romantic?

00:20:32.543 --> 00:20:34.539
Da, da, da, da.

00:20:34.539 --> 00:20:36.535
A very catchy strain.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:39.030

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.527

Oh, thank you very much.

00:20:47.014 --> 00:20:50.008
-I better fix your tie.

00:20:50.008 --> 00:20:54.998

Can we have the lights also?

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:33.390
Thank you.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.850
All right.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.460
I hope you enjoyed
that lovely sequence.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.850
That device is called
a "pass-along song."

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.140
I've written it on the board.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.360
And I won't say
more about how witty

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.100
and wonderful the film
is, except to suggest

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.910
that apart from its wonderfully
amusing and witty qualities,

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.050
I hope you implicitly
recognized why I took the time

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.600
to describe the plot to you
because what does the music do?

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.150
What does this song do in
this early part of the film?

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.640
It predicts the plot.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.200
It predicts the story.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.480
It carries the story into the
countryside to the very castle

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.280
where the plot will take Maurice
from Paris later in the story.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.720
And not only that.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.660
What is dramatized by the
way in which this song moved

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:24.010
from tailor to aristocratic
well-dressed man to composer,

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:30.170
artist to cab driver to soldier
to gypsy to Princess Jeanette?

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:34.350
And also that it covers physical
territory as well as-- it

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.550
crosses social barriers.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.240
It crosses particular
social classes.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.000
It crosses
differences of gender.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.210
It crosses ethnic difficult--
what does it say about music?

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:47.630
Music creates community.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.980
Music is democratic.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.390
Music can overcome
barriers, which

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:55.170
is going to be ultimately the
message of the film itself.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:59.100
So it's an immensely
subtle, crystallized moment

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.640
in the film, and
it has all kinds

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.250
of powerful thematic
implications for later

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.550
in the film, apart
from the fact that it's

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.990
a wonderfully rich introduction
to the primary character

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:10.870
and to the joys of music.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.370
Reality is, however, that
until the advent in something

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:22.780
like 1933 of work
by Busby Berkeley,

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.980
the great choreographer
and director working,

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.630
at this stage, primarily for
the Warner Brothers Studio

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.760
did we begin to see forms
of the movie, forms of film,

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:39.910
forms of cinema that were
uniquely adapted to the nature

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.310
of music itself.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:48.110
That is to say, Busby Berkeley
became a legend in Hollywood

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:52.070
for the immense extravagance
and elaborateness

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.730
of his dance numbers and
of his production numbers.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.850
They were an
elaboration of something

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.620
that was popular in
the Broadway theater

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.340
before the advent of movies.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.040
But what Berkeley did was take
this tendency of the Broadway

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.340
theater and cinematize
it in a certain way.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.370
And we can get some
sense of what Berkeley

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.230
was like, what
Berkeley's work is like,

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.970
by talking about the way in
which he created a new attitude

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.500
toward film spaces.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.910
He loved to create receding
arches and doorways and even

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.450
waterfalls and to
destroy what we

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:31.000
might call "theatrical space"
by exploring the camera's powers

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.190
coupled with the power of
editing, the power of editing

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.220
now linked to rhythms of music.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.510
So he created, essentially, a
choreography for the camera.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.380
No seated audience could have
had the views and experiences

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.100
that the Busby
Berkeley production

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.630
numbers began to provide.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.830
And there's a moment in
Singin' in the Rain tonight

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.799
that explicitly recalls this
tradition of the musical.

00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:57.840
There's a moment in which
a character in the film

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.320
has a megaphone, and the
front of the megaphone

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.530
dissolves into a circle
of costumed dancers

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.450
in a sequence called
"Beautiful Girls."

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.060
That's the name of the number.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.800
And that whole number is an
homage to this Busby Berkeley

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.590
tradition.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.230
Well, there were
certain disadvantages

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.560
to the Berkeley strategy.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.720
One of them was that especially
in the extremity with which he

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.090
began to pursue his
expressive aims,

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.820
he began to sort of
dematerialize his women.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.370
He began to objectify them.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.280
And many of his films, many
of his production numbers,

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.300
literally objectify parts of
a woman's body, especially

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.290
breasts and bottom and legs.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:44.180
And there's almost, in a certain
sense, a kind of dehumanizing

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.100
impulse in which the
human figures, especially

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.830
when he used-- he
often would use cameras

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.340
that would rise very high.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.000
He invented a shot called
the "Berkeley top shot."

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.170
Often cut a hole in the
ceiling of the places

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.420
in which they were filming
so he could move up higher.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.240
And he would film
from so far above

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.330
that the individual lineaments
of bodies would disappear,

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.860
and only the patterns
that they made appeared.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:10.820
What he anticipated was MTV and
forms of expressive filmmaking

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.540
that severs a
musical experience,

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:18.000
or an audiovisual experience
animated by music,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.586
driven by music, from subject,
from plot, from story.

00:28:21.586 --> 00:28:22.960
In other words,
there's something

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.270
in one sense very
visionary about what

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.360
Busby Berkeley was doing.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.610
But of course, he was doing
this often in the middle--

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.660
always in the
middle of films that

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.260
had stories and characters.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.740
And one of the
issues in his films

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.620
were the production numbers were
far more lavish, interesting,

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.340
and witty and
aesthetically energized

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.020
than the stories
that carried them.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.770
And in a certain
sense, the stories

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:50.040
were really the
platform to generate

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.310
these kinds of performances.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.090
So the films were not as
aesthetically coherent

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:58.250
as one would like, but they
were full of these astonishingly

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:03.130
expressive musical numbers,
audiovisual experiences.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:07.530
And let me just show you
one that will give you

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:16.870
a sense of his extravagance,
of his extremism,

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.620
in a certain sense, although
that's part of the pleasure we

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.140
take in how far he can go.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.330
There's something deeply
camp, deeply campy

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.480
about Busby Berkeley's
choreography.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.730
And he reveled, he reveled
in these kinds of gestures.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:32.820
But here is one
of the most famous

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.810
of the-- although not by far
the most extreme or ridiculous,

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.230
of these kinds of gestures
from a film Berkeley made

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:42.142
in 1933 called 42nd Street.

00:29:42.142 --> 00:29:45.550

to have you in my arms.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:23.645
I'm young, healthy,
and so are you.

00:30:23.645 --> 00:30:27.605
When the moon is in the sky,
tell me what am I to do?

00:30:27.605 --> 00:30:32.555
Say-- If I could hate
ya, I'd keep away.

00:30:32.555 --> 00:30:34.535
But that ain't my nature.

00:30:34.535 --> 00:30:37.505
I'm full of vitamin A, say!

00:30:37.505 --> 00:30:41.510
I'm young and healthy,
so let's be bold.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:46.504
In a year or two or three,
maybe we will be too old.

00:30:46.504 --> 00:30:50.995
I'm young and healthy,
and you've got charms.

00:30:50.995 --> 00:30:56.000
It'd really be a sin not
to have you in my arms.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.860
I'm young and healthy,
and so are you.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.542
When the moon is in the sky,
tell me what am I to do?

00:31:04.542 --> 00:31:08.440
If I could hate
ya, I'd keep away.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.440
But that ain't my nature.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.992
I'm full of vitamin A, say!

00:31:12.992 --> 00:31:17.320
I'm young and healthy,
so let's be bold.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:22.170
In a year or two or three,
maybe we will be too old.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:26.445
-I'm young and healthy,
and you've got charms.

00:31:26.445 --> 00:31:30.736
It would really be a sin not
to have you in my arms, dadum.

00:31:30.736 --> 00:31:35.170
-I'm young and healthy,
and so are you.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:39.640
When the moon is in the sky,
tell me what am I to do?

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.592
-If I could hate you,
honey, I'd keep away.

00:31:43.592 --> 00:31:45.568
But that ain't my nature.

00:31:45.568 --> 00:31:51.002
I'm full of vitamin A. Whoa--
I'm young and healthy, so let's

00:31:51.002 --> 00:31:52.484
be bold.

00:31:52.484 --> 00:31:55.942
In a year or two or three,
maybe we will be too old.

00:32:56.183 --> 00:32:57.766
DAVID THORBURN: The
Berkeley top shot.

00:32:57.766 --> 00:33:01.259
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:14.233 --> 00:33:16.800
See how he's moved to a
kind of abstraction here?

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:26.129
-If I could hate
ya, I'd keep away.

00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:27.602
But that ain't my nature.

00:33:27.602 --> 00:33:30.057
I'm full of vitamin A, say!

00:33:30.057 --> 00:33:33.985
I'm young and healthy,
so let's be bold.

00:33:33.985 --> 00:33:40.317
In a year or two or three,
maybe we will be too old.

00:33:40.317 --> 00:33:40.900
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.610
DAVID THORBURN: You
think there might

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.310
be something almost grotesque
about those final images?

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:47.110
On the other hand,
can you also see how

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:50.850
in a system that is censored,
in which women are not

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.290
allowed to be seen on
a bed without one foot

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.320
at least on the
floor, in which there

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.480
is a kind of sexual energy
and a kind of testing

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:07.009
of boundaries running through
this kind of display as well.

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:08.550
We're running out
of time, and I have

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.469
another even more
magnificent sequence

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:14.310
to show you to finish
out this attempt

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:17.090
to give you at least a quick
flavor of the varieties

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.389
of experience available
in the musical

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.690
before we look at a fully
integrated musical this evening

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:23.889
with Singin' in the Rain.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:27.230
Let me say very quickly
then, to jump to the bottom,

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:31.550
the final aspect of this is what
Arthur Freed and his cohorts

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:35.960
articulated as the idea of a
musical that would integrate

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.570
sufficiently music and dance
with character and story

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:42.070
in a way that would be coherent.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:45.530
And the musicals made under
Arthur Freed's direction, often

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.409
called the "Freed
Unit" at MGM, tried

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:50.550
to satisfy this criterion.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.929
They were, in many
ways, more coherent

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.630
in terms of the relation
between the singing

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:58.490
and the dancing and the story
than these earlier forms

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.940
were, although they were
often less imaginatively

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:04.660
expressive in some cases,
although this is not true,

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.180
I think, of Singin' in the Rain.

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.330
But there is another stage to
mention in this development

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.700
or evolution, and it's
one of the most important

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.580
in the history of the
Hollywood musical.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.880
And it has to do with the
partnership between Fred

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.950
Astaire and Ginger Rogers,
mostly at the RKO studios.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:27.800
They made nine films together
between 1933 in 1939 at RKO.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.600
And they introduced
another element

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.490
into the musical film
that is then, I think,

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:38.720
incorporated in a certain degree
in the so-called integrated

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.910
musical of MGM.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.010
So my last example
this afternoon

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.650
comes from the
great Astaire-Rogers

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:47.280
musical, Top Hat.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.420
And let me set
the stage for you.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.590
Get ready to show it because
we're running out of time.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:55.460
The situation is this--
and it dramatizes even more

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.120
fully the idea that there are
potentially sexual tensions,

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.940
sexual themes embedded in the
experience of watching a song

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.590
and dance musical.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.580
What the Astaire-Rogers
musicals brought

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.880
to the table that had
not been there before

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.960
was, in some sense, a kind
of psychological element.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.900
Even though in the
Astaire-Rogers films,

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.390
the singing and
dancing was still

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.270
in some sense much more central
to the film than the rest

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:25.930
of the story, and the stories
were often thin, what they did

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.484
introduce was an individuation.

00:36:28.484 --> 00:36:29.900
In the Busby
Berkeley numbers, you

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.480
can see the women are--
all the characters in fact

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.500
are-- hard to differentiate
from the backdrop

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.390
or from the curtains.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.050
They are objectified
in a certain way.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.890
Especially when he
gets going, they

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:44.070
become parts of an
abstract pattern.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:48.270
In the Astaire-Rogers films,
Astaire and Roger's characters

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.330
are deeply, sharply
individuated,

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.560
and certain kinds of
psychological themes

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.699
begin to enter in.

00:36:53.699 --> 00:36:55.240
In this clip you're
going to see now,

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.640
a fairly characteristic one and
probably the single most famous

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.770
dance number in the
history of the studio era,

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:05.660
a dance number based on
the song "Cheek to Cheek,"

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:11.370
danced by Astaire and
Rogers-- in this sequence,

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:14.000
we are in a setting that's
worth mentioning to you.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.940
We're on board a cruise ship.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.660
Wealthy Americans are there.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.700
It's wealthy
people, aristocrats.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:26.490
The Astaire and Rogers
characters have met earlier,

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.760
and they haven't
really hit it off.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.580
And the Rogers
character, the woman,

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:37.800
thinks that Fred Astaire is an
immoral man, that he commits

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.390
infidelities against his wife.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.840
And she's under the
mistaken impression

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.800
that the woman he's
with is his wife.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.840
So what happens in the
sequence, essentially,

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.750
is that in front of what
she believes to be his wife,

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.660
he asks her to dance-- he
asks Rogers to dance with her,

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:57.200
and then, to her surprise,
Astaire's apparent wife

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.080
says, oh, go ahead.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.630
I'd love to see
you two together.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:04.280
And she says, well, I'm--
and so when the dance begins,

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.800
she's sort of resistant.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.610
She thinking, ah,
this is disgus--

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.896
and she goes along
with it, but she

00:38:09.896 --> 00:38:11.520
feels there's something
wrong about it.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.080
And then as the
dance goes on, you

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.850
can see her resistance
begin to break down.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.010
And you can see the dance
becoming more and more mutual.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:22.710
And you can see her enthusiasm
for the dance increase.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:25.720
And think about what
the dance, first

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.230
of all, how profound
and brilliant this dance

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:33.440
is as an embodiment of
mutuality and collaboration

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.060
because one of the reasons
Rogers was so remarkable

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.230
was that she was
capable of dancing

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.710
at the same complex, astonishing
level as Fred Astaire himself.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:47.000
And it's an image of mutuality
and of collaborative artistry

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.270
that's very remarkable.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.340
But it's also a
metaphor for other kinds

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.990
of mutual interactions
that are physical.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:56.040
And I hope you will pay
attention to that subtext

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.750
as you're watching this
remarkable sequence.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:04.140
The fact that Rogers begins in
an act-- hostilely, resistant,

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.900
and yields slowly is a key
to the energy we see here.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.432
OK.

00:39:09.432 --> 00:39:10.815
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:13.532
-Nice to see you
again, Miss Tremont.

00:39:13.532 --> 00:39:14.782
DAVID THORBURN: Ginger Rogers.

00:39:14.782 --> 00:39:16.168
-You've robbed me
of the pleasure

00:39:16.168 --> 00:39:17.554
of introducing you two.

00:39:17.554 --> 00:39:19.529
You've already met.

00:39:19.529 --> 00:39:22.070
DAVID THORBURN: Now, remember,
Ginger is mistaken about this.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:23.784
Fred's not really
married to her.

00:39:23.784 --> 00:39:25.700
And of course that's a
typical Hollywood trick

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.760
because we're able
to enjoy the [FRENCH]

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.420
of infidelity and of the idea
of straying from your wife,

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.600
but it isn't really true.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:37.913
-I don't know what
I'd do without her.

00:39:37.913 --> 00:39:39.390
-Oh, that's sweet
of you, darling.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.200
But you two run along and
dance, and don't give me

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:41.866
another thought.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.696
-That's what I'm afraid of.

00:39:54.326 --> 00:39:57.120
I think Madge is a
very brave person.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.120
-Yes, I have tremendous
admiration for her.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.980
DAVID THORBURN: You see
how the misunderstanding

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:14.886
adds tremendous sexual
energy, wit to the scene.

00:40:14.886 --> 00:40:17.655
-Well, if Madge doesn't
care, I certainly don't.

00:40:17.655 --> 00:40:21.060
-Neither do I. All I
know is that it's--

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.560
(SINGING) heaven.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.370
I'm in heaven.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:32.740
And my heart beats so
that I can hardly speak.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:36.730
And I seem to find
the happiness I

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:43.660
seek when we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:49.455
Heaven, I'm in heaven.

00:40:49.455 --> 00:40:51.580
DAVID THORBURN: Kristen,
can you put the sound off?

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.304
And pay attention--
[INAUDIBLE] I'm

00:40:54.304 --> 00:40:55.970
going to do the
terrible damage to this.

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:57.960
Keep watching as I'm
talking, and imagine you

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.267
hearing the song, all right?

00:40:59.267 --> 00:41:00.850
But because we're
running out of time,

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.310
I don't want to lose
our energy, and I

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.476
don't want to keep you over.

00:41:03.476 --> 00:41:04.606
So this dance continues.

00:41:04.606 --> 00:41:06.355
As you'll see, it's
quite a long sequence,

00:41:06.355 --> 00:41:08.649
and he's singing to
her in his weedy--

00:41:08.649 --> 00:41:10.190
really not a very
good singer, is he?

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.480
It doesn't seem to matter.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.810
But one of the things
you should watch

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:15.920
is the way they move
out of a crowded space

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.510
into a more private space and
how the intimacy of their--

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:23.640
and how the dance partly
stops for a moment.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.930
Then it resumes.

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:29.640
And they move-- as you'll
see in the sequence,

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:34.120
they move into a space that's
completely private, and her--

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.320
and if you watch
her expression, you

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.910
can also see that she's
beginning to yield,

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:42.420
that she's beginning
to become enthusiastic.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:42.950
OK.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:44.270
Put the sound back on.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:49.198
-(SINGING) --charm about
you will carry me through

00:41:49.198 --> 00:41:52.154
to heaven.

00:41:52.154 --> 00:41:55.528
I'm in heaven.

00:41:55.528 --> 00:42:02.416
And my heart beats so
that I can hardly speak.

00:42:02.416 --> 00:42:06.400
And I seem to find
the happiness I

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:13.140
seek when we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.230
DAVID THORBURN: --the
sound for a second.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.700
My final comment--
we're coming to

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.110
near the end of this sequence,
although it will extend.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.620
I want you to hear
the music, too.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:57.470
But watch especially the way
the intensity of this picks up

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.320
and then subsides.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.900
Ask yourself what rhythms
are being implicitly

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.160
dramatized here and then
why, at the very end,

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.930
it's time for a cigarette.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:07.802
OK.

00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:11.098
