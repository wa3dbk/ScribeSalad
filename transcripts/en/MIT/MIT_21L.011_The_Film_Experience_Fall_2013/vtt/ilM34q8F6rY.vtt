00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.870
DAVID THORBURN: The aesthetic
of connection, this aesthetic

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.800
of familiarity, this
popular aesthetic operated

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.490
in Hollywood movies.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.960
And I want to expand
a bit on this idea

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.430
by talking about
more explicitly what

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.130
might be called an
anthropological view

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.700
of this matter,
what could be called

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.030
the cultural work of movies.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.060
One way I can make you think
about the larger and more

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.680
significant implications
of what the movies are,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.270
of how to think
about the movies,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.830
is to ask you to think
about the true implications

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.430
of certain words that we
just take for granted.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.260
For example, take the
word entertainment

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.560
or the verb entertain,
to entertain.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.150
We think of it
as-- we think of it

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.370
as a relatively
straightforward term, as it is.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.910
And we think of entertainment
as some form of diversion

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.782
that takes us away from
the serious things in life.

00:01:16.782 --> 00:01:18.990
But I want to suggest to
you that if we look closely,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.960
even if we look at sort
of the root of the word

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.666
and the way the word is used,
and the variations on the kinds

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.540
of meanings that are
associated with the word

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.620
entertainment or the
verb to entertain,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.100
we can see deeper implications.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740
For one thing, for
example, let's just

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.340
take a standard
dictionary definition.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.150
There are three
different senses in which

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.030
almost all
dictionaries in English

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.840
would iden-- would define
the verb to entertain.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.100
They would say, to hold
the attention of someone

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.660
is to entertain them.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.350
A second meaning would be to
extend hospitality to someone.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.480
That makes sense, right?

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.350
But think when
you extend hospi--

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.020
you're engaged in a communal,
in a hostly act, right?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.770
It's an act of generosity,
an act of inclusion, right?

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.220
So forms of entertainment
are potentially

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.930
community creating, gestures
towards a community, acts

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.009
of hosting, right?

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.020
And they also, of course,
are a bid for your attention.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.530
And then there's
a third meaning,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.490
which is the most interesting.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.750
To entertain, almost
all dictionaries

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.050
will tell you also means,
to hold in the mind.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.290
I'm entertaining this idea.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.160
I'm entertaining this thought.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.460
I'm entertaining
this possibility.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.800
In other words, the word
enter-- the verb to entertain

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.460
means to meditate, to think,
to speculate, to consider

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.220
possibilities, right?

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.980
And when you attend
an entertainment

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.370
in a certain sense, that's
exactly what happens.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.610
Exactly because the
space of entertainment

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.170
is marked out by the society,
by social convention,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.680
as a place of diversion,
as a place of relaxation,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.510
as a place that is theoretically
not a place of work.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.530
Certain things are licensed
or permitted because of that,

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.590
or encouraged.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.290
Because you know
you're kicking back,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.340
it's not a serious place,
what is likely to happen?

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.650
You're allowed, or at
least by implication,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.350
or permitted to entertainment
possibilities that

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.590
in actuality might be scary
or disturbing or unacceptable.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.800
So that one of the
ironies of entertainment

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.120
is that it can become a
space, especially public forms

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.720
of entertainment in
cultures, like Shakespeare's

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.130
public theater or likely public
theater of the American movie

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.270
system in the studio
era, these public spaces

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.350
can become spaces
in which the body

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.770
politic, the political
and social community,

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.800
entertains ideas
about its own nature.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.360
Entertains, considers,
speculates, holds

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.380
in its mind accounts of its
origins, stories of its values,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.880
right?

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.080
And what we can say, then, is
that the space of entertainment

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.620
becomes from, in a certain
angle, in virtually

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.620
all societies, a
space of discourse,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.320
a space in which exactly
because it's a space recognized

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.360
as not real, as make believe,
is therefore licensed or allowed

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.370
to explore possibilities that
might be too dangerous or too

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.660
disturbing to explore
in other ways.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.370
And we can see that certain
features of the entertainment

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.560
systems of most countries
and of most societies,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.760
and certainly the
entertainment system we're

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.260
calling the Hollywood
studio movie,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.920
are systems in
which other features

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.870
of the-- other
features of the formats

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.780
and organizational
principles of the films

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.440
reinforce this idea
that you're escaping

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.510
into a space that is also
a space of exploration

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.680
and discovery.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.150
That you're not escaping and
running away exactly into forms

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.530
of diversion and hiding
from the world, but in fact,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.720
you're escaping into
a space of freedom

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.650
in which you can
consider possibilities

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.940
that might otherwise be too
disturbing to think about.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.180
And one way you can see
how the formats encourage

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.000
that comes back to
the argument I was

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.640
making about genres and stars.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.170
Because think about, one of
the most fundamental things

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.000
about the conventions
of genre are

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.870
that audiences
understand not only

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.370
sort of the costumes
and the setting

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.920
and so forth, but also
usually understand

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.130
the basic-- what do we call
it-- the basic segments, a story

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.742
force, the segmentation
of the story,

00:05:23.742 --> 00:05:26.550
the stages through which
the story is likely to go.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.200
And they're likely,
in many cases,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.820
to have a pretty good idea
about the nature of the ending

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.790
of a particular genre form.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.550
They may not be absolutely
certain about the details

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.130
of how it will
work out, but they

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.700
have some pretty good
ideas about-- for example,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.710
the notion is that
various forms of comedy

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.630
end on some sort of an
affirming or a happy note,

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.700
even if the difficulties
that are dramatized

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.430
in the text from the beginning
are very serious and troubling,

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.200
right?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.340
Not that every single comedy
ends on a totally happy note,

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.200
but that's the
expectation you have

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.610
when you come to see a comedy.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.660
You expect an adventure
with many difficulties

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.230
that are-- that will finally
be resolved in some form.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.790
And in fact, traditionally, one
of the most fundamental ways

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.702
in which comic narratives
and comic dramas are resolved

00:06:12.702 --> 00:06:13.785
is in the act of marriage.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.230
Because of course, marriage
is a kind of reconciliation

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.530
of potential opposites.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.976
It is a space of
celebration in which

00:06:22.976 --> 00:06:24.600
different families
and different groups

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.190
and, in many forms of comedy,
different social classes

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.240
are brought together.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.060
So that the marriage itself
becomes a social space that

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.300
replicates, if it's dramatized
on stage or in the movie,

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.780
it replicates in some
sense the communal space

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.290
of sharing that the
audience is engaged in when

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.160
it's watching the text, right?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.730
So you have expectations
about the characters,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.070
about the plots, about
the basic formats,

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.220
and especially about the
endings of genre forms.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.227
Now what follows from
the fact that you

00:06:56.227 --> 00:06:58.590
know that genre forms
usually end happily?

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.900
And indeed, that most--
that most Hollywood movies,

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.420
leave aside the
question of comedy,

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.680
will end on a reassuring,
or if not a happy, at least

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.250
a reassuring or a positive note.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.540
You simply know that going in.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.030
Even though that rule
is sometimes violated,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.700
it's not usually violated.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.440
And when it's
violated, it's often

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.040
violated in ways that are
instructive and interesting.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.740
But you have that expectation.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.470
Well, the expectation
that when you

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.510
get into the story,
the expectation

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.874
you have as an audience member
when you enter the story,

00:07:29.874 --> 00:07:32.290
knowing that you are going to
come to a happy ending, what

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.640
does that do?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.510
It's a form of reassurance
before you start.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.260
There are theorists of
folk tales and fairy tales

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.590
who argue that that's one of
the functions of fairy tales.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.290
That when a folktale
or a fairytale

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.010
begins, once upon a time,
many, many years ago,

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.280
in a land far away, and the
story ends, and they all

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.760
lived happily ever after,
what are the-- those

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.900
are ritualized or conventional
beginnings and endings.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.950
What do they contain?

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.970
They may contain terror.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.870
They may contain Little
Red Riding Hood being

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.120
raped or eaten alive, right?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.670
But it's OK in a certain
sense, because when

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.410
you come to the ending, you
know that you'll be reassured.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.820
So because you know that the
ending will reassure you,

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.790
it enables an
exploration of stuff

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.960
that would be scary
and frightening.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.770
There are child
psychologists, for example,

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.520
who say that one of
the important aspects

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.595
of storytelling to
children is precisely this.

00:08:24.595 --> 00:08:27.800
That the ritualized reassurance
of once upon a time and they

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.179
all lived happily ever after
are enabling conditions

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.049
that permit the
exploration, that

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.276
permit the story to
go into territories

00:08:36.276 --> 00:08:38.400
that would otherwise be
frightening and terrifying.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.108
What I'm suggesting
to you is that that's

00:08:40.108 --> 00:08:43.530
a way of understanding
adult entertainment as well.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.930
And over and over again,
the Hollywood film

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.300
will prove this principle out.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.430
It will explore disturbing
and frightening materials,

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:56.000
but in ways that are some
sense legitimated or permitted

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.320
by the very fact that it belongs
in an entertainment space,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.680
by the very fact
that it marks itself

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.120
as something that
is a diversion,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.630
a mere entertainment.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.620
But I'd like to
eliminate the word mere

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.520
because it's an inadequate and
derogatory way of describing

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.820
an experience that often
can be among the most

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.490
creative and valuable that
people in a society can have,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.330
right?

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.590
So one way then of
crystallizing all of this

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.180
is to say that the
Hollywood film for me,

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.630
in the studio era
especially, represents

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.460
a particular form of what I
would call consensus narrative.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.310
What I mean by this term is
something rather elaborate,

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.050
but I think very helpful.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.630
What I mean by the term is
this, that in most societies--

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.500
perhaps not in all,
but in most societies--

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.330
all societies have
many different sites

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.470
of storytelling, right?

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.940
People tell jokes to each other.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.160
We go to the opera.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.810
We watch-- we play
video games that

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.880
are deep forms of
narrative today, right?

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.680
So that's the coming-- probably
the new form of narrative

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.390
that's emerging in our society
today, are video games.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.860
We hear stories in theaters.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.540
We can hear stories
in popular songs.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.285
We read stories
in novels, right?

00:10:13.285 --> 00:10:14.840
There are stories all over.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.200
And in fact, we get
non-fictional stories out

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.800
of our newspapers and
from our politicians.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.350
These are usually even more
outlandish, ridiculous,

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.950
and false than the fictional
stories that we're fed,

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.320
although we often don't
recognize that, right?

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.160
So we live in a sea, an
ocean of narratives, right?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.320
All societies have many
different sites of it.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.860
But in many
societies, if not all,

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:42.740
there usually is a single site
that by general acceptance

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:48.720
or consent is recognized as the
space in which the stories that

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.470
are being told are intended
for everyone, right?

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.035
The difference between what
goes on in a wrestling match

00:10:54.035 --> 00:10:57.380
or in a baseball game, also
forms of narrative in a way,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:02.130
or in an opera or in a
theatrical piece and a movie

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.440
of the Hollywood era, or a
television program in the great

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.400
era of television before,
say, 2000 when new systems

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.990
so atomized and divided the
television system that it began

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.520
to-- it began to imitate what
happened to its ancestors,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:23.580
the films, a generation earlier,
losing its hold on the majority

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.050
of the population-- the
idea is then that the idea

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.400
of a consensus
story is the story--

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.940
it's the story form
or the story system

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.640
that the culture recognizes
as the one that reaches

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.110
the largest number of people.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.090
And that by common
agreement or consent--

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.080
not by law, but by something
much richer and larger

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.960
than that, by a kind
of communal agreement,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.550
this space is recognized as the
place in which the stories that

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.100
are told are meant to appeal to
the largest number of people,

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.970
cutting across social class,
cutting cross age and gender

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.960
differences, cutting
across ethnic differences.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.510
Virtually all societies
have some space

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.730
in which some story system
of one kind or another

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.710
that wants to appeal to
virtually everyone exists.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.550
Now it's important
to understand that I

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.970
don't mean it's a real
consensus, an authentic one.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.110
That is to say, I don't
mean that the stories that

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.630
are told there really embody the
values universally of everyone

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.360
in the society.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.490
Not at all.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.690
Because these societies are
limited in certain ways.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:22.760
They have exclusions.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.290
They have caste
structures, and so on.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.280
So the consensus
narrative in 1920

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.520
was a consensus narrative that
sort of saw African Americans

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.960
as second class citizens, right?

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.376
There was a lot
of prejudice then.

00:12:35.376 --> 00:12:37.910
Or it certainly was a
patriarchal consensus,

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.920
which assumed that women
belonged in the home,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.500
and so forth.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.800
I don't mean that the
consensus is universally

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.849
embraced by everyone.

00:12:43.849 --> 00:12:46.140
What I do mean, though, is
that everyone in the society

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.230
recognizes that this
is the consensus.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.170
And even the people
who descend from it

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.710
recognize that this is the space
in which the central values

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:59.000
of the society are articulated,
dramatized, and diffused.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.250
And what makes this
space-- these spaces--

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.620
so that another example,
I mentioned one earlier,

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.740
in Shakespeare's day, the public
theater of Shakespeare's time

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.240
was the equivalent of
what I'm saying Hollywood

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.562
was in the studio era.

00:13:11.562 --> 00:13:14.410
In the Middle Ages, it
would be the Bible, right?

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.790
The central story promulgated
through all-- virtually

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.450
everyone in the
society had-- not only

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.690
had access to the Bible,
when they went to church,

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:28.110
they received further discussion
and elaborate propaganda

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.090
about how important and central
the Bible was to their life.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.220
So the consensus
narrative system

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.807
was the one the church sustained
in the Middle Ages, right?

00:13:35.807 --> 00:13:37.390
In fact, one of the
interesting things

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.690
is to watch in Western culture
the way in which the consensus

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.600
story becomes more
and more secularized.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.740
And not only
secularized, not only

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.780
freed from religious
dispensation,

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.610
but also freed, in some
sense, in many societies

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.750
from government control.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.570
Right?

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.580
So in some societies,
there is no such freedom.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.900
So for example, the consensus
narrative in the Soviet Union

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.070
was the story that was
approved by the government.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.270
It was-- and in fact, probably
the majority of the population

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.884
dissented from that
consensus, right?

00:14:09.884 --> 00:14:11.300
So the consensus
I'm talking about

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.590
is always a
constructed one, right?

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.199
But that construction
is still interesting.

00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:18.240
And this is one of the
exam-- one of the reasons,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.920
for example, that
today people will still

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.900
scream bloody murder if
they see that on television,

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.430
the representation of minorities
or women is prejudicial.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.900
But you don't see anybody
complaining about the fact

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.140
that there are such
representations in books

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.660
or in theater any longer.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.450
And the reason for that
is that it's the consensus

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.230
system that matters to people.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.560
It's the consensus
space in which

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.890
it is assumed the
values of the society

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.440
can be challenged
or discussed, OK?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.580
So what I want to
suggest, then, is

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.410
we might think-- so we can think
of the Hollywood film then,

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.770
all Hollywood movies, as
belonging-- as participating

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.470
in the creation of what we
can call the consensus story,

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.130
the most widely shared story
about American society.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.780
And it has many sides, right?

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.770
Part of the story has to do
with how you define masculinity,

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:10.280
right?

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.230
And some of that burden
is carried in every film,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.990
but there are certain movies
like war movies or Westerns

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.590
in which masculinity, tough
guy-ness is the main issue.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.440
And then there's some--
then we could say

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.714
the norms about family life.

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:23.630
Where do they come in?

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.820
Well, more often in
comedies and in melodramas

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.300
that focus on families, right?

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.870
In other words, different
parts of the consensus

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.160
are dramatized more fully
in different genres.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.320
But all the films together
can be said broadly

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.610
to participate in a process
whereby the central values

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.770
and assumptions of the society
are rehearsed and repeated

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.160
and tested.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.180
The central fact
about this process

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.910
is that it's never finished,
just like culture itself.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.720
Culture's never a
fixed, finished thing.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.415
This is one of the deep
insights of modern sociology

00:15:58.415 --> 00:16:00.100
and anthropology.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.750
I attribute it
primarily-- specifically

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:08.250
to the great English sociologist
and historian Raymond Williams

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.570
from whom I'm borrowing
some of the ideas

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.075
on-- although the word
consensus narrative is mine,

00:16:14.075 --> 00:16:16.100
not his-- many of
these ideas are

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.161
drawn from Raymond Williams'
account of culture.

00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:21.410
What he says is essentially
that culture is constantly

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.400
making and remaking itself.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.490
That every time you watch--
think about-- some of you

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.580
can see this example more
fully with television

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.545
than with movies.

00:16:29.545 --> 00:16:31.045
Remember, the
argument of the course

00:16:31.045 --> 00:16:33.540
is that at a certain
point, sometime

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.340
in the 1950s or early
'60s, television

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.850
supplanted the movies as the
central form of narrative

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.110
in the American society.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.640
Took over the job of being
the consensus, the purveyor

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.110
of the consensus, the
purveyor of the culture's

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.494
central values.

00:16:49.494 --> 00:16:51.410
And in many ways, that
was a liberating moment

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.540
for the movies.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.830
Our course dramatizes that.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.650
This week, we're looking
at two screwball comedies

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.470
from inside the studio era.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.680
Hereafter when we
juxtapose two films,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.619
one will be from the studio era.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:08.220
One will be from the era
after the movies no longer

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.460
carry the consensus,
the responsibility

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.950
to be the consensus medium.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.609
That's been taken over by TV.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.790
And the differences
are dramatic.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.329
The differences are
stark and exciting.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:21.680
Both forms are interesting.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.450
The post-consensus forms
have great claims on us

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.589
because they're much freer.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.585
They're not limited
or constrained

00:17:28.585 --> 00:17:32.510
by what we might call the
central pieties of the culture.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.950
The most obvious way you could
see this is in nudity, right?

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.640
They can show-- attitudes--
and dirty language, right?

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.090
Think about-- you can see the
stupidity and the arbitrariness

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.880
of these systems if
you think about how

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.990
television worked today.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.540
If you put on an
American network show,

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.220
even a late night show by 10:00,
11 o'clock, at 9:00 or 10:00

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.412
a night, what you will get on
those shows-- you might get

00:17:56.412 --> 00:17:58.620
things very different from
what you would have gotten

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.540
10 or 15 years
ago, but you still

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.930
won't get full frontal nudity.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.640
You won't get women
taking off their clothes.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.100
You won't see sexual activity.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.410
You won't see very
much dirty language.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.840
You used to see none of it.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.190
But if you click the channel
one over and you go to HBO,

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.650
you could see the most
disgraceful pornography

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.140
that you can ever
imagine, right?

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.880
And you could hear people using
the F word so often that it

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.510
runs out of your ears, right?

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.730
And they're right next to
each other on the dial.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.540
What explains the difference?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.530
HBO doesn't belong to
the consensus system.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.200
The networks are still
a vestigial survival

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.072
of the old consensus system.

00:18:39.072 --> 00:18:41.280
And if you think about the
difference between network

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.975
television, even today, and the
movies or network television

00:18:44.975 --> 00:18:47.400
and what's on HBO
or Showtime, you

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.980
will see this distinction
with great clarity, right?

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.727
So one of the things
that this means

00:18:53.727 --> 00:18:55.560
is that these systems
of consensus narrative

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.680
have a tremendous
claim on our attention.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.360
They're more important,
in some sense,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.630
in a sociological or
anthropological sense

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.140
than other forms that don't
bear the burden of having

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.260
to tell the story, the
consensus story of the society.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.180
You remember I said
culture's unfinished.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.740
So are these stories, right?

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.130
The great thing about them
is that they change, right?

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.672
That over time, they'll alter.

00:19:18.672 --> 00:19:20.380
I'll come back to this
question next time

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.750
when we talk about the Western.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.090
We talk about how
the Western alters

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.330
over time in ways
that are tremendously

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.510
responsive to problems
in the outer society.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.110
A very clear example of the
way in which genre constraints

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.750
can enable an exploration
of serious subjects.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.490
So we'll return
to that next time.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.600
For our purposes tonight,
the primary point is this.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.780
What the advantage
of these consensus--

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.720
one of the advantages of
these consensus systems

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.850
is that they can review a great
deal to us about the societies

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:55.580
they serve.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.210
We can say in a certain sense
that the work or the job,

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.820
the anthropological function
of these consensus systems

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.849
is to help the society
figure out what it is.

00:20:04.849 --> 00:20:07.140
So that one of the things
that happens in these stories

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.070
is that-- and here
I'm borrowing directly

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:13.240
on Raymond Williams-- we can
think of a consensus narrative

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.160
as a discourse space, as a
space for conversation, right?

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.690
Thinking of also
remembering that genre,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.730
in one way or another,
could be thought

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:27.050
to carry some sub-category or
some sub-element of the larger

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:27.720
consensus.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.730
So masculinity and warrior
behavior, and certain forms

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.810
of honor and courage
are dramatized

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.540
in war movies and Westerns.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.890
But certain aspects
of family life

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.670
and of the relation
between siblings

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.620
and of the relationship
between parents and children

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.730
are dramatized in forms of
melodrama and comedy, right?

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:53.120
And detective stories
sometimes explore

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.990
the social and
political implications

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.970
of particular societies more
systematically and fully

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.170
than other forms.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.480
But so take it all together.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.350
The different genre
forms may be said

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.290
to lay different emphases
on the consensus,

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.430
but they all contribute
to the consensus.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.600
And one way they contribute
is by constantly showing us

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.365
fissures and disagreements.

00:21:12.365 --> 00:21:14.194
They don't all tell
the same story.

00:21:14.194 --> 00:21:15.610
What they tend
to-- and this helps

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.810
to explain why movies are often
either incoherent or partly

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.160
contradictory, right?

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.664
Movies are not simple,
stable, unitary things at all.

00:21:25.664 --> 00:21:27.830
One reason is they're made
by so many people, right?

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.320
There's no single author.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.430
There's a director,
a writer, actors.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.940
There's an army of
subsidiary people who help.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.490
Films are profoundly
collaborative form.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.000
And one of the effects of
this is that in some forms,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.880
the director's control
may be imperfect,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.390
and the star may distort the
film in some way, or take it--

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.350
or in some films, the writer
may be so powerful and so

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.570
imaginative, and the
director's relatively

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.630
weak that a different kind
of movie emerges, right?

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.130
So movies are
different in that way.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.505
And then, of
course, they're also

00:21:58.505 --> 00:22:02.140
different because they occur
at different moments in time.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.654
And those moments--
when they occur

00:22:03.654 --> 00:22:05.070
in different moments
in time, even

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.870
if they belong to
a particular genre,

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.970
they may be responsive to
later problems in the society

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.630
from ones that differ
from the problems that

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.040
may have been the case 10 years
earlier when the genre-- when

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.330
a different version of
the same genre story

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.240
would handle the
characters or the story

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.810
in a somewhat different way.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.530
So what we can say,
among other things,

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.290
is there's a tremendous
value to the idea,

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.400
to the recognition that
not only is culture

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.870
always unfinished
or always sort of

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.820
struggling to figure out
certain kinds of conflicts

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.670
and difficulties, but that
our consensus narrative

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.980
systems are also a
space that accommodates

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.420
that kind of disagreement.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.890
And one way to
conceptualize this

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.080
is to see that in
almost all films,

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.140
and certainly the
whole system, could

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.790
be said to dramatize
or give voice

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:56.020
to three different strains
or perspectives on society.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.140
One is what might be
called a traditional voice.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.400
That is to say, these
are old-fashioned ideas

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.320
that are still powerful,
but they really

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.190
belong to an older era.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.680
The second kind
of voice you hear

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.388
is what we could call
the dominant voice.

00:23:08.388 --> 00:23:10.492
That is to say,
the central values

00:23:10.492 --> 00:23:12.950
that the majority of the people
in the society now believe,

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:13.449
right?

00:23:13.449 --> 00:23:15.410
A little different
from traditional voices

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.320
that are more old-fashioned
that are becoming vestigial.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.930
And then on the other side,
emergent voices, right?

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.100
New ideas, new attitudes
that are coming through.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.350
And you can feel
this in every film.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.530
You can feel this in
every television program.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.400
If you look at American
television from the 1950s

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.270
to the 19-- say '90s-- let's
say you've restricted yourself

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:36.860
to situation comedy.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.240
What do you think you would see?

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.660
You would see a drama in which
the American family undergoes

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.180
profound change.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.180
What happens?

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.850
Women become more important,
patriarchal values

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:52.590
become less and less powerful,
children become more respected,

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:57.270
are treated less like
appendages to the family.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.950
And by the '80s and '90s,
sometimes the children

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.840
have more dominant
roles than the adults

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.552
and are often even shown to
be wiser than their parents.

00:24:05.552 --> 00:24:07.260
Something that would
have been impossible

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.150
in the early 1950s, a
more patriarchal era,

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.360
when the classic television
program about families

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:17.290
was called Father
Knows Best, right?

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.250
Whereas in later episodes,
the father not only

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.650
knows-- doesn't know
best, he knows least.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.930
Or sometimes he's
completely gone,

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.160
and it's women who are
raising the children, right?

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.390
Well, what's going
on in that process

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:34.650
has to do with the way in
which the feminist movement

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.690
and a reconfiguration
of our idea of gender,

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.360
our ideas of gender and
family-- what's happening

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.540
is the situation comedy is the
space in which those problems

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.860
are being dramatized over time.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.150
And if you juxtapose a sitcom
from the '50s and a sitcom

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.470
from the '60s, and a sitcom from
the '70s and one from the '80s,

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.710
you can actually see
that drama being enacted

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.710
in tremendously powerful ways.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.110
I choose examples
from television

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.180
because I want to choose
examples more of you

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.690
are likely to have your
own experience with.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:08.400
But I could offer such instances
from the history of movies

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.010
as well.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.220
But almost none of you would
have sufficient experience

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.620
with the movies to
understand the examples.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.750
So that's why I've chosen
examples from television.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.000
I hope some of you at least--
well, I know many of you

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.561
can't, because you didn't
grow up on American television

00:25:22.561 --> 00:25:23.060
either.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.050
But some of you at
least can get the idea

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.750
that I'm talking about here.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.810
So the notion that-- so
this is a way of explaining,

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.520
for beyond what the intentions
of any particular movie

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.910
maker or producer
would have, it's

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.950
a way of explaining
and clarifying

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.400
the profound historical and
anthropological importance

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.020
of the movies in
American society.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.170
And by implication,
in other societies

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.040
as well because the argument
applies in different ways

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.780
to those societies as well.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.230
The notion is not that
movies are unimportant today.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:00.160
But they occupy a different
niche in our consciousness

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.810
and in our daily lives than
they did in the Hollywood era,

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:06.340
in the era of the
Hollywood studios.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.480
OK.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.180
Capra and Hawks
can be said to be

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.660
two characteristic instances,
two characteristic examples

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:19.290
of really journeyman
directors from the studio era.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:22.800
I had intended-- let's put
up the other-- I actually

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.160
had intended and had planned
to give you a much more

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.480
elaborate, sort of brief
biographical accounts

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.490
of each director.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:31.130
But I don't have
time to do that.

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.340
And what I'm putting
up instead here

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.970
are just a list of
some of their films.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.950
You can see what a
journeyman Hawks was.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.580
He made very important
screwball comedies.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.330
Probably the dominant
figure in screwball comedy.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.890
Classic Westerns.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.110
I've listed some of them there.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.549
And he was also be a great
director in other genres.

00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:51.590
He worked-- it was very
interesting that he could

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.420
work across genres in this way.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:59.310
He may be the most diverse
of all the classic Hollywood

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.090
journeyman
professional directors

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:04.060
because he worked so well
across so many categories.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.395
There are recurring themes
that show up across genre

00:27:07.395 --> 00:27:09.279
in Howard Hawks' work.

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:11.320
And I'll mentioned some
of them in a little while

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.780
when I try to introduce
His Girl Friday,

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:19.200
one of his great
screwball comedies.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.020
Capra operated in
a slightly more--

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.110
a slightly narrower range.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.640
But like Hawks, he was
an immensely successful,

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.530
immensely popular
director during an era

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.000
when the studios
were essentially

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.930
operating like gigantic
factories in which the studio

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:38.140
heads where the primary bosses,
and in which each studio,

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.270
especially the five major
studios as well as many

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.900
of the smaller ones,
were essentially

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:48.350
small cities, small factory
cities for the manufacture

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.000
of movies, right?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.180
Not just that they employed
dozens, if not hundreds

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.200
of-- well, they
employed hundreds, even

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.840
thousands of workers
of different--

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.930
but they employed dozens
of writers and dozens

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:05.210
of directors, and they had
dozens of stars and actors

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.600
on contract, and they
owned great lots.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.550
And of course, they had
an army of technicians,

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.340
of grips and best boys
and camera people,

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.520
and post-production people
and publicity people,

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.500
and various other factotums
who took care of people.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:28.360
And they probably had a
more elaborate encyclopedia

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.760
of gophers than any other
industry in history.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.780
But the point is, in a
sense that each studio was

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.770
a kind of manufacturing
hub, was like

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.940
a great factory, the equivalent
of General Motors or Chrysler.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.050
But instead of making
automobiles or toasters,

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.590
they were making these things
that infiltrate our dreams.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.570
A product I think much
more powerful, disturbing,

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.425
and interesting, even than
the most remarkable automobile

00:28:54.425 --> 00:28:54.925
or toaster.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.869
Two other things I should
mention about both Capra

00:28:59.869 --> 00:29:01.660
and Hawks, because they
share this quality,

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.610
and they share it with
Hitchcock as well.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.430
They began their careers
in the silent era.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.670
They made a transition
to the sound era.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:16.270
Capra was a more successful
silent director than Hawks,

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.850
but both had experience
in the silent era.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.580
Unlike some directors,
were able to make

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.230
a very successful transition,
along-- as Hitchcock

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:27.030
also did, and became major
directors in the sound era.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.890
The other significant thing
to mention about both of them,

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.490
they both spent
time in the Army.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.490
They both kicked around.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.050
They were not sure they
were-- it wasn't as

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.100
if when they were
born they said,

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.224
I want to be a movie maker.

00:29:37.224 --> 00:29:41.380
They had all kinds of
uncertainty in their lives.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.124
They almost fell
into movie making.

00:29:44.124 --> 00:29:45.790
But there's one thing
I think all of you

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.706
will find interesting.

00:29:46.706 --> 00:29:49.160
And I love to mention
this to my MIT students.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.040
Both Capra and Howard
Hawks studied engineering.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.170
And Capra, in fact, got
an engineering degree

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.460
from the University of
Southern California.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.600
When he couldn't get work
as a mechanical engineer,

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.860
he began to cast around
for other things,

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.790
and he ended up in the movies.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.240
Howard Hawks didn't graduate,
but he studied engineering

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.304
at Cornell.

00:30:08.304 --> 00:30:09.970
I think he never
graduated from Cornell.

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.750
But he studied
engineering seriously.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.100
And I don't think it's an
accident that these directors

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.632
had engineering experience.

00:30:16.632 --> 00:30:21.340
Because there's an
organizational intelligence,

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:25.110
a practical
intelligence, even genius

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.440
that every good director--
not to say great director

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.847
needs-- that is very will served
by an engineering education.

00:30:31.847 --> 00:30:34.180
So I encourage all of you,
when you finish your degrees,

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.160
to go to Hollywood
and become directors.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.560
I won't say more
about Capra and Hawks

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.620
now except to say again
that they represented

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:46.160
a certain sense, the center of
what a Hollywood director could

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:55.640
represent in the era of
the studios, in the era

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.770
when the movies where the
dominant form of entertainment

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.116
in American society.

00:31:00.116 --> 00:31:02.490
I want to say a couple of
things about each of the movies

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.620
that you're seeing tonight,
the two different screwball

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.380
comedies.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.620
One by Hawks, one by
Capra, each representing

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.890
a characteristic tone
of each director.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.780
As I said earlier, you can think
of Capra as a slightly more--

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.730
as a somewhat more sentimental
and optimistic director.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.880
If you want a
quintessential-- a scene

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.920
that sort of distills this
sentimental populism--

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.260
a sentimental populism is a
good way of describing much

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.250
of Capra's work--
there's a scene

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:38.430
in It Happened One Night that
captures this quality in him.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.340
You can feel that-- you can
feel its optimism and perhaps

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.020
its fakery.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.002
But you want it to be
true, even though you

00:31:45.002 --> 00:31:49.480
know he may be imagining a nicer
humanity than actually exists.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:54.680
There's a scene on a bus
in It Happened One Night.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.280
A good deal of the film
or a good part of the film

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.840
takes place as
people are traveling.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.210
It's a road film,
in a certain way.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:07.312
And there's a scene on a bus,
a number of scenes on the bus.

00:32:07.312 --> 00:32:08.770
But there's one
very powerful scene

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:13.030
in which all of a sudden, after
a certain dialogue occurs,

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.690
the people on the
bus sort of rise

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:17.130
up and begin to sort of
create a little musical number

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.400
themselves.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.700
Watch how it happens.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.770
And it's almost as if
these strangers suddenly

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.250
become members of
a musical troupe,

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.540
and they begin to
interact with each other.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.670
It's a fantasy of
community that has

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:32.630
all kinds of sentimental,
affectionate assumptions in it

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.900
that is no doubt
an exaggeration,

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:39.430
but it tells us something about
the sentimental populism that's

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:43.720
at the heart of Frank
Capra's vision of life.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.460
Let me say quickly a couple
of words about each film now.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.230
It Happened One Night is not
the first screwball comedy,

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.640
but is the film that
established screwball comedy

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.550
as a dominant genre.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.270
There are films going
back probably to 1930,

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.530
if not earlier, that
could be identified

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:01.840
as screwball comedies.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.500
And there are certainly
films-- full screwball comedies

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.440
that existed before
It Happened One Night.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.570
But the success of It Happened
One Night nailed the genre,

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.600
made the genre a popular one.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.240
And I want to mention a
couple of production notes

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.700
that are kind of interesting.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.940
One of them is this.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.660
Both the stars in It Happened
One Night, Claudette Colbert

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:29.770
and Clark Gable, had had
significant careers before they

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.000
came to make It
Happened One Night.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.270
Gable had been in movies
for over a decade.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.210
He'd been in a whole
number of films.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.530
But he was a second
rate-- a secondary player.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.760
And he was a difficult man.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.270
He was resisting assignments
that he was being--

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:46.310
he was under contract
to the MGM Studio,

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.940
which was the most elaborate
and wealthy of all the studios.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.820
And the head of
MGM, Samuel Goldwyn,

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:56.605
was annoyed with Gable,
because he was uncooperative.

00:33:56.605 --> 00:33:58.730
They were sending him
scripts he didn't want to do,

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.438
even though he was
under contract to them

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.530
and theoretically had to
do what they told him.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:06.310
And because he annoyed
Goldwyn, Goldwyn

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.880
decided to discipline him.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.650
And the way he disciplined
him is we said, all right.

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:13.800
I'm assigning you to Frank Capra
who works for Columbia Studios.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.909
You have to make a film
that he's working on.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:16.723
You have no choice.

00:34:16.723 --> 00:34:17.889
You're under contract to me.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.480
Gable was incredibly
angry about this.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.370
One of the reasons is Colombia
was not a major studio.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.130
It was a low-budget studio.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:28.709
Capra was not yet a
widely known director,

00:34:28.709 --> 00:34:31.000
even though he had been
directing since the silent era.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.590
Gable felt that he was
being imposed upon.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.980
He was very reluctant
and angry about the job.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.420
The star, the female
star, Claudette Colbert,

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.000
was also reluctant
to take the job.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.745
She had been in--
she was a stage star,

00:34:42.745 --> 00:34:44.969
and she had been
successful on Broadway.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:46.973
But she'd had a checkered
career in the movies,

00:34:46.973 --> 00:34:48.139
some bad luck in the movies.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:49.650
She'd made a film
that was panned.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.920
She was very reluctant
to make any more movies.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.770
And when she was
asked, she resisted.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.090
And she finally agreed only
when they doubled her fee.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.140
She normally would get
$25,000 for a film.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.860
This time she got $50,000.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.600
But even when she accepted
this, she still was reluctant.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.720
She said, OK.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.580
I will do this, but I
have to be free to go

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.110
to spend Christmas with
my friends and family

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.310
in Palm Beach.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:14.670
The shooting has to stop
no-- I will not work

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:18.220
late-- longer than December 23.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:22.240
And so they had four very
intense weeks of shooting

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.130
in which they-- in which
they did their best

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.360
to finish the film.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.090
And they didn't quite finish it.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.440
But Claudette walked off
the set and said, I'm done.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.400
My contract-- I fulfilled
my contract, and she left.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.450
Capra hadn't yet filmed the
final scene of the film.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:39.800
When you watch the brilliant
final scene of the film, which

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.940
Capra had to do
without his stars

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.010
because Colbert had
walked off the set,

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:46.810
you will see a
magnificent example

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:50.330
of what we might call necessity
being the mother of invention.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.470
Because it's a
brilliant, rich scene,

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.036
but he had to do it because he
didn't have his actress there

00:35:55.036 --> 00:35:56.160
in order to make the scene.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.760
So watch for it
when you come to it.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.660
Another point about-- when
Colbert left the film,

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.160
she was said to say
to friends, I've

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.618
just completed--
I've just finished

00:36:04.618 --> 00:36:06.310
the worst movie of my life.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.819
This is a horrible film.

00:36:07.819 --> 00:36:09.610
Gable was angry about
the film, and thought

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.610
it was a piece of garbage.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.720
In the advent, the
film was the first film

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.570
to win Academy Awards
in every major category.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.030
It won for best film.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:22.770
It won for best actor, best
actress, best director, best

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:23.620
screenplay.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.090
It was the first film to notch
all five victories, right?

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.250
Like, it's better than a
hat trick in hockey, right?

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.810
Like a perfect game
for a pitcher, right?

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:36.320
The best-- very few films
have ever done this.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.240
And it turned every one of the
major participants in the film

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.190
into major Hollywood players.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:46.380
After this film,
Gable became what--

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.080
came to be known as
the King of Hollywood.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.520
And for a decade and a half,
he was the top-grossing actor

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.080
in Hollywood.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.870
And all of his great work
follows after this film.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.370
He was in a series of
classic Hollywood films

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:02.550
to the very end of his
life in his last film

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.560
with Marilyn Monroe.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.070
Anyone know what it--
written by Arthur Miller?

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.380
A film called The Misfits,
his very last film.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.130
He was dying when he
was making that film.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:12.459
It's very moving film.

00:37:12.459 --> 00:37:14.500
You can see that he's
dying of cancer in the film

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.410
if you look closely.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.960
But he had a magnificent career.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.570
He was one of the
characteristic,

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:23.510
central, iconic actors
of the studio era.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.695
And this is the
film that made him.

00:37:25.695 --> 00:37:27.070
There's a moment
in the film when

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:31.470
you see Gable and
Colbert discussing--

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.320
they're forced to
share a motel room,

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.940
and this is very
risque in the 1930s.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.720
Man and woman together,
unmarried in the same room.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.940
And in fact, they
have separate beds,

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.360
but it's a very small room.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.500
And she's nervous about it.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.435
And one of the
things he does is he

00:37:48.435 --> 00:37:51.020
puts up a line across the
room of, like, a clothesline,

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.100
throws a blanket over
it, and he says, OK.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.040
We'll stay on either side
of the wall of Jericho.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.200
And you'll see how
the wall of Jericho

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.380
works out in the final
scene when it comes down.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:06.500
And there are moments where
you could see the Colbert

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.380
character very nervous about
the fact that she's alone

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.060
with a strange man in a motel
room, and she's at his mercy,

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:12.740
in some sense.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.010
And there is a kind of
[INAUDIBLE] about this.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:17.680
And there's a moment where we
see them getting ready for bed.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.760
Gable takes off his shirt, and
he's not wearing an undershirt.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.520
He's only wearing
an outer shirt.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.760
And it is said-- it
has been said so often

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.440
I can't resist
mentioning this to you,

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.034
even though I can't
confirm it absolutely.

00:38:29.034 --> 00:38:30.950
But it's mentioned so
often in the scholarship

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.060
that I want it to be true.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.090
It is said that the sales
of undershirts in the United

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.540
States plummeted after
it was discovered

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.342
that this actor wasn't
wearing an undershirt.

00:38:42.342 --> 00:38:46.100
(GRUFF VOICE) Because
that's what men do, OK?

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.140
But there is a larger
context for the film.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.440
The film takes place
during the Depression.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.550
And even though it's a comic
film about two apparently

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.750
mismatched creatures who will
come together in the end-- can

00:38:56.750 --> 00:39:00.180
you guess from the
scene in Ball of Fire

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.452
what's going to happen to Gary
Cooper and that sexy woman

00:39:04.452 --> 00:39:05.410
by the end of the film?

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.740
Of course you know, don't you?

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.180
Why do you know it without
ever having seen the film?

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.240
Because that's what
comedy does, right?

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.250
The conventions
of comedy do that.

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.504
And part of the pleasure
in watching that is to say,

00:39:15.504 --> 00:39:16.670
look how different they are.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.370
Look how frightened he is.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.626
Look how aggressive she is.

00:39:19.626 --> 00:39:21.000
How could they
ever get together?

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.600
But of course you
know that they will.

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.475
And part of the pleasure
in watching the film

00:39:24.475 --> 00:39:26.396
is watching them get
over those barriers.

00:39:26.396 --> 00:39:29.020
Well, the same thing happens, as
you'll see, in tonight's film.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.930
But the gap between the Gable
character and the Colbert

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.470
character is not just
gender male and female.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.040
It's also a class difference.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.807
She belongs to
the upper classes.

00:39:37.807 --> 00:39:39.890
She has no experience with
the outer world at all.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:42.720
She's lived an incredibly
protected life.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.530
So that when she comes
to terms with Gable,

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:50.080
she's coming to terms not
only with certain inherited

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.660
forms of class prejudice.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.920
She's also overcoming a certain
kind of innocence and naivete

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.370
about her relationship to men,
and her relationship maybe even

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.920
to her own sexuality.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.100
So the film is a bildungsroman.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.680
You know that word?

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.970
Novel about growing up?

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:10.230
About this woman who lived
a very-- lives a very

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.870
sheltered life.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:12.600
She's a very spoiled rich girl.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.760
And the drama of the
film is she becomes,

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.700
in a certain sense, begins to
discover her own real nature,

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.070
begins to discover
something about her own--

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.490
about her own character
and about her own capacity

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.830
to judge the outer world.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:28.770
She's very limited
and foolish earlier.

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:31.020
The context of the film,
then, is a dramatization

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.330
of this relationship.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.670
But the background of the
film is the Depression.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:38.830
And as you'll see, this
sexual and marital adventure,

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:43.340
this comedy of marriage,
or eventual marriage,

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.960
takes place against a backdrop
of suffering and unhappiness

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.100
and misery.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:52.440
And it imparts a resonance
and an importance to the film

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.850
that it wouldn't otherwise have.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.150
Because there are scenes
in these trailer homes

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.880
where the Colbert character,
completely unused to having

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.050
to live a life like
that of ordinary people,

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:04.735
is suddenly forced to confront
what such lives are-- what

00:41:04.735 --> 00:41:09.400
such a life is like, and
it's part of her education.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.090
So the context of the
Depression is important.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.060
A second fundamental
thing, as I've already

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.330
implied by my anecdote
about the undershirt,

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.500
is that the Gable
character came to stand

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.360
for an ideal of
American masculinity.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.114
In the scene where he is first
introduced, he's half drunk.

00:41:25.114 --> 00:41:27.530
And it's important for you to
understand the context here,

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:30.140
because it's not exactly
celebrating drunkenness.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.290
Although it partly is, I
mean, he's a man's man, right?

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.590
We see him get drunk and
talk on the telephone

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.340
to his editor boss,
who fires him, right?

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.352
And he staggers out
of the phone booth,

00:41:40.352 --> 00:41:42.810
and he's talking to his friends,
and he says, I'm the king.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:45.470
This is where the word-- where
the term the King of Hollywood

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.051
originates, in the lines
that you see in the film.

00:41:49.051 --> 00:41:51.550
But it's important for you to
understand that part of what's

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.950
going on here-- it's 1934.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.819
Prohibition has just
been lifted, right?

00:41:56.819 --> 00:41:59.110
And what's being dramatized
there, it's illegal for him

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:02.100
to drink for the first time
in whatever it is, a decade.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.357
And the film is partly
celebrating that, right?

00:42:04.357 --> 00:42:05.940
So you're not supposed
to think of him

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.362
as some ridiculous
roustabout drunkard.

00:42:08.362 --> 00:42:10.320
You're supposed to
recognize that what's partly

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.110
being dramatized there
is the new freedom that

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:17.170
has emerged in American
society now that Prohibition

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.970
has been repealed.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.580
And in that scene you
can see something--

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:27.582
because his half drunkenness, we
do see some of his inhibitions.

00:42:27.582 --> 00:42:29.540
You can see something of
his true nature there.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.392
And what you
discover is-- and you

00:42:31.392 --> 00:42:33.850
can see this come out elsewhere
in the film too-- something

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.880
that the Colbert character
at first can't recognize.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.740
That he has a heart
of gold, that he's

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.450
a decent, admirable
person, that he would never

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:42.610
treat anyone badly.

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:44.690
But he's also very
self-reliant, and no one

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:46.020
can push them around.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.750
He's a particular kind of--
represents a particular kind

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:50.550
of masculine ideal, right?

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.780
He can't be intimidated, but
he'll never mistreat someone.

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.420
He has a kind of moral compass
that guides his behavior, even

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.520
though it's implicit, right?

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.900
He's a bit vulgar.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.250
He's suspicious of
wealth and pretension.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.900
The Gable character
came to stand

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.940
for a particular kind
of American masculinity

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:13.880
that was celebrated over and
over again in American movies,

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.392
a kind of-- a type
of the American male.

00:43:16.392 --> 00:43:18.850
I've already said that one of
the things the film does also

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.937
is dramatize a romance
across social class.

00:43:21.937 --> 00:43:24.020
And you might want to think
about the way in which

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:28.670
the-- in almost all comedy,
and certainly comedies that

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:31.090
involve-- comedies
about marriage,

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:36.010
comedies about men and women,
almost all such comedies

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:40.920
involve some notion of barriers
of some sort that are placed

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:44.980
in the way of the consummation
in which the text wants to end,

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:45.480
right?

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.750
And those barriers
can take many forms.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.460
But one of the most fundamental
forms they take over and over

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.700
again is the barrier of class.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.910
And one of the things
that the Colbert character

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.070
and the Gable character
both have to do

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.690
is get over their
prejudices, get over

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:02.960
their blind spots about
the social classes they

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.600
have less understanding of.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.420
One of the most moving and
powerful aspects of the film,

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.740
and I think you'll see
this really powerfully,

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.350
is the way in which
the audience comes

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.420
to have an understanding
of the characters that

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.346
exceeds that of the characters.

00:44:17.346 --> 00:44:18.720
And that there
are many moments--

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.935
there are many moments
in the film in which you

00:44:20.935 --> 00:44:22.960
will understand how
the characters are

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.290
feeling before they are able
to acknowledge it themselves.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:28.280
You can see them falling
in love, for example,

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.550
without them being able
to admit it to themselves.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:35.250
And it's immensely-- think of
what an immensely subtle trick

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:39.330
that is, to put the viewer
in possession of information

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.860
or knowledge that the characters
themselves don't have,

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.000
and what a rich
kind of knowledge

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.180
and ironic perspective--
a rich kind of irony

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.510
that generates for the
viewing of the film.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:53.590
"A marriage of true minds" is
a famous sonnet by Shakespeare

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.550
that begins, "let me not to
the marriage of true minds

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:59.010
admit impediments."

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:03.810
The impediments to the marriage
of true minds in this film

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:10.490
have to do with the characters--
the Colbert character's naivete

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:13.860
with the prejudices and
self-reliance of the Gable

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:18.160
character, with the social
realities of the Depression.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.920
And these barriers
have to be overcome.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.720
But "a marriage of true minds,"
what could the phrase mean?

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.700
A marriage of equals,
a marriage of people

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:29.830
who are not different.

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:31.945
The deepest thing I
love about this movie,

00:45:31.945 --> 00:45:34.570
and the reason that I've come--
that I treasure this film, even

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:36.710
though there are many
old-fashioned qualities in it

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:39.540
that make it feel old and
distant, in some sense,

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:44.170
from contemporary society is
its understanding of-- it's

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:47.340
the implicit, idealized
understanding of marriage.

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.420
Because what the film
really wants to suggest

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.140
is not that-- first of all, it
suggests that these people are

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.776
drawn to each other sexually.

00:45:53.776 --> 00:45:55.650
It's not embarrassed by
the fact that they're

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.870
both physically beautiful people
and that they feel attraction

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:00.700
for each other that
they can't themselves

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.360
fully acknowledge or deal with.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.490
But the second kind of
attraction they have

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:06.880
is a mental attraction.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.790
They realize that they're both
deeply intelligent people,

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.930
that they're both people who
are deeply verbal, that they

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:17.642
both have improvisatory powers,
intellectual powers, that

00:46:17.642 --> 00:46:19.100
distinguish them
from other people.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.330
That they're made for
each other, essentially.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:22.940
There's one scene
that shows this.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.830
Before they realize
it, we realize it.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:26.396
It's a wonderful scene.

00:46:26.396 --> 00:46:27.645
They're hiding out in a motel.

00:46:27.645 --> 00:46:30.800
And at a certain point,
she's on the run.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.540
Her rich father is
searching for her.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.336
And the Gable
character's a reporter.

00:46:34.336 --> 00:46:36.710
Says, I'll protect you and
help you if you give me your--

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:38.890
if you let me have an
exclusive story, because she's

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:41.700
such a rich heiress
that she's big news.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.510
So she agrees, and he's
escorting her north,

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.620
hiding from the people who
are searching for her, right?

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.030
And at a certain point,
they're in a motel.

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:53.200
Some private cops knock
on the door of the hotel,

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.390
and they come in, and
they're searching for her.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:56.825
And watch what happens.

00:46:56.825 --> 00:46:58.610
What Gable and the
Colbert character

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.640
do is they immediate--
Gable says, follow my lead.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.580
And then when they
come in, they begin

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.320
to play husband and wife
having a tremendous quarrel.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.960
And you can watch-- you can see
that they're improvising it.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.870
And you can see
they're enjoying it.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.180
And you can see how well
they play with each other.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.054
So in other words, it's
a moment in which you

00:47:15.054 --> 00:47:17.090
can see that it is a
marriage of true minds,

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:19.490
long before the characters
themselves fully

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.874
recognize how they are
meant for each other.

00:47:21.874 --> 00:47:23.290
That's a wonderful
moment in which

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:26.290
their intimacy and there
appropriateness for each other

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:27.000
is dramatized.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.330
It's not only a physical
or a sexual thing.

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.670
It's also an intellectual
and a moral and mental thing,

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.610
a psychological thing.

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.820
They are-- it will be a
marriage of true minds

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.349
if they can come together.

00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:41.140
I want to end-- just
finally mention-- I've

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.430
mentioned the ending already.

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:45.830
And I'll just say
one more time that,

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:47.340
watch how the ending works out.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.660
And you'll see a
magnificent example

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.800
of a director dealing with
contingencies he could not

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.330
possibly have anticipated.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:59.470
And it's a wonderful example
of a kind of inventiveness.

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.610
Seems to me, the film ends
as well as it could end.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:05.120
And it's better that
the actors aren't there.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.000
But he certainly--
when this happened,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.350
I'm sure that Capra thought
it was the end of his film

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:11.850
and that he was--
didn't know what

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:13.308
he was going to do
to try to finish

00:48:13.308 --> 00:48:15.640
his film without
his star actress.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.677
I have to be even briefer
about His Girl Friday,

00:48:17.677 --> 00:48:19.510
but I think it's a more
straightforward film

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.140
in some respects.

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.850
It's a much less
sentimental film,

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:26.560
and I hope you'll recognize how
deeply-- how much more deeply,

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.330
unsentimental, even cynical,
or at least deeply tough minded

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:34.020
and suspicious, skeptical
Howard Hawks is about all

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.430
of the operations of the world.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.970
Not only about
individual human motives,

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:39.910
but about all
human institutions.

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:43.792
Virtually everyone
in His Girl Friday

00:48:43.792 --> 00:48:48.760
is a cynical,
self-seeking creep.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.440
Even the primary characters,
the Ros Russell character

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.980
and the Cary Grant
character have

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.990
intriguish, manipulative
elements in their natures.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.180
And you can see especially
that the Cary Grant

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:04.490
character is, in some respects,
a very nasty piece of work.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.180
He does terrible,
terrible things

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:09.220
to poor Ralph Bellamy, the
man that Ros Russell is

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.010
supposed to marry, her fiance.

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:14.830
He plays a sort of straight,
sweet, straightforward kind

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.490
of person, very much in
love with his girlfriend,

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.840
but completely--
how can we put it?

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.340
But he's a dummy.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.570
He's stupid.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:25.550
And even though he's very nice,
you don't really like him.

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:28.060
You think he's a jerk.

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.579
The film makes
you mean or nasty,

00:49:29.579 --> 00:49:31.120
in some sense,
because it makes you--

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.980
it makes you see things from the
perspective of the Cary Grant

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:34.750
character.

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:38.272
It encourages you to be
tough minded and skeptical.

00:49:38.272 --> 00:49:40.480
And you do come away from
the film thinking, oh, gee.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.230
I've participated
in the humiliation

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:43.570
of this poor, decent guy.

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:44.890
But anyway, he's deserved it.

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:47.290
He's such a stupid mark, right?

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.645
You can't-- you almost can't
help that kind of reaction.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.040
The film is based
on what had been

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.980
a very successful
play on Broadway,

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.150
some generation earlier.

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:02.260
And that play was made
into a film in 1930

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.970
that was quite successful,
directed by Lewis Milestone.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:09.370
But the Hawks film is the
classic version of it.

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:11.740
And Hawks does one thing
that's very important,

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.020
that changes the
original, changes

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.390
the play in a fundamental way.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:17.160
In the original
play, the character

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.170
played by the Rosalind
Russell figure in the movie

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:21.770
is a male character.

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:26.090
And the great discovery or
the great transformation

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:28.340
that was wrought in the
film by Howard Hawks

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.750
was his decision to
turn that character,

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:37.320
a guy named Johnson, from a male
Johnson into Hildegard Johnson.

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.080
Hildy, Johnson, the character
played by Rosalind Russell.

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.090
And as soon as he
turned her into a woman,

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:45.200
he created his screwball comedy.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.140
He created a wonderful
kind of antagonist

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.355
for the Cary Grant character.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:59.080
I've already indicated
to you how many films

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.832
in different genres
Hawks directed.

00:51:01.832 --> 00:51:03.540
Remember that list I
put up there was not

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.500
a complete list at all.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.100
It was a selected list.

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.460
But it was some of the
most important films

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.000
by each director.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.680
And one of the things that's
really interesting about Hawks

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.710
is that he directs Westerns
and screwball comedies

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:21.420
and private eye
films and war movies,

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:28.520
and a range of other lesser,
sort of no-genre films as well.

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.190
And yet in all of them, there
are certain throughlines.

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:33.820
You can recognize
certain recurring themes

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.840
across these radically
different films.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.600
And one of the most fun--
and one of the way-- one

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.230
the most fundamental
impulses in a Hawks

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:44.510
film, whether it's a Western
or a war movie or a screwball

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:48.420
comedy, is an impulse
to slow things-- well,

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:50.920
not to slow things down
exactly, because his dialogue is

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.030
so rapid-fire.

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:56.320
But to sort of stop the
plot, to interrupt the story

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.420
with a scene of argument.

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.140
He loves scenes of quarrel.

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.830
He loves scenes of
discussion, of talk.

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.230
He loves talk.

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:06.170
And especially, he
loves intelligent people

00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:07.810
quarreling with each other.

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.360
And there's never
been a director better

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:15.050
at eliciting from his actors
quick, rapid-fire dialogue.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:17.119
In fact, he developed a
strategy for doing this.

00:52:17.119 --> 00:52:18.785
He used to sit right
next to the camera.

00:52:18.785 --> 00:52:20.310
He didn't stand
behind the camera.

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:21.280
He had a cameraman.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.130
But he sat right
next to the camera,

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:25.900
and he had his
actors play to him,

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:29.110
only sometimes very close
to him as they were acting.

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:31.470
And if you watch, especially
some of the scenes

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:34.680
in this film, you will
see what astonishingly

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:38.430
realistic performances
he got from his actors

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:39.460
by this strategy.

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.320
He even encouraged certain
forms of improvisation.

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.175
He would run through
rehearsals first,

00:52:44.175 --> 00:52:46.300
and then he would encourage,
when he began to film,

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.940
scenes-- he would encourages
his actors to improvise

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:51.670
and to improvise to his face.

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:55.240
And he creates a kind
of electric authenticity

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.540
in his dialogue scenes that
has a tremendous authority.

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.630
So the character plot
I'm talking about

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:02.890
is this impulse to
slow the plot down

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:06.472
or to stop the plot for scenes
of argument and conversation.

00:53:06.472 --> 00:53:08.180
And what constantly
happens, whether he's

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.380
making a Western or
a screwball comedy,

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.990
is his characters
stop the action

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:14.590
and say, oh, what do you
think is going to happen next?

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:16.270
If I do this, what
will happen then?

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:18.000
As if the films
begin to generate

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.810
a kind of meta-commentary
about their own nature, right?

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:24.280
So they're incredibly
talky films,

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.580
and the dialogue is fundamental
to your-- the rapidity

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:31.920
of the dialogue is fundamental
to your understanding

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.090
of the characters and to your
understanding of the larger

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:35.960
film.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:40.435
So his central scene then is a
scene of quarreling intimacy.

00:53:40.435 --> 00:53:41.810
You feel that
they're quarreling,

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.080
but you also feel that no
people could quarrel exactly

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.560
in this way if they weren't
also intimate with each other.

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.315
And you'll see fully
how it works out

00:53:49.315 --> 00:53:51.280
when you see the film itself.

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.710
So finally, I want to
say at least a word

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:56.860
to remind you how it
actually-- although he's

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.980
tremendously entertaining line
by line and scene by scene.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.830
And never calls--
such a professional.

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:03.800
He never calls
attention to his camera.

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.130
He's a very quiet
filmmaker in that sense.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:09.250
A real journeyman,
a real professional.

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.532
He doesn't want you to think
about him or his camera.

00:54:11.532 --> 00:54:13.490
He wants you to think
about what you're seeing.

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:15.637
There are limits
to this strategy,

00:54:15.637 --> 00:54:17.303
and we'll talk about
what the limits are

00:54:17.303 --> 00:54:19.094
when we look at certain
other directors who

00:54:19.094 --> 00:54:20.060
behave in other ways.

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.476
But there are also
great strengths

00:54:21.476 --> 00:54:23.870
to this, as you'll see when
you watch tonight's film.

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:26.920
And something of his
complexity is embedded here.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.960
Because what you can
find is he creates

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.270
scenes of immense comic energy,
really generates real laughter.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.730
But beneath the
laughter, there's

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:38.720
a deep layer, a deep
substrate of cynicism,

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.770
of skepticism,
about human motives,

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:44.240
about the virtue of
human institutions,

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.270
about the capacity
of human institutions

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:50.380
and individual human beings for
corruption and misdirection.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.320
There's a kind of deep
political and social cynicism

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.960
in the film that
doubles the comedy

00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:02.180
or complicates or deepens
or roughens the comedy,

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:05.340
sours the comedy,
in a way that makes

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.740
for a particular
kind of complexity.

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.840
It's possible to argue,
which some critics have,

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:15.620
that this film, more than
any other that Hawks made,

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:20.230
combines laughter and
cynicism in unique measures.

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:24.240
And I think together, these two
films and these two directors

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.791
can mark at least a
certain pole, certain poles

00:55:28.791 --> 00:55:31.570
in the tradition of
Hollywood filmmaking,

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:34.000
and especially in the
tradition of screwball comedy.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.680
You can feel the pull toward a
kind of sentimental, affirming

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:45.320
impulse in Frank Capra,
and the pull toward a kind

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:49.700
of cynical, distanced,
complex, psychologically

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.860
deep, politically
informed laughter,

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:55.360
even mockery in Howard Hawks.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.150
And they represent two
aspects, two elements,

00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:04.350
almost poles within the larger
story of the Hollywood studio

00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:05.180
film.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.140
Enjoy the films.
