00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.570
OK.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.600
So we have-- you can show
the answer-- 57%, 1 and 3.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.060
So this is where we were
at the end of last lecture,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.370
so if you didn't get this
written down in your notes,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.424
you want to look at
these definitions.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.470
So here in this, we have
NH3 with its lone pair,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.280
and it is acting
as the Lewis base,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.150
and BF3 is acting
as the Lewis acid.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.830
So a Lewis base donates
its lone pair electrons,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.030
and the acid accepts them.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.440
So what was the
other definition?

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.350
We had the Bronsted-Lowry.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.170
Does someone want to tell
me what that definition was?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.440
Can we have a volunteer tell us
the Bronsted-Lowry definition?

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.260
Pull out your notes.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.968
There you go.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.600
AUDIENCE: So a Bronsted-Lowry--

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.170
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
I'm not sure it's on.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.490
It is on?

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.990
OK.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.520
AUDIENCE: Bronsted-Lowry
base is something that

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.040
accepts H plus or H3O plus.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.040
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.750
So the base accepts the
hydrogen ion or the proton,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.720
and the acid donates.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.740
So is this definition
now incompatible,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.720
or are they completely
opposite, or could they

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.650
be worked together?

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.336
Does anyone have
an opinion on that?

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.350
So how many people
think that these

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.690
could be consistent
definitions in some way?

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.370
OK.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.380
Oh, quite a few people.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.870
One could make that argument.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.220
So if you know now that
you can make the argument,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.765
does someone want
to try to make it?

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.880
We have a bag.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.430
All right.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.460
Our mic went away, but
can we get up over there?

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.790
So where did our mic runner go?

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.290
I should have explained
they were needed twice.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.920
All right.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.777
All right, who said
they might try this?

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:55.500
AUDIENCE: All Bronsted-Lowry
bases are Lewis spaces,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.970
but not all Lewis bases
are Bronsted-Lowry bases

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.410
because you can act as a
proxy with no hydrogen ion

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.560
if it connects directly.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.140
But if a hydrogen ion
bonds, an example H3O,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.960
to the lone pair of
oxygen, then it's

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.300
the same thing as a Lewis base.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.060
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.980
so that's right.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.190
The Lewis acid-Lewis
base definition

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.630
works if you don't
have a hydrogen

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.720
ion involved or a
proton involved,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.660
but the other still applies.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.500
So remember that when
you're accepting H plus,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.290
you're taking it
without an electron,

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.260
so the base is taking H plus,
so it's donating its electrons

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.500
to form the bond.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.700
And the acid, when
it gives up H plus,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.540
it's keeping all
of the electrons.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.190
It's accepting the electrons, so
when the acid gives up H plus,

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.210
it's accepting, and when
the base takes H plus,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.870
it's using its electrons.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:06.320
So the Lewis definitions are
lone-pair or electron-centric

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.340
definitions, whereas,
Bronsted-Lowry

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.010
is thinking about the proton,
but they both work together.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.240
So that's a good review
of the definitions

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.040
we talked about last
time, and now I'll

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.670
try to get my mic back on.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.190
All right.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.860
So today we're going to continue
talking about acid base,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.310
and we're going to continue
talking about acid base quite

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.000
a bit.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.390
So we have a number more
lectures on acid base.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.990
So we're going to start
today with the relationship

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.810
between pKw, pH,
and pOH, we're going

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.540
to talk about the strengths
of acids and bases,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.680
and then we're going to
start doing equilibrium

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.450
acid-base problems.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.170
And we're going to
do a bunch of those.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.010
And students who are
doing this and learning it

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.690
for the first time
are telling me there

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.290
is an infinite number of
different kinds of problems.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.295
It's really not true.

00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:00.670
There are only five different
types, and today hopefully,

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.310
we'll get through two of them.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.500
So first we need to
think about water

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.830
because water is a really
important solvent when

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.150
we're talking about
acid base equilibrium.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.280
And we mentioned
last time that water

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.490
can act as an acid and a base.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.070
Does anyone remember what
that's called, something that

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.520
can act as an acid and a base?

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.765
AUDIENCE: Amphoteric.

00:06:22.765 --> 00:06:24.570
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Amphoteric.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.420
So here we can think
about two waters

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.684
going to H3O plus and OH.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.100
We could also write
it out instead

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.410
of just saying two
waters, one water that's

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.570
acting as the acid and another
water is acting as a base.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.160
So the water that's acting as an
acid gives up its hydrogen ion,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.680
or proton to the base.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.840
The base accepts it
forming a conjugate acid,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.950
and this water that lost
H plus becomes OH minus.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:01.170
So water plus water, H2O plus
H2O, forms an acid and a base.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.940
So we can ask the question,
then how much water

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.600
is in a glass of water, or
how much H2O is actually

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.900
in this water container
that I have here?

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.840
So when I'm asking
that question,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.070
how much H2O in a
container of water

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.920
and if I know the delta
G0 of that process,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.530
I'm asking about what
is the relationship

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.180
between our products
here, our ionized acid

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.690
and our base over here, the
ionized products of water,

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.870
compared to water
at equilibrium.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.140
Because this container, the
water, is in equilibrium.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.770
So if I'm asking about
the ratio of products

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:50.130
to react as an equilibrium,
what am I asking about?

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.224
Just yell it out.

00:07:51.224 --> 00:07:52.140
AUDIENCE: Equilibrium.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.681
CATHERINE DRENNAN: I'm asking
about the equilibrium constant.

00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:55.340
Exactly.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.440
I'm asking what is K. What
is the equilibrium constant.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.320
So let's just briefly
review the relationship.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.560
We're given here a
delta G0, and we're

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.060
asking about K. What is
the relationship, how

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.480
do you calculate K
if you know delta G0?

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.090
And we have some equations
that will be given to you.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:18.590
Sorry.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.400
Not quite yet.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.450
There's going to be a
clicker question coming.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.640
We have some equations here.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.780
So we have delta G0 equals
minus RT natural log

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.440
of K, which we can
rearrange to solve for K.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.140
And let's just have a
little reminder of what

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.679
these terms are.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.240
So we'll put this up here.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.510
T is temperature,
and we're going

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.270
to be talking about
room temperature.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.049
This isn't room temperature now.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:45.740
And in fact, almost
all acid-based problems

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.326
are going to be at
room temperature.

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:48.700
There might be a
few differences,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.800
but we have a lot
at room temperature.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.830
We have a constant,
R, and so 8.314 joules

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:04.470
per Kelvin per mole and delta
G. So we were already told

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.470
the value for delta G here.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.710
Now, thinking about this room
temperature, this constant,

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.850
and this value for
delta G, do you

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.120
expect a large or
small value for K

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.387
if you have this delta G0 value?

00:09:19.387 --> 00:09:20.720
And that's our clicker question.

00:09:51.282 --> 00:09:52.260
All right.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.290
Let's just do 10 more seconds.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.170
Yep.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:14.320
So K, you would expect to be
a small value less than 1.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.950
And you could think
about that mathematically

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.250
from these expressions, or
you could think about it

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:25.960
in terms of the value of for
delta G. So if we solve this

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.540
and we put in our value
for delta G0, which

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.640
is a positive value--
so the forward direction

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.380
of the reaction is
non-spontaneous.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.820
So we put in our positive delta
G0 and our other values here,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.580
and this is, again, joules
per Kelvin per mole.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.830
And we have to make sure that
we convert kilojoules to jewels

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.780
and our units will cancel out.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.480
And if we do that, we get this
value for natural log of K

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.600
and this value for K of 1.0
times 10 to the minus 14th

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.080
at room temperature.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.310
And you will find
that you end up

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.610
memorizing this value if you
do enough acid-base problems.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.650
In fact, you might have
it memorized already.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.120
So this is, in
fact, a small value.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.130
And that indicates that
only a small proportion

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.410
of water molecules are ionized.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:22.900
About 1 molecule in every
200 million are ionized,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.910
so it's a very,
very small value.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.720
So there is a lot of
H2O in a glass of water.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.480
So in here it's mostly H2O.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.000
Very few molecules
are ionized in that.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.720
Now, part of the
reason why you're

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.970
likely to have this
value of K memorized

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.790
is because it has
a special name.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:50.550
This K is called Kw for water.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.640
So that's easy to remember.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.690
And Kw, the equilibrium
constant for water,

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.010
is equal to the hydronium
ion concentration

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:05.010
times the hydroxide
ion concentration.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.650
And since this is an
equilibrium constant,

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.610
if you're at constant
temperature at room

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.960
temperature, this will
always equal 1.0 times 10

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.610
to the minus 14th.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.930
This product is always going
to be this at room temperature.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.670
And that is why it's
going to turn out

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.360
to be important
because you're going

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.971
to use that information in
solving a lot of problems.

00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:28.470
All right.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.410
So if this is an
equilibrium constant,

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.010
we want to think again about
expressions for equilibrium

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.080
and just make a
note that we did not

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.610
include water squared on the
bottom of this expression.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.100
So Kw equals hydronium
ion concentration

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.530
times hydroxide
ion concentration.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.530
You don't put it over water.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.060
And the reason for this is
because this is a pretty pure

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.060
solvent, and you don't
include pure solvents

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.090
in your equilibrium expression.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.930
You also don't include solids.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.180
So we talked about that when we
were talking about solubility.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.760
So you have to remember
that solvents like water

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.820
is nearly pure, doesn't go in.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.610
Pure other liquids,
pure other solids

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.710
are not included in your
equilibrium expression.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.570
All right.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.450
So we now know about water.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.610
We know about Kw.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.850
Let's do a few more
definitions and then

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.300
think about how
all of these terms

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.320
are related to each other.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.230
So a definition that
many people already know,

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.290
probably if you've taken
any kind of science before,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.850
you're probably
aware that pH equals

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:43.040
minus log of the hydronium
ion concentration of H3O plus.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.490
If you don't know it, it will
be on your equation sheet,

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.920
so it doesn't really
matter, but there it is.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.730
And there's also pOH.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.180
pOH equals minus log
of the hydroxide ion

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.430
concentration, OH minus.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.900
Now, let's think about
the relationships

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.270
of pKw, pH, and pOH.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.930
So relationships.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.730
So I just told you
and maybe you've

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.400
already memorized
that Kw is going

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.280
to be equal to the
hydronium ion concentration

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.180
times the hydroxide
ion concentration,

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.660
and that's going to be equal to
1.0 times 10 to the minus 14th

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.850
at room temperature.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.780
So now, if we take
this expression

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.240
and we take the log
of all of these terms

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.870
and multiply by
a negative value,

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.750
then we will get
this expression.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:43.080
So minus the log of Kw is pKw.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.080
And minus log of the hydronium
ion concentration is what?

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.962
pH minus log of the hydroxide
ion concentration is what?

00:14:53.962 --> 00:14:55.378
AUDIENCE: pOH.

00:14:55.378 --> 00:14:56.480
CATHERINE DRENNAN: pOH.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:08.210
So pKw equals pH plus pOH, and
that is equal to 14.00 at room

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.270
temperature.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.470
And this is a very
useful expression,

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.130
the fact that pH and
pOH are equal to 14.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.020
If you know one of
these, then the other one

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.410
by doing a simple subtraction.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.810
So you will find yourself using
this expression quite often

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.870
in the problem sets.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.380
And so I'll say that one,
the problem set that that's

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.040
due on Friday has just a
couple of acid-based problems

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.872
at the end.

00:15:34.872 --> 00:15:40.940
The next problem set will
be 100% acid-base problems,

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:46.440
so there's a lot
to look forward to.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:51.050
So let's talk about the
strengths of acids and bases.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.230
So if you have a
pH of pure water,

00:15:55.230 --> 00:16:00.350
it should be equal to minus
log times 1.0 times 10

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.600
to the minus 7, or the pH
equals 7, which is a neutral pH.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.650
So if we have a scale here,
pH minus 1 to pH 14, 7

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.820
is a neutral value.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.270
If we're talking about
things that are acidic,

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.680
the pH of an acidic
solution is less than 7,

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.530
and so this is the
acidic part over here.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:31.660
And the pH of a basic
solution is greater than 7,

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.850
so that is down in this part.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:40.800
The EPA defines
waste as corrosive

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.750
if the pH is lower
than 3, so that

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:52.230
would be corrosive, or higher
than 12.5, also corrosive.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.420
So living creatures like to
be more in the neutral range.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:01.510
When you get to things that are
very low pH or very high pH,

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.310
that is less good.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.369
So let's now check out
a few pH's, and I'd

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:13.240
like to have five TAs come
down to help me with this.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.819
And I'll just show you
what we're going to do.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.089
So we'll have some volunteers.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:20.069
We have pH paper.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.490
The pH paper has
an indicator on.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.990
You put the paper
in the solution

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.099
and then try to see
which thing matches best.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:32.270
So this is a very quick and
dirty way to estimate pH.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.780
There's pH meters and indicator
dyes that work better,

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.840
but we'll have five people
measure five things.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.280
We have ammonia, a cleaner.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.030
We talked about the
importance of cleaning

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.270
bathrooms last lecture.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.890
We have soda.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:52.840
We have vinegar, which is
often used in salad dressings.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.790
Before I came here I just
went to a random sink

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.520
and got some MIT
water to measure.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.660
And then this, this is special.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.710
This is a prescription medicine.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:12.500
So this is a solution
of iron 2 sulfate.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.710
And this is prescribed if
have an iron deficiency.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.600
An iron deficiency is pretty
bad, and a lot of kids

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.810
have iron deficiencies.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.680
It's really common in infants.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.460
So my daughter had
an iron deficiency,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.170
and this was her medicine.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:32.260
In fact, this box is completely
full of this medicine.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.360
So kids cannot swallow
pills very easily.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.940
How many of you actually
cannot swallow a pill?

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.340
A lot of adults are
pill challenged.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.400
How many are happy
swallowing pills?

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.820
Let's do a more positive thing.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.820
OK.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.620
So swallowing pills is
not everyone's favorite.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.970
When you're a kid,
it's really impossible

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.930
to tell someone to put
something in their throat

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.400
and go back and
try to get it down.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.140
They choke, spit up, it's awful.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.440
So kids have to take
medicine in solution.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.330
So this medicine is 300
milligrams in 5 milliliters.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.620
It's very concentrated,
so my daughter

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.010
had a pretty severe
iron deficiency.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:19.030
So when she tried taking
it, and I tasted it,

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.276
it was horrific beyond belief.

00:19:21.276 --> 00:19:23.150
And after she had taken
it a couple of times,

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.900
she started to have sores on
her tongue and in her mouth.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.950
And I as a chemist said,
let's measure the pH.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:34.230
So you will measure the pH
of this prescription medicine

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:38.850
for a four-year-old and tell me
whether the EPA would prove it

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.380
or not.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.300
Anyway, so here are the TAs, and
they're going to come around.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.777
Raise your hand if you're
willing to measure a pH.

00:19:45.777 --> 00:19:46.860
TAs, just grab a solution.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.830
I should have had you pour
it, but OK, we're doing it.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:57.300
And we'll go around, and
we'll measure, and tell me

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.288
what you find, and I'll
write it on the board.

00:20:07.866 --> 00:20:08.824
Yeah, OK.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.100
All right.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.105
So we have pH.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.010
All right.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:54.898
Do we have an answer?

00:21:01.012 --> 00:21:03.532
Did we get one?

00:21:03.532 --> 00:21:04.240
What do you have?

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:04.989
AUDIENCE: Ammonia.

00:21:04.989 --> 00:21:06.610
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Ammonia is 12.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.840
So almost corrosive,
but not quite.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.210
You can still have
clean, but if you

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:24.920
want an excuse not to clean,
you're like, sorry, too close.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.210
Too Corrosive Do we
have another one?

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.190
AUDIENCE: MIT water is 7.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.729
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
MIT water is 7?

00:21:30.729 --> 00:21:31.770
AUDIENCE: MIT water is 7.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:32.920
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Awesome.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.290
So often, actually, water
that you get from a tap

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:45.370
is not 7 because often there are
ions that are dissolved in it.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.890
But a little bit around
7, a little bit of ions

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:49.700
never hurt anyone.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.725
We have lots of
ions in our body.

00:21:51.725 --> 00:21:52.225
Soda?

00:21:52.225 --> 00:21:53.680
AUDIENCE: 3 and 1/2.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.568
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Soda at 3 and 1/2.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.450
So soda is definitely getting
into our corrosive range.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:05.955
AUDIENCE: Vinegar at 2.

00:22:05.955 --> 00:22:07.920
CATHERINE DRENNAN: And
we have vinegar at 2.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.630
And that is corrosive.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:19.190
People often use pure vinegar
to clean out a coffee pot

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.980
because it is pretty corrosive.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.570
It really does a good
job of cleaning it.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.290
When you're having
it in salad dressing,

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.250
you don't want to
have it pure vinegar.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.176
That would not be good to drink.

00:22:29.176 --> 00:22:30.175
And what about medicine?

00:22:30.175 --> 00:22:32.680
AUDIENCE: Medicine
has a pH of 2.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.780
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 2.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.350
So we also have in
the corrosive category

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.480
the medicine that my
four-year-old daughter

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.050
was asked to take.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:50.760
So when she started getting
these sores in her mouth

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.530
from taking her medicine, I
brought some pH paper home

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.170
and measured the
pH and discovered

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.310
that what she was
taking was corrosive.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.990
So I went to the doctor
and said, can you

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.820
prescribe something different.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.690
This medicine is corrosive.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.780
And the doctor looked at
me and it's like the pH,

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.470
the pH is like 2 or lower.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.775
And she looked at me, and she's
like, what do you mean pH?

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.390
This is why I
spend many lectures

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.510
on pH in this class
and acids and bases.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:31.200
Some of you will be
doctors, and some of you

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.360
will not encourage parents to
buy this much corrosive thing

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.980
to feed their child when
they're iron deficient.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.540
So this is what
I'm talking about.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.040
And for those of you who
are not going to be doctors,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.730
many of you will
probably have children

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.870
with an iron deficiency.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.200
It's super common.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.520
So you will know that
you need to measure

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.810
the pH of the solution before
giving it to your child.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:55.220
So what did I do?

00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.010
So what I did was I bought
adult pills, same stuff,

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:04.040
iron sulfate, and I
made sure that this

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.380
told me the number of
milligrams that were in there.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.160
I looked at what was prescribed.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.330
So I got the pills with the
correct number of milligrams,

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.840
and then I crushed them,
and that stuff also

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.510
tastes really nasty, but a
little tip for the future,

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.680
there is one and only
one that I discovered,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.370
taste that can cover the
taste of iron 2 sulfate,

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.056
and that is Nutella.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.290
So don't give your child
corrosive medicine.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.990
Give them crushed
pills in Nutella.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.080
pH is important.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.010
pH is important.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.190
So let's talk about
the strengths of acids.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.520
And you might want to reconsider
huge soda consumption too.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.360
I don't really know,
but that's something

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.090
you might want to think about.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.082
Strength of acids.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:13.050
So here we have some acetic
acid, CH3COOH aqueous,

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:17.260
dissolved in our solvent,
which is liquid water.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.140
And this is an acid,
so it will give up

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.400
a hydrogen ion or a proton to
the water, which acts as a base

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:30.630
and forms our hydronium
ions, H3O plus, and also

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.710
the conjugate base of the acid.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:40.520
So it's the acid missing
H plus, CH3C00 minus.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.580
So if we're talking about the
strength of the acid, what

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.050
we really want to know
is how much of that acid

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.230
forms ions, how
much of it ionizes.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.310
That is going to
determine how strong it

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.980
is because the
amount that ionizes

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.630
is equal to the amount of
the hydronium ions you get,

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.850
and pH equals minus
the concentration

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.040
of hydronium ions.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.890
So the pH depends on the
extent to which it ionizes.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.960
And again, we're talking
about at equilibrium,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.870
so we're talking about
a equilibrium constant,

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.220
and this one also
gets a fancy name.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.830
In acids and bases,
all the equilibrium

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.750
constants get their
own little names,

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.480
and this is the acid
ionization constant, Ka.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.440
So it's the equilibrium
constant for an acid, Ka.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.190
So that's at least
very easy to remember.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:35.620
So now based on what you know
about equilibrium constants,

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.545
why don't you tell me
the answer to this?

00:27:19.583 --> 00:27:20.666
All right 10 more seconds.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.920
All right.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.140
So this one is wrong.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.920
It's always products over
reactants for an equilibrium

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.850
expression.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.400
Water is a solvent
and is nearly pure,

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.220
so it should not be there.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.480
This should be in the
expression because it's aqueous.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.970
If it were solid, it wouldn't
be included, but it's aqueous,

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.440
so its concentration
is going to change,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.800
so it is in our expression.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.320
See answer to 3 for that one.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.610
Enough information,
and it's not correct.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.070
So we can write the
expression for Ka.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:12.520
So that's equal to the
products, our hydronium ion

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:18.190
concentration, our conjugate
base over are conjugate acid.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:22.360
And so we can look at what the
value is for this expression,

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.190
and we can look it up.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:27.540
There's lots and lots of
tables of these in your book.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:33.430
And it is 1.76 times 10
to the minus 5 or minus 3.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.620
I don't have my glasses,
whatever it says there.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:41.690
I think it's 5 at room
temperature, which is small.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.690
So when Ka is small, it
means that very little of it

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.100
is ionizing.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:53.890
And so only a small number
of our acetic acid molecules

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.820
are donating their proton when
they're dissolved in water.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.080
So that's the definition
of a weak acid.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:04.360
When it has a very small Ka,
it's not ionizing very much.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.860
Now, in doing these
units, a lot of people

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.840
get hung up on the names
of the different acids

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.980
and one of the first
steps in solving

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.560
a problem is to write the
equilibrium expression out,

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.290
but people get
hung up with that.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.240
So don't get hung up with that.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.940
You can use generic expressions
for acids and water.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.660
If you don't want to write out
the whole name of the acid,

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.330
you can always just say HA,
aqueous, plus the solvent,

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:36.880
water, goes to hydronium
ions plus A minus,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.130
the conjugate of the weak acid.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.940
So this is an acid in water,
and the acid is HA here.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.740
And an acid expression should
be forming hydronium ions.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.920
If it's acidic, you
should have acidic pH,

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.770
and so you need to have
some H3O plus around.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.970
You can also write
this expression

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.110
as BH plus plus water.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:06.000
BH plus can give up the H plus
and become B and also generate

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.610
hydronium ions.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:11.175
So here are the acid is BHA.

00:30:11.175 --> 00:30:14.620
And often when you're looking
at these kinds of problems,

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.840
a weak acid will be
HA, but sometimes you

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.770
have a problem involving the
conjugate acid of a weak base,

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.110
and that's often
expressed as BH plus.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:30.050
So both of these expressions
are valid for an acid in water.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:34.790
So now let's think about strong
acids versus weaker acids,

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.970
and here's our
definition in this class.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.920
A strong acid has a Ka greater
than 1, a lot of strong acids

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.480
have a Ka really, really,
really greater than 1,

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.280
and the acid ionizes
almost completely.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.100
So if you say it's a
strong acid in water,

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.890
whatever concentration
of that acid you put in

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.170
is going to be equal to the
concentration of hydronium

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:57.060
ions.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.890
It basically goes straight.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.980
You form lots and lots and lots
of products at equilibrium.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.650
A weak acid has a
Ka of less than 1,

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:10.030
and a weak acid does not
for many ionized species

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.130
in solution.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:14.765
Not very much H3O
plus is formed.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:23.960
So what about pKa?

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.040
pKa's are really important in
organic chemistry, in biology,

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.700
in a lot of areas.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:35.470
And every year the organic
chemistry faculty in 512

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:40.114
talk about pKa's in organic,
and the students there say, no,

00:31:40.114 --> 00:31:41.280
we never learned about that.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.990
They're like, you took
freshman chem, right?

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.540
It's like a GIR or
you pass the test.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:49.480
You should know about
pKa's, and they're like, no.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.870
So they contact me, and I'm like
they did not take 5.111 if they

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.770
do not know what a pKa is.

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:59.280
There are other courses that
sometimes people decide to take

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.770
that are not 5.111, but in
5.111, you know about pKa's.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.310
So what I want you to
do is later in life

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.670
when you're in a class
and pKa's come up

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.210
and everyone else in the
class is like, I don't know.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:17.080
You're like I took 5.111.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.350
I can answer that.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.990
That makes me very happy.

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.000
So pKa's.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.290
so pKa is minus
the log of the Ka.

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.320
That's easy to remember.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.970
We already talked about
the relationship of Ka

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.980
with strong acids or weak acids.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.060
The lower the value
of the Ka the higher

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.600
the value of the pKa.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.000
That's just out of
that expression.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.990
So the higher the pKa
means what about the acid?

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.330
Think about what you know about
Ka to answer this question.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.970
All right.

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:15.815
10 more seconds.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.580
All right.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.300
So that is correct.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.130
So we have a weaker acid.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:43.270
So if we have a
low Ka, that means

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:48.250
that it is a weak acid, and
then the higher value of Ka.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:51.220
So the higher the
Ka, that's going

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:57.130
to mean the lower the value
or the weaker of the acid.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.870
So just remember the
relationship from the equation,

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.090
and think about it, and you
can think about the value

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:05.560
of Ka, products over reactants.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.190
You might have a
lot of products.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.489
That means a lot of
ionization and a stronger acid

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:15.510
and fewer products,
that means it's weaker.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:18.320
So let's look at some
tables, and I just

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.969
put the values that are with
the arrows in your notes.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:23.980
I didn't put the entire table.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.870
The tables are in the book, and
this is page one of the table,

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.860
so there's a lot of values here.

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.420
So this has the acid.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.760
It tells you what the HA
term is, what the A minus,

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.679
so what the weak acid is,
what the conjugate base is.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.139
It gives you the Ka and the pKa.

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:41.739
And so you can see
the relationship

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:44.690
between Ka and pKa.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:49.300
So up here, HI is at
the top of this table.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.370
So that probably means it's
the strongest or the weakest.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:53.270
Which do you think?

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.955
Is this the strongest
or the weakest?

00:34:55.955 --> 00:34:56.830
You just yell it out.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:57.746
AUDIENCE: Strongest.

00:34:57.746 --> 00:35:00.040
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
It is the strongest.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:00.730
Right.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:04.200
So it has Ka value that is much,
much, much, much, much, much,

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.570
much, much, much, much,
much greater than 1.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:12.510
And it has a very, very, very
negative tiny, tiny pKa value.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.180
So this is a super strong acid.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.851
In fact, do not use that.

00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:19.350
There's no reason really you
would ever want to be using it.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.540
It is not a good
thing to play with.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.040
All right.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:28.000
So HCl is used more
often in pH-ing things.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.740
Is this a strong or weak acid?

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.286
AUDIENCE: Strong.

00:35:32.286 --> 00:35:34.150
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
It's also strong.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:38.500
It's K or Ka is
also greater than 1,

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.390
but not as strong as this.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:43.460
We have 10 to the seventh,
and that one, gosh,

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.790
I should bring my
glasses, 10 to the 11th.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:46.860
That's super strong.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.070
That's still pretty strong.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:48.570
All right.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.880
So let's look down here now.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.782
Tell me, is this a
strong or weak acid?

00:35:54.782 --> 00:35:56.090
AUDIENCE: Weak.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.920
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
That is weak acid.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:06.140
The Ka is less than 1 here,
and I think that's a minus 2.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.650
And the pKa value, now we're
out of the negative number,

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.630
so it's on the bigger side.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.710
And down here, is
this strong or weak?

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:16.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.550
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Also weak.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.540
And it's even weaker
than this one.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:25.650
It's like 10 to the minus
4, and pKa value is 3.75.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.800
So you see you can
look at the Ka values

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.440
and think about whether
it's a strong or weak acid.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.940
You can also look
at the pKa values.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.980
This is really, really
small negative value.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.960
This is a bigger
value down here.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.320
And this is not been
the weakest acid.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:46.470
There's a whole other page of
tables for acids, lots and lots

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.220
of acids.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.510
Less bases.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:55.600
There are a few, and you will
see this space quite often,

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.640
NH3.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.010
So we have a base in water.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:03.730
The base accepts a hydrogen
ion or proton from the water,

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:06.030
forming NH4 plus.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:10.120
And then after water
loses its hydrogen ion,

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.120
it forms OH minus.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.260
So the equilibrium
expression or the K

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:23.560
for this base in water problem
is called the base ionization

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.040
constant, or Kb.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.560
And we can write
that expression here.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.060
We have the ammonium
ion concentration

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.040
times the hydroxide
ion concentration

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.740
over the concentration
of ammonia.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.220
Again, water is not
in the expression.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:43.130
It stays pretty much pure
throughout this entire thing.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:44.500
It's the solvent.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.480
And so this is our
expression for Kb.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.570
And if you're writing
an expression for Kb,

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.040
you should always make
sure, check yourself

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.380
that you're putting hydroxide
ion concentration in there.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.270
If it is a base in water, it
should be forming hydroxide ion

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.410
concentration.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:04.180
If you start writing a Kb
and you have hydronium ion

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.310
concentration in there, you
want to stop and rethink

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:09.320
what you're doing.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.690
So in this case, we
also have a weak base.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:18.670
1.8 times 10 to the minus
5 is a small number for Kb.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:21.520
It's a small equilibrium
number, so that means

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.130
you're not a lot of products.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:27.360
Not a lot ionized when you
put this weak base in water.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.730
So only a tiny
amount of NH3 ionizes

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:35.150
to NH4 plus and OH in
solution, so this is what

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:39.440
they call moderately weak base.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.170
So as we saw before, you
can have generic expressions

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.800
for a base in water.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.440
We can write B aqueous
plus water goes to BH plus.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.810
The base accepts a
hydrogen ion or proton,

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.550
and the water loses
one forming OH minus.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.480
We can also write
the expression that

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:05.690
often exists from the
conjugate of a weak acid,

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:07.170
and this is a weak base.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:11.620
So A minus plus water goes
to HA plus hydroxide ion

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.050
concentration.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.690
So either of these are
generic expressions

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:20.820
that you can write
for a base in water.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.230
So in terms of the
definitions, it's the same.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:28.140
You would say a strong base
is something that ionizes

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.720
almost completely to give OH.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.640
There aren't a lot of
examples of strong bases.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.800
Most of the ones you'll
see in your class

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.030
are things like
sodium hydroxide.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:41.480
Yes, that is hydroxide.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.480
That's a strong base, and
if you put it in water,

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.830
you should definitely
form a lot of hydroxide.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.100
So they're not a whole
lot of examples there.

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.250
So they're not all those tables.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.240
It's not like the acids.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.100
But there are some terms
that you still need to know.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:04.600
So pKb equals minus
log of the Kb.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:09.730
And again, the larger the value
for Kb, the stronger the base.

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:14.100
Again, it tells you you have
a lot that have ionized.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:18.090
And because of this relationship
of this equation, the larger

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:22.677
the pKb the weaker the base.

00:40:22.677 --> 00:40:24.260
Because if you have
a big number here,

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.750
you're going to have
a small number there.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:33.050
So now, let's talk
about conjugate acids

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.690
and their bases.

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.370
This is super
important for buffers

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:42.060
that, hopefully, we'll
get to in class on Friday.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:47.110
So the stronger the acid, the
weaker its conjugate base.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:51.600
The stronger the base, the
weaker its conjugate acid.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.150
And here we have HCl,
which we determined

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:58.910
was a strong acid a little while
ago, giving up its hydrogen

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:06.450
ion to water, forming hydronium
ion concentration and Cl minus.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.320
Cl minus is not a very
good conjugate base.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.890
It's not a good base.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:14.460
So if we look at this table
when we have a strong acid,

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.080
its conjugate it is going
to be ineffective as a base.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.930
You're basically not pushing
that equilibrium back

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.710
at all, the other direction.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:26.470
It's completely ionized,
and it stays that way.

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:29.840
But if you have a
moderately weak acid,

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.700
you're going to have a very
weak base, a very weak acid,

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:37.770
you'll have a moderately weak
conjugate base, a strong base

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.910
and you'll have something
that's ineffective as an acid.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:44.970
So they are inversely
related to each other.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:48.610
So let's think about
why this would be true.

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:57.070
And this relationship holds
Ka times Kb equals Kw.

00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:01.930
And we know that Kw is
1.0 times 10 to the minus

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.590
14th at room temperature.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:09.920
And if we put logs and then
minus logs by everything,

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:15.330
we can derive this expression,
which is the pKa plus the pKb

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:20.540
equals the pKw equals 14.00.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:25.200
So you can't have an acid
and its conjugate base

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.630
both be strong.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:30.950
You can't have a base in its
conjugate acid both be strong.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:34.480
The pK's need to add up to 14.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.540
So if you have something
that's a good acid,

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.370
then its conjugate base is not
going to be particularly good.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:46.840
The pKa and the pKb
must add up to 14.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.930
If you have something
that's a good base,

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.740
its conjugate acid is not
going to be that good.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:57.520
So these are connected
to each other.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.770
So we can think about,
then, the strong acids

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.880
and the strong bases again.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.680
So we talk about
equilibrium, but really this

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.650
is pushing the equilibrium
pretty much to completion.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:13.530
If it's a strong acid in
water, however much strong acid

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:17.650
you put in is how much hydronium
ion concentration you get out.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.990
A strong base is
going to give you

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.360
that amount of hydroxide
ion concentration.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.150
Strong acids and bases push
the equilibrium pretty much

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:29.270
completely toward ionization.

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.350
We have these numbers of 10 to
the 11th, 10 to the seventh.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:34.950
These are hugely over here.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:39.060
We're forming almost
ionizing completely.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.620
Now, for weak acids and
bases, it's very different.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:47.820
Here the equilibrium you
are going back and forth.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.150
You have this
dynamic equilibrium.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:55.810
The acid in water is forming
hydronium ions and an A minus,

00:43:55.810 --> 00:44:00.160
but a minus is also a
somewhat good, weak base

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.360
pushing the equilibrium
back the other way.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:08.330
So in this case, we have a back
and forth between the forward

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.300
and the reverse.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.385
So if you have very
weak, you have moderate,

00:44:12.385 --> 00:44:14.720
you have moderate,
you have very weak,

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.920
and this is what's important
for forming buffers,

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.650
and buffers are
really important.

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:26.570
Let's see if we can get to
one of these types of problems

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:31.250
because they're five we
need to get to in this unit.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.630
And there are only five.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.850
And people will say salt
and water is another,

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:37.490
but salt and water
just breaks down

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:39.490
into weak acid and weak bases.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.580
So everyone can learn how to
do five types of problems,

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.270
so this is very doable.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.770
All right.

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:48.560
So let's just look at
equilibrium of weak acids

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.790
and we'll save weak
bases for last time.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:55.480
So a weak acid is vitamin C, and
I brought some vitamin C here.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.420
I tried to do a demo once and
discovered that vitamin C,

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.510
it's really coated
well, so it does not

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:03.980
dissolve until it hits
the acid of your stomach,

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.820
so I could not dissolve it.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.490
So I'll just hold
this up right here.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:12.980
But if we had a 500
milligram tablet, which

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:17.610
I think is what this is and
if I had 100 mils of water

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.360
and if this wasn't
coated so there's

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.710
no way you can dissolve it,
then I could calculate the pH.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.070
So how am I going to do this?

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:29.280
I'm given the Ka, I'm told
the number of milligrams,

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.370
and I'm told the
volume of water.

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:35.110
So the first thing you want
to do is calculate molarity.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:39.970
So you want convert grams
to moles or milligrams

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.840
to grams to moles.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.389
And then you want to use your
volume, and you have 100 mils,

00:45:45.389 --> 00:45:46.680
but we're going to do molarity.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.600
So we want to convert
milliliters to liters.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:56.680
And we can calculate 0.0284
molar moles per liter.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.560
Then we can write our
expression, and if you want to,

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.290
you can just write
HA here and A minus.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.620
You don't have to write
out the whole thing

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.710
if you don't want to.

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:08.690
All right.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:10.990
So here is the expression again.

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:13.960
Now, just as we saw with
chemical equilibrium,

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.970
we can write this table talking
about the initial molarity.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:22.550
So we have a weak acid we have
no hydronium ion concentration.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:26.110
We have no weak
conjugate base over here,

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:29.690
so the change then is going to
be the constant, the molarity

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:31.500
that we had, and
these are change

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.580
in molarities, so don't put
moles or other things here,

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:39.100
molarity here, minus x, that's
what you have in equilibrium,

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.880
plus x plus x.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.510
So we can write our
expression now for Ka.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:48.910
We're given the
value Ka, and we know

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.730
how to write an expression.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.000
We have our hydronium
ion concentration,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.180
our conjugate base over here
over our conjugate acid.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:04.170
This is equal to x
squared 0.0284 minus x.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:07.220
Now, if you want to
with these problems,

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.690
you can make an
assumption that x

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:12.450
is going to be small
and then not have

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.710
to use the quadratic
equation, but you do

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:16.460
need to check your assumption.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.870
But I'll show you how to
do it with an assumption,

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:22.620
so we're going to assume x is
small, and this value, the x,

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.990
will drop out.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.080
So we can rewrite
this expression

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:31.660
as x squared over just the
concentration we started with.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.330
And then we can solve for x.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:40.170
And x, in that case, is
point 0.00151, but really

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:41.750
two significant figures.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:44.350
Our Ka is just 2.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:46.590
Now, we can check
the assumption.

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.350
And we're going to
check the assumption

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.730
that this is, in fact, small.

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:56.950
And if it's less than
5%, then we can use that.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:00.320
So here this is the
x we calculated.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.470
Here is the amount
times 100% gives us

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:07.260
5.3%, which is more than 5.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.800
5 is the magic number
for the course,

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.499
and so then we have to use
the quadratic equation.

00:48:12.499 --> 00:48:14.290
Now, a lot of you
probably have calculators

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.700
that can work with
quadratic equation,

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.240
so you don't really
care, but if you

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.860
want to check the assumption,
you can, and sometimes

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.700
we'll need to check it.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.190
So this value,
this percent here,

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:28.210
is sometimes called
percent ionization

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.170
because it's x over the
amount you started with.

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:35.090
It's the percent that ionized
or percent deprotonated.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:37.240
If this is an acid,
it's the amount

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.660
of hydronium, the
amount that deprotonated

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.309
over what you started with.

00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:43.600
So sometimes you're asked to
do this even if you're not

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.440
checking any assumptions.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:46.950
All right.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:49.560
So we got to end with
if a quicker question.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.540
We get here this is really
two significant figures.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.430
So why don't you tell me
how many significant figures

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:57.445
are in your answer for pH.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:21.330
All right.

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:22.120
10 more seconds.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:47.900
So let's take a look
at the answer here.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.360
So there's the answer.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.930
So this had two
significant figures,

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:55.190
which means you get
two significant figures

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:56.912
after the decimal point.

00:49:56.912 --> 00:49:58.870
So maybe we'll have one
of these in the clicker

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:05.250
competition on Friday, and we'll
do our weak bases next time.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:08.716
So again, we've been
studying acid base.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:17.940
And there are only five types
of acid-base problems, weak acid

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:22.510
in water, which we already did,
check, weak basin water, which

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:24.980
we're going to do right
now, and as soon as we're

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:27.580
done doing week
base in water, I'm

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.470
going to explain to you
how salt and water are just

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:33.300
weak acid in water or weak
base in water problems.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.800
So you already know how to do
them as soon as they teach you

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.680
about weak bases.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.820
And then we're going to
move on and do buffers.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.510
And then next week
we're going to do

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:48.090
strong acids and strong bases,
and then you'll have all five.

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:52.820
You already have enough
that after today's lecture,

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.040
you can do, I think,
all the problems

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.720
set 7 except for the
last two questions,

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.030
I believe, or at least a large
fraction of problem set 7.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:07.350
I will warn you that acid-base
problems take a lot of writing

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:09.290
and a lot of time to work.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:14.310
One problem often has
five or six parts to it,

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:16.970
and they're all time-consuming
part pretty much.

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:20.450
So don't leave problem
set 7 to the last minute.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:23.716
That would be a mistake on
this particular problem set.

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.720
Weak bases.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.910
Acid-base type problem 2.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:41.370
So in this example, we have
ammonia, NH3, in water,

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:44.880
and we measured the
pH of some solutions

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.100
before and saw they were basic.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.800
We had a pH of, I
think, 12 last time.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.780
And so this conjugate base
goes to a conjugate acid.

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.550
So the base accepts a hydrogen
ion or proton from water,

00:51:57.550 --> 00:52:00.470
becomes NH4 plus,
and the water that

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:03.880
lost its hydrogen
ion becomes OH minus,

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.220
and that is a base
in water problem

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:09.690
because you're forming
hydroxide ions.

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:13.730
For a base in water, you're
talking about the equilibrium

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:16.720
constant for that base in
water, which has a special name

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.170
KB, B for base.

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:22.520
And it's important to
remember the A's and B's

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.310
on the equilibrium constant
because it's always

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:27.220
checking your work.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.830
Is this a base in water problem.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:32.380
People sometimes try to apply
Ka's when they should be doing

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.020
Kb's.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:35.670
So pay attention to basin water.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:37.930
We're thinking about Kb.

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:41.170
So here if we're going to
calculate the pH of a solution,

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:45.310
we have molarity of 0.15,
and room temperature,

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:47.500
pretty much everything
is at room temperature.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.160
So whenever you're
asked to calculate

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.460
the pH of a weak
base in water, you

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:54.580
want to think about
at equilibrium, what's

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.610
the condition now, what will
be the condition, what's

00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:00.790
the change, and what will be
the condition at equilibrium.

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:03.050
And so you can make this table.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:04.820
You can write out
the expression.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.500
Again, you can
forget about water.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.730
Water is our solvent.

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:10.270
It's not going to be showing up.

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:14.020
And then put in our
initial molarity, 0.15.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:17.030
And we put zeros in
the other categories.

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:20.313
And why don't you try the rest?

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.728
Is it slowing down?

00:53:46.728 --> 00:53:49.352
SAM: [INAUDIBLE] answers
are really quick.

00:53:49.352 --> 00:53:50.560
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.835
Let's just do 10 more seconds.

00:54:05.981 --> 00:54:06.480
Yup.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.970
Excellent.

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:11.990
Sam told me everyone
responded really quickly.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:14.230
So that is, in fact,
what you're going to do.

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:16.890
We'll put that up here as well.

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:21.190
So we lose some of this minus x.

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:24.540
So at equilibrium, we
have point 1.5 minus x.

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:30.560
And we get plus x
here and plus x there.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:35.570
Now, we can write our Kb for
our base in water, its products,

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:40.150
the conjugate acid, NH4
plus, times the concentration

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:43.190
of hydroxide ions over NH3.

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:44.710
Again, water is the solvent.

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:46.950
It's not in the equation.

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:50.380
And then we can write
it out-- this is x.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.240
That's x, so we have x squared.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.740
And then the change in the
amount of the weak base,

00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:00.880
when it's in water,
is 0.15 minus x.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:05.350
So at this point, you can either
use the quadratic equation,

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:08.830
or you can make an
assumption that x is going

00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:11.370
to be small compared to 0.5.

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:13.650
We don't want to make
the assumption up here.

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:17.060
We want to get to this point
before we try the assumption,

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:19.770
and you always need to
check your assumptions

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.900
to make sure they are correct.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:27.040
But if we use the assumption
here just to simplify the math.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:29.690
And so the assumption
is that this x is small,

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:33.530
so we can drop
that x minus x out,

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:41.270
and then we can calculate
that x is 0.00164.

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:44.870
And then we can
check the assumption,

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:46.847
and that is another
clicker question.

00:56:35.011 --> 00:56:35.510
All right.

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:36.450
10 more seconds.

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.950
All right.

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:56.010
It is number 1.

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:58.760
So here you're checking
the assumption and the way

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.500
that you check the assumption
is that you put x that you've

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:07.410
calculated by simplifying
it, divide it by the number

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:11.650
that you're asking is it
smaller than, and then times 100

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:14.140
because our rule is 5%.

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:18.460
So if this value is greater
than 5% of this value,

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.300
you need to use the quadratic.

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.160
If it's less than 5%,
then you can go ahead

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.790
and use your assumption.

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:26.980
And so this is the assumption
we're talking about,

00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.840
that this number is under 5%.

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:37.250
And for weak acids and bases,
it very often is less than 5%

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:40.450
because they're weak, so
there's not a lot of ionization.

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:45.940
And this is often referred to as
percentage ionization as well.

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:46.440
All right.

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.130
So our checking
assumption, again,

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:58.960
that x 0.00164 divided
by 0.15 times 100% is 1%,

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:04.870
1.1, that's less than 5,
so the assumption is OK.

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:09.670
And then we can calculate
pOH because this

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:13.350
is a weak base in water,
so the x that we calculated

00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:17.140
is the amount of
hydroxide ion in solution.

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:22.050
So we calculate pOH,
and we get 2.79.

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:24.000
And that's two
significant figures,

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.070
everything we had
after the decimal

00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:29.610
because everything that we had
was two significant figures.

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:31.780
And so this is two
significant figures,

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:34.660
two significant figures
after the decimal point.

00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:36.720
And then you need
to calculate pH

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.550
because the problem
asked for pH.

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:40.750
So this is, again,
at room temperature.

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:47.490
So we can use 14
minus 2.79 is 11.21.

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:49.420
That's our pH.

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:51.640
And don't make the
mistake of stopping here

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:56.690
forgetting that x is hydroxide
instead of hydronium ion

00:58:56.690 --> 00:59:02.630
and tell me that the pH of my
weak base in solution is pH 2.

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:05.977
So one of the things that's
really good about this unit

00:59:05.977 --> 00:59:08.060
is that there are some
good checks that you've got

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:09.830
the right answer at the end.

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:14.110
If you're talking about
a base in solution,

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:16.360
you should have a
pH above what value?

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.306
AUDIENCE: 7.

00:59:17.306 --> 00:59:18.690
CATHERINE DRENNAN: About 7.

00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:20.980
So it should be on the
basic side of neutral.

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:23.890
pH 7 is neutral, so
it should be above 7.

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:26.600
And so if this was
your answer for pH,

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.570
that wouldn't make
a lot of sense.

00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:30.050
So always check at the end.

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:33.430
And it's fine if you get to
an exam and you get to the end

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:35.460
and you did something
wrong and you

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:38.290
realize that your answer doesn't
make any sense, if you write,

00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:40.350
this answer doesn't
make any sense,

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:42.730
but I don't have time to
figure out what I gave wrong,

00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:46.970
you will get points for
recognizing that that is not

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:48.380
a valid answer.

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.520
Because it's a weak
acid problem and you

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.850
have a basic pH or vice versa.

00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:54.005
So keep that in mind.

00:59:54.005 --> 00:59:55.630
There's lots of partial credit.

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:58.800
Grading acid-base
problems on exams

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:04.770
is a whole new fun adventure
that the TAs have no idea what

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.090
is going to be happening.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:09.020
But I'll be right with you
there for 10 hours of grading,

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.300
and we'll have a good time.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.520
Write neatly, please.
