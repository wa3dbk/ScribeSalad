CATHERINE DRENNAN:
So where are we

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.270
in our grand list of our
five types of problems?

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.090
We've done weak acid in
water, weak base in water,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.610
salt, and buffer.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.172
We only have two left.

00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:38.630
And that's what
we're going to talk

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.950
about right now-- strong
acids and strong bases.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.570
And we're going to talk about
them in terms of acid base

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.760
titrations.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.930
So switching to
today's handout, so

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.220
titrations-- how
many of you have done

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.040
a titration in a laboratory?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.660
OK, a lot of people.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.840
If you haven't, I have to say,
you're not missing anything.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.030
It is really--
it's like watching

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.270
paint dry for most of the
time during the titration.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.260
So here in an acid
base type titration,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.660
you have the addition
of, say, a base

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.110
of known concentration to an
acid of unknown concentration.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.940
And you can use
this by figuring out

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.880
what volume you need to
reach the equivalence point.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.140
You can figure out
the concentration

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.800
of that acid or base.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.080
If you know the concentration
of two things you,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.270
can often use it
to figure out a Ka

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.680
or calculate a molecular weight.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.920
But that's the purpose
of the titration.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.330
So let's look at the shape
of these titration curves.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.430
So here we have a strong
acid with a strong base.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.380
So we start out.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.310
All we have at point
0 is the strong acid.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.530
So we should have
a very low pH here.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.610
And then it should
change slowly.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.880
Then it changes very rapidly
and then changes slowly again.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.260
So what is this point S?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.030
So that point S has
many, many names, which

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.240
are all equivalent.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.330
It's called the
equivalence point,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.410
and we had the clicker
question in the beginning

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.760
was mentioning that.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.000
The S here really stands for
the stoichiometric point.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.730
Both of these are
the same thing.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.920
And it's the theoretical
volume and which

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.620
that base that you've added,
the number of moles of that base

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.980
is equal to the number
of moles of acid you had.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.700
So it's the point of which the
moles are equal to each other.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.680
And so that stoichiometric
1-to-1, or equivalence.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.260
The moles are equivalent.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.942
So all these names are the same.

00:02:41.942 --> 00:02:43.150
They all mean the same thing.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.050
Don't get tricked if problem
say one thing or the other.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.200
You also might hear end point.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.860
That's often the result of
the experiment that you do,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.240
where you figure out
what volume you needed

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.920
to add to have a color change.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.490
So the way these work
usually is you have this,

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.780
and you go drip, drip, drip,
and you look for a color change.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.680
And at that point
of the color change,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.900
the first little hint
of the color change

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.700
is where you want to stop
and measure the volume.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.360
But often you get
very frustrated,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.430
and you go from totally
clear, you're very, very slow,

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.660
and you're right in here.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.160
And then you can't
stand it anymore.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.660
You jump right up
here, and you have

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.130
to do it over and over again.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.820
But it should be that
the end point should

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.440
equal the equivalence point.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.550
So if you're good at
these kinds of problems,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.690
you might be able to do a
quick and dirty, estimate what

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.380
the value is, and then figure
out exactly how much you can

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.730
add before you have to go
slow, i.e. you can cheat,

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.870
which I highly recommend in
doing these kinds of laboratory

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.890
exercises.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.840
So knowing how to do
the math is really

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.810
valuable of these problems.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.530
So we add a strong
acid and a strong base.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.060
Here's the same curve
for a strong base

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.450
with a strong acid, where
we're adding the strong acid

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.550
into the strong base.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.770
Again, now we're going to start
in the beginning at point 0

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.330
before we've added any acid.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.640
We have a basic pH.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.310
It goes slow, goes
fast through point

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.590
S, the equivalence point
or stoichiometric point,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.470
and then goes slow again.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.980
So how do you know?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.630
And the TSs are going
to come down and do

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.579
a little demo for you
now about pH indicators.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.380
How do you know?

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.640
And for those of you who have
done these experiments in lab,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.610
again, you have
this color change.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.180
And usually you're clear.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.502
You go a little bit more.

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.460
You have a little bit
more, and you go to this.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.490
But as I was saying,
what happens most of time

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.110
is you go from this clear, all
the way to the really dark,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.110
and you have to start all
over again because you

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.380
missed the end point.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.520
So these pH indicators
are able to tell you

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.530
that there's this change in pH.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:56.011
So the TAs are going to show
you, using a pH-- come on in.

00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:56.510
Set up.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.810
I'm just talking
while you set up.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.480
Over there-- you can use the
document camera if you need it.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:12.860
So our demo TAs have created a
natural dye from red cabbage.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.110
And this dye, when it's in
acid, has a slightly different

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.080
structure then in base, which
causes it to have these two

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.490
different colors.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.350
So we can tell which
things are acidic

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.910
and which things are basic by
the color of the indicator.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:35.342
And I'm just going to hand
over a mic if it's on.

00:05:35.342 --> 00:05:36.550
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Is it on?

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.530
Yes?

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.030
Yes?

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.860
OK, great.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.900
So we've got our solutions here.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.070
This is lemon juice.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.070
Did I put water in here?

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.420
Right?

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.110
Yeah, water, vinegar, I think.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.866
Maybe it vinegar--
this is vinegar.

00:05:56.697 --> 00:05:57.280
Don't do that.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.130
Don't do that in lab.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.120
CATHERINE DRENNAN: In
the lab you should always

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.807
label your containers.

00:06:00.807 --> 00:06:02.340
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Yes, indeed.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.725
So we've got lemon juice,
water, vinegar, and ammonia.

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:08.100
Did you add some
water into that?

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.330
Can you?

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.130
So we're going to add a
little bit of the indicator.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.310
The indicator came
from red cabbage.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.170
So the dye in the
red cabbage, it

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.240
is a molecule that
can be protonated.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.930
And when the molecule
gets protonated,

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.930
basically it's double
bonds start moving around.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.700
And when you do that, it
absorbs light differently.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.180
So what we're going to see
when we pour into there

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.150
is that you'll see this,
which is the acid forms

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.960
a nice pinkish color.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.752
This was the water.

00:06:39.752 --> 00:06:42.251
And when you pour it into the
water, nothing really happens.

00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:44.800
And you can kind of understand
that because the indicator

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.840
itself is a
water-based solution.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.370
So it's going to be purple.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.450
This was the vinegar.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.520
And as we did last time,
the vinegar is acidic.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.450
And this was the ammonia.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.210
And I'm going to add
little bit of water.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.420
Can you add a little bit
of water into this one?

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.961
You added it?

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.090
OK, great.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.910
And then we're going to kind
of do a little excursion here.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.635
So what this, this
is a piece of-- oh,

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:12.750
it's cold-- a piece of dry
ice, which is just solid CO2.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.730
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to drop it into there.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.744
So this is kind of a bit of a--

00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:20.035
CATHERINE DRENNAN: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:20.035 --> 00:07:21.826
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
Yeah, put it over here.

00:07:21.826 --> 00:07:24.520
So this is an interesting demo
because-- oh, that's not useful

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.020
at all.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.061
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah,
actually we can change--

00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:28.429
AUDIENCE: Can we change that?

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:29.470
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Maybe.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.130
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
Oh, maybe not.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.620
Oh, well, it's fine.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.070
Oh, man.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.110
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
CATHERINE DRENNAN:

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.120
I think we can do that.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.870
But this is beyond my
ability [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.953
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Well,
what I was talking about

00:07:35.953 --> 00:07:38.880
was basically when you drop the
CO2 into this mixture, what's

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.685
happening is that the
CO2 actually decomposes,

00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:44.630
and it forms something
called carbonic acid.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.920
Good idea.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.740
Carbonic acid is an
acid, so it will actually

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.600
change the pH of the
solution as we're talking.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.250
And what this is relevant for
is really for global warming.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.800
So we know about companies when
they make-- I mean, it's true.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.160
When we have companies
and they make

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.650
lots of kinds of
chemical compounds,

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.770
they'll release CO2
into the atmosphere.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.997
And when the CO2 gets
released-- is it working or no?

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:18.190
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Upside down!

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.149
That's even cooler.

00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:20.690
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
Oh, look at that.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.535
So when the CO2 gets
released into the atmosphere,

00:08:23.535 --> 00:08:25.160
basically, by Le
Chatelier's principle,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.802
you add all this CO2.

00:08:26.802 --> 00:08:29.690
It will force the reaction to
start making carbonic acid.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.910
And that will react
with the water vapor

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:37.210
and start making the water
in the air very acidic.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.929
Wow, that's not useful at all.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.640
And the color's not
really changing.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.477
But it was supposed to.

00:08:42.477 --> 00:08:43.177
(LAUGHING)

00:08:43.177 --> 00:08:44.510
CATHERINE DRENNAN: We have time.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.180
We can keep an eye on it.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:45.640
TEACHING ASSISTANT: I think we
may have added too much base.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.100
But we can keep an eye on it
and watch the color change

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.620
while it's upside down,
which is really useful.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.085
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yes,
because that's really cool.

00:08:51.085 --> 00:08:51.750
TEACHING ASSISTANT: But
anyway, yeah, that's

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.930
how the indicator works.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.010
And, yeah, that's that, I guess.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.300
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK, great.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:57.815
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:57.815 --> 00:08:59.690
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So
we can leave this here.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.700
I'll switch the document
the camera back.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:09.030
And you might add a little more.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.530
It's very concentrated still.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:16.730
See if we can get a little bit
more without too much overflow.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.630
I think it's changing
a little bit actually.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.129
Yeah.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.560
Well, we'll keep an eye on it.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.120
So let's go through and
calculate some points

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.390
on a strong acid and base curve.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:39.420
So we can check off those two
final types of pH problems.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.000
So here, when we're calculating
strong acid and strong bases,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.490
say we have a strong base
that's 2.5 molar, NaOH

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:57.570
being traded with a strong
acid, HCl at 0.34 molar.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.370
So first, we want
to calculate the pH

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.030
before the equivalence
point, when we've just added,

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:08.250
say, 5 mLs of our strong
acid to the solution which

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.720
was 25 mLs of our strong base.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.280
So the first thing
we're going to do

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.790
is calculate how many
moles of base that is.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.390
So how many did we have in here?

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.440
And since this base
is strong, the number

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.660
of moles of sodium
hydroxide added

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.730
equals the amount
of hydroxide formed.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.820
That's the definition
of a strong base.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.990
And it is hydroxide, so pretty
much that's how much you get.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.230
So all we have to do is
know how to calculate

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.630
the number of moles.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.480
And that is the
volume that we had,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.860
and we're converting that to
liters times our concentration.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:51.200
And so that gives us 6.25
times 10 to the minus 3 moles.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.060
So we know how many
moles of OH we have.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.630
Now we need to figure out
how many moles of acid

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:01.310
we added when we added 5
milliliters of the acid.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.160
So it's a strong acid.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.290
So the moles of acid
added equal the number

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:10.900
of moles of our hydronium ions
that are formed-- definition

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.360
of strong acid.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.080
And so we had 5 milliliters.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.160
We convert to liters
times our concentration.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.470
That gives us 1.7 times
10 to the minus 3 moles.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.750
So now we need to
figure out what

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.830
the new amount of hydroxide is.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.690
So we're going to convert.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.250
Some of our hydroxide will
react with the amount of acid

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.640
added because the
stoichiometry is one-to-one,

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:45.250
you're going to react equal
numbers of OH with H3O-plus.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.460
So we had 6.25 times 10
to the minus 3 moles.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.900
We've added this number
of moles of acid.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:57.870
So that many moles are going
to be formed into salt.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.700
And we're left with this
minus this, or 4.55 times

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.580
10 to the minus 3
moles of OH-minus left.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.300
So at this point, this is a
strong base and water problem.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.770
All we have as hydroxide
ions left in our solution.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.870
We've converted all
the acid that we

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.500
added into salt because
it reacted with the base.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.760
And so this is a
strong base now.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.250
So for strong base, all we have
to do is calculate the molarity

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.940
and then calculate pOH and pH.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.190
So for molarity,
We have the number

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:40.380
of moles left, 4.55 times 10 to
the minus 3, in our new volume.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.340
And this is the part
where people forget.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.880
We had 25 mLs.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.090
We added five more.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.920
So our new volume is 30 mLs.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.470
And so we have a
new concentration.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.010
And then from that,
we calculate pH.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:59.440
First we do pOh, plugging in
our hydroxide ion concentration.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.959
and then calculate
pH, using the fact

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:05.000
that at room temperature--
and all these problems

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.440
are room temperature-- that
would be 14 minus the pOH

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.070
is the pH.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.980
And we have a point somewhere
around here, point B,

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.460
on our titration curve after
we've add 5 mLs of strong acid.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.910
Our pH is still pretty
basic-- 13.18 left.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.420
So strong base in water
problem-- all you have to do

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:33.310
is calculate the concentration
of OH-minus, then the pOH,

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.730
and then the pH.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.300
So you don't have to have any of
these minus and pluses in terms

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.720
of setting up our tables
and using Ka's and Kb's

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.780
For a weak base
in water problem,

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:50.380
it's a concentration of
hydroxide ion-- pOH pH.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.770
So let's move on now
and think about what

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.970
volume we would need to get
to the stoichiometric point.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.870
So you're often
asked to calculate

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.820
the volume of the
strong acid needed

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.186
to get to the stoichiometric
or the equivalence point.

00:14:05.186 --> 00:14:06.560
And to do this,
you need to think

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.310
about how many moles
of OH you have,

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.000
because at the
equivalence point,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.450
you have equal numbers
of moles of acid.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.780
So we had 6.25 times 10 to the
minus 3 moles of OH originally.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.780
And at the equivalence point,
then, how many moles of acid

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.705
do we need to add?

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:30.360
We have to add that exact
same number, by definition.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.210
So the equivalence point,
it's the stoichiometric point.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.500
So if you know how many
moles of the base you had,

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.690
that's going to be equal to the
moles of acid you need to add.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.670
So now we want to figure out
the volume that that's needed.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.790
We know the number of
moles that we need,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.320
and we know the
concentration, so now we just

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.460
have to calculate the volume.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.640
So we have the moles.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.960
We use the concentration
of the acid

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.440
to figure out the volume
that has to be added.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.900
And what would be
the pH at this point?

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.615
It would be 7.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:09.570
So this is a really fast
question to ask on an exam,

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.420
because all you
have to do is say,

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.910
if it was a strong
base in a strong acid,

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.797
they're going to form a neutral
salt in water, so the pH is 7.

00:15:19.797 --> 00:15:20.380
And that's it.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.990
No calculations needed.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.970
You can answer that question
very quickly-- so strong acid,

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.320
strong base, at the equivalence
point, equal number of moles.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.050
You're going to get a
salt that's neutral.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:41.000
In the salt here, we have HCl
and NaOH is just NaCl, salt.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.110
So remember, at the
equivalence point, strong acid,

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:50.020
strong base, the pH
is going to be 7.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:55.030
So now let's go down here
and try point D so just

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.450
beyond the equivalence point.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:03.860
So here we want to calculate
the pH after 1 mL of strong acid

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.240
has been added after you have
reached the equivalence point.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.160
So you went 1 mL too
far in your titration,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.090
and this is a strong
acid in water problem,

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.540
so our last type
of problem here.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.280
So first what you
want to do is figure

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:25.590
out how many moles of this acid
were added due to this 1 mL

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.930
extra.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.720
And again, it's a strong
acid, so the amount of acid

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.830
added is going to be
equal to the hydronium ion

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.330
concentrations formed--
definition of strong acid.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:41.420
So we had a concentration
of 0.34 of our strong acid.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:46.580
We added 1 mL extra,
so we have 3.4 times 10

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:52.540
to the minus 4
moles of H3O-plus.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.765
Now we need to calculate
the molarity of that,

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:57.015
and that's a clicker question.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:22.780
So the trick here is
just to think about what

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.140
is the volume at this point.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.804
And if we look
over here-- do you

00:17:29.804 --> 00:17:31.820
want to just-- you can it out.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.360
We're trying a couple
of different variations

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.350
of the experiment over here.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:42.535
But we'll just see if
we can get it over time.

00:17:42.535 --> 00:17:44.330
Maybe we'll come back
to that at the end.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.290
We'll just leave it
there and say, OK.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.395
Or did you want
to say something?

00:17:49.395 --> 00:17:51.520
Why don't you talk about
it briefly, and then we'll

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.061
look at the--

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.300
TEACHING ASSISTANT: We
did the experiment again

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.610
with a less concentrated
solution, added several pieces

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.110
of dry ice.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.364
And as you can see,
the color-- yeah,

00:18:00.364 --> 00:18:01.530
we can put it on the camera.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.250
I don't know if we can.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:02.880
It's fine.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.890
But the color's
changing very slowly,

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.200
which is a lot slower than
we expected it to change.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.060
But you dilute
the concentration,

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.960
and this is turning blue.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.140
And it will eventually
turn into a yellowish-pink,

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.770
which is when it will
officially become an acid.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.062
So we'll just leave that there.

00:18:19.062 --> 00:18:20.811
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
We'll keep an eye on it

00:18:20.811 --> 00:18:21.990
for the next few minutes.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.070
So the trick here was to
figure out the volume.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.370
So you had 25 mLs to begin with.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:30.530
You needed 18.4 to get
to the stoichiometric

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.050
or the equivalence point.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.450
Then you added one more
past the equivalence point.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.160
And if you remembered to add
those three volumes together,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.860
then you will get the
right concentration.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.630
And when you get the
right concentration,

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.840
the rest of the
problem is very easy.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.680
And I'll just mention also,
significant figures here.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.080
We have three here because
we had three there.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.230
And so then you just
take the pH of this.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.210
This is the hydronium
ion concentration.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.550
And that will give your answer.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:08.147
And it'll be pH 2.116 with all
of those significant figures,

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.980
which you can never
measure that accurately.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.210
But nonetheless, that's what
the rules would tell us.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.940
So a strong acid
in water problem

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.720
is you just calculate
the hydronium ion

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.490
concentration and then pH.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.170
So this is a pretty simple part.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:30.310
So if we go back
now to our diagram,

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.860
we've measured a
couple of parts.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:38.220
We measured point B. And
so we had a pH of 13.18.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.070
This was like a strong
base in water problem.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.420
At a point S, we
calculated that we

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:50.040
needed 18.4 mLs of strong
acid, and our pH is 7.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.080
And so the trick to
doing this problem

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.430
was just to remember that
the moles of strong acid

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.670
equal the moles of strong
base at this point.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:03.500
And then from point D, 1 mL past
the equivalence point, the pH

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:09.820
was 2.116, and this is like a
strong acid in water problem.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.800
And notice how dramatic it is.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.260
Up here you're at pH 7.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.490
You add 1 mL too much, and
you're already at pH 2.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.610
So this is a very rapid change.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.450
This is why a lot of these
experiments are so frustrating.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.940
That you add a
little bit too much,

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.230
and you're just
way, way, way beyond

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.780
the stoichiometric point.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.670
So in one titration
curve here, we

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.630
have three types of problems.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.770
But as we get into weak acid in
weak base, which we'll do now,

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.720
you'll see that a
titration curve is actually

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.800
all five types of problems.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:49.640
So this is why one wants to
start problems set 7 early.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.780
So we've done all of these now.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.200
And now we can apply all
of these types of problems

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.500
while doing weak acid
strong base part.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.900
And we'll just start this,
and we'll continue it later.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.520
But let's go through
the curves now.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.080
So this is in your handout.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.430
This is the curve for the
weak acid in strong base.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.300
And I just want to remind you
what we just talked about,

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.830
which is strong
acid in strong base.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.630
So for weak acid in
strong base, the curves

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.790
look quite a bit different.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.470
So here we start at a higher
pH, because it's a weak acid.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:25.220
Here's lower.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.580
It's a strong acid.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.240
Then we go up.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.320
The pH levels off.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.080
And this is called
the buffering region.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.870
There's no such buffering region
with a strong acid strong base,

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.210
because strong acids and strong
bases don't form good buffers.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.120
But weak acids and strong bases
can generate good buffering

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.180
region because a strong base can
convert some of the weak acid

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.940
to its conjugate weak
base, and that creates

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.860
a buffer in this region.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.930
Then the pH starts
to change again.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.100
It's constant in the buffering
region, starts to change again.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.940
You get to the
equivalence point.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.870
The definition of
equivalence points

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.060
are the same-- equal
number of moles of acids

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.360
and base at the
equivalence point.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.200
But now the equivalence
point is not at pH 7 anymore.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.790
It's greater than pH 7 because
we've converted our weak acid

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.370
to its conjugate base.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.300
So up here we have
conjugate base,

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.340
which makes it more basic.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.560
And so the pH is greater than 7.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.530
And then the curve
goes up again.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:32.615
We also have something that's
special for a weak with strong

00:22:32.615 --> 00:22:35.670
titration that doesn't
exist with strong -strong,

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.370
and that's called the
half-equivalence point.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.260
The half-equivalence
point is the point

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.130
where half the volume and
half the number of moles

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.690
needed to reach the equivalence
point have been added.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.470
So that's the
half-equivalence point.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.300
It's half of the
equivalence point.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.250
So let's just look at these--
a couple of different points

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.530
here.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.550
And look at this figure here,
and we'll end with this.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.940
And I'm just going to
have my TAs come down

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:12.110
and just help me
with this last part.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:16.110
So let's see if we
can get two more.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.640
We already have
someone with a hat.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.070
You have a hat.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.597
We have two more TAs.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:29.030
So these are all
weak acids over here.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.390
So we have just our weak acids,
and we have four of them.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.200
Other TAs who want to
come down, can help out.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.060
This is volume equals 0.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.650
So this is like a weak
acid in water problem.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:46.290
So now let's bring our moles
of strong base over here.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:50.360
So now, Amanda, you're a
strong base, so you're 1.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:56.960
So you're going to react just
with one of these weak acids

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.300
deprotonate it and
form a conjugate base.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:23:59.850
There we go.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.260
And then you can go off and
form your salt and water.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.780
So now we have a
buffer situation.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.150
And we have a buffer
situation when

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:12.260
we have some conjugate acid
and some conjugate base.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.210
We have a special type
of category of buffer

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.300
at the half-equivalence
point, where

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.630
you have half the conjugate
S and half the conjugate A.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:24.020
So another mole of strong
base comes in and deprotonates

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.880
one of our acid.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.800
So why don't you be-- yeah,
and you go off and form a salt.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.310
And so then we have half
the weak acid and half

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.070
the conjugate base.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.680
Now, as we go on, we're going
to reach the equivalence point.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.990
And now we've added an
amount of strong base

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.850
that will fully
deprotonate our weak acid.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.100
So why don't we have two
more strong bases come along

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:47.840
and deprotonate.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.890
And so now we have
only weak bases left.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.200
There are just weak
bases left because we

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.830
added equal numbers of
moles of our strong base

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.890
as we had weak acid.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.670
So now we have conjugate base.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.820
So this is like a weak
base in water problem.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.284
And then at the end, if
we add more strong base,

00:25:08.284 --> 00:25:10.450
and a strong base comes
over, there's nothing to do.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.570
He's just strong
base in solution.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.320
And so this is a strong
base in water problem.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.070
So the point is one
titration problem

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:22.730
is really five different
types of acid base problems.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.930
So start problem set 7 early.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.080
See you on Wednesday.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.150
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.430
I have a feeling that
more people understand

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.610
how to do this, but
it's just a matter

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.690
of thinking about
the sign of things.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:26:04.190
So the trick here-- you
have a pH of 4, pKa of 4.19.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.540
And so, obviously,
it's the difference.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.610
But you have to
think about if you

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:14.820
want the ratio to be A minus
2 A, which expression you're

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.620
going to use here to
give you the correct one.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.720
So just pay attention
to your sign.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.520
Always show all your
work on an exam.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.330
So today, we're going
to finish the lecture

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.780
notes from last
time on titrations,

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.627
continue with titrations.

00:26:31.627 --> 00:26:33.210
And toward the end
of the class, we're

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.990
going to start the next unit,
which is oxidation reduction.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.140
So we want to take
out lecture note

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:45.770
23, top of page 4,
where we had this curve.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.340
So as we were
finishing last time,

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.000
we saw the curve for a
titration of a weak acid

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.630
with a strong base.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.530
And this is the
curve for a weak base

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.310
that's being titrated
traded with a strong acid.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.120
And drawing curves on an exams--
that's one of my favorite exam

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.850
questions So make sure
you know how to draw

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.070
these types of titrations.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.600
So things that you should pay
attention to in drawing them,

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.120
if it is a weak base
that's being titrated

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.730
with a strong acid,
you would expect

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:22.350
that before you've added
any acid, that you're

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.390
going to have a basic pH.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:29.950
So at point 0 here, you
would expect a basic pH.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.410
So then the pH starts
decreasing as you're

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.560
titrating in the strong acid.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:43.000
And you go into this
region of constant pH,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.870
where that's the
buffering region.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.970
So the pH is
changing very little.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:47.930
It plateaus.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.070
It's flat.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.140
So when you're drawing
a region like this,

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.100
make sure that in the curve
it looks kind of flat,

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.710
because the idea of
a buffering region

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.460
is that the pH
isn't changing much.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.340
Here you have the conjugate
acid and the conjugate base,

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.590
so it's a buffer-like problem.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.560
Then when you get out of
that buffering region,

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.880
the pH drops rapidly,
which is often

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.519
one of the funs in doing
these titrations in lab.

00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:11.310
Nothing's changing.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.980
Nothing's changing.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:12.771
Nothing's changing.

00:28:12.771 --> 00:28:14.630
And all of a sudden,
you're down here.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.300
So at the equivalence
point here,

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.470
the equivalence point is
going to be below pH 7

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.750
because at this point, you have
added the same number of moles

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.410
of acid as the weak base.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.410
So you've converted
all of the weak base

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:28.890
to its conjugate acid.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:32.640
So the pH is below 7, and
then it drops off rapidly.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.220
So again, in these
titration problems,

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.870
there are really five different
types of problems within them.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.140
When you have the
volume of zero,

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.130
it's a weak base
in water problem.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:48.270
In this buffering region
here, it's a buffer problem.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.550
And there's a special
kind of buffer problem

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.550
at the half-equivalence
point, where

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.250
the number of moles
of the conjugate acid

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.740
formed equal the number
of moles of baes.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.020
And then we get to
the equivalence point,

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.150
and now we've converted
all the weak base

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:04.390
to its conjugate acid.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.160
So this is just a weak
acid in water problem.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.870
And then down here, it's a
strong acid in water problem.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.510
So again, the trick
in doing these

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.030
is to recognize where
you are in the curve

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.130
and figure out what
type of problem it is.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.070
Once you figure out what
type of problem it is,

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.240
it's usually not
so bad to solve it

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.590
because you can all figure
out how to solve these five

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.770
types of problems.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.520
It's recognizing what type of
problem it is at various times

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.990
during the titration.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:33.820
and in some of the
problem set problems,

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.970
you'll have all of the
various points to do.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:37.470
But in an exam,
you're going to just

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.300
be thrown into the
middle of a titration

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.620
and have to think about where
it is in the midst of titration

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.030
what type of problem is it.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.260
So now we're going to go
through and do an example, work

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.030
point by point for a titration.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.040
And the titration
we're going to do

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.750
is a weak acid in a strong base.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.060
So that's the curve here.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.310
So we start at low
pH and then go up.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.280
So the particular problem
we're going to work--

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.880
and we're going to
work all these points.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.630
And then we're going
to have a bonus point

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.140
E at the end-- is formic acid.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.820
And we have 25 mLs of
0.1 molar formic acid.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.600
And we're titrating
with a strong base,

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.440
sodium hydroxide, 0.15 molar.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.320
And you're often going to
be given the Ka of the acid.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.100
So the first point,
point A, is volume zero.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.310
You haven't added any
of your strong base yet.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:36.430
So you can write the expression
for what's going on there.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.490
You have your acid
plus water going

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.750
to hydronium ion
concentration, and you're

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.510
forming the conjugate
base of that weak acid.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:50.340
So this is, again,
a weak acid problem.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.600
So you know how to do
weak acid problems.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.330
So titrations are
just a collection

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.560
of problems we've already
talked about how to do.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.820
So just very briefly, we'll
go through this pretty fast

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.520
at this point.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.140
So we have our
weak acid in water.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:11.400
We had 0.1 molar, and
we had none of the other

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.800
to begin with.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.340
So we're at zero volume here.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.970
So as the equilibrium is
reached, we have 0.10 minus x,

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.050
x, and x.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:25.580
So because this is a weak
acid in water problem,

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.170
we can use Ka to solve the
problem, which is our acid

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.920
ionization constant.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:36.280
It's 1.77 times 10 to the minus
4 for this particular one.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.640
We can set this up it's products
over reactants at equilibrium.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.090
So x squared over 0.10 minus x.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:46.540
Again, water doesn't fit in.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:49.290
That's our solvent, so
it's not in our expression.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.470
We can solve this
with the quadratic,

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:53.889
or we can assume
that x is small,

00:31:53.889 --> 00:31:55.930
which, again, is a pretty
good assumption usually

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.940
for a weak acid problem.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:03.440
And by assuming x is small, that
means this minus x drops out.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.810
So we're saying x is small
compared to the concentration

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.330
that we started with.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.430
And then we can solve for x.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:19.490
If we do that here, we get
0.00421, and that we can check,

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:24.740
and we find that it is 4.2%
of 0.1, so that's under 5%.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.200
So that assumption is OK.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.300
Again, I'm using the 5% rule.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.060
And then we can solve this.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.720
x is our hydronium
ion concentration.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.010
So we can plug that
in and get an answer.

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:41.190
But now I want you to tell me
how many sig figs this has.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.060
And to do that, you
have to figure out

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.914
how many sig figs were
actually in this number here.

00:32:45.914 --> 00:32:47.830
So you have to go back
and look at the problem

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.290
and figure out the total
number of sig figs.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.560
See how easy that was to fix?

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.630
So it is two,
because this had two,

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:09.950
and the concentration
was limiting here

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.800
to two significant figures.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.330
So there were two
here, which means

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.400
there are two after
the decimal point here.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.920
And I have to say I was
looking a problem set 7,

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.970
and some of those
problems are just

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.970
like if you love
significant figures,

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:27.620
they're a joy because you've
got adding and subtracting.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.660
And then you had division,
and then you have logs.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:37.900
It is the triple whammy
of sig fig love-- so two

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.200
after the decimal point.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.240
So we have 0.1.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.260
We have a pH that's acetic.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.450
That's good because
at the beginning,

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.380
all we have is a weak acid.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.110
So we have a pH of
2.38, so that's point A.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:58.080
So now let's look at this region
here in the buffering region.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.830
And again, the
buffering region is

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:02.120
when you have added
volumes of your acid

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.760
that are greater than zero but
less than the volume needed

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.780
to reach equilibrium.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.310
And so in this
particular problem,

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:10.070
we're going to
calculate what happens

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.460
when 5 mLs of our
strong base are added.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.219
So this is basically
point B here.

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:18.300
And because it's a
strong base, it's

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:22.290
going to react with all of
the same number of moles

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:23.679
of our weak acid.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.177
It's much stronger than
the conjugate base.

00:34:26.177 --> 00:34:28.510
So it's going to react pretty
much completely with this.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:32.460
So we can write out that
the weak acid plus our base

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.760
are going to be converted
over to the conjugate base

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.920
of this weak acid.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.070
So we can just
figure out the moles

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:45.190
and then subtract them to
understand how much is left

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.320
and how much is being formed.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.900
So first, then, we
need to figure out

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.020
how many moles we had initially.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:56.300
So for our acid, we had
25 mLs of 0.10 molar.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.360
So we have 2.5 times 10
to the minus 3 moles.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.770
For our hydroxide, our strong
base, we've added 5 mLs.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.890
And it was a 0.15
molar solution.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.460
So we 0.75 times 10
to the minus 3 moles.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.890
So now there's going
to be this reaction.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.990
So we want to think
about what happens

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:19.420
after you have the
reaction of the strong base

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.060
with the weak acid.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.710
And so just to
emphasize this point,

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:27.720
say we have 8 moles
of our acid here

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.970
and we added just 1
mole of our strong base.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:36.160
That will react, pull off,
deprotonate, and form water,

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.190
and form the conjugate base.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.040
So net we had eight.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.130
We added one of the strong base.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:44.380
So we have seven left.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.960
And we've formed one
of the conjugated base.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:53.400
And so I'm just showing this
here because so often on exams,

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.110
I see people just
plug the initial moles

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:59.200
into the later part, and
they forget that there's

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.770
a reaction happening.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.190
And so I was hoping
if I would show this,

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.840
I'm going to get people used
to thinking about, OK, I'm

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.900
adding strong base.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.670
What's happening?

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.470
How much is being converted?

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.680
And if you're not
subtracting things,

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.040
there's a problem with the
way you're doing the problem.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:20.680
So here, these are less
easy numbers to visualize.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.760
2.5 times 10 to the
minus 3 moles, how much

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.500
we had of our weak acid.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:30.760
We have added a strong base at
0.75 times 10 to the minus 3.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:35.660
So we have 1.75 times 10 to the
minus 3 moles of our acid left.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.050
So we subtract the amount that's
converted due to the addition

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.310
of the base.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:42.860
And so why don't you
tell me how much, then,

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.510
we're going to have of our
conjugate base being formed.

00:37:11.759 --> 00:37:13.300
So I kind of tried
to fool you there.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.440
But 70% of you
were not having it.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:24.350
So here, it's going to be equal
to the number of moles of a OH

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:28.170
that's added because that's how
much is going to be converted.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:31.420
That's how much of
the conjugate acid

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.230
is converted to
the conjugate base.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.220
Now, we have moles.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.030
We need molarity if
we're going to use a Ka

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.970
to solve the problem, because
the expression for equilibrium

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.480
constant has
molarity, not moles.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.120
So then in converting
to molarity,

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.650
the thing you have to
remember is the volume.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:38:00.220
So we had 25 mLs to start
with, and now we've added 5.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.630
So we need to make sure that
we have the correct number

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.520
of liters in our expressions.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.060
So we can calculate 1.75
times 10 to the minus 3 moles

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.970
for our weak acid, volume
concentration of weak acid.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:19.090
We have 0.75 times 10 to the
minus 3 of our conjugate base.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.180
And then we have a
concentration there.

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.360
Now, there are two ways
to solve this problem.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.970
And option one uses Ka.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:31.280
It doesn't involve
Henderson-Hasselbalch.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.830
Option two will involve
Henderson-Hasselbalch,

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:36.690
and it's OK to use this because
this is a buffer problem.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.550
So option one now for
calculating point B--

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.340
so we can set up
this expression.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.780
And always remember you're
talking about molarity here,

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.820
so don't put in your
moles in this expression.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:47.890
Only put in molarity.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.230
So that's why the
volume's really important.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:55.040
So we can put in our
concentration 0.0583,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.840
and it'll will be minus
x for equilibrium plus x

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.940
for our hydronioum ion
concentration and also

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:07.970
our concentration of the
conjugate base 0.0250 plus x.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:12.900
So this is like a buffer
problem, using option one.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.520
And so we can use Ka,
plug in our values.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.390
Here we have our conjugate
base concentration

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.880
at equilibrium
times our hydronium

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:28.120
ion, x over the equilibrium
molarity of our weak base.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.760
We can, again,
assume x is small,

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.550
which drops out the
plus x and the minus x.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.750
We solve for x.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:39.740
We get 4.13 times
10 to the minus 4.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.600
We can check the assumption.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:46.030
And sure enough, it's
much smaller, 1.7%,

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:49.380
0.7% of these two.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.920
And you really only
need to check one.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.820
The smaller one--
assumptions OK.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.170
And we can calculate
then by putting

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.710
in x, which is hydronium
ion concentration,

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.840
into the equation pH equals
minus log of the hydronium ion

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.500
concentration
equals the pH 3.38.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.650
We can also use
Henderson-Hasselbalch,

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.080
because it's a buffer problem.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.960
It's allowed.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.320
You were given the Ka.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:24.130
You can calculate pKa minus the
log of Ka and put that number

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.310
in, put in the concentrations
that you determined.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.300
So you still need to
subtract the moles.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.740
You can skip that step.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.950
But you can skip
the volume step.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.250
Because when you use
Henderson-Hasselbalch,

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:40.230
the volume would cancel
out if you had moles

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.560
per volume moles per volume.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.060
The volume's the same.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.300
So you can skip the calculating
molarity step here--

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.040
that simplifies the
problem-- and solve.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.130
And you should get
the exact same number,

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:53.330
or something was wrong.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:57.810
Both of these should
work equally well-- 3.38.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.300
But you'll often
be asked to check

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.360
the Henderson-Hasselbalch
assumption.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.770
And remember there was
an assumption here,

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:08.370
because we solved the
Henderson-Hasselbalch

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:12.270
from an equation that use
Ka, the equilibrium constant.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:15.360
So really this expression
is at equilibrium,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.580
but we're plugging in values
that are not at equilibrium.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.300
They're the initial
values that we're

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.960
putting into this equation.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.590
So we still need to check,
and we're using the 5% rule.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:29.280
So to check the
Henderson-Hasselbalch,

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.200
then, we have to back
calculate pH of 3.38

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.260
equals a hydronium ion
concentration of 4.2 times 10

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.010
to the minus 4.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:43.650
And then you want to check that
that number is less than 5%

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:44.810
of the smaller number.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:48.160
And we checked that assumption
when we looked at option A.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.260
So it's still good for
option B. And we can

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.100
use the HendersonHasselbalch.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:57.110
Now, if it was greater
than 5%, then you

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:59.360
can only use option one.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.150
And you must use the
quadratic equation.

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.570
But this doesn't
happen very often

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:07.600
because a buffer is usually
not a very good buffer

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.700
if x is not small.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.840
A buffer's a good boss for when
you have a weak conjugate acid

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.540
pair.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.010
And when you have weak
conjugate acids and bases, then

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.700
usually x is small.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.110
It doesn't ionized
much in water.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:23.660
So most of the time
these assumptions hold.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.770
But if you're asked to
check an assumption,

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:28.290
that's what you need to do.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:31.870
So we have point B two ways,
and we got the same answer.

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:33.560
It's 3.38.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.890
And that's point B, and we're
in the buffering region there.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.160
What about point C?

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.430
Point C is the
half-equivalence point.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.640
So let's think about
what the pH would be

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.400
at the half-equivalence point.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.860
So at the
half-equivalence point,

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.730
by definition, you've
added half the number

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:55.930
of moles you need to reach
the equivalence point, or half

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.510
the volume of the strong
base that you need

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:00.360
to reach the equivalence point.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:05.010
And at this point, the number
of moles of your weak acid

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:08.610
equal the number of moles
of your conjugate base.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:12.860
So when that is true and we look
at the Henderson-Hasselbalch

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:18.530
expression, we see that
this term becomes 1,

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:24.290
and so therefore pH equals pKa.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:29.200
So if you weren't given the pKa
and you were just given the Ka,

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.340
that's no problem because
you can calculate it--

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.320
minus log of Ka.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.530
And so that's minus log of
1.77 times 10 to the minus 4

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:46.300
for this problem, which
gives us a pH about 3.75.

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:51.950
So if you were just given the
pKa, which is for this 3.75,

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:53.940
and it's really not
much more significant

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:54.912
than that, honestly.

00:43:54.912 --> 00:43:57.370
And there actually not a lot
of significant figures when it

00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:00.960
comes to measuring pH or pKa's.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.390
If on a test it said,
the pKa of this is 3.75.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:08.940
What is the pH at the
half-equivalence point?

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:12.750
You could write down
3.75 and nothing else.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.540
You do not need to prove to
me that this expression here

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.730
is true at the
half-equivalence point.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.440
It's just a way to ask
a question that tests

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.820
your knowledge of titrations.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.520
So this is a good problem that
involves very little work,

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.240
so you should be extremely
excited if I'm asking you

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.330
about the pH at a
half-equivalence point,

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:33.910
because that's going to
be a real easy problem.

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:37.110
Don't spend a lot of time on it.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:41.250
So we got point C,
3.75-- very close.

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.650
We're sort of in this
region where the pH

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:47.510
is changing not that much.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.990
So that's the end
of that lecture.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:56.130
But the beginning of the next
one starts where we left off.

00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:00.780
As I said, acid base titration
problems take a long time.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.900
They're in two
handouts, and we're just

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.680
going to continue now with
the next handout and point

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.580
S, the equivalence point.
