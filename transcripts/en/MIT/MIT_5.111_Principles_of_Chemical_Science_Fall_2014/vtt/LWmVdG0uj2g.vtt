00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:39.190
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.900
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:00:58.385
OK.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.319
So let's look at this one.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:11.370
So first, you want to notice
that you have a plus 1 here.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.790
So you've lost an electron.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.530
And then you want to think
about what happens when you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.750
start filling the deorbitals.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.590
So when you start
filling the deorbitals,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.910
then the energy changes and
4s and 3d switch an energy.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.110
And so we could write
this one either way.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.980
We could have put the 3d
first and the 4s second.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.220
But importantly now, because
of that switch in energy,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.230
the electron that is lost is
lost from the 4s over here.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.650
So this has to do with the fact
that electron configuration

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.340
of neutral atoms and ions
are different and especially

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.670
with this 4s-3d switch, that the
3d orbitals drop, change energy

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.450
when you start to fill them.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.320
And there's really very similar
energy between 4s and 3d.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.680
And that leads to
some of the exceptions

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.170
that you're responsible
to know that there

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.510
can be subtle things that
switch the energy a little bit.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.050
So because they're
so close in energy,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.640
you have this half-filled
and full-filled thing

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.330
where you can pull
an electron from 4s

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.520
and put it in 3d to make
3d5 or to make 3d10.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.220
So they're very close in energy.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.060
And that leads to some of
these interesting features.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.720
OK.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.500
So today's lecture, we're
moving on to the periodic table.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.110
But we're actually talking
about a lot of the things

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.510
that we just talked about.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.740
So today actually
turns out to be

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.170
an awesome review for some
of the material that's

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.815
on the exams.

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:47.450
So that worked out really well.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.180
In past years, this
material was on exam 1.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.670
Exam 1 was later.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.070
And so if you get old exams from
other people, not the ones that

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.620
are posted, the
ones that are posted

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.990
are mostly old exams, except
we were placed questions

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.350
for material not covered on
this exam with material that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.340
is covered.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.990
So it's not 100% an old
exam from this class

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.650
because we've never had
an exam this early before.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.210
So there were no good examples.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.570
So if you get old exams
from other people,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.029
do not freak out
when you look at it,

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:21.070
and like, oh my goodness.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.210
Somehow I haven't learned this.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.810
There are today's
lecture and also

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.940
Friday's lecture we're
typically on exam 1.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.930
So just keep that in mind.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.710
So use our practice
exams and then you

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.120
will not have that problem.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.620
All right.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.895
So moving on to
the periodic table.

00:03:40.895 --> 00:03:43.890
This is very exciting for me.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.610
And so today, we're going
to talk about trends

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.070
in the periodic table.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.140
We're going to finish
that up on Friday

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.020
after the exam, which will
be a clicker competition.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.310
And then we're going
to go on to talk

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.690
about bonding of the elements
in the periodic table.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.170
So that's where we're headed.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.250
So the periodic table, here
is one of them that's up here.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.680
So this was originally
put together a while ago.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.380
And it turned out to
be amazingly accurate.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.780
And this really describes
all of the elements.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.019
So this is kind of like the
artist's paintbox for a chemist

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.860
or wordsmiths words.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.250
These are all the ingredients
that go into making everything.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.830
Some of these elements
are incredibly dangerous

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.510
and they're used
to make explosives.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.510
They're used to make bombs.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.300
Other elements here are
found in the human body

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.860
and allow us to live.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.060
All materials, whether
it's a desk, a pointer,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.440
a bottle of water, everything
is made up of elements.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.280
So this is one of
the reasons why

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.100
chemistry is so cool because
we think about the elements.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.970
And elements are
made of everything.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.580
So we think about everything
that makes up everything.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.810
And that's pretty neat.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.070
So just to kind of
give you a flavor

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.280
of the joy of the periodic
table and introduce you

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.130
to the elements that make
up this periodic table,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.980
I feel like we should
think about this in music.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.780
[MUSIC - THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS,
 "MEET THE ELEMENTS"]

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.300
[SINGING] Iron is a metal.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.910
You see it every day.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.190
Oxygen, eventually,
will make it rust away.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.180
Carbon in its
ordinary form is coal.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.010
Crush it together and
diamonds are born.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.010
Come on, come on and
meet the elements.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.628
May I introduce you to
our friends, the elements?

00:05:48.628 --> 00:05:54.840
Like a box of paints that are
mixed to make every shade,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.340
they either combine to
make a chemical compound

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.440
or stand alone as they are.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.798
Neon's a gas that lights up
the sign for a pizza place.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:10.790
The coins that you pay with
are copper, nickel, and zinc.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.452
Silicon and oxygen make
concrete bricks and glass.

00:06:15.452 --> 00:06:21.270
Now add some gold and silver
for some pizza place class.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.247
Come on, come on and
meet the elements.

00:06:24.247 --> 00:06:28.540
I think you should check out
the ones they call the elements.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:35.202
Like a box of paints that are
mixed to make every shade,

00:06:35.202 --> 00:06:38.513
they either combine to
make a chemical compound

00:06:38.513 --> 00:06:40.781
or stand alone as they are.

00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:41.280
OK.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.030
So you get the sense of this.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.440
The song is quite accurate.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.680
It has lots of information
[INAUDIBLE] them.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.170
And it points out
some other things

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.420
like elephants are
made of elements.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.590
And we're made of elephants--
oh no, wait-- elements.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.960
No, it's a really fun, fun song.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.030
And it really, I
think, expresses

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.730
why It's so important to
learn about the properties

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.520
of the elements
and all the things

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.000
that you can do with them.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.160
So when it was
originally put together,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.770
it was put together
based on sorting elements

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.010
by their properties, such as
ones over here in column 1

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.370
are soft and reactive metals.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.930
And it was observed that
the elements over here

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.190
are pretty inert.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.070
So they were all
grouped together.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.330
And later, we have pretty
much kept this grouping.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.110
But now, it's really grouped
by the electron configurations,

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.090
which is one of the things
you need to know for the exam,

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.840
how to write these
electron configurations.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.490
And these reactive
metals, it turns out,

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.690
they only have one
valence electron.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.530
So they like to react because
they want to have a noble gas

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.880
configuration, so they're very
reactive whereas these others

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.980
that were not reactive, have
filled electron configurations.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.896
So they don't want
any extra electrons

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.270
and they don't
want to lose them.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.400
They don't want to get any.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.810
They're very happy as they are.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.930
So they're inert.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.340
So now these groupings
make a lot of sense

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.590
in terms of the
electron configurations.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.770
Now, it doesn't
tell you everything.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.990
So if you know one element
is very safe to consume,

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.630
that doesn't necessarily
mean something right next

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.990
to it is just as good.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:28.190
And if we consider over here,
we consider lithium, sodium,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.280
and potassium,
sodium and potassium

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.840
are ions that are really
important in the human body.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.870
And you have to make sure that
if you're exercising a lot,

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.730
that you keep up the
amounts that you're getting.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.850
So they're very important ions.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.360
And they will often hang around
and serve as counter-ions

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.370
to other molecules in your body.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.830
You have citrate in your body.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.070
So you could have sodium citrate
where the sodium is hanging out

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.160
or potassium citrate.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.980
But that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.610
that other things will
work as well, like lithium,

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.670
for example.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:09.410
But a while ago when 7-Up soda
was first put on the market,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.560
they thought well, sodium and
potassium are a little boring.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.070
Let's sort of make things
a little more exciting

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.000
and use lithium citrate instead.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.790
It's right there in the same
column of the periodic table.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.510
And citrate makes
things taste lemony,

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.220
which is a lovely taste.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.700
And we'll have lithium as
the counter-ion to that.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.890
And so they said this
dispels hangovers.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.320
It takes the ouch out of grouch.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.555
And does anyone know what
lithium is used for today?

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.120
So it's often used
for people who

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.860
have bipolar disorders
or manic depressive.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.000
So it really did take
the ouch out of grouch.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.130
But it's not something
that you should just

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.500
put in a consumable soda.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.020
So it has somewhat
different properties,

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.320
even though it's part
of that same group.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.610
So this is a lesson
that I feel like we

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.220
keep learning over and over
again with other things,

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.860
that you have to be a
little more careful.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.180
Just because it's hanging
out near its friends,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.591
doesn't mean it's going
to be exactly the same.

00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:15.090
All right.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:19.150
So the periodic table
is an amazing thing.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.120
Let's think about the trends
in the periodic table.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.570
So we're going to first
do ionization energy.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.730
And we've already talked
about ionization energy.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.040
So this is awesome
because it turns out

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.380
to be a really good
review for the exam.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.570
So ionization energy,
again, is the minimum energy

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:41.360
it's going to take to remove
an electron from an atom.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.250
And if we just talk about-- just
say IE for ionization energy--

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.550
we're going to assume
it's the first ionization

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.180
energy unless it is specified.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:58.060
And we saw before that
ionization energy is opposite

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.800
in sign to the binding energy.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.040
And so here we have the
binding energy of an electron.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.490
And we know that this
is a multi-electron atom

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.080
because it depends on n and l.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.700
If it was just hydrogen or
one other one-electron atom,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.470
then anything with n, all
those orbitals, are degenerate.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.460
But if you have putting
in multi-electrons,

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.320
then it matters whether you're
talking about not just n,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.650
but l matters too, whether
it's an s orbital or p orbital.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.220
So we've seen this before.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.800
But now let's talk more about
different ionization energies.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.870
So let's look at boron and
think about the first ionization

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:39.670
energy.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.440
And this is the energy to move
an electron from the highest

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.494
occupied atomic orbital.

00:11:45.494 --> 00:11:46.660
That's what that stands for.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.440
And it's written
out in your notes.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:55.530
And so what is the highest
occupied orbital in this case?

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.650
Just yell it out.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.340
2p.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.880
So let's look at removing
an electron from 2p.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.980
If we do that, we
go to boron plus.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.210
And we have 1s2,
2s2, an electron.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.610
And this process, the energy
involved in this process,

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.320
is the ionization energy--
the first ionization energy.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.360
It's also equal to the binding
energy of the 2p electron.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.100
And again, the signs
are opposite here.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.400
So now second ionization
energy, we just keep going.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.860
The next highest occupied
atomic orbital is 2s.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:41.670
So if we remove, we get
boron plus 2 1s2, 2s1

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.610
and an electron.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:48.130
And now the energy difference is
due to these second ionization

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:48.710
energies.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.910
So we say IE2.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:56.316
And that is equal to the binding
energy of the 2s electron in B

00:12:56.316 --> 00:12:58.300
plus because that's
what we're removing.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:03.980
We're moving a 2s
electron from B plus here.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.200
So we can keep going.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.820
We can go to the third
ionization energy.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:15.950
And now we're also going to be
removing an electron from 2s.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.360
And when we remove the
electron, it only had one.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.790
So now we have a boron
plus 3 1s2 and an electron.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.540
The energy difference is the
third ionization energy--

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.200
IE sub 3.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.650
And this is equal to
the binding energy.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.930
Or the difference in sign
is the binding energy of 2s

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.624
in the plus 2 system.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.580
So now if we look at this
little table over here that's

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.120
in your handout or this
little chart in your handout,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.110
you can see that there is
quite a bit of difference

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.920
between these different
ionization energies.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.790
So we were talking about boron.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.020
So here we have the
first ionization energy,

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.190
second ionization energy,
third ionization energy,

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.520
and fourth ionization energy.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.930
And so there can be
quite a bit of difference

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.610
in the magnitude of
these ionization energies

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:17.700
or how hard it is to pull
off successive electrons.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.590
And so here are some of the
other ones you see when you're

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.300
going here with boron, you
remove the first one here,

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.220
the second one is about
three times harder.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.050
We're jumping from p to s.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.990
Not too much
difference within 2s.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:39.270
But once we get to
helium here, 1s2, that's

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.510
really hard to pull off
another electron here.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.000
So this fourth
one is really big.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.520
And then we can look
at these other trends.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.440
Beryllium here, we have the
2s and then we go to a 1s.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:57.200
And then we have just the one
electron over here for lithium.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.330
And then when we come up
here, it's a lot harder.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.140
So we can look at these
tables and realize

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.390
these are not going to
be necessarily the same.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.860
There can be big jumps
in ionization energy.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.300
And I'm going to come back
to all of this and sodium

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.040
and potassium in a little bit.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.670
But first, let's just stick
with boron for a minute

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.980
and think more about the
different kinds of ionization

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.260
there.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.840
So now let's just consider
taking a 2s electron,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.540
but from two different
types of boron-- boron

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.010
plus and regular boron.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.530
So in this first
case here, we're

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.390
going to take one of
these two s electrons.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.270
And now we have a
difference in energy.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.440
This is the second
ionization energy.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.800
The first one removed
the electron from p.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.795
So we saw this before.

00:15:44.795 --> 00:15:49.240
We're moving one of
the electrons from 2s.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.650
And so this is the
second ionization energy.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:55.270
It's also equal to the binding
energy of the 2s electron

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.240
in boron plus.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.690
Now we're going to
take a 2s electron.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.300
But we're going to
do it from boron.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.210
So the p electron
is still there.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.740
So we go from 2s2
to 2s1 over here.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.620
And this energy difference
is an ionization energy

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.430
for a 2s electron.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.430
And that's equal to
the binding energy

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.890
of the 2s electron in boron.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.920
So do you think these
energies are going

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.020
to be the same or different?

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.770
Are they equal?

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.820
No.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.759
So I showed you that
little chart and that

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:36.300
made you probably
think that there is

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.810
going to be some differences.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.470
No, they're not equal.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.560
So why are they not equal?

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.700
Well, when you have boron plus,
you have lost an electron.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.430
So you have less electrons
available to shield.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:57.880
So you have less shielding
in boron plus than in boron.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.090
And if there's less
shielding, you're

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.480
going to have a higher Z
effective, less shielding.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.819
They'll feel more of the
force of the positive charge

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.569
of the nucleus.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.329
And therefore, it's
going to take more energy

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:15.089
to pull it off.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:16.780
So it's going to be
more tightly bound.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.920
It's going to be held in because
of this less shielding, higher

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.410
Z effective.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.390
All right.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.885
So now let's try a
clicker question.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.068
10 more seconds.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.020
OK.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.410
So most of you did
not like answer 1.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.450
But does someone
want to explain this?

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.500
And do you want to just walk up?

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:44.170
Someone want to
give an answer why?

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.490
OK, over there.

00:18:48.939 --> 00:18:49.480
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:58.440
So if we're choosing between 2
and 3, the answer for number 2,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.470
the 3p orbital has
two electrons in it.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.820
And so the electrons, by
nature, kind of repulse

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.750
each other, right?

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.890
So it's a little easier
to pop one of those two

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:12.020
out than if there was only one
electron in there by itself

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.640
and you're trying
to pull it out.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.570
So yeah, you'd pick 2 over 3.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:18.960
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK, yeah.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.140
So actually, I don't know
if you can take the answer.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.460
It's a little hard to read it
with the colors on top of it.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.870
But here, you have
this plus system here.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.440
So you've removed
this extra electron.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.040
So there should be, you feel,
a higher Z effective here,

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.230
which will mean that it's harder
to sort of pull things off.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:48.300
And let's see this one.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.740
There's no way to take
the answer down, right?

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.670
So this one-- oh yeah.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.060
OK there, that's better.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.160
I can see this more.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.730
So this one here, you're pulling
one from the s orbitals here.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.840
The p orbital's
easier to pull it off.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.790
It takes less energy
from p than from s.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:08.290
OK.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.980
So let's continue.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.710
We'll come back to
some of these ideas

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.990
as we go along
because now, we're

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.330
going to think about
how these trends go

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.880
across the periodic table.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:28.310
So across a row, ionization
energy is going to increase.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:33.740
And the reason for this
is that Z is increasing.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:38.620
So we're having more and more
protons, a bigger Z effective.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.780
You're also adding
electrons though.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.640
But n, the shell,
remains the same.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.450
So if Z is increasing,
n is remaining the same,

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.490
what do you predict
about Z effective?

00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:00.040
Is it going to increase,
decrease, or stay the same?

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.780
It's going to increase.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.850
So Z effective
will also increase.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.910
And if you had a case
that every single time you

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.550
had total shielding of
that added electron,

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.470
then it might stay the same.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.250
But you're not going to have
this case, this extreme case

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.720
of total shielding.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.530
So if Z increased,
Z effective is also

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.090
going to increase
as you go across.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.970
And because n is
staying the same,

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.840
you have more or less the
same amount of distance

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.310
from the nucleus.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.830
So you just have this
stronger Z effective

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.970
and it's holding on
to the electrons.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:44.730
Now, if you go down a
column, the ionization energy

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.470
decreases.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:51.020
So in this case, you're
also increasing Z.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.150
But now you're
increasing n as well.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:59.440
And so when you increase n,
you have your 3s and you go

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.800
to your 4's and your 5's.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.960
And so now, those other
orbitals are way far away

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.810
and you have a much bigger
effective radius here.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.340
The Z is getting bigger.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.750
But it's not really
reaching as strongly out.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.080
So here, the effect
of increasing n

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.110
is making a much bigger
difference than increasing Z.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:28.310
So going across, we have this
increase in ionization energy

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.710
because Z effective
is increasing

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.644
while n is staying the
same or Z is increasing

00:22:34.644 --> 00:22:36.310
while n is staying
the same, which means

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.300
the effective is increasing.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:43.130
And going down, it's really n
that dominates that pattern.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.880
So you have a decrease
because you're

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.770
going to higher and higher n.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.510
So let's look at some of those.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:55.220
And we can go back and look at
it what I showed you before.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.570
I said I'd get back to
sodium and potassium here.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:04.210
So if we consider all these,
if we remove one electron,

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.240
then we're going to go to
a noble gas configuration.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:13.940
So with our first ionization
when we're over here,

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.490
we're going to go.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.260
And so when we do
that, then we say,

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.000
why are these numbers different
for the second ionization?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.670
We have a noble gas
configuration after we've

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.900
lost one electron in each case.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.220
But then we can say, OK,
well helium is up here,

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.760
then neon, then argon.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.670
So the ionization
energy is decreasing

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.210
as we go down here
because n is increasing.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:46.480
So we see that trend
in our plot over here.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.040
There's a couple other things
that we can see in this plot.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.360
So we also see that for boron,
this fourth ionization energy

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.820
is really big.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.720
And it's bigger than beryllium's
third, which is bigger

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.650
than lithium's second.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.959
So let's think about
why that's the case.

00:24:07.959 --> 00:24:09.500
And that is another
clicker question.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:01.550
OK.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.930
Let's just do 10 more seconds.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:19.670
Oops.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.960
All right.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.920
I was actually expecting
a lower number for this.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.580
That's awesome.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.080
Right.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.260
So it turns out 1 is true.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.640
But all of these
other ones are also

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.450
going to be the same
because they've just

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.740
lost more electrons.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.460
So all of them have
the same configuration.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.820
So that doesn't explain
what's going on here.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.570
And this is also true.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.930
But binding energies
are always negative.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.970
That does not explain anything.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.950
So the thing that explains
the trend is this one.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:00.840
Even though they all now
have the same configuration,

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.620
it's going to be a
lot harder to pull off

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.220
the electron from the one that
has the biggest Z effective

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.630
because that's going to
be bound more tightly.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:10.130
Great.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.800
So you're getting the hang
of these types of questions.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.790
All right.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.450
So those are some of the trends.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.600
And, of course, when
there are trends,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.430
there is always glitches.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.860
These aren't really exceptions.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.890
They are more glitches.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.810
And we can rationalize
them pretty easily.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:32.580
So again the trend, increasing
ionization energy across,

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.180
decreasing iron energy
down, the increase

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.400
across as the Z effective
increase, and down

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.590
is the increase in n.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.930
But when you actually look
at ionization energies, which

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:50.860
are often reported in
kilojoules per mole, versus Z,

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:56.260
you see that it's not just
kind of a straight line here.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:00.290
And if we put the elements on
here that these correspond to,

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:05.890
we see 1s1, 1s2, a
drop to 2s, and then

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.560
we're doing another
2s, a drop to 2p,

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.420
and then so on as
you go up along.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.230
So let's look at some of
these little glitches.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:19.170
Why isn't this a
straighter line here?

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:24.300
So I'm now going to blow up
this region on this slide here.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.510
And I can just put up
this diagram again.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.430
And you can see that it's true.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.600
So we're talking about the
first ionization energies here.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.180
We see lithium is lower
then it goes higher then

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.650
it goes down again.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.110
So that's that little
trend over here.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.070
So why is this the case?

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.060
So the ionization
energy for beryllium

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:49.400
is a bit higher than the
ionization energy for boron.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.490
And so it turns out
that this glitch then

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.241
is we're going from
the 2s to the 2p.

00:27:56.241 --> 00:28:00.480
And 2p, It's easier to
pull off that electron.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:06.360
So that's why you have this
lower ionization energy.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.920
We have another
glitch over here.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.280
Now we're just within p.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.540
So what's going on there?

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.980
And it's very small.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.120
It's a very small
little difference.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.280
But here, the ionization
energy for nitrogen

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.080
is bigger than for
oxygen. So it's easier

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.900
to pull off an
electron from oxygen.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.360
And if you draw out
your diagram here,

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.070
is nitrogen where we
have obeyed Hund's rules

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.530
and we put everything
in parallel.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.630
But for oxygen,
we have one extra.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.820
So we had to pair the electron.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.650
So it turns out
it's a little easier

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.910
to steal this 2p
electron because it's

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.690
the first one paired.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.120
And I kind of think about
that as, again, sort

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.650
of the bus where everyone sits.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.490
You can sit two people per seat.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.740
One person sits down, no one
else wants to sit next to them

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.650
until all the seats are taken.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.940
And sometimes when you're
sitting in the seat,

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.660
you're really, really, happy
when that person gets up

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.040
who's sitting next to you.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.660
Maybe there's another
seat available.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.530
They move over to another seat.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.040
So it's often easier to
eject the second person

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:13.790
from the seat.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.070
There's a little bit of
repulsion going on there.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.010
Everyone's working.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.730
They're moving their
arms as they're

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:20.520
doing their chemistry
homework, at least

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.825
the buses I'm on anyway.

00:29:21.825 --> 00:29:22.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:28.710
So that's why there's
a glitch there.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.390
All right.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.410
So this is all well and good.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:33.800
We have our trends.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.390
But I always like to think
about how do we know any of this

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.330
is really true?

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:43.080
How do you actually measure
these ionization energies?

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.850
And so we're just going to talk
about one method for measuring

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.580
these for a minute.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.890
So photoelectron
spectroscopy, PES,

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.710
is used to determine
ionization values.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.700
And so you can have
some energy that you

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.200
will use to excite
something like neon, which

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.490
is gas which lights up a
sign for a pizza place,

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.060
and you can inject
an electron from it

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.440
that has a certain
amount of kinetic energy.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.810
And what you actually
measure in this technique

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:16.940
is the velocity of the electron.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.860
But from velocity, as you know,
you can get kinetic energy.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.700
And from kinetic energy, we
can get ionization energy.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.660
So let's look at this experiment
and think about the electrons

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.890
being ejected.

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:34.720
So we have, again, our
neon configuration.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.450
And we'll lose one
electron from p here.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.810
And it will have a velocity
and a kinetic energy.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.580
We can also think about
losing an electron from s.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:51.550
And we're just going to lose
one electron per shell here.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:56.050
And we can lose an electron
from the 2s and the 1s.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.720
And all of those should
have distinct velocities

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.350
and distinct kinetic energies.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:08.840
So if we measure velocity,
calculate kinetic energy,

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.180
then we can find the
ionization energy

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.240
if we knew the energy that
we used to excite the neon.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.000
So the incident energy
equals ionization energy

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.560
plus kinetic energy.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.910
Or rewritten,
ionization energy equals

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.390
the incident energy
or initial energy

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.700
minus the kinetic energy.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.090
So we can use this to
calculate ionization energies.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.730
And this should look
awfully familiar to you.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:39.090
It's very similar
to something that

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:43.430
will be an exam 1 where we're
talking about using photons

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:46.880
and shooting them
at metal surfaces

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.260
and ejecting electrons
that have kinetic energy

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:55.780
if the energy used to hit the
metal is greater in energy

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.500
than the work
function and the extra

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.380
comes off in kinetic energy.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:04.341
This is basically all
the same idea here.

00:32:04.341 --> 00:32:04.840
All right.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.260
So in this particular
case, you would

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.110
measure three different
velocities or three

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.000
different kinetic energies.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.870
And now we can think about
what those should probably

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.630
correspond to using our
chemistry knowledge.

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.580
And some calculations here.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.480
So we have these three
different kinetic energies.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.130
We know the energy
of the incident.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:31.990
So we can do some math.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:40.210
And when we subtract those,
we get one energy of 22.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:44.360
And then this kinetic
energy is less.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.620
So we're going to get a higher
ionization energy of 48.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.740
And this is really small.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:57.710
And so now we get an
ionization energy of 870.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.770
And so we might not
necessarily know which

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.480
orbitals these correspond to.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.170
But if we think
about it, you should

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:08.490
have the lowest ionization
energy to take an electron out

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.890
of 2p, next would
be to 2s, and then

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.650
the hardest electron to
eject would be from the 1s.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:18.420
And these are pretty
similar to each other.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.130
But this is a much
bigger number over here.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:25.860
And so that's kind of
consistent with what we know.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:26.360
All right.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.850
So this is how you measure it.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:31.980
And again, this is a
multi-electron system.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.930
And so then the energy is going
to depend on the two quantum

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:35.750
numbers.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.360
It depends on l and n.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.078
It matters what specific
orbital you're talking about.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:49.510
So let's just think about
another problem here.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:54.350
Suppose you had five really
distinct kinetic energies.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.950
Assume that a very
distinct kinetic energy

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.220
means a different subshell.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:04.240
And so then we want
to think about what

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.060
are the possible elements
in the periodic table that

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.469
could produce a spectrum
with these five very,

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.620
very distinct kinetic energies?

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.830
And so the way you
think about this

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:20.460
is you want to find what
elements are going to have five

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.929
different kinds of orbitals.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:31.130
And so we can list the first
set here-- 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p,

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:32.960
that's five.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.480
And then you need to know
from the periodic table

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.276
where are the elements
where you're filling the 3p.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:46.210
And those are over here.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:50.560
So again, we talked and these
problems aren't on the exam.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.620
But on the exam,
you need to know

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.870
that this is 1s-- you're
filling 1s, you're filling 2s,

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.410
you're filling 2p,
you're filling 3s,

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.380
you're filling 3p-- that
you need to interpret.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.980
You'll be given
a periodic table.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.640
But you need to be able
to know what orbitals

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.420
are being filled in
the different parts

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.550
of the periodic table.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:13.543
So let's just try a
practice with that.

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:08.990
All right.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.480
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:36:28.392 --> 00:36:29.870
All right.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.764
So we might need to work
on the sort of counting.

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:42.290
So again, you want to think
about you have 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s,

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:50.070
3p, 4s, 3d, and 4p.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.550
So I think if we get the
counting down we'll be good.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.000
But again, you need to
look at the periodic table

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.840
and know what's getting filled.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.820
All right.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:04.010
So let's move on and talk
about electron affinity.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:09.200
And maybe we can squeeze in some
electronegativity at the end.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.420
These are very related
topics and pretty fast.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:14.920
All right.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:21.720
So electron affinity-- the
ability to gain electrons.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.610
So what we're
talking about here is

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:30.145
how likely atom X is to grab
an electron and become X minus.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.630
So we often think
about halogens when

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.960
we're talking about
this like chlorine.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:44.190
So we have Cl plus an
electron, Cl minus.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.100
And here the change
in energy associated

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:52.160
with gaining that electron is
minus 349 kilojoules per mole.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.800
Energy is released.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.870
And that means that the ion is
more stable than the parent.

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:03.070
So chloride is very
happy to become Cl minus.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:06.540
And so you think about
energy being released,

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.169
if you think about a kid--
my husband's out of town,

00:38:10.169 --> 00:38:11.960
so I was watching our
six-year-old daughter

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.000
this weekend.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.310
And she was racing around
like a crazy person

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.900
until she collapsed in a heap.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.280
So energy is released.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.930
And she became a more
stable six-year-old.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:25.660
So that's what's happening
with chloride as well-- more

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.260
or less.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:35.130
So here, the electron affinity
is minus the change in energy.

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:39.240
So if we talked about the
electron affinity of chloride

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.330
for the electron
to become Cl minus,

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:49.670
you would say that was plus
349 kilojoules per mole.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:55.450
So unlike ionization energy,
which is always what?

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:59.250
Positive or negative--
ionization energy?

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.910
Always positive.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:06.090
Electron affinity can
be positive or negative.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.310
And that tells you
something about how much

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.870
it wants to gain electrons.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:14.590
So nitrogen plus an
electron, going to N minus,

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:19.970
has a positive energy value
here and has a negative electron

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:21.100
affinity.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:28.750
So N minus-- the minus one ion
is less stable than its parent.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:33.680
So it is not as happy
as chloride to do this.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.210
So trends in ionization.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.640
Usually you have an
increase going across

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.310
and a decrease going down.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:49.140
And let's just
consider noble gases

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.050
and what you think about them.

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:53.596
So we'll do one final
clicker question.

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.090
It should be pretty fast.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.125
OK, ten seconds.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:33.650
OK, yup.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.370
They are, in fact, negative.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:38.450
And so we can think
about this over here.

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:42.010
Noble gases have negative
electron affinities.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:46.220
Noble gases are very
happy the way they are.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.430
If you had to add
another electron to them,

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.830
you would need to make
a new subshell there,

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.200
which they don't want to do.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.770
And so halogens,
on the other hand,

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:04.750
which are right next door,
have highest electron affinity.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.000
So if you're over here, they
want to gain an electron

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.530
and become a noble gas.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:11.900
Noble gases want to
stay the way they are.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.600
So the increase trend
ends right before you

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.170
get to the noble gases.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:19.030
They're in their own category.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.530
OK.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:21.120
So we're going to end with that.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:26.370
And we'll continue with
electronegativity on Friday.
