00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:27.050
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.390
So enzymes, of
course, are catalysts,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.240
and that leads us to our
next unit, which is kinetics.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.560
And it's our next
unit and, in fact,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.160
our last unit of the semester.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.792
So we're going to be talking
about kinetics for the rest

00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:42.750
of the semester, which
sounds like a long time,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.091
but it really isn't.

00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:44.590
All right.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.260
So we'll switch to
today's handout.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.310
So kinetics and thermodynamics
is a sort of yin-yang.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.240
You really have to think about
both of them at the same time.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.090
So when you're thinking
about whether a reaction will

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.190
go forward spontaneously, you're
thinking about thermodynamics.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.180
And you're thinking about
how fast that reaction is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.080
going to go, you're
thinking about kinetics.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.380
So let's just do
a little review.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.530
We've talked about this before,
but it's a clicker challenge.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.750
So today, let's think back
to thermodynamics and tell me

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.780
what stable/unstable refers to,
thinking about thermodynamics

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.100
and kinetics now.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.767
OK, 10 more seconds.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.190
OK.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.840
So most people got stability.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.620
When you're talking
about stable/unstable,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.340
you're not talking about rate.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.920
You are talking
about delta G. You're

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.000
talking about the
spontaneous tendency.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.200
A chemist, if it's
around a long time,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.080
would talk about it not being
stable, but being inert.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.120
And in terms of this
one here, if you're

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.670
thinking about the delta
G for the decomposition

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.350
into its elements, that versus
the delta G for formation,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.500
if that's negative then
it would be stable.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.241
But we want to be positive
for the decomposition.

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:47.740
All right.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.670
So let's just look
at this up here.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.600
So again, it refers to delta
G. And labile and inert

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.310
refers to the rate.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.650
And again, when you have a
negative delta G of formation,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.080
then that makes
something stable.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.160
OK.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.050
So thermodynamics, kinetics.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.280
We want to think about, is
the reaction spontaneous?

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.670
But we also need to think about
how long it's going to take.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.660
So rate is important.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.210
And so if we think about
the average rate of a Ferris

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.790
wheel-- I looked it up.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.960
It is 31.4 seconds
to spin around

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.790
if you're at an amusement park.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.140
And you can think about your
experience-- or sorry, that

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.900
should say imagine-- one
revolution for every 5 seconds

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.200
or every 5 hours would be a
very different experience.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.912
Five seconds would
be way too fast.

00:03:46.912 --> 00:03:48.620
You'd probably be
throwing up everywhere.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.000
In 5 hours, you'd be
like, oh, my goodness,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.600
get me off of this thing.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.320
So rate matters.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.600
And chemical kinetics
doesn't measure

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.180
the rate of Ferris wheels,
except maybe it does

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.190
if the ferrous is ferrous iron.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.530
Then we might be
talking about its rate

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.140
if it's spinning around doing
things in a chemical reaction.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.020
So we might think about the
concentration of ferrous iron

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.260
changing with time.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.130
So chemical kinetics
experiments,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.790
you measure concentrations and
think about how fast they're

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.880
changing with time.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.020
So let's think about
some of the factors that

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.710
are going to affect the
rates of chemical reactions,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.630
and we'll write some
of these on the board.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.720
So what's one thing that
you may have observed

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.280
that will affect, either
speed up or slow down, say,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.880
a chemical reaction?

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.494
What's one thing
you can think of?

00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:41.410
AUDIENCE: Temperature.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.701
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Temperature.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.743
What's another thing
you can think of?

00:04:48.743 --> 00:04:50.675
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:51.887
AUDIENCE: Catalysts.

00:04:51.887 --> 00:04:53.095
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Catalysts.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.450
So right, so changing
the sort of environment.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.510
So it depends a little.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.570
It could be pressure.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.000
It depends on what
you're talking about,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.490
what kind of nature of
material you're talking about.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.090
So possibly pressure
could have an effect.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:23.680
And that brings us to the
nature of the material,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.540
whether it's gas or
solid or other things.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.140
And that also comes to
the other issue, which

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.714
is, what is its mechanism?

00:05:32.714 --> 00:05:35.860
Oops, sorry, mechanism.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.350
So does it have one step?

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.550
Does it have many steps?

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.830
Do the steps involve
changes in phase?

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.380
What's going on
in the mechanism?

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.850
And so those are all
some good things.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.410
One other thing
that I'll put on,

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.930
which also only
applies in some cases,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.090
depending on the type of
mechanism and type of reaction,

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.940
would be the concentration of
the material, which kind of

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.810
also gets to this pressure
idea, depending on what it is.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.860
How much do you have in there?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.360
All right.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.109
So those are some of
the things, and we're

00:06:08.109 --> 00:06:11.790
going to talk about most
of these in the next unit.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.390
All right.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:20.900
So let's now think about one
example of a chemical reaction,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.700
and this chemical reaction is
called the oscillating clock.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.510
And before we see
the demo, we're

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.490
going to think about
what's happening.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.790
So this demo, as with
most chemical reactions,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.880
involves thermodynamics,
chemical equilibrium, kinetics.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.550
It also has some acid-base.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.250
You have to have some acid
in there to get it to go.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.820
It's also an
oxidation-reduction reaction.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.450
And it has colors, and we'll
see that the colors change

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.900
depending on what the
oxidation state of the material

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.810
is and also what its
liganded state is.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.760
So basically, in one
demo, you get every unit

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.890
that we've had in the
second half of the course.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.130
And that's kind of true
about any chemical reaction.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.540
Every chemical reaction,
if you're interested in it,

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.680
involves thinking about
all of these things

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.071
that we've been talking about.

00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:06.570
All right.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.150
So oscillating clock reaction.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.920
It's a fairly
complicated reaction.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.880
It has many steps,
and we're just

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.040
going to break the
overall reaction shown

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.460
here down into two steps today.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.370
As with many
reaction mechanisms,

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.550
there are multiple steps.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.320
But here is step 1
that we'll talk about,

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.050
and here is step 2
that we'll talk about.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:35.610
And step 1 occurs when your
I2 concentration is low.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.900
I2 here is a product
of the reaction,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.310
and when it builds up too much,
then that reaction will stop.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.150
And so in this reaction,
we have acidic conditions.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.720
You'll see our H+.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.840
And under those
acidic conditions,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.640
we're going to change
a clear solution--

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.160
so I, iodide, in its certain
oxidation states is clear.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.170
But when it goes to I2,
it turns an amber color.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.730
In the second reaction,
which will only

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.710
occur when I2 is high--
so this will build up,

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.730
shutting off reaction a
and starting reaction b.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.340
In this reaction, you have
a complex being formed,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.920
and that's going to
change the color.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.190
So we're going to go from
amber to a blue complex.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:26.710
All right.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.030
So before we see
this happen-- and I

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.790
should say that once
you get over here,

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.539
you find the blue complex.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.120
This will consume the
I2, which will cause

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.120
that to drop to be low again.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.570
And then you're going to
start reaction a again,

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.950
which, when your concentration's
built up too much,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.790
you'll start reaction b again.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.800
And so reaction a, then reaction
b, then reaction a, reaction b.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.380
And you'll notice that the
product of one of the reactions

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.630
is a substrate here, product
here, substrate here.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.450
So this goes back and
forth, hence the name

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.420
oscillating clock.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:01.920
All right.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.580
So before I show you
something pretty,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.260
I'm going to make
you do work and think

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.430
about the oxidation-reduction
reactions that are occurring

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.910
that you're going
to see that lead

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.560
to these specular color changes.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.090
All right.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.760
So here we go, clicker question.

00:09:37.249 --> 00:09:38.957
All right, let's just
do 10 more seconds.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.420
All right.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.340
So somebody asked
once, like, how

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.430
will I know that
it's a peroxide?

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.310
So I tried to help you
out and said reaction

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.110
with hydrogen peroxide.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.780
Let's see how many people-- some
people definitely noticed that.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.280
All right.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.570
So let's just take a look
over here at what's going on

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.480
and fill in our chart.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.820
So here the oxidation
state is plus 5.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.920
So we have now this oxygen
is its normal minus 2.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.630
So minus 2 times 3 minus
6 equals the whole thing.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.680
Charge needs to equal minus 1.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.330
So we need plus 5 there.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.040
And I2 is 0.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:37.260
The next one, I-, is being
oxidized to I2, minus 1 to 0.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.310
The oxygen in hydrogen
peroxide is being oxidized.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.300
So it's minus 1
here because we have

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.580
plus 2 for H and two oxygens.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.820
So that's minus 1 each to 0.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.490
And then, again, minus 1, and
oxygen and water is minus 2.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.600
So there's lots of
oxidation-reduction reactions

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.450
going on.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.130
And in fact, this occurs in
multiple different steps.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.340
So there's even more
different reactions going on

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.881
that I didn't even show you.

00:11:06.881 --> 00:11:07.380
All right.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.160
So we have one more
clicker question

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:14.155
to answer before we do the demo,
which is that if I told you--

00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:16.194
you want to think about
iodide you're using

00:11:16.194 --> 00:11:17.360
because it's changing color.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.340
Why are you using the
hydrogen peroxide?

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.150
So tell me what is true
about hydrogen peroxide

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.665
using the information given.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.510
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.990
All right.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.190
So if we look over here,
the large positive value.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.530
And again, it's a large positive
value of the standard reduction

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:18.090
potential is a big value,
which makes it a good oxidizing

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:18.750
agent.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.370
The reduction is spontaneous.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.780
So if you have a large positive
E for the reaction written

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.500
as a reduction, that means
that delta G for that reduction

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.300
is going to be negative,
which means it's spontaneous.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.010
So things that
like to be reduced

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.760
are good oxidizing agents.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.890
Actually, hydrogen peroxide is
a really good oxidizing agent,

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.030
and that's why it's
used in a lot of things.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.530
All right.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.600
So let's look at this demo now.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.430
So again, clear to
amber, amber to blue.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.750
And the reaction rate is also
sensitive to temperature,

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.550
and you told me temperature
does affect reaction rates,

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.040
and it does in this case.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.540
All right.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.299
Let's see it.

00:12:56.299 --> 00:12:56.840
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.640
So we've got the
hydrogen peroxide.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.806
Eric's got that in his hand.

00:12:59.806 --> 00:13:02.821
He's going to take that off
before he actually unscrews it.

00:13:02.821 --> 00:13:03.320
Yay.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.140
OK.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.579
Hydrogen peroxide, as we said,
it gets reduced really easily,

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:11.120
which is actually the reason
why we kept it in a plastic bag,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.890
because even the presence of
oxygen can cause it to react.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.950
So he's going to add solution b.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.930
That was solution a.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.560
Solution b contains
the iodate, which

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.002
is going to provide the-- huh?

00:13:25.002 --> 00:13:26.210
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Oh, sorry.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.035
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
got it stirring.

00:13:27.035 --> 00:13:27.470
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.080
AUDIENCE: It's
going to provide--

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.540
CATHERINE DRENNAN: I
forgot to turn this on.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.350
AUDIENCE: --the iodine
for the solution.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.750
And as you can see, it's
turning kind of yellowish, which

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.833
is what we were expecting.

00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:38.260
So now the iodate is starting
to produce the iodine.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:43.860
And when he adds solution
d, we can see it changing.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.615
Yay, it works.

00:13:46.615 --> 00:13:48.990
It's always a struggle whether
these things will actually

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.517
work, but this one
usually works very nicely.

00:13:51.517 --> 00:13:53.350
I'm going to turn this
up a little bit more.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.095
And it will actually
continue to do this

00:13:57.095 --> 00:13:58.650
for quite a while,
I think, right?

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.230
So--

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.230
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.583
AUDIENCE: Yay.

00:14:00.583 --> 00:14:01.560
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Awesome.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:01.970
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.136
CATHERINE DRENNAN: [LAUGHS].

00:14:03.136 --> 00:14:05.465
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:13.110
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.397
So we can move this
off to the side,

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:17.605
and now we're going to see
the effect of temperature.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.230
AUDIENCE: Actually, we'll
move that in a second.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.094
So as Cathy mentioned,
affecting temperature

00:14:29.094 --> 00:14:30.510
will affect the
rates of reaction.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.074
So this guy will continue to go.

00:14:32.074 --> 00:14:34.240
And what we have here is
we have all three solutions

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.382
again, except they've
been put in ice.

00:14:37.382 --> 00:14:38.840
So we're going to
see if we've kept

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.760
this a little bit cold again.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.259
You should have
taken the thing off.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.850
All right.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.076
So that's the peroxide.

00:14:46.076 --> 00:14:49.730
We've got solution b.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.630
You got it?

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.010
OK.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.893
And yeah, we're going to
stir in a second, after b.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.760
So as before, you saw the
temperature change kind

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.876
of quickly.

00:15:04.876 --> 00:15:06.750
This time it's not really
changing that much.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.470
So before, you saw temperatures
change pretty quickly.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.870
This is probably going to take
a while to actually change,

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.161
and it might not change at all.

00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:29.310
It's because the reaction
was so cold that you

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.660
won't have that second step.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.620
And also I can't-- there we go.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.010
So it happens really, really
slowly, as you can tell,

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.060
whereas this one happened
very, very quickly.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.236
So yay.

00:15:39.236 --> 00:15:40.235
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:15:40.235 --> 00:15:42.080
So example of many things.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.780
So we had chemical equilibrium.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.950
We had thermodynamics,
talking about which

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.640
reactions were spontaneous.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.870
So spontaneous until
making the amber.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:56.790
And then when it's made too
much of the iodide, the I2,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.480
then we see the
next reaction going

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.180
until we now have too little.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.769
And then we switch
back and forth.

00:16:01.769 --> 00:16:03.310
And yeah, this, I
think, very clearly

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.914
demonstrates that the
temperature is very different,

00:16:06.914 --> 00:16:08.080
has a very different effect.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.330
It's a much, much
slower reaction.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.210
All right.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:12.880
Thank you.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.100
We can leave them-- do you want
to just leave them up here?

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.920
AUDIENCE: I"m going to
leave this one up here.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.080
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah, OK.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.496
We'll leave the
fast one up there.

00:16:17.496 --> 00:16:19.450
It will eventually stop.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.660
So it's good probably, I
don't know, maybe five minutes

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.410
or more or a little longer.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:30.924
And then eventually it just kind
of stays this more dark brown.

00:16:30.924 --> 00:16:32.090
Maybe it's already happened.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.381
We'll see if it switches again.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.940
All right.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.040
So let's talk about measuring
reaction rates then,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.010
because we just saw
this reaction going

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.260
in another reaction rate.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.860
We saw the effect
of temperature.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.400
And let's think about
how we would actually go

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.370
about measuring some of these.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.110
So we can think about
measuring two different kinds

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.580
of rates-- an average rate
and an instantaneous rate.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.980
And so first let's talk
about measuring average rate.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.507
And to do that, I should
switch back over here.

00:17:02.507 --> 00:17:03.700
OK.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.791
So let's consider a
different reaction now,

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:07.290
one that's a little
less complicated

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.670
and kind of made up,
but it's a good example.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:15.160
NO2 plus CO goes to NO plus CO2.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.079
And so if you're
measuring a rate,

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.440
you could think about
measuring the decrease

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.859
in either of the reactants or
the increase in concentration

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.589
of either of the products.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.240
So in this case, let's
consider that we're

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.120
measuring the change in NO.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.130
And usually people
pick the thing

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.420
to measure based on
what's easiest to measure,

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.680
what kind of handle you are.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.140
Does it have a spectroscopic
signal or something else

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.230
that you can easily measure?

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.860
So here we have
concentration versus time.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.510
And so we should see
none in the beginning,

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.220
and then we should see it
increase and then level off.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.090
And we can calculate
an average rate,

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.480
which is just going to be
the change in concentration

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.340
over the change in time.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.900
We can also express
the average rate

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.860
as delta the
concentration of NO over

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.100
delta t, the change in time.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.390
And we can calculate
what that would be.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.840
We can pick an interval,
say, from 50 to 150.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.490
We can measure some
concentrations there and then

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.020
calculate the average
rate-- the change

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.260
in concentration
from the time 150

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.850
to the time 50 concentration
over that time interval.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.090
And it will give us an
answer, in this case,

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:36.040
1.3 times 10 to the
minus 4 molar per second.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:36.540
All right.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.340
Well, that could
be useful to know.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.940
But the average rate depends
on the time interval I picked.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.540
If I picked a different
time interval,

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.500
I might have gotten
a different rate.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.430
So instead of calculating
average rate, a lot of people

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:53.580
want to calculate instantaneous
rate, where you're asking,

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.140
what is the rate at a
particular time point?

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.690
So now let's talk about
instantaneous rate.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.960
We'll have the same
equation up there.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.650
Now, instantaneous
rate is defined

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.850
as the rate where you have a
limit of delta t, the change

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.640
in time, going to 0.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.580
You're comparing concentrations
at time t and time

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.650
t plus the interval dt
over this time change,

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.310
again, as you approach 0.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.690
You can also express
this as d change

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:34.430
in concentration of NO dt.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.600
And so as that change
in time approaches 0,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:45.080
then the rate becomes the
slope of the line tangent

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.220
to the curve at time t.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.720
So if we wanted, say, find
the instantaneous rate

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.390
at 150-- here's 150-- we
can draw a line tangent

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.550
to the curve at that time.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:04.890
So this would be
the point at 150,

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.070
and then we can
calculate the slope

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.460
to tell us the
instantaneous rate.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.010
So let's do that.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.050
We will calculate the slope.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.620
We have to look what
the concentrations are,

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.430
what the times are.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.170
And then the
instantaneous rate at 150

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.680
would be the slope of the line,
this change in concentration,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.620
over that time interval.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.170
And to the correct
significant figures--

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.220
there should be an
extra 0 in there--

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:38.520
7.70 times 10 to the
minus 5 molar per second.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.040
So that would be the
instantaneous rate,

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.460
again, the slope of the
line tangent to the curve

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.080
at time 150.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.790
So you could ask, what
is the instantaneous rate

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.700
at 100 seconds or
200 seconds, and get

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.600
that instantaneous rate.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.850
People are often talking
about initial rate.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.880
And by initial rate, they mean
the instantaneous rate at time

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.390
equals 0.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.030
So again, we have
two different rates.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:10.220
We have average rate
and instantaneous rate.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:15.595
So now let's think about rate
expressions and then rate laws.

00:21:15.595 --> 00:21:16.095
All right.

00:21:16.095 --> 00:21:21.420
So keeping with
that same reaction,

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:26.860
again, we could monitor
NO forming or CO2 forming,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.680
or we could monitor either of
our reactants disappearing.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.620
And if we assume that there's
no intermediates or very slow

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.220
steps, then we could say
that the rate of the reaction

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.470
should be equal to
the disappearance

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.660
of the concentration of
NO2, or decrease in NO2, one

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.030
of our reactants, over time.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:50.380
It should also be equal to
the disappearance of CO,

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.730
our other reactant
over time, and also

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:59.000
equal to the appearance
of NO with time, and also

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.020
equal to the appearance
of CO2 with time.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.780
And again, for these all
to be equal to each other,

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:11.660
we are assuming here there are
no intermediates being formed,

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.810
or that if we are
forming them, then

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.300
they're independent of time.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.140
In other words, if, say,
there was a large, slow step

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.380
somewhere in here, we might see
all the reactants disappear.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.760
But there'd be a lag before
the products would appear,

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.890
because more steps and
things are going on.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.380
So these are all
equal to each other

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.610
if you have no intermediates
or the intermediates are not

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.110
affecting the overall rate.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:42.460
So we could think about
this for a generic equation.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:47.070
So if we consider A plus
B going to C plus D,

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.384
when we're talking about
the rates of disappearance

00:22:49.384 --> 00:22:51.550
or appearance, we have to
remember the stoichiometry

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.790
of the reaction.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.920
So if we have a
stoichiometry of little a,

00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:02.890
then we would say minus 1/a dA
dt, stoichiometry of little b

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:09.860
for reactant B, minus 1/b dB dt.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:16.280
Then formation of products, 1/c
dC dt, and our other product,

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.595
1/d dD dt.

00:23:19.595 --> 00:23:20.450
I got through it.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.640
OK.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.130
So let's look at an
example reaction,

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.420
and why don't you tell me
what the rate is equal to.

00:23:34.094 --> 00:23:37.162
I didn't announce whether this
would be in the program or not.

00:23:37.162 --> 00:23:39.411
Why don't you look at the
results and make a decision?

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.765
OK, 10 seconds.

00:24:00.635 --> 00:24:03.130
All right.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.396
Still haven't gotten much into
the 90s, but still I'm happy.

00:24:06.396 --> 00:24:07.230
All right.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:11.660
So here, again, we're talking
about the disappearance

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.590
of our reactant.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:18.810
So it will be minus
1/2, and the formation

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.090
of one of our products
and the formation

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.851
of the other product as well.

00:24:24.851 --> 00:24:25.350
All right.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.410
So don't forget about the
stoichiometry of the reaction.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:33.770
So these are called
rate expressions,

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:37.590
and you don't want to get
that confused with rate laws.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.990
So a problem might ask,
write the rate expression.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.840
This is what it's looking for.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.560
If it says write
the rate law, it's

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.850
going to be looking for
the following thing.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:55.790
So a rate law is a relationship
between rate and concentration,

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.120
and they are related by a
proportionality constant,

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.580
little k, which is
called the rate constant.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.314
So big K is what?

00:25:05.314 --> 00:25:06.230
AUDIENCE: Equilibrium.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.000
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Equilibrium constant.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.661
Little k is a rate constant.

00:25:10.661 --> 00:25:11.160
All right.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.940
So let's look at a reaction.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.490
And so reaction of A
plus B going to C plus D,

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.570
the rate law could be
expressed, rate equals

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.950
rate constant k times
the concentration of A

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:31.800
to the m and B to the
n, where m and n are

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.390
the order of the reaction
in A and B respectively,

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.760
and k, again, is
our rate constant.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.260
All right.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:43.424
So let's look at what I call
the truth about rate laws.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.880
So the first thing, you cannot
just look at the stoichiometry

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:56.780
of the equation and say, oh,
it's going to have this m for A

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.760
based on its stoichiometry,
unless it's what's called

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.370
an elementary reaction.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.410
And we're going to get
to that on Wednesday

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.320
after Thanksgiving.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.370
Make sure you come Wednesday
after Thanksgiving.

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:08.900
That's the lecture on mechanism.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.150
It's a really important
lecture in kinetics.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.780
So we'll learn about
elementary reactions.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.760
So you can't just look
at the stoichiometry

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.130
and write the rate law.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.630
You need experiment.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.450
So the rate law is
not just limited

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.790
to reactants, although
largely it's true

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.500
that the rate laws will
just have reactants.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.860
It can also have a
product term, like C

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.960
could appear in the rate law.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.030
How would you know this?

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.970
Well, it would be
experiment would tell you

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.470
whether this was true or not.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:44.290
So for this rate law,
we saw this already,

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:49.980
the order of the
reaction in A is m,

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.250
and the order of the
reaction in B is n.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.270
And m and n can be integers.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.970
They can be fractions.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:03.280
They can be positive,
and they can be negative.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.380
So now we're going
to think about all

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:10.890
these different orders of
reaction and think about what--

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:14.680
and we'll do it just for
A-- what m is equal to.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.680
So we're going to fill
in this table here.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.120
And some of these things are
in your notes, some of them

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.690
you need to fill in.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.630
So we're going to
start with m equals 1,

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:29.380
and this is called a
first-order reaction.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:34.610
The rate law for this, the rate
would equal the rate constant

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.370
times the concentration
of A. And now

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.420
let's just think, if this is a
first-order reaction that just

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:47.750
depends on A, if you double the
concentration of A, what do you

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.771
expect will happen to the rate?

00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:51.823
AUDIENCE: It'll double.

00:27:51.823 --> 00:27:52.823
CATHERINE DRENNAN: What?

00:27:52.823 --> 00:27:53.570
AUDIENCE: Double.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.140
CATHERINE DRENNAN: It
will double, right.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.740
So in a first-order
reaction, you

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.810
double the concentration
of something,

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:00.950
and the rate will double.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.750
And this is how you figure out
what the order of the reaction

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:04.490
is.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.270
You double the
concentration of something,

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.650
leaving everything
else the same,

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.350
and see the effect on rate.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.150
So again, these are
experimentally determined.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.240
Now let's consider m equals 2.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.030
And notice the blue went away
here, but it's still there.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:20.811
So you can see it.

00:28:20.811 --> 00:28:21.310
All right.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:24.320
Second order-- what
does the rate equal?

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.780
So it would equal k,
our rate constant,

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.770
times the concentration
of A, and now we have a 2.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:34.350
So it's raised to the
power of m, and that's 2.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.070
So that's how we would write
the rate law for something that

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:41.220
was second order in A.
So now let's think about

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.253
if you double the
concentration of A,

00:28:43.253 --> 00:28:46.800
what you would you
observe for the rate?

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.970
What would happen?

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:49.890
AUDIENCE: Quadruple.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.850
CATHERINE DRENNAN: It
would quadruple, right.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.326
Now, what about if it triples?

00:28:56.326 --> 00:28:58.200
Why don't you tell me
what would happen then.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.127
All right, 10
seconds, very fast.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.990
90%, yes!

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.510
OK.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:31.210
So yes, 9 times.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:31.730
All right.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.370
And in problem set 9,
which is already posted,

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.820
there's all sorts of problems
where you see the effects,

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.891
and you can figure out what
the order of the reaction is.

00:29:40.891 --> 00:29:41.390
All right.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.760
So now let's consider
minus 1 over here,

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.690
which is often not
referred to by any name.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:52.150
The rate here would be equal
to k concentration of A

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.910
to the minus 1.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.130
And if we double the
concentration of this--

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.580
you can just yell out-- what
would happen to the rate?

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:00.905
AUDIENCE: Half.

00:30:00.905 --> 00:30:01.530
AUDIENCE: Half.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.130
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Half, yes.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.670
All right.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:11.080
Now, to m equals minus 1/2.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.040
So the rate here would
be k equals concentration

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.410
of A raised to the minus 1/2.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.200
And now if we double, that's
our last clicker question

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.510
on this sheet.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.214
So why don't you
tell me what happens,

00:30:26.214 --> 00:30:27.380
and this should be fast too.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:44.530
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.010
All right.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:05.470
So going back over
here, right, we

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:11.290
have 0.7 times, which
is 2 to the minus 1/2.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.510
And when you're
looking at the effects

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.270
of the rate on
concentration, you'll

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:16.630
see the concentration double.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:19.460
And you're like, what on
earth happened to the rate?

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.380
Keep in mind this minus 1/2,
because it's very hard to think

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.560
about what the relationship is.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.140
So again, they can be fractions,
positive, or negative.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:31.770
All right.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:37.000
So back up here now, this
actually is called half order.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.680
So we would have a
rate that is equal to k

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.880
times the concentration
of A raised to the 1/2.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.140
And if we double
that-- you can just

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.440
yell out-- what would happen?

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:55.260
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So
1.4 times the rate.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:59.440
And finally, m equals 0.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.910
What do you think that
is likely to be called?

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.200
AUDIENCE: Zero order.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.510
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
That is zero order.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:11.140
So at least some things
are pretty easy to guess.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.480
And if we think
about the rate, what

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.113
would the rate be equal to?

00:32:15.113 --> 00:32:16.040
AUDIENCE: k.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.500
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Just k, right.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.700
It's just going
to be equal to k.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:25.670
So zero order, the
A term is not there.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.210
So if we double the
concentration of something

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.040
that is zero order, what
happens to the rate?

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.950
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.366
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Nothing, right.

00:32:33.366 --> 00:32:34.670
No effect on rate.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:38.420
The concentration term
isn't part of the equation.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.260
So the problem set 9 will
have a lot of experiments,

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.350
and you need to
figure out by looking

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:48.640
at what is happening what
the order of the reaction is.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.580
Is it doubling when
you double the rate?

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.840
Is it quadrupling?

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.310
Is it doing some
weird thing that

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.290
seems to be a negative--
an inverse fraction?

00:32:56.290 --> 00:33:00.040
And that will allow you to
figure out what the order is.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.100
OK.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.810
So once you figure out
the order of the reaction,

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.130
then the next truth
about rate laws

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:12.480
is that the overall
order of the reaction

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.640
is just the sum of the
exponents in the rate law.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.100
So for example, if
we had this reaction,

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.790
what would be the overall order?

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.182
You can just yell it out.

00:33:25.182 --> 00:33:25.952
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:33:25.952 --> 00:33:26.910
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yep.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.130
It would be a third order.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.070
The order would be 3.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.290
Now, some people get
this wrong on the test.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.110
It's like, no, you want
to save your points

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.730
for something that's hard.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.800
2 plus 1 is 3.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.770
So remember that.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:42.320
OK.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.540
And this would be then
second order in A.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:51.170
You would say that's first
order in B, overall third order.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:52.870
So if you're going
to lose points

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:56.440
on an exam on this
material, I recommend

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.890
losing them determining
the units for the rate

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.490
constant, because
that's much more

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.790
complicated than figuring
out the overall order

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:03.930
of the reaction.

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:07.500
The units, it
depends on the order.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.860
You can have squared.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.429
You can have molar
squared, quadrupled,

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.630
molar to the minus fractions.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.210
All sorts of crazy things
happen in your units

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:17.449
of rate constants.

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:19.929
So save your points if
you're going to lose some.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.384
And I think it would be
great if everyone got 100,

00:34:22.384 --> 00:34:24.550
but if you're going to lose
some, lose some on that.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.440
That's harder.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.500
OK.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.360
So we'll end there for today.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.780
And Wednesday, we're going to
be talking about integrated rate

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:39.639
laws, half-life for first
order, nuclear chemistry.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:44.920
It's going to be very exciting
and slightly radioactive.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.406
So where were we?

00:34:46.406 --> 00:34:49.920
We were talking about
the fact about how

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:55.150
you measure instantaneous
rates and average rates.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.640
And one of the issues of
doing kinetics experiments,

00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.690
it's all experimental.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.090
You want to measure things.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:04.370
But it can be very challenging
to measure initial rates,

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.010
because you're often talking
about a very small change

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.610
in concentration.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.480
And so it can be
helpful sometimes

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.950
to use integrated
rate laws, which

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.950
allow you to measure a lot
of different concentrations

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:25.980
as times elapses and plot that
data to get out rate constants

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.340
and things like that.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:31.410
So we're going to talk
about integrated rate laws.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:35.630
And so the alternative, then,
is to use this integrated rate

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:36.220
law.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:40.350
Again, expresses concentrations
directly as a function of time

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:43.550
and gets at this
small changes problem.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.050
All right.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.010
So we're going to talk
about first order now,

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.560
and then we'll talk about
second order in a little bit.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.970
So for a first-order equation,
we have A going to B.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:58.470
And we learned last time
that we can write a rate

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:03.110
expression for a first-order
process, or for this process

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:03.730
here.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:05.640
So we could talk about
the rate expression

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:12.070
as the disappearance of A
minus d concentration of A dt.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:18.110
We can also write the rate law
for a first-order equation,

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.500
and that would be k,
our rate constant,

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.330
times our concentration.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:26.180
So the rate expression
has the d dt,

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.381
and the rate law has k,
our rate constant, in it.

00:36:30.381 --> 00:36:30.880
All right.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:34.160
So using these two things
that we learned last time,

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.160
we can do a derivation to get
our integrated first-order rate

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.350
law.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:43.440
So in this derivation,
we're going

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.050
to separate our concentration
terms on one side and our time

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.970
terms on the other side.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:55.120
So we're going to bring over our
concentration of A over here.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.070
So we'll divide by the
concentration of A.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:01.820
We have our d concentration
of A term from here.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.680
We're going to take our minus
sign, put it on the other side.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.260
And we're going to take
our dt, our time term,

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.420
and put it over there as
well with our rate constant.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.030
So we have the terms that have
concentration of A on one side,

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:18.090
and we have our terms with rate
constant and time on the other.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:21.100
Now we can integrate
both sides, and we

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:25.600
will integrate from our
original concentration of A.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.930
So that's A to the O, for
our original concentration,

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:34.500
up to concentration at whatever
time t we stop the experiment

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.150
and through all the
times in between, over 1

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.930
over the concentration of A dA.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:44.810
And on the other side, we have
our minus rate constant k,

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.930
and we're looking at the
time from time 0 to time t,

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:50.230
when we stop the experiment.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.730
All right.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.250
So we can take this
expression now and move it up,

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.140
because I have more
derivations to go.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.800
So I'm going to put it
on the top of the screen.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.050
And now I am going to solve it.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:05.070
So this integral solves
to the natural log

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.470
of the concentration
of A at time t

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.996
minus the natural log of our
original concentration of A,

00:38:11.996 --> 00:38:15.700
on the other side
minus kt, our time.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.490
So there are two ways we
can rewrite this equation.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:22.730
We can write it as the
equation for a straight line.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:26.760
And all I did was take
this natural log of A0,

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.540
or A original over here.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.310
And we could also
rearrange this term.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:37.050
Instead of minus,
we have natural log

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:39.250
of the concentration
of A at time t

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.540
over our original concentration.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:47.390
And now we can take the inverse
natural log of both sides.

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:50.860
And so we get rid of natural
log here, and on the other side

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.770
we have e to the minus kt,
again, the rate constant times

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.890
the time.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:00.330
And then I can write
it-- break this out here,

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.420
moving the original
concentration of A

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.470
to this side.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:06.980
And now this is the equation for
the integrated first-order rate

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.860
law, where you have
the concentration of A

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:14.070
at some point t equals
its original concentration

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:18.440
times e to the minus k, the
rate constant, times the time.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.960
So if you know a rate constant
and how much time has elapsed,

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.760
and you know how much you
have of something originally,

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.580
you can figure out how
much you should have now.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:34.091
Or if you figure out how the
concentration changes over time

00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:35.590
and how much you
had originally, you

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:40.250
can calculate the rate constant
for that particular material.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:43.630
And you can do those
calculations for rate constants

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:47.830
by plotting, using this
equation for a straight line.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:52.070
So here I'm going to
plot natural log of A.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:53.690
So I measured the
concentration of A

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:58.250
at various different
times against time.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.214
And we have an equation
for a straight line.

00:40:00.214 --> 00:40:01.880
So we should get a
straight line if this

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.084
is a first-order process.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.170
And so what would
this be up here?

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.470
What is the y-intercept?

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.738
What is it?

00:40:17.738 --> 00:40:20.020
AUDIENCE: Natural log of
the original concentration.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.020
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.610
So that's the natural log of
our original concentration.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:29.253
And this you can yell more
loudly-- what is our slope?

00:40:29.253 --> 00:40:30.730
AUDIENCE: Minus k.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.154
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yes.

00:40:32.154 --> 00:40:33.820
It's a little bit
easier to yell loudly.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.900
Minus k.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.100
So you can
experimentally determine

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.730
the rate constant from this.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.760
So if you measure
how the concentration

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.430
of A changes with
time, plot your data,

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.180
natural log of those
concentrations versus time,

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.460
get a lot of data
points, from the slope

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.070
you can measure
the rate constant.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:54.900
And so rate constants for a
lot of different materials

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.050
have already been measured
in this kind of way.

00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:58.550
All right.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:02.830
So for a first-order process,
these are important equations.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.100
But also for first
order, we spend

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:09.200
a lot of time talking
about half-life.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.040
So half-life is
the time it takes

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:16.740
for half of the original
material to go away.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.850
So it's a really easy thing.

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.100
I like it when things
are called what they are.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:26.740
And here the time involved has
a little special abbreviation,

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.450
t 1/2.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.410
So whenever you
see t 1/2, that's

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.470
talking about a half-life.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:35.740
So we can derive this
expression as well

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:39.290
for the first-order half-life
using the expressions that we

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:43.090
just looked at, so
from the expression

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:45.540
we had above, where
we had the natural log

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.960
of the concentration
of A at time

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.100
t over our original
concentration

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.350
equals minus the rate
constant k times time.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.050
And now we can substitute in.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:56.020
So we're not interested
in just any old time.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.010
We're interested in
time 1/2, so we're going

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.510
to want to put a 1/2 in there.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:03.900
And that is the time it
takes for the original amount

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.350
to go to half, so
to be divided by 2.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.640
So we can put that in.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.730
So now our At, our
concentration of A at time t,

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:15.970
is our original
concentration divided by 2,

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:18.930
and our t is t 1/2.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:23.320
So you'll see that the A0
terms are going to cancel out.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.040
And you're going to end
up with natural log of 1/2

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.810
equals minus k times
our half-life, t 1/2.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:35.220
And so then we can put in
our value for the natural log

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.620
of 1/2 and get rid of all those
minus signs and rearrange it.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.870
And so then our half-life
for this first-order process

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:47.430
is going to be equal
to 0.9631 divided

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.290
by k, the rate constant.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:53.510
So you'll note a couple of
perhaps important things

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.060
about this expression.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.690
And one of the
important things is

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.350
that half-life doesn't
depend on the concentration.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.860
So the concentration
term has dropped out.

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.120
So what does half-life
depend on then

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.160
if it doesn't depend
on the concentration?

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.730
Again, this is for first order.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:12.670
So it's going to depend on k.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.130
That's all that's in there.

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:15.755
There's only one
thing that's in there.

00:43:15.755 --> 00:43:18.140
There's a number, a
constant, and there's k.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.980
So half-life depends on
k, this rate constant,

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.430
and the rate constant depends
on the material in question.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.467
So different materials
will have different values

00:43:27.467 --> 00:43:28.175
of rate constant.

00:43:28.175 --> 00:43:30.530
And we just saw how you can
calculate a rate constant.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.960
You can measure it and
get the slope of the line

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.670
and tells you about what k is.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:36.170
All right.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.400
So let's use this
expression now.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.580
And why don't you tell
me for the same material,

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.257
which of these events
will take longer.

00:43:54.197 --> 00:43:55.503
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:12.360
So it takes, in fact,
the same amount of time,

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.710
because the concentration
doesn't show up in there,

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.250
and it was the same material.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:18.750
All right.

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.350
So before we move
away from this,

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:23.870
you can write same amount
of time in your notes.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:27.190
Let's take a look at this
plot on the bottom of the page

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:29.460
and just think about
what's happening.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.360
Because you can talk
about a first half-life

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.910
and a second half-life
and a third half-life.

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:35.970
So we can just
fill this right in.

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:40.470
So for a concentration at
your first half-life, how much

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.750
is left?

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:43.850
So what's this number?

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:46.570
The concentration is what?

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:47.830
Half.

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:49.230
Second half-life,
what do we got?

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.170
AUDIENCE: 0.25.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:52.170
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 0.25.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:52.669
Third?

00:44:52.669 --> 00:44:53.730
AUDIENCE: 0.125.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.110
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 0.125, right.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.714
So this is pretty
easy to think about.

00:44:56.714 --> 00:44:59.130
But sometimes when you have
data and you're looking at it,

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.130
you have to remember what the
sort of possibilities are.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:02.940
OK.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.025
So that's first-order
half-life, and that's

00:45:05.025 --> 00:45:06.025
the end of this lecture.

00:45:06.025 --> 00:45:09.420
But we're not really
moving away from the topic,

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.790
because now we're going
to talk about an example

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:16.650
of a first-order process,
which is radioactive decay.
