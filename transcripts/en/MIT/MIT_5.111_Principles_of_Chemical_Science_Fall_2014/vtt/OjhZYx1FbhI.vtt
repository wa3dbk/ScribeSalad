00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:27.620
CATHY DRENNAN: So
now, we're going

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.220
to move on to talk about
spontaneous change.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.076
And so this is today's handout.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.790
So spontaneous
reaction is a reaction

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.010
that proceeds in the
forward direction

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.600
without any kind of
outside intervention,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.180
like heat being
added, for example.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.630
It just goes in that direction.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.170
So we can talk about
the following reactions

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.880
are spontaneous at
constant pressure.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.440
And we'll see later
that temperature

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.180
can make a difference between
whether something's spontaneous

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.570
or not.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.850
But constant pressure, here's
an example, iron plus oxygen.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.310
And what is this in
layman's term an example of?

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.030
AUDIENCE: Rust.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.080
CATHY DRENNAN: Rust, yes.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.100
And many of you are
probably aware of this,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.850
rust is a spontaneous process.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.270
It's something that people
try to do something about.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.110
You don't want your car to rust.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.740
If you're new to New
England and you're

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.750
from a part of the country
that doesn't get so cold,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.000
you'll look at people's
cars and you're like, wow,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.500
look at all that
rust all over them.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.720
Yes, rust happens,
especially in New England.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.640
And delta H here is negative.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.575
Is this endothermic
or exothermic?

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:01.450
AUDIENCE: Exothermic.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.840
CATHY DRENNAN:
Exothermic, minus 824.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.990
Here is another
spontaneous process.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.270
This molecule is ATP.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.890
And it will hydrolyze, which
means react with water,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.440
forming ADP.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.070
So ATP is triphosphate.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.140
ADP is diphosphate.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.890
So one of the
phosphates-- and here's

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.930
the phosphate-- comes off.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.860
It hydrolyzes off.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.780
And this is a
spontaneous process.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.700
And we also have a delta H0 of
minus 24 kilojoules per mole.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.380
And remember, when we
oxidize glucose in our body,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.940
we store that energy in ATP.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.150
And we want that
ATP to be around.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.190
And then when we break ATP
apart, it releases the energy.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.160
So this is a very important
biological process.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.690
And you have a negative
value, exothermic reaction.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.570
But there's a few other examples
of spontaneous reactions.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.910
One of them is this one.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.164
And we've probably
all experienced this.

00:03:09.164 --> 00:03:10.580
If you're from New
England, you've

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.110
seen snow melt or ice
melt, solid to liquid.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.150
If you're from a hot
part of the world,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.470
you probably had ice cubes in
your nice, refreshing drink

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.850
with maybe a little
umbrella on the top.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.220
Anyway, everyone, I
think, has seen ice melt.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.820
But here, delta H0
is of positive value.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.710
It's endothermic.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.370
Also, if you have
ammonium nitrate,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.680
this will just come apart
in a spontaneous reaction.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.110
Delta H here is plus
28 kilojoules per mole.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.880
So is delta H the
key to spontaneity?

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.550
It is not-- plays
into it, but it is not

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.440
the determining factor.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.170
So if delta H0 is not the
key to spontaneity, what is?

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.680
It is free energy, yes,
particularly Gibbs free energy,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.760
or delta G. And I'm
really happy they decided

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.020
to add the Gibbs free energy,
because another thing of energy

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.190
would be a lot.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.435
So having this free energy
having abbreviation of G,

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:33.320
I think is a good thing--
so Gibbs free energy.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.260
So Gibbs free energy
depends on delta H.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.150
But it also depends
on another term,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:48.070
which is T delta S-- temperature
and delta S, change in entropy.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.180
So delta G is the predictor
of whether a reaction will

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.980
go in the forward direction in
a spontaneous fashion or not.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.840
So let's just think
about the sign of delta G

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.120
and what it means.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.230
So again, at constant
temperature and pressure

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.410
here, delta G less than
0, negative delta G,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.960
is that spontaneous or not?

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.196
AUDIENCE: Spontaneous.

00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:18.480
CATHY DRENNAN: Spontaneous.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.750
Positive delta G is not
spontaneous, non-spontaneous.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.110
And delta G equals 0.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.840
It's one of the other things
that I am very fond of,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.642
which is equilibrium.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.530
So delta G indicates whether
something is spontaneous

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.070
or not.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.020
Negative value, spontaneous
in the forward direction.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.870
Positive value, not spontaneous
in the forward direction.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.400
And equilibrium, the thing we
all try to reach in our lives.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.800
So let's look at an
example and calculate

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.950
what delta G is going to be.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.100
So we saw this equation already.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.810
We have a positive delta H0.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.980
And now, I'm telling you
that delta S0 is also

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.940
a positive value.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.100
So we can use this equation.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.840
And this is really one of
the most important equations

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.240
in chemistry.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.520
Figuring out this equation was
really a crowning achievement.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.370
And you'll be using it a lot.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.450
Not just in this
unit, but pretty much

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.630
in every unit from now on, you
will be using this equation.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.459
So room temperature, pretty much
we're not doing-- occasionally,

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.250
we'll do something not
at room temperature,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.560
but we like room temperature.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.360
And we like it in Kelvin.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.030
So delta G0, so we plug
in our delta H value.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.940
So it's going to equal delta
H minus the temperature.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.320
And if the temperature
isn't given in a problem,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.130
you can assume that it's 298.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.380
And now we need to
plug in delta S.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.280
But I left a blank here
to make a point, which

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.400
is that delta S's are
almost always given

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.930
in joules per kelvin per mole.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.620
But everything else is
given in kilojoules.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.005
So you want to make sure
you convert your units,

00:07:10.005 --> 00:07:13.470
or you're going to come up with
very funky answers at the end.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:20.000
So from joules to kilojoules,
so now plus 0.109 kilojoules

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.110
per kelvin per mole.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.750
And we can do this out now.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.830
So we have plus 28 minus 32.48.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.700
And why don't you tell me
how many significant figures

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.881
this answer has.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.190
10 more seconds.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.630
So at least some
people got it right.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:20.680
We've identified once
again a weakness, so rules

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.060
of adding and subtracting.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.510
So we have 28 here minus 32.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.260
There are no significant figures
after the decimal point here.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.720
So we're just left with 4.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.010
So when we're doing
multiplication or division,

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.520
we consider the total number
of significant figures.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.539
But with addition
and subtraction,

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.950
you gotta pay attention to
where the decimal point is.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.880
And when we get into the
next unit, there are logs.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.410
And those have special rules
of significant figures.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.050
Yes, very exciting.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:05.780
So delta G0 is negative here,
although delta H is positive.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.650
So this reaction is spontaneous.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.900
It's not hugely.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:15.270
It's a pretty small number,
but still, it's spontaneous.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.230
So let's consider
our friend over

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.990
here that we've been talking
about-- glucose being oxidized

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.510
to CO2 and water.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.180
You practically should
have the delta H memorized

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.560
for that at this point.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.370
Now, I'm telling you
what the delta S0 is.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.740
And it's positive 233
joules per kelvin per mole.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.070
And we can plug this
into our equation

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:42.520
to calculate a delta G0, again
remembering to convert joules

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.730
to kilojoules to do this.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:54.970
And so now, we see that it has
a very negative delta G0 here,

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:01.110
minus 2,885 kilojoules per
mole at room temperature.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.450
So at room temperature,
this reaction

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.300
is spontaneous but slow.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.200
We saw that with the candies
that had glucose in it.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.820
We opened them up,
and no water or CO2

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.890
were obviously being
liberated in this reaction,

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.230
because it is slow.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.930
And now, a clicker question.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.470
I want you to tell
me whether it would

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.345
be spontaneous at different
temperatures or not?

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.820
10 more seconds.

00:11:02.936 --> 00:11:03.920
Yep.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.300
So it is spontaneous
at all temperatures.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.470
Not all reactions
are, but this one is.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.060
So if we go back
here, the reaction

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.550
is spontaneous at
all temperatures.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.220
And that's because,
to be spontaneous,

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.720
you want a delta
G that's negative.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.150
If delta H is negative
and delta S is positive,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.590
then you'll have a
negative minus a negative.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.740
So it doesn't matter
what temperature is.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.940
This will always yield
a negative delta G0.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.980
So other reactions, that
might not be the case.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.510
But if you have negative delta
H and a positive delta S,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.660
it will be spontaneous.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.080
So negative delta H, again,
exothermic, heat release.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.280
And a positive entropy
is a favorable thing.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.640
Entropy is always increasing.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.110
So if this reaction has
increased in entropy,

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.790
it will be much more
likely to be spontaneous.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.560
So let's talk about entropy.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.300
So entropy is a measure
of disorder of a system.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.100
Delta S is the
change in entropy.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.090
And delta S, again,
is a state function.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.090
So one example of
entropy in New England

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:23.320
are these stone walls that do
not look absolutely beautiful.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.550
There are often stones
falling everywhere.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.860
And it doesn't matter if these
stone walls that were probably

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:35.080
built in 1600s or 1700s in
New England fell totally apart

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.270
and were rebuilt, now we just
care about how the wall is

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.080
compared to the way it started.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.990
So delta S, again,
is a state function.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.310
It doesn't depend on path.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.470
And so if you get
out and walk around

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.870
and go like on the
Minuteman Trail

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.230
and see some of the
historical sites

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:58.490
where Paul Revere rode his horse
along a lot of stone walls,

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.030
there's a New England
poet who writes

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.480
about this, Robert Frost.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.310
And he said, "something there
is that doesn't love a wall."

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.497
And that something is entropy.

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.330
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.450
CATHY DRENNAN: Entropy
does not love a wall.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.840
Entropy does not like order.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.760
Another example, those of you
who are learning more about me

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:26.050
as a person know that
I am a fan of dogs.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.560
This is my dog Shep.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.460
Shep does not like going to
the groomers, does not like it.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.620
And I think that this is because
he's been at my office hours

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.550
and he knows that increasing
entropy is favorable,

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.700
decreasing entropy is not.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.050
And he says, really,
this violates

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.460
the laws of thermodynamics,
what you're doing to.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.490
Me and you should
cease and desist.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.970
But anyway, he
still get haircuts.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.190
So entropy, again,
is this measure

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.250
of disorder of a system.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.570
You have a positive
delta S, which

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.880
is going to be an
increase in disorder.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:12.220
And a negative delta S is going
to be a decrease in disorder.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.970
And disorder, you
can be thinking

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.540
about this as internal degrees
of freedom in your molecule,

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.650
thinking about
this as vibrations.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.400
All sorts of
different things can

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.800
lead to increase or
decrease in entropy.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.160
But we often think
about changes in entropy

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.570
depending on if the reaction
is changing in phase.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:40.300
So gas molecules have
greater disorder than liquid.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.110
And liquid has greater
disorder than solids.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:48.070
And so a solid has all
its molecules lined up.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.160
And liquid can move
around a little bit more.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.930
But gas really can
spread all out.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.630
So in terms of entropy
and changes in entropy,

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.910
we can think about the phase
change that's happening

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.280
and even predict if
something's going to be

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.640
an increase in entropy or not.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.270
So let's just look
at one example.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.890
So without a calculation,
predict the sign of delta S.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.208
And this is a clicker question.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.690
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.800
And can our demo TAs come down?

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.860
Yep, good.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.880
So you predicted positive,
which is the correct answer.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.570
And so here, we're going from
a liquid to a liquid and a gas.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.950
And so going to the
gas, that will increase

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.410
the disorder of the system.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.370
So delta S will be positive.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.620
So now, we're actually
going to do a demo

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.130
of this particular reaction.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.710
And so we have
hydrogen peroxide,

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:26.630
which can just be bought at
a CVS or local drugstore.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:32.380
And it will go to liquid
water and also oxygen gas.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.680
And so how do you see a gas?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.800
And you can see it by putting
it in with soap bubbles.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.210
So as bubbles of oxygen
form, the soap bubbles

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.530
will bubble out.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:44.840
And so you can see it.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.540
And you can also add
some kind of food color.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.750
And we have yeast as
a catalyst to make

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.530
it go a little bit faster.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:56.415
So let's see if we can
actually see disorder increase.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.590
I don't want the mic.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.288
If you want to just say-- if you
want to talk at the same time,

00:17:10.288 --> 00:17:10.829
here's a mic.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:11.749
AUDIENCE: I might do that.

00:17:11.749 --> 00:17:13.130
CATHY DRENNAN: You're
not going to do that, OK.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we will.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:13.589
CATHY DRENNAN: Oh, you do.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.089
OK.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:15.910
AUDIENCE: Is this on?

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.440
This on?

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:16.990
Yes, it is.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.630
OK, great.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:22.722
So what we have going on here
is we've got this container.

00:17:22.722 --> 00:17:23.680
It's filled with water.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.470
And what I did was I added
about 4 teaspoons of yeast.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.550
The yeast, as Cathy said, is
going to act as a catalyst.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:37.129
It's actually a
biological species.

00:17:37.129 --> 00:17:38.920
It's a living species
that's actually going

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.190
to catalyze this reaction.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.280
What Erik is doing is Erik is
pouring some hydrogen peroxide.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.870
He added some soap.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.120
So as you see in the
reaction, the H2O2

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.420
is going to break down
into water and gas--

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.582
the gas being oxygen.

00:17:51.582 --> 00:17:53.040
And what we don't
want to happen is

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.910
we don't want just
the gas to escape,

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.368
because then you
guys can't see it.

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:58.780
So what Erik is doing right
now is he's adding some soap.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.500
The soap is actually going
to catch, if you will,

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.740
the escaping gas and
turn it into a foam.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.290
And what we should
be able to see

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:13.250
is the foam kind of escape
from this container.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.351
You ready?

00:18:14.351 --> 00:18:14.850
OK.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.058
So hopefully, this will work.

00:18:16.058 --> 00:18:17.722
We should put on our goggles.

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:19.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.430
Smells really bad.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.250
OK, ready?

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:28.500
And-- get out of
there, look at that.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.190
Hey!

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.731
Wow, that worked a
lot better than we

00:18:30.731 --> 00:18:32.105
thought it was going to work.

00:18:32.105 --> 00:18:33.730
CATHY DRENNAN: And
so this is sometimes

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.240
called the elephant
toothpaste demo,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.620
because that is sort of, if
you were an elephant, what

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.720
you would probably be brushing
your teeth with, I don't know.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.460
Yes.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.314
So this is--

00:18:47.314 --> 00:18:48.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.644
--entropy increasing.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.830
So let's just see
if we can quickly

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.980
talk a little more about
entropy and then we'll end.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.340
So entropy of reactions
can be calculated

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.400
from absolute values.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.280
And again, we can use
this equation here.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:19.800
So we have a delta S for
a particular reaction,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.400
can be calculated
from the delta S's

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.560
of the product minus reactants.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.250
So again, we have
products minus reactants.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:32.130
The absolute value, or
an absolute delta S, S

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:37.910
equals 0 for a perfect crystal
at a temperature of 0 kelvin.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.180
You never really talk
about S by itself.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:45.171
It's always really
delta S. And S of 0,

00:19:45.171 --> 00:19:47.420
this is like the saddest
thing for a crystallographer,

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.878
because you know
you're never going

00:19:48.878 --> 00:19:52.290
to have a perfect crystal,
even if you go to 0 kelvin,

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.760
I feel like at least
experimentally.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.960
So S equals 0, to me
that's kind of sad.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.860
So if we just put in for this
reaction that we just did,

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.700
we can put in our values here.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:13.570
And we can put in we're
forming liquid water.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.200
And we're forming O2 gas.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:24.140
And we're using two molecules of
hydrogen peroxide-- H2 O2 here.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:29.990
And so now, we can calculate
what that delta S0 is.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:35.590
And it's a value of 125
joules per kelvin per mole.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.950
So again, products, water
and gas, minus reactants,

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.240
pay attention to
the stoichiometry,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.590
and you can get
your delta S value.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.120
And why is it positive?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.380
Again, we already
talked about this.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:54.850
It's because it's going from
liquid to a liquid plus a gas.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.390
And then, if we plug
these values in again

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.690
to see if it's
spontaneous, we can

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.990
use this equation and
plug in our values,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.480
making sure we change our units.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.310
And we can see that, in fact,
this is a spontaneous reaction,

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.150
because it's negative here.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.180
But you already knew
that, because you

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.510
watched it go spontaneously.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.690
So most of the time,
you can't do the demo.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:25.840
So then you can use this
awesome equation right here.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.040
So that's where we're
stopping for today.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.330
And we'll see you all on Friday.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:39.180
So if you take out your Lecture
16 notes, the bottom of page 3,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.630
we had an example about
the melting of ice

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.950
at room temperature.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.930
So we did a little demo for you
at the end of class last time

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:54.000
and calculated that
the reaction was

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.700
spontaneous for
hydrogen-- hydrogen

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.580
peroxide is pretty reactive.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.090
And we watched the O2 bubble go.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.680
And we did that calculation.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.920
So we're thinking
about, not just delta H,

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.800
but we're thinking
about delta S.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.820
And we're now thinking
about delta G as well

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.610
and how they all play together.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:15.380
So when we started
last lecture, we

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.920
had talked about the fact
of some reactions that

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.170
were spontaneous where
delta H was negative,

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.790
where it was exothermic,
where heat was released.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.630
But then we also
gave some examples

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.860
where delta H was
positive and said,

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.220
but these are also
spontaneous reactions.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.060
We all know that at room
temperature ice will melt.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.610
We know that that's a
spontaneous reaction.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.550
But the delta H
for that reaction

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.220
is actually a positive value.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.360
It's an endothermic reaction.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.300
So when we're thinking
about these reactions

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.295
and spontaneity, we have to
be thinking about delta G,

00:22:45.295 --> 00:22:50.850
no just delta H. And delta G has
to do with delta H and delta S.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.470
So sometimes, delta S
is the driving force

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.330
behind whether a reaction
is going to be spontaneous.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.430
Whether the delta G will
be negative or positive,

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.320
delta S is making
that determination.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.820
So we can calculate what
a delta S for reaction

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.440
is if we know the entropy
values for the products.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.740
And it's the sum of
the entropy values

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.270
for the products minus
the sum for the reactants.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.000
So when we're doing
heats of formation,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.210
we also had products
minus reactants.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.320
But we have one exception
to this products

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.705
minus reactant rule, and
that's when we're using what?

00:23:27.705 --> 00:23:32.038
What thing are we going to
do reactant minus products?

00:23:32.038 --> 00:23:32.986
AUDIENCE: Bond--

00:23:32.986 --> 00:23:33.819
CATHY DRENNAN: Bond?

00:23:33.819 --> 00:23:34.882
AUDIENCE: Bond enthalpy.

00:23:34.882 --> 00:23:37.540
CATHY DRENNAN: Enthalpy, right.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.740
But here, we're products
minus reactants.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.370
So we can plug those numbers in.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.500
Our product is our liquid water.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.050
Our reactant is our
solid water, or our ice.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:55.950
And we can calculate what the
delta S0 is for this reaction.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.390
We can put in our values.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:03.470
And we get a positive
value, positive 28.59 joules

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.850
per kelvin per mole.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.510
And delta S's tend
to be in joules.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.070
Everything else
is in kilojoules.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.340
So keep that in mind.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:20.470
And why do you think this
reaction has a positive value?

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:23.360
Why is delta S greater than 0?

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.790
What would be your
guess for that?

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.276
What's happening?

00:24:30.276 --> 00:24:32.168
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:32.168 --> 00:24:35.730
CATHY DRENNAN: Yeah, so we're
going from a solid to a liquid.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.210
So we're increasing the
internal degrees of freedom.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.680
The molecules of water can
move around more in a liquid

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.270
than they can in a solid.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.885
So this is increasing the
disorder of the system.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.270
You're increasing entropy here,
because the water molecules

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.600
can move around more.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.750
There's more freedom of motion.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.850
So delta S is positive.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.000
It's increasing.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.010
And then we can use that
to calculate delta G0,

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:06.470
Gibbs free energy.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.820
We can plug in our delta H
value minus T, room temperature,

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.170
times delta S, which we
just calculated, making sure

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.860
that we convert from
joules to kilojoules.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:23.820
And then our units will
be kilojoules per mole.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.650
And here, delta G0
is a negative value.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.950
So it is spontaneous.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.400
We all know it's spontaneous.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.700
We've observed this happening.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.460
So even though delta
H0 is positive,

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.640
it's an endothermic reaction.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.050
Ice melts at room temperature,
because the delta G

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.300
is negative.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.640
So let's talk a little
more about delta G.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.520
So let's talk about
free energy of formation

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.380
and the last page
of this handout.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:56.540
So free energy of
formation, delta G sub f.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.630
And so this is analogous
to delta H of formation--

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.890
so the change in
enthalpy of formation.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:09.330
So again, when you have
a little value here,

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:13.320
this is standard Gibbs free
energy of formation for the f

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:13.970
here.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.860
And that's the
formation of 1 mole

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.540
of a molecule from its
elements in most stable state

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.200
and in their standard states.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.355
So we can have tables in
your book of these values.

00:26:28.355 --> 00:26:30.480
So your book, in the back,
if you haven't explored,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.500
the back of your book gives
lots of tables of things,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:38.890
including information about
delta G's and delta H's

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.240
and bond enthalpies and
all sorts of other things.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.320
Redox potentials, we
haven't talked about yet,

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.500
lots of tables.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.090
So you can look this up.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.280
Or if you have
already, say, looked up

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.490
your delta H of formation, you
can use this handy equation--

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.930
delta G equals delta
H minus T delta S.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.350
But if we plug in our
delta H's of formation,

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.510
we can get our delta
G's of formation.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:09.290
So how you're going to
calculate delta G of formation

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:12.500
depends on what
information you're given.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.480
So let's think a
little bit about what

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.080
it means for particular
delta G's of formation--

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.330
if they're positive or
if they're negative.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.040
So let's look at an example.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.850
And we saw this before.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:30.330
This is the formation of
carbon dioxide from elements

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:35.302
in its most stable state, which
is graphite carbon and O2 gas.

00:27:35.302 --> 00:27:37.510
So these are the elements
in their most stable state,

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.190
forming CO2.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.780
Now, I'm telling
you that the delta

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:46.850
G0 is minus 394.36
kilojoules per mole.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:51.160
And we can think about what
this information tells us,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.180
that this is a fairly
large negative number.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:28:00.410
So if delta G of
formation is less than 0,

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.884
what's going to be
true thermodynamically?

00:28:02.884 --> 00:28:04.175
And this is a clicker question.

00:28:27.577 --> 00:28:29.394
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.100
Interesting.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.290
So let's think about
why this is true.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:54.030
This might be a deciding
clicker question.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.550
We'll see.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:29:01.470
So if it is negative
value for delta G,

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.770
a negative value
for delta G means

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.060
that it's spontaneous in
its forward direction.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.720
So here, the formation from the
elements in their most stable

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.260
state, if this is spontaneous
in the forward direction,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.580
it also means that
it's non-spontaneous

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.120
in the reverse direction.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.440
That means once CO2
forms, it's going

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.380
to be stable compared to the
elements from which it came,

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.930
because it's non-spontaneous
going in the reverse direction,

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.320
or at least that's the way
that I like to think about it.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:37.130
So relative to its elements,
it's stable-- spontaneous

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:41.350
forward, non-spontaneous
in reverse.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.810
So this is kind of
bad news for us,

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.820
because there's too much CO2
in our environment right now.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.420
It's a greenhouse gas.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.270
And wouldn't it be awesome if
we could just encourage it all

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.710
to go back to its
elements, form more oxygen,

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:57.850
which we could breathe.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:58.510
How lovely?

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.160
Make some nice graphite.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.300
Maybe compress it,
make some diamonds.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.930
But no, it is quite stable
compared to its elements.

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:11.050
So CO2 is in our environment
causing global warming.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.610
And it's going to be hard
to solve that problem, not

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.050
easy to solve that problem.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:19.700
So this is unfortunate news
that thermodynamics gives us.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.130
So then we can
look at the other.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:26.400
If you have a positive value
for delta G of formation,

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.930
then it's
thermodynamically unstable

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.360
compared to its elements.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.450
So it's spontaneous going
in the reverse direction.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.160
So it's unstable.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.780
So thermodynamics tells
us whether something

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.210
is stable or unstable.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.450
And kinetics tells us
about whether things

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.150
will react quickly or not.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.350
So something can be
kinetically inert-- it might

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.290
take a long time to react.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.620
But thermodynamics tells
us stable, unstable.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.740
So thermodynamics is great,
but it doesn't tell us anything

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.850
about the rates of reactions.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.210
So nothing about the
rates, and that's kinetics.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.670
So really thermodynamics
and kinetics

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.980
are very important for
explaining reactions.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.950
And we'll talk about
more kinetics at the end.

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.020
So to calculate a
delta G for a reaction,

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.010
it depends, again,
what you're given.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:26.460
You can sum up the delta G
of formation of your products

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.950
minus your reactants.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.510
Or you might use this.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.150
You'll find yourself
using this equation a lot.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:36.290
This, again, was a crowning
achievement of thermodynamics,

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:40.840
that delta G equals delta H
minus T delta S. So, again,

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.330
whatever information
you're given,

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:47.550
you can use that to
find these values.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.250
So we're not done
with this equation.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.830
We're going to switch handouts.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:55.590
But we're going to continue
with that exact same equation.
