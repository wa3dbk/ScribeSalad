CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Cell potential-- cell

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.890
potential delta
E cell, and we're

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.690
going to relate this
back to delta G.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.070
So as we saw with these cells,
you have this flow of electrons

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.030
through the circuit.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.410
They're generated at the anode
from the oxidation reaction,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.080
and they go over to the cathode.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.910
And when your cell
is running, it'll

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.480
generate a potential
difference, this delta E cell,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.600
between those two
electrodes in the cell.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.950
So delta E cell has a
lot of different names.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.055
It's called cell potential, cell
voltage, electron motive force,

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:12.360
EMF.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.350
All of these names are
valid, can be used.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.660
I'm going to try to
call it cell potential.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.370
Hopefully, I'm not
going to switch up.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.870
But if you see
any of these, it's

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.460
talking about the same thing.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.950
So overall, then, if we
know this cell potential,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.130
we can relate this
back to delta G.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.280
And so that will then be able to
tell us whether the reaction is

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.150
spontaneous or not.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.710
So the overall free energy,
Gibbs free energy, of the cell

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.990
is related to the cell potential
by the following equation.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.800
So delta G for the cell
minus n, the number of moles

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.280
of electrons that pass
through the system, Faraday's

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.790
constant and that
cell potential.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.440
So we can think about
this at a particular time.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.810
We can also think
about this equation

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.760
in the standard states.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.509
So let's just think again
about standard states

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.390
so we can talk about delta
G0 for the cell and delta

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.210
E0 for the cell-- so delta
E0, the cell potential, cell

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.690
voltage, EMF for
the cell, in which

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.470
the products and the reactants
are in their standard state.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.170
And the unit here is volts.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.720
So we have a new
unit that we haven't

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.260
used before, I think-- volts.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.820
So let's look at an example
of how we would then calculate

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.017
our delta E0 for a cell.

00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:42.600
And we'll do the
cell we've been using

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.980
this whole time, our cell
with zinc at anode and copper

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.720
at the cathode.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.660
And so we have our
anode reaction.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.370
And again, this is
our oxidation, anox.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.730
And our cathode
reaction, cathred.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.990
So we can write it out as the
reduction reaction happening

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.850
at the cathode.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.320
And the equation we're going to
use for this is the following.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.610
So delta E0 of the cell, the
cell potential, equals E0,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.910
and E here is the standard
reduction potential--

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.820
and this is the standard
reduction potential

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.180
for the couple, the
reaction, that's

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.760
happening at the cathode--
minus the standard reduction

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.880
potential for the reaction
that's happening at the anode.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:45.630
So now we can look those
values in the back of the book.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.870
So we have for zinc the
standard reduction potential,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.330
minus 0.7629, and the
standard reduction

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.520
potential for the
copper, plus 2 two

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.500
electrons to copper solid
reaction, plus 0.3402 volts.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.980
So now clicker
question, why don't you

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.790
calculate for me what
the cell potential is

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.370
for this type of cell.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.600
So 10 more seconds.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.220
81%, that's right.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.980
So let's take a look
at that over here.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.520
So the correct answer involves
putting the standard reduction

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.510
potential for the reaction
at the cathode with the sign,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.750
without changing it
as plus over here,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.020
0.3402, and then it's minus.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.680
And then you put the standard
reduction potential in there,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.490
and this is a minus
value minus, 0.7628.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.210
And minus a minus we get
a plus, and so our answer

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.110
is 1.103 volts.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.430
And this is very
important, and it's

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.000
important to think
about the reaction

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.440
at the cathode, which
is the copper reaction.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.900
The reaction at the anode
is the zinc reaction.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.070
And a lot of people who try
to be too clever with these.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.440
And they're like,
OK, but this one's

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.780
the one that's being oxidized,
so I'll switch the sign

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.000
and then put it in the equation
and end up getting it wrong.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.620
So if you always remember
standard reduction potential

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.770
put here-- standard reduction
potential put here--

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.410
the equation already takes
care of the sign issue for you,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.140
so don't do anything
with the sign.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.710
Other people say, I looked
through pages and pages

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.055
of these potentials in
the book, and the reaction

00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:04.930
I'm looking for isn't
listed, because they're

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.940
looking for an oxidation.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.980
They're not going to
find the reaction written

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.420
as an oxidation in a table
of reduction potentials.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.030
So all of these are listed
as reduction potentials.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.370
That's what you will find.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.830
The trick is to remember
which is happening

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.560
at the cathode, which is
happening at the anode,

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.012
and then you will always
get this problem right.

00:06:26.012 --> 00:06:27.970
And it's good to get this
right, because as you

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.100
will see later on,
this can be step

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.297
one in a multi-part problem.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.200
So when we
successfully calculated

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.940
delta E of the cell, the cell
potential, then we can ask,

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.570
is the flow of electrons going
to be spontaneous for this?

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.520
Will it?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.930
It will be.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.920
And the way we know that is
that we can always come back

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.800
to delta G. So whenever
you're asked if something

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.917
is spontaneous or not, you
always want to think delta G.

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:01.250
That's what I'm going to go for.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.070
I'm going to think
about delta G.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.750
So here delta G equals minus n,
number of moles of electrons,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.100
Faraday's constant, times
that cell potential.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.960
So if the cell
potential is positive,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.510
delta G will be negative.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.998
And is a reaction spontaneous
when delta G is negative?

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.850
It's easy to answer.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.230
It's on my shirt today.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.450
I'm giving it all the way-- yes.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.150
So when delta G is
negative, then you

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.620
can be feeling spontaneous.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.180
It's a spontaneous reaction.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.200
So delta E positive
means delta G negative.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.350
Reaction is spontaneous.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.640
So now let's have a
little reminder, review,

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.330
of what types of cells
have spontaneous reactions

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.890
and what kind involve
non-spontaneous reaction.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:04.860
10 more seconds.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.000
Can anyone tell me
what the correct name

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.930
is of the cell that involves
a non-spontaneous reaction?

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.292
Electrolytic cell.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:54.360
So if we look over here-- so
people knew about the galvanic.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.750
That's good.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.470
So a reaction, if it's a
spontaneous reaction that

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.090
will produce an
electric current,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.190
that's called a galvanic cell.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.620
If it's a non-spontaneous
reaction that

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.440
has to be driven by
applying a current,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.690
that's called an
electrolytic cell.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.440
So I just threw up
another random name

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.470
to see if people
would go for it.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.750
So it's important to
keep these in mind,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.450
because a lot of the problems
will say things like,

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.470
in this galvanic cell.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.780
And you seem like you don't
have enough information

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.840
to solve the problem because
the problem didn't tell you

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.590
which reaction was at the
anode or which reaction was

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.360
that the cathode.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.790
So how do you do the problem?

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.350
Well, the fact they told
you it was a galvanic cell,

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.350
there's only one way to
put the reactions in order

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.997
for it to be spontaneous.

00:09:45.997 --> 00:09:47.830
So that's part of the
problem-- figuring out

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.480
which is at the
anode and which is

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.180
at the cathode based
on the fact that it has

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.200
to be a spontaneous reaction.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.200
So knowing these terms
is really important.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.955
It's hard to do the
problems without them.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:05.780
Summary of this part, then, so
a cell operate spontaneously.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.760
Whether it does or
not can be determined

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.220
by your cell potential.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.960
If it's positive,
it's spontaneous.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.800
And that's because if it's
positive, delta G is negative.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.730
And delta G is really what
tells you about spontaneity.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.550
And you can calculate
your cell potential

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.520
from your standard
reduction potentials

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.580
that you will find in your book.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.590
So now let's think
about the meaning

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.390
of the standard
reduction potential.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.410
What's true if it's a
large positive value?

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.300
What's true if it is a
large negative value?

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.820
We can look at these
values and know something

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.710
about the reactions.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.520
So meaning of standard reduction
potentials-- what do the values

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.750
tell us?

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.800
So a large positive
standard reduction potential

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.460
means that the element
is easy to reduce.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.800
So let's look at an example.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.050
So we have fluorine F2
gas plus two electrons

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:07.190
going 2 fluorine minus ions.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.870
And this has a standard
reduction potential

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.340
of plus 2.87 volts.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.120
So large positive
number means that it's

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.320
easy to add electrons.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.170
And we can think about
this in terms of what

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.220
we know about these reactions.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.635
So again, if it's a positive
standard reduction potential,

00:11:26.635 --> 00:11:29.390
E0, that's going to
mean a negative delta

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.910
G for this reaction
as written, written

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.830
as the reduction reaction.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.200
And so it's favorable or
spontaneous in that direction.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.250
So the reduction is
spontaneous or favorable.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.710
So when you have a large
positive value here,

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.550
you can think about, yes,
fluorine wants those electrons.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.986
It spontaneously will grab those
electrons and become F-minus.

00:11:50.986 --> 00:11:52.610
And this also makes
sense to you if you

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.920
think about your
periodic table trends.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.770
You have fluorine
wants to be F-minus.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.990
It will have its noble
gas configuration then.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.280
It likes getting
an extra electron.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.700
So this should make
sense from other things

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.290
that we've talked about.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.050
So now I could ask the question,
and I will, and it's a clicker

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.240
question, does that make F2 a
good oxidizing agent or not?

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.340
10 more seconds.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.920
So the answer is yes.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.740
F2 is easy to reduce, which
makes it a good oxidizing

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.460
agent.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.040
Remember, it's an
agent of oxidation.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.210
It wants to go out there
and oxidize other things.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.580
It wants to itself be reduced.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.860
So something that's a
good oxidizing agent

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.940
is easy to reduce.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.140
It wants to be reduced.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.230
It wants to be an
agent of oxidation,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.020
bringing oxidation to the world.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.280
So it's easy to reduce.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.380
It's a good oxidizing agent.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.870
So in general, you can think
about this the following way.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.870
Let's just like bring the
noise down a little bit.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.340
I know it's a clicker
competition day.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.970
So we have a large positive
value here for a reaction.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.090
For a reduction reaction
is written large positive

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.000
standard reduction potential.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.500
And the couple
here, F2 to F-minus

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.580
is the couple we're
talking about.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.520
And we'll say that the
oxidized species of that couple

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.500
is very oxidizing.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.912
And again, F2 here is
the oxidized species.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.970
So the oxidized species F2
is a good oxidizing agent.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.900
It's very oxidizing because
it has a large positive

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.120
standard reduction potential.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.510
So I don't know how
well this copied.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.420
But here are some standard
reduction potentials.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.560
They're all in your book, so
it's OK if they look terrible.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.840
But the important point
here is that the top.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.236
We have large positive values.

00:14:16.236 --> 00:14:17.860
So if you can see
that in your handout,

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.820
this is the reaction
we just talked about,

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:25.060
or the couple we just talked
about-- F2 F-minus and so

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.500
large positive.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.360
And then there's a gap here.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.250
There are pages
and pages and pages

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.410
of these standard
reduction potentials.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.010
And at the very bottom, you
have a large negative number,

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.520
so large positive on the top
large, negative on the bottom.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.830
So at the very top, the
oxidized species of that couple

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.930
is very oxidizing.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.980
And we'll see it in a
minute, that at the bottom

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.090
the reduced species, when
it's a negative number here,

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.010
the reduced species
is very reducing.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.720
So let's look at
the reduced species,

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.210
and this is lithium
on the bottom.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.320
So a large negative
standard reduction potential

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.110
means that the element
is hard to reduce.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.110
So example, lithium
plus 1 plus 1 electron

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.570
going to lithium solid.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.180
The standard reduction
potential for this reaction

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.800
is minus 3.045 volts.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.390
So it's hard to add
electrons to lithium-plus.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.730
We have a negative standard
reduction potential,

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.330
which means a positive
delta G for the reaction

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.450
is written for the
reduction reaction.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.390
So it's not favorable.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.280
Lithium-plus does
not want electrons.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.640
It doesn't want to
go to lithium solid.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.790
So lithium-plus, if
it loses an electron,

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.340
it gets its nice noble
gas configuration.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.570
It's a group-one element.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.800
It likes to be in the
plus-1 oxidation state.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.410
It doesn't want to be reduced.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:16:00.960
So is lithium plus 1 a
good oxidizing agent?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.730
No, it's not.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.440
It does not want to be reduced.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:10.920
But lithium solid is
a good reducing agent.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.530
It's a good reducing
agent because it

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.270
wants to reduce other things.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:19.380
It wants to itself
become oxidized.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.680
So lithium solid will
reduce other things.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.020
Lithium solid wants
to be oxidized.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:29.140
It wants to be lithium plus 1.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.540
So the rule here for those
large, negative standard

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.220
reduction potential
couples is that

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.480
with a large negative
standard reduction

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.830
potential, the reduced
species is very reducing.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.470
The reduced species
here is lithium.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.580
So lithium is reduced
compared to lithium plus 1.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.480
This, then, is very reducing.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.220
It is a good reducing agent.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:01.110
Do you think lithium plus 1
would be a good reducing agent?

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.860
What do you think?

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.894
So if it was a good
reducing agent,

00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:10.819
it wants to reduce other
things and become oxidized.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:14.970
Do you think lithium
plus 2 is a good thing?

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:15.980
No.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.270
So again, in this couple,
it's the reduced species

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.920
that's very reducing.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.619
And so you have to think
about this a little bit.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.599
Make sure that you
pick the right one.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.830
Often you'll ask
about rank the order

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.420
of these as reducing agents.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.970
And people remember
this, but don't

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.979
remember which
species of the couple

00:17:36.979 --> 00:17:38.270
is going to be doing the thing.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.250
So think about what's happening.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.790
Lithium solid, does it want
to become lithium plus 1?

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.420
It sure does.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.940
Does lithium plus 1 want
to become lithium plus 2?

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.710
No.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.770
So again, back to
just our table just

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:54.650
for a second, on the top-- large
positive, oxidized species very

00:17:54.650 --> 00:18:00.572
oxidizing, negative value,
reduced species very reducing.

00:18:00.572 --> 00:18:02.030
And now if we look
at this, I don't

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.821
know how well this came
out in your handout

00:18:03.821 --> 00:18:06.800
either, but part of
the periodic table

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.660
for you kind of compressed.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.780
Over here we have fluorine,
large positive, standard

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.350
reduction potential,
easy to reduce over here,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.250
good oxidizing agents.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.470
If they get an electron,
if they're reduced,

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.750
they get their noble
gas configuration.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.500
Over here, we have these
big negative numbers,

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.930
easy to oxidize the solid or
the neutral to their plus 1.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.379
So they would be
good reducing agents.

00:18:35.379 --> 00:18:37.670
And so this all makes sense
when you think about trends

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.250
in the periodic table.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:45.290
So today we're going to have
two examples of why all of this

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.950
is important across disciplines.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.030
So often these units
are really talked--

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.670
you talk about making
batteries and things like that.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.870
And that is important.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.600
In fact, with
energy initiatives,

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.421
making batteries is a
really hot area right now.

00:19:02.421 --> 00:19:03.920
But all these things
you're learning

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.220
are also related to biology
and to medicine as well.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.770
And so we have one more of the
"In Their Own Words" segment.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:17.510
And John Essigmann studies DNA
damage as related to cancer.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:21.500
And people are like, what
is DNA damage and cancer

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.990
have to do with oxidation
reduction potentials?

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.600
But it's not all about
oxidation reduction.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.150
That's what a lot
of the damage is.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.570
So why don't you hear
from John Essigmann.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.860
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.200
- My name's John Essigmann.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.770
I'm in the Department
of Chemistry

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.000
and Biological Engineering MIT.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.800
I'm a toxicologist by training,
so I study how cells respond

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.790
to toxins, and in particular,
the kinds of toxins

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.637
that cause nucleic acid damage.

00:19:56.637 --> 00:19:58.970
Some of these are chemicals
from out in the environment,

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.190
organic compounds,
that cause DNA damage.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.240
But I'm also interested in
how chemicals inside our body,

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.075
for example, reactive
forms of oxygen,

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:12.870
the molecule that we breathe,
also cause nucleic acid damage.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.760
Oxidation is the
process by which

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.680
we convert our metabolic
fuels into energy.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.210
This is a gummy bear being
oxidized by potassium chlorate.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.720
This is exactly the kind
of chemical reaction

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.190
that goes on in your bodies.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.210
But in your body, it goes
on at a much lower rate.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.230
Oxygen is a double-edged sword.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.530
There are two aspects to
its use that is good for us.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.545
The first one is by acting
as an electron acceptor,

00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:47.070
sort of like an
anode in a battery,

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.930
it completes the
circuit and allows

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.560
us to be able to generate
free energy that we can

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.280
use to power vital processes.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.060
That's good.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.890
The second good thing is
that it's the ammunition

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.540
of our innate immune system.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.810
[COUGHING]

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.080
Oxygen is used to
charge the system

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.640
to produce one, two, or three
electron-reduced species

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.950
that themselves can react
with reactive nitrogen species

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:24.260
to create a host of
very damaging oxidants.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.120
Our innate immune system
uses these to protect us

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.330
against invaders
and oftentimes, we

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.730
believe, developing
cancer cells.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.970
The bad thing is that the
second system I described

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.700
doesn't have a lot
of accuracy in how it

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.250
focuses that chemical warfare.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.740
So not only are the,
let's say, invading

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.620
bacterial cells or
the cancer cells hit,

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.200
but surrounding cells as well.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.710
And that creates
oxidative damage

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:58.970
in the genomes of those cells,
those innocent bystanders.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.540
If those cells divide, the
oxidative damage that's in them

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:07.335
can cause mutations, and that
sets the cell along a path.

00:22:07.335 --> 00:22:11.349
If you accumulate enough
mutations in enough genes,

00:22:11.349 --> 00:22:13.015
you're going to convert
that normal cell

00:22:13.015 --> 00:22:15.980
into a cancer cell that
will grow out into a tumor.

00:22:20.267 --> 00:22:20.850
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.900
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So
that was one of, I think,

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.100
the only video, besides mine,
that involved a faculty member.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.150
But I thought it's
nice to have a sort

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.880
of a collection of
different folks talking

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.230
about their research.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.410
And this relates to
free radical species

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.670
as well as to oxidation
and reduction.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.820
So now I have another bio
example, which hopefully we'll

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.120
get to at the end.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.200
But I want to introduce
a very important equation

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.530
for this unit and
oxidation reduction, which

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.350
is the Nernst equation.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:55.240
So here, and this happens,
I think, to all of us

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.410
all the time-- our
exhausted batteries.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.450
So when you have
a battery or you

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:05.090
go to turn on your headphones
or use your laser pointer

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.030
or things like that and the
battery doesn't work anymore,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:11.500
it's because the cell reaction
has reached equilibrium.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.380
So equilibrium is a
state of calmness.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.950
It's also a state of
batteries not working anymore.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:23.790
And so at this point,
when it's at equilibrium,

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.170
the cell generates
zero potential

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.430
across its electrodes.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.500
It's not working anymore.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.390
It is a dead battery.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:35.200
And we need to think about
when it reaches equilibrium,

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.110
what state it's in at
any given time compared

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.717
to its equilibrium state.

00:23:39.717 --> 00:23:41.800
So this really brings us
back to some of the ideas

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.310
that we had in the
chemical equilibrium unit,

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.800
where we were thinking about
composition of a reaction

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.860
at any given time compared
to the equilibrium state.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:58.030
So how does cell potential
change with cell composition?

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.060
So again, we know
a lot about this.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:04.080
And exam three on Friday
has equilibrium on it.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.810
So we already know a lot about
what happens in relationships

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.490
between equilibrium.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.110
And we know that delta G
changes as the composition

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.700
changes in the cell.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.330
And until equilibrium
is reached-- so again,

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.920
reactions going forward
and back in equilibrium--

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.070
the forward direction equals
the reverse direction.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.030
But at some given time that
is not always the case.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.940
So the equation that
we know from before is

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:36.370
that delta G equals delta
G0 plus RT natural log of Q.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.050
And so if you know
delta G and Q,

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.140
you can talk about what
the delta G is going

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.580
to be at a particular
composition of the cell

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:49.480
with a particular
value of Q. So now we

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.140
can think, well, OK, here's what
we know about Q, that reaction

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.210
quotient, and delta G.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:25:00.490
What do we know about delta
G and E, the cell potential?

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.300
And we just talked about that.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.960
So we know that delta
G0 equals minus n,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.370
the number of
moles of electrons,

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.470
Faraday's constant times
that cell potential.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.120
So now we can do a
rearrangement of terms.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.180
We can combine and come up
with the Nernst equation.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.650
So here are the two equations.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:18.700
One we knew before.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.220
One we just learned about today.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.280
And we can put those together.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.490
We can plug in for delta
G here without the 0,

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.400
and for delta G0
with the 0 over here.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.120
And then we can
divide both sides

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.290
by minus the number
of moles of electrons

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.980
and Faraday's constant, come
up with the Nernst equation.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:43.810
So the Nernst equation
compares our cell potential

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.620
under standard conditions
with our cell potential

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:52.770
at any given time based on
that reaction quotient Q.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:56.970
So let's do an example
with the Nernst equation.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:02.400
So let's calculate the cell
potential at a particular time

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:09.510
when the zinc plus 2 ions are
0.1 and copper plus 2 is 0.0010

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.470
molar.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.990
And we're same cell
as we've done before.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:19.290
So step one, very easy, we want
to calculate the cell potential

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.330
under standard conditions.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.210
And this is particularly
easy because we already

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.470
did this today.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.930
So you already told me
it's plus 1.103 volts.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.930
So we could look up our
standard reduction potentials

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.914
for our copper couple and our
zinc couple and calculate this.

00:26:37.914 --> 00:26:39.330
So we already did
this, and that's

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.540
why I said you want to make
sure you get this right

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.730
because it's often just step
one of a multi-part problem.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.140
So we want to get that right.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:51.748
Step two is calculating Q, and
this is a clicker question.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.170
10 more seconds.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.640
I tried to make the
math not that hard.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:40.240
So Q, products over reactants,
so one thing you want to do

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.070
is make sure you have the
reaction written correctly.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.810
So you know what the products
are and what the reactants are.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:50.680
And here we have the
zinc ions over copper.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.860
Copper solid and
zinc solid don't

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.740
appear in the
equilibrium expression

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.350
or in the Q expression
also because they're solids

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.810
and their concentration
is not changing.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.640
So there is enough
information that

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.790
was given because we
don't include the solids.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:10.870
So it's just the
concentration of zinc ions

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:15.598
over the concentration of copper
ions, or 1.0 times 10 to the 2.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.350
Now we need to know n.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.990
So n is the number of
moles of electrons that

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.060
are involved in this reaction.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.625
This reaction involves
how many electrons?

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.210
How many?

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.330
It involves two, right.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:41.490
So the zinc to zinc plus
2, copper plus 2 to copper,

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.590
so it involves two electrons.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:47.370
So this is two, and sometimes
you can just look at this

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.040
and realize it's two
electrons involved.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.500
Other times you have
to balance the reaction

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.710
to figure out how many
electrons are involved.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.730
It's not obvious by
looking at the reaction.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.980
This is a simple one,
but some of them are not.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.170
So that's we're balancing
reactions comes in handy.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:05.670
so

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.500
Now we have everything
we need to plug it

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.360
into the Nernst equation.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.860
So we can put it in.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.320
We calculated this
standard cell potential

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:20.130
over here, the plus 1.1 value.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:24.870
We can look up R. Everything,
again, room temperature.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.720
Natural log of Q,
we calculated Q.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.230
We have two electrons
and Faraday's constant.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:36.180
And we can multiply this
out, get this value.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.880
In terms of significant figures,
this also is a lot of fun.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.260
We have log rules of significant
figures, multiplication

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.270
and division rules of
significant figures,

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:49.740
and adding and subtracting
rules of significant figures,

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.450
and also in terms of units.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.060
All of a sudden, volts appeared.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.310
That was nice because our
answer should be in volts.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.320
But where did they come from?

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.220
So we had our kelvins
are going to cancel out.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.000
But we have joules over here.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.170
And we have coulombs.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:10.260
But luckily, a joule per
coulomb equals a volt.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.740
So we're all set to get
our appropriate units.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.190
So just a couple of things
that I'll mention about this as

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:20.160
well-- sine almost
all these problems are

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.650
at room temperature, I
try to make your lives

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:28.020
a little bit easier on the
exam and multiply this out

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.360
for you, because these
are all constants,

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.100
and they're big
constants that involve

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.410
plugging a lot of numbers in.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:39.030
So I will give you
this combined value.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.480
And if you use log
instead of natural log,

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.850
you need to change
that value here.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.600
And so what I actually
put on equation sheets

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.120
are these equations.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.940
I'll also put the full
equation there as well but just

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.560
to make your lives
a little bit easier.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.150
It's horrible to make
mistakes up there.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:06.720
So just briefly, what about at
equilibrium, what does Q equal?

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:13.180
Q equals K. Delta G equals 0.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.940
And so we can rewrite
this expression again,

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.950
which we've done before.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:25.820
And if we take this and
look at this expression now,

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.590
we can again combine
these-- we have

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:33.700
two expressions for delta G0--
and combine them and solve.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.410
And you can see
that you can also

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:41.230
calculate K from standard
reduction potentials.

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.190
So all the things that we
have been learning here,

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.560
we can always come back
to chemical equilibrium.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.960
So I'm done with everything
but my second bio example.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.490
So you'll have to
wait until next week

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:58.376
to find out how vitamin B12
gets reduced in the body.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:13.200
Let's just take 10 more seconds
on the clicker question.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:39.310
Does someone want a
nice T-shirt to tell me

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.602
how they got the right answer?

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.587
Pass this back.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.980
AUDIENCE: So when you're
looking at the Pb--

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.000
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Let's all quiet down.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] and
zinc, zinc is going to reduce--

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:03.711
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Let's quiet down.

00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:07.700
AUDIENCE: --Pb because it
goes from a 2 plus charge

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.330
to no charge at all.

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.600
So that's reducing its charge.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.690
And then in the
reverse reaction,

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:17.060
Pb does the same
thing to zinc 2 plus

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.325
and takes it from 2 plus
to a neutral charge.

00:33:22.325 --> 00:33:23.575
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yep, great.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.670
So the trick to this is
just look at the equations

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.310
and figure out what
is being oxidized

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.560
and what is being reduced
in both directions.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.370
Oxidation reduction, it's
not just about batteries.

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.730
Batteries, of course,
are very important.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.800
There's a lot of active
research right now

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.750
in trying to make better
batteries that are more

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:52.980
environmentally friendly, just
solving the energy problem

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.770
every single possible way.

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.140
But even if you're not
interested in solving

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.650
the energy problem,
oxidation reduction

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.570
is really important in medicine.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.900
So I'm just going to give you
another bio example for this.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.230
So there's a vitamin in
your body, vitamin B12

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:13.230
It has one of the largest
negative reduction potentials

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.679
of any biological molecule.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.710
So we ask the question,
how can something like that

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.730
be reduced in the body?

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.670
So let me introduce
you to vitamin B12.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.610
You're going to see this
a couple of times today.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:29.630
So vitamin B12 needs to
be reduced to be active.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.686
But it has a low
reduction potential.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.850
This is the vitamin
B12, and you'll

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.060
see several more
views of it, and it's

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.620
in pictures in your
handout of today's lecture.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.420
There's an enzyme that requires
vitamin B12 and another B

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.060
vitamin called folic acid.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.440
And if this enzyme is
not functioning properly

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.030
in your body, it leads
to all sorts of things.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.550
It's connected to heart disease.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.420
If women don't have enough folic
acid while they're pregnant,

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.360
it can lead to birth
defects, neural tube disease,

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.350
where the brain
doesn't form properly.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:10.370
Also, there is rising evidence
connecting a vitamin B12

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.480
deficiency with bringing
on Alzheimer's disease.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.270
And some people actually buy
little B12 squirt bottles

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.020
and squirt it into
their nose before exams.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.920
I'm not sure that helps.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.610
But as you get older,
I would seriously

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:29.330
consider taking
extra vitamin B12.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.190
So since we're
talking about this,

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.920
we'll have a little
nutrition quiz.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.790
Where do you get vitamin B12
and folic acid in your diet?

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:40.920
First let's think
about vitamin B12.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.670
Does anyone know where you get
this, besides vitamin pills,

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.630
in food?

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.689
Where do you get vitamin
B12 in food, yeah?

00:35:46.689 --> 00:35:47.480
AUDIENCE: Broccoli?

00:35:47.746 --> 00:35:49.079
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Broccoli, no.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.420
We had a hand up there.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.770
Anyone else?

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.436
Yeah.

00:35:58.436 --> 00:35:59.060
AUDIENCE: Meat?

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.270
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Meat,
yes-- red meat, actually

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:03.150
any kind of meat.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.110
But hardly ever is
red meat the answer

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.710
to a nutritional question.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.870
So I thought I'd put it up
there in big bold red letters.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:15.910
Yeah, you get B12 in meat.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:18.250
Plants don't use vitamin B12.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.440
So you can eat as many
plants as you want.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.360
Unless they're covered with
bacteria that do use B12,

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.640
you will not get
any in your diet.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.360
So if you're vegetarian, you
should take a vitamin tablet.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.150
You don't need much, so it's
not really your problem.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:32.860
But it does come from red meat.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.480
What about folic acid?

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:38.461
Any guesses where
folic acid comes from?

00:36:38.461 --> 00:36:38.960
Yeah.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.120
AUDIENCE: Broccoli?

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.950
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yes.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.230
Very good.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:46.600
So it's the fall in New England,
and hopefully some of you

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.760
have gone out and
seen the foliage.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.300
So folic acid does come
from green leafy things.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.820
And if you're Norwegian, you
will also say the following.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:05.140
So Norwegian scientists claim
that the great longevity

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.120
of Norwegians has
to do with the fact

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.370
that their beer is
rich in folic acid.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:11.020
And somehow they
even got a grant

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.200
from the Norwegian government
to study the correlation

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.640
between beer and health.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.400
Everyone signed up for
that study, I'm sure.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.000
So red meat and beer
for good health.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.650
But yes, leafy green
vegetables, yes, folic acid,

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.770
foliage, also orange
juice is really high.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:36.970
And at one point, they had this
commercial for orange juice.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:39.190
It's not just for
breakfast anymore.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.210
It's good for your heart.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.300
Well, that was because of
the folic acid in there.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.820
And that's actually true.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.980
So there was a commercial
that actually provided you

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.740
with valuable
nutritional advice.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.370
Not so sure about
the beer, but I'd

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:56.260
go buy the leafy greens
and the orange juice.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.110
So you need both of
these to be healthy.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.930
But again, we have this
problem that vitamin B12

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.640
has this low negative
redox potential.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.520
So how is it reduced?

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.700
Well, in the body it's
reduced by a protein called

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.020
flavodoxin, which has a flavon,
which is another B vitamin.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.750
So there's lots of B
vitamins going on here.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:20.340
So the standard reduction
potential for vitamin B12

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.480
is minus 0.526.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.320
That's a really low
number for biology.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.680
And for flavodoxin,
it's minus 0.23.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.201
So we ask, which is the
better reducing agent?

00:38:34.201 --> 00:38:35.534
And that's the clicker question.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.405
Let's just do 10 more seconds.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.940
Yep.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.190
So the better reducing agent
wants to reduce other things

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.940
and get oxidized itself.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:17.800
So vitamin B12, with its
low negative potential,

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.780
is very reducing.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.280
It wants to reduce other things.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.910
It wants to be an
agent of reduction.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.040
But that's not what's
supposed to happen.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.370
It's not supposed to
reduce flavodoxin.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.590
It's supposed to happen
the other way around.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:36.190
So we could ask, is
the reduction, then,

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:40.390
of vitamin B13 by
flavodoxin spontaneous

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.440
if this is the case, yes or no?

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.830
No.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:46.360
It shouldn't be spontaneous.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.170
It's not going the
way that it should go.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:54.130
So we can just calculate how
exactly non-spontaneous it is.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:40:00.340
So we can calculate both
what the change in potential

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:05.290
is, and we can also
calculate delta G0 from this.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.540
So we saw how to do this before.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.870
But we were talking
about different kinds

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.360
of galvanic or
electrolytic cells.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.510
But now we can use
the same equation

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.060
that we saw before but
talk about it in terms

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.890
of a biological system.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:25.870
So before we saw to calculate
E0 of the cell, the cell

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.960
potential, we had the
standard reduction potential

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.600
for the couple at the anode
minus the standard reduction

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.730
potential for a
couple at the cathode.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.100
We can do the same
thing here but just

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.130
put reduction and
oxidation over here.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.760
So we can make this
a generic equation.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.250
And we can plug our values in.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.980
So the thing being
reduced is vitamin B12.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.550
So we want to put the reduction
potential of B12 in there.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:55.570
And the thing being
oxidized is the flavodoxin.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.110
And so minus
0.526six for the B12.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.700
Standard reduction
potential would

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.340
be 12 minus the
standard reduction

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.230
potential of flavodoxin.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:10.810
And we get a negative
number, minus 0.0296 volts.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.980
So then we have
a negative value,

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.730
which should tell us that delta
G is going to be positive.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.500
But we can also
calculate that value

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.570
from the equation
you saw before.

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:26.200
So just because we are talking
about these equations in terms

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.540
of cells before,
we can also talk

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.170
about it's same exact equation
that we use in biology.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:35.540
So minus n, number of
moles of electrons--

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.384
this is a one-electron process.

00:41:37.384 --> 00:41:38.800
I would have had
to tell you that.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.470
You wouldn't necessarily
have known it's one electron.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:43.300
But that's our one.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.210
What is this term here, this
kind of weird-looking F term?

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.080
What is that again?

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.720
Faraday's constant.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.150
Then we plug in
our cell potential

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.170
or potential difference.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:57.850
And we get out a value
positive 28.6 kilojoules

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.580
per mole-- big positive number.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:04.150
So is this spontaneous?

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:06.710
Why don't we all
have heart disease?

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.890
It is not a
spontaneous reaction.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:11.170
So how is it driven forward ?

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:13.040
This happens in our body.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.080
This reaction happens.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.640
So clearly something has to
happen to make it spontaneous.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.700
So when we were talking about
the different kinds of cells,

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.730
we had electrolytic cell,
where we could put in a current

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:27.610
to drive a
non-spontaneous reaction.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.730
Same thing happens in
biology, and the current

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.890
in this particular
case is a molecule

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.170
known as adenosylmethionine.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.710
So it's the methionine amino
acid within a denosyl group

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.060
attached to it.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:44.590
And the cleavage of this
molecule is very spontaneous.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:49.120
It has a delta G of minus
30.6 kilojoules, which

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.150
is greater than what we need.

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:54.280
And we can even
calculate the net delta G

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.860
for this reaction,
the coupled reaction,

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.420
of the cleavage
with the reduction.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:05.470
And if we do that, we have
minus 37.6 plus 28.6, so

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:09.350
minus 9.0 kilojoules per mole.

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:13.420
So we can drive this
unfavorable reduction reaction

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.030
with a very favorable
reaction, the cleavage

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.731
of adenosylmethionine.

00:43:17.731 --> 00:43:18.730
And that's how it works.

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:22.810
So that's why we're all healthy.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:26.020
So this is the end of our
oxidation reduction example.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.980
We'll transition to
transition metals.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.500
But we're not moving very far
away from oxidation reduction.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.710
Because to do problems that are
effective transition metals,

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.200
you have to know how to
determine oxidation numbers

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.410
and all sorts of things.
