00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:34.460
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.190
Let's just do 10 more seconds.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.190
All right.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.181
Does someone want to tell me up
here-- hello everyone up here--

00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:02.430
how they got the right answer?

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.160
Over-- everyone
over there, I guess.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.640
OK, I'm coming over there.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.080
So for the answer we have
an MIT chemistry bag.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.960
That's quite special.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.320
AUDIENCE: Well, since
your delta H value

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.990
acts as the y-intercept,
you know that it's negative

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.030
because it's negatively.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.700
And then you also see that
you're ascending positively,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.010
so that you know your
slope is positive.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.770
And so delta S also has to be
negative to make it positive.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.150
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Interesting.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.370
That was a different answer
than I would have given,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.350
but that works
really well, which

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.950
is always great to ask people.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.720
So you could also think about
this in terms of your going

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.459
from a situation with a negative
delta G to a positive value.

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.000
So you know that
temperature is going

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.870
to make a difference there.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.006
And so that would also tell
you how the temperature changes

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:06.880
is also going to tell
you the answer to that.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.631
So that's great.

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:09.130
All right.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.080
So a couple of announcements.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.400
As you can see, see what
I am wearing on my legs.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.200
So I was pleased with the
performance on exam 2.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.110
The average was 84.7,
not quite as celebratory

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.610
as 87.4, which was
the average on exam 1.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.944
Yeah, those are real numbers.

00:02:34.944 --> 00:02:35.860
That's a little weird.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.400
But anyway, I was still very
happy with the performance

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.690
on the exam.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.420
I would like for exam
3 for the average

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.110
to be back at 87, though.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.930
I like it to be very close
to 90 because I want everyone

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.380
to have an average
around 90 in the class

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.730
to demonstrate excellent
knowledge of chemistry.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.490
So I try to write
an exam where I

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.040
feel like if you have excellent
knowledge of chemistry,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.420
you can get a 90% or above.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.000
So this is my goal.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.060
I all want you to have
this fundamental knowledge

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.300
of chemistry that you can go out
and solve the energy problem,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.030
that you can go out
and be ready to tackle

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.850
the next great
challenge in health.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.680
There's so many
challenges facing us,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.000
and we don't even know
what they are right now.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.770
So the Ebola situation, I
think, is a real case in point,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.370
that we don't know what the
next challenge facing us

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.270
is going to be.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.111
So we need to be ready with
our chemistry knowledge.

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:33.610
The only thing I can tell you
about the challenges facing us

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.110
is that knowing
chemistry is going

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.630
to be really important in
tackling those problems.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.280
So everyone needs to have
an excellent understanding

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.930
of chemistry to go on
and do well and solve

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.310
the problems of the world.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.030
So 84.7, really good.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.100
You're getting there.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.350
Awesome.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.752
So celebratory
tights, or leggings.

00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:56.210
Not really sure the difference
between tights and leggings.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.690
Anyway, I was very pleased.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.660
But next unit, next exam,
has thermodynamics, chemical

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.550
equilibrium, and acid-base.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.960
We're already done with
thermodynamics and moving on.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.260
So it's just for the
rest of the semester,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.110
we're about halfway there,
the rate seems to accelerate.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.589
So problem set 5,
thermodynamics.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.134
It's a little shorter because
you have fewer days to do it.

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:21.550
So we wanted to
make sure that you

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.619
would be able to get it
done by Friday at noon.

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:25.660
But that's when it's due.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.950
It's all thermodynamics.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.440
We've already covered all the
material on the problem set.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.100
You can do it
already right away.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.600
All right.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.210
So also in my wardrobe-- I'm
commenting a lot on my wardrobe

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.157
today-- you'll notice maybe
that I've worn this shirt once

00:04:40.157 --> 00:04:42.490
before, and my goal was really
to have a different shirt

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.270
every time.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.390
Now, this shirt is appropriate
for today's lecture.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.040
But I just wanted
to say that I did

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.470
try to get a different shirt.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.550
And I ordered new shirts on
thermodynamics and chemical

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.850
equilibrium this year,
and one of the shirts

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.087
had to do with entropy.

00:04:59.087 --> 00:05:01.170
And I just thought I would
share with you briefly,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.220
because it's a good
review of thermodynamics,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.620
what happens when you do
things related to entropy.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.100
So just to sort of
show you what happened.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.320
In September, I was
super organized.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.370
I ordered my shirts.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.130
And on October 3, they shipped.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.430
They went through
Indianapolis to Massachusetts

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.320
and to Newton Highlands
about somewhere

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.180
around October 8 or 9.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.640
That's where I live,
so that's really good.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.580
But the shirts
were about entropy,

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.930
and then look what happened.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.320
Wait-- rerouted for
delivery to a new address.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.990
Jersey City, Cincinnati, Ohio,
Warrendale, Pennsylvania.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.890
And then yesterday they were
in Springfield, Massachusetts,

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.970
to which I say, entropy!

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.560
This does not happen when you
order T-shirts about kinetics.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.940
That's all I'm saying.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.257
Those arrive record time.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.160
Thermodynamics is not
always your friend,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.420
but you can embrace it.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.150
And I'm going to try
to calm myself down

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.200
because we should be
at equilibrium today.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.890
Today, the topic is
chemical equilibrium.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.970
It's the calm part
of thermodynamics.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.620
We'll get back to entropy.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.690
There will be some
mention of entropy.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.220
But I'm going to
try to calm down.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.990
I'm going to
remember my reaction

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.570
quotients and my
equilibrium constants

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.300
and think about
chemical equilibrium

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.310
and embrace the
T-shirt I am wearing.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.600
Because I feel powerful in this
T-shirt, like I can control

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.350
thermodynamics with the
power of the Green Lantern,

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.660
with chemistry knowledge
at my fingertips,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.130
and I will move forward.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.330
So chemical
equilibrium is calming,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.250
but it's also a dynamic process.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.570
We can't forget that the
reactions have not stopped.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.150
It's just the rate of
the forward reaction

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.640
is equal to the rate of
the reverse reaction.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.810
So there's no net change,
but the dynamic process

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.580
is still happening.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.910
So my goal in life is to
have equilibrium in my life.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.590
The amount of work-- the rate at
which work comes into my office

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.350
equals the rate at which
I complete the work

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.450
and it leaves my office.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.550
Most of you should
also have this goal.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.160
The rate at which
problem sets come in

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.330
equals the rate at which you
complete the problem sets

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.470
and the problem
sets get turned in.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.390
You don't want to get
yourself in a situation

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.480
where that equilibrium
is messed up,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.470
where the rate of
things coming in

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.350
is just nowhere at all equal
to the rate at which things

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.180
are completed and going out.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.260
So goal-- chemical equilibrium.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.340
We want to be at this calm place
where we're still working hard.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.550
It's still dynamic.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.490
But the net change is good.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.580
It's in our favor.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.640
The amount of work we're doing
equals the work coming in.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.380
So I like chemical equilibrium.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.280
I feel like it brings
hope to thermodynamics.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.300
So let's look at an
example of a reaction,

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.920
and we're going to talk a lot
about this reaction in chemical

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.160
equilibrium.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.650
So we have N2, nitrogen,
H2, hydrogen coming together

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.620
to form ammonia, and
it has a delta G0

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.710
of minus 32.9
kilojoules per mole.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.260
So let's think about
what's happening

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.343
in the beginning of this
reaction, when we're just

00:08:23.343 --> 00:08:25.260
starting this reaction.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.810
So we can plot
concentration on one axis,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.419
and we can have time
on our other axis,

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.724
so time increasing over here.

00:08:36.724 --> 00:08:38.390
And we can think about
what happens when

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.556
we're starting our reaction.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:45.860
We can have hydrogen
starting out.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.920
We have some hydrogen in
a certain concentration,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.350
and it's going to come
down and level out.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.270
So that's our H2.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.720
We'll also have
nitrogen as a reactant.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.320
It comes down, levels out.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.570
And we're starting
with our product.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.650
We have no product.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.200
We're just starting the
reaction with the reactants.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.002
So product increases
and then levels out.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.860
So we're decreasing
our reactants,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.470
increasing our product,
but the lines go flat.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.335
The reaction is still happening.

00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:22.460
The reaction in the forward
direction is happening,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.140
and then in the reverse
direction is happening.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.434
But there's no net
change at equilibrium

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:28.850
because it's reached
a state where

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.550
the rate of the forward
reaction equals the rate

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.940
of the reverse reaction.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.910
And let me also just
point out some arrows

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.710
and some nomenclature here.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.360
So we have this
double arrow, and you

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.370
can see this a couple
of different ways.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.370
But this indicates the
reaction's going forward,

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.380
and the reaction is going back.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.630
And that's necessary if
you're at equilibrium.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.520
The definition of
equilibrium-- rate

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.070
forward equals rate
back at equilibrium.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.970
So you'll be seeing
those arrows a lot.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:57.470
All right.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.350
So let's think about
delta G now in terms

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.690
of what's happening at different
times in this reaction.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.560
So if we're just starting
out this reaction,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.120
and you don't have
a lot of products,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.194
so you're in this case
of pure reactants.

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.860
At this point, you're
going to be moving

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.901
in the forward direction.

00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:15.830
You need to make products.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.440
And so at this point, the
forward direction is negative.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.490
It's spontaneous.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.380
You're spontaneously
making your products.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.630
You don't have
any at this point.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.100
And so your delta G is
going to be negative.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.300
So up here with pure reactants,
your delta G is negative.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.090
Now, if you started
with pure products--

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.350
you could do that as well-- the
NH3 will dissociate and form

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.010
the reactants.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.700
And so that would be over here.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.670
And so when you have
excess products,

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.280
now the forward
direction is positive.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.610
It's not spontaneous because
it's the reverse direction that

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.140
is spontaneous.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.020
So over in this part
of the graph over here,

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.850
our delta G is positive.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.390
So if you have pure
reactants, you spontaneously

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.290
go to products.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.560
If you have pure products,
you're going toward reactants.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.490
And when you have the
right amount of reactants

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.830
to products, the right
ratio for equilibrium,

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:18.190
then you get to equilibrium and
delta G equals 0 at that point.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.560
So delta G is going
to change depending

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.608
on your ratio of
products to reactants.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.890
So delta G changes
as the proportion

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.390
of the reactants
and the products

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:36.740
change, and there's an
equation to describe that.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.070
So we're back now
to having a few more

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.670
equations in this unit.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.510
We noted a lot of people forgot
to bring calculators to exam 2.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.840
There weren't so
many calculations.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.630
We're back to more
calculations again.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:55.660
So delta G equals delta G0
plus RT natural log of Q.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.040
So let's think
about these terms.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.960
So delta G is Gibbs free energy
at some particular point,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.470
at some ratio of
product to reactant.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:10.900
Delta G0 is Gibb's free energy
under standard conditions,

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.030
in their standard state.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.620
Q is our reaction quotient,
products over reactants.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.210
And R is the universal gas
constant, and T is temperature.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.140
So this equation
describes how delta G

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.050
will compare to delta G0
at a particular condition,

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.340
a particular ratio, of
products and reactants.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.780
So let's talk
about this reaction

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:41.870
quotient Q. So let's look
at a made-up reaction--

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:47.090
A plus B goes to C plus D.
And think about that reaction

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.450
in the gas phase.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.930
When we think about that
reaction in the gas phase,

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.190
we're going to be talking
about partial pressures.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:13:01.040
And so Q over here is
products over reactants,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.450
but here we're writing it out
in a more complicated long way.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.190
So let's go through this.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.640
So we have this P sub
C. Well, what is that?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.500
That is partial pressure.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.800
So partial pressure
of gas X, and this

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.240
is partial pressure of
gas C, and C is a product

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.380
and D is a product.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.750
So we have products
over reactants.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:28.010
Partial pressure of
gas C over P reference,

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.040
partial pressure
reference, which is 1 bar.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.400
The reference is 1 bar, so
we're dividing that by 1.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.460
And this is raised
to the little c,

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.210
which has to do with the
coefficients of the reaction.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.210
Then we have partial
pressure of gas D

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.520
over our reference raised
to the small d-- those

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.030
are our products,
products are C and D--

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.200
over reactants--
partial pressure

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.470
of gas A over reference
raised to little a,

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.300
partial pressure of gas B over
reference raised to little b.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:04.910
But 1, the number 1,
the reference is 1.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.350
So most of the time you'll see
the following expression-- Q,

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.040
our reaction quotient,
partial pressure of gas

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.595
C to the stoichiometry little
c partial pressure of gas

00:14:16.595 --> 00:14:20.780
D raised to the stoichiometry
d, over reactants,

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.690
partial pressure of A little a
partial pressure of B little b.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.320
And you will note that
because we had 1 bar

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.070
and these are in bars, our
units are going to cancel here.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.220
So Q does not have units.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.665
I knew this should be
very exciting for you.

00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:43.490
You won't be losing one point
for lack of units with Q.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.600
There are no units.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.640
So this is very exciting.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.645
So there's the expression
that you'll mostly see for Q.

00:14:50.645 --> 00:14:54.140
And now we can kind of forget
that the reference is there.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.490
We can ignore the reference.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.910
You just don't freak out
later if you have no units.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.710
It's OK.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:01.210
All right.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.880
So we also could be
talking about solution,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.142
and here we're going to
talk about concentrations.

00:15:07.142 --> 00:15:08.600
In a lot of these
problems, they're

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.070
talking about things
in the gas phase,

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.570
and they're giving
you concentrations.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.460
Don't worry about it.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.180
It's all OK.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.900
So here our concentration
reference, C for concentration,

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.490
is 1 molar.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.220
And you'll see this
term-- C in brackets.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.070
That means concentration of.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.430
And so if you see
that like this, you

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.750
would express this in words as
the concentration of C-- again,

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.232
that's a product-- over the
reference-- we'll get rid

00:15:35.232 --> 00:15:37.190
of the reference in a
minute, but we'll keep it

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:42.110
for now-- raised to the little
c, concentration of product D

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.530
over this concentration
reference of 1 molar

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:49.820
to the little d,
concentration of reactant A

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.010
over this
concentration reference

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.400
raised to the little a,
concentration of other reactant

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.330
B over our concentration
reference of 1 molar raised

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.620
to the little b.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.640
And then, again, this
is concentration.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.620
And we can get this
expression, which

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.790
is usually the one you see, of
just products over reactants.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.120
But I will make one
point here, that you

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.370
need to know how to
balance equations

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.110
to be able to do these.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.020
So in the beginning
of the book there

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.660
was something about
balancing, limiting reagents,

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.250
stuff like that.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.020
If you feel like you
did not master that,

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:27.994
you want to go over it.

00:16:27.994 --> 00:16:29.285
You need to be able to balance.

00:16:29.285 --> 00:16:30.710
And in a lot of
these problems you

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.771
may be thinking about
limiting reagents again.

00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:34.270
All right.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.569
So that's Q. You can see
it as partial pressure--

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:39.610
and I'm going to do a
little partial pressure gas

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.760
review on Friday--
or concentrations

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.940
with these brackets.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:51.820
So at equilibrium,
delta G equals 0.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.280
And it's a dynamic
process-- rate

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.000
of the forward reaction equals
rate of the reverse reaction.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.630
Q now is the
equilibrium constant,

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.170
because the ratio of products
to reactants at equilibrium

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.859
is the definition of the
equilibrium constant.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.359
So when delta G
equals 0, Q equals K.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:17.890
So we now can go back to
this expression that we had

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.829
and rewrite this
for the situation

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:24.510
at equilibrium, when
delta G equals 0.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.329
So when delta G
equals 0, this is 0

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:33.030
and Q is K. K is products
over reactants at equilibrium.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.300
And we can rewrite this
or rearrange it now--

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:42.560
delta G0 equals minus
RT natural log of K.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.560
And that's a very important
equation that you'll

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.590
be using a lot in these units.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.400
So it relates delta G0 with
our equilibrium constant K,

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.031
and it depends on temperature.

00:17:55.031 --> 00:17:55.530
All right.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:01.510
So K-- same expression as
Q, except for something

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.540
very important, which is
that the concentrations are

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.480
the concentrations
at equilibrium.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.320
So it has the same
form as Q, but it's

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.790
only the amount of products
and reactants at equilibrium.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.880
So in the gas phase,
we would write

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.670
K in terms of our
partial pressures.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.120
And again, this is this
little symbol to remind you

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.490
these are the concentrations
at equilibrium.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.550
And in solution it
would be expressed

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.390
in molar or something else.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.790
So K is, again,
products over reactants,

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.140
but only those concentrations
at equilibrium.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.590
Whereas Q is at any
point, any concentrations

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.740
of products over
reactants for Q. For K,

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.895
it's those concentrations
at equilibrium.

00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:46.690
All right.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:53.070
So now let's think
about Q and K together.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.530
So we can rewrite
this expression again.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:19:01.290
We just derived a new
expression for delta G0,

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.800
and that was minus
RT natural log of K.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.900
So we can say delta
G equals, and now

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.180
have this other
expression, minus RT

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:15.445
natural log of K plus
RT again-- gas constant

00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:19.090
and temperature--
natural log of Q.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:24.030
And we can simplify
it, bring out the RTs,

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:30.130
and now we have delta G
equals RT natural log of Q/K.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.860
And this is, again, a
very important expression

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.260
that you'll use a lot.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.460
Because it tells
you about delta G,

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.890
whether the reaction is
going to be spontaneous

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.510
in the forward direction
or the reverse direction,

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:48.670
depending on the
ratio of Q and K.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.820
This is a very
important equation

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.040
for chemical equilibrium.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.640
So let's think about what this
means, what comes out of this.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:07.750
So the relationship between
Q and K, if Q is less than K,

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:12.420
what is the sign of delta G?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.012
You can just yell it out.

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:14.904
AUDIENCE: Negative.

00:20:14.904 --> 00:20:16.352
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yep.

00:20:16.352 --> 00:20:17.560
So it's going to be negative.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.585
Just mathematically, you
can look at that expression.

00:20:20.585 --> 00:20:21.460
So it'll be negative.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.140
And again, we give
you all the equations

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.130
on the equation sheet.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:24.921
That will be there.

00:20:24.921 --> 00:20:27.570
So you just need to know
how to think about it.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.960
And so the forward
reaction will occur.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.720
And so if we think
about this, it's

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.580
going to mean that
at equilibrium there

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.390
are more products than there
are at this time for Q.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.790
There's less products
in the Q expression.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.690
K is greater than Q. So we
need to make more products.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.590
So delta G will be negative,
and the forward reaction

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.800
will occur.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.890
So when Q is greater than
K, delta G is positive.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.660
And so when Q is
greater than K, that

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.900
means there's more
products now in Q

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.110
than there are at equilibrium,
too many products.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.170
So we need to shift it
in the reverse direction.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.190
So delta G will be positive.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.270
So again, thinking about
the ratio of Q and K

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.450
tells you about what direction
is going to be spontaneous.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:18.070
Is it spontaneous in the forward
direction or in the reverse?

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.880
OK.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.960
So let's continue
doing a little example.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.900
We can do a little
calculation here

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.480
on the board for
the same reaction.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.960
We're given a
value of K. And now

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.710
we're told some partial
pressures of these gases

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.410
and asked which direction
the reaction will go.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.665
So let's write the
expression for Q.

00:21:41.665 --> 00:21:45.190
So Q, again, is going
to be equal to products

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:51.400
over reactants, and our
product here is our NH3.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.020
So we're going to be talking
about the partial pressure

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.320
because it's a gas of NH3.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.050
And am I done with the top
part of this expression?

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:01.592
AUDIENCE: No.

00:22:01.592 --> 00:22:02.508
CATHERINE DRENNAN: No.

00:22:02.508 --> 00:22:03.448
What do I need?

00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:04.364
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:05.440
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yep.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.500
Again, you need to remember the
stoichiometry of the reaction.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.330
So now we have the partial
pressure of N2 on the bottom,

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.540
and I'm good, and the
partial pressure of H2.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.720
And again, I have to
remember that there are three

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.610
H2s in this balanced reaction.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:29.740
So we have the partial
pressure of H2 to the third.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.910
I can put in my numbers.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:44.140
1.1 squared over 5.5 over 2.2--
these numbers may be made up,

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:52.750
that's OK-- equals 2.1
times 10 to the minus 2.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.110
And we're back to thinking
about significant figures

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:58.370
a lot again in this unit.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.380
So I have two there, so I'm
going to have these two here,

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.810
and I'm good.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.270
But now this is the
value of Q. And I

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.530
want you to tell me with
a clicker question, what

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.761
direction is this
reaction going to go?

00:23:39.141 --> 00:23:39.640
All right.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.098
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.380
All right?

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.770
So recognized,
for the most part,

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.780
that yeah, most
of these numbers,

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.620
that Q is a bigger
number than K.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.780
And so then you have to
think about what that means.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:15.670
And so when Q is greater
than K, then you're

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.100
going to go toward reactants.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.060
And so you're going to
dissociate the product

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.550
until you achieve
equilibrium again.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.180
And so this means when
you have a big Q number,

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.060
you have too many products
compared to the equilibrium

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.540
state, and you want to
dissociate your products.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.510
So you're going to
go spontaneously

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.280
in the reverse direction.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.846
Now, I just want to
mention one point.

00:24:46.846 --> 00:24:48.220
For the first part
of the course,

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.747
I only taught that
material once before.

00:24:50.747 --> 00:24:52.330
But the second part
I've taught a lot.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.580
So I have lots of
years of experience

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.220
of what people do wrong
on exams on this part,

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.500
and I will share one thing.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.740
A lot of students--
and faculty too,

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.460
I'm this way--
right-left challenged.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.510
So they write left
when they mean right.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.730
They write right
when they mean left.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:18.050
And so for those of you who are
like me and have this issue,

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.200
draw an arrow.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.130
When people draw an arrow, they
always draw it in the direction

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.680
that they mean, or they
say toward reactants

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.570
or toward products.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.550
And so I've seen so
many times on the test

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:35.110
they'd explain the answer
beautifully, and then

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.210
write the wrong direction down.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.110
So if you are
right-left challenged,

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.550
try toward reactants or toward
products or draw an arrow.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.880
So that is my suggestion
to you, as someone

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.510
who's also very bad with
saying the right direction,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.110
left or right, when I
mean that direction.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.110
OK.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.432
So what does K tell us?

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.660
So K tells us about
the ratio of products

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.560
to reactants at equilibrium.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.090
And if you have a
very big number for K,

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.850
it's going to tell you
something about the ratio

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.310
of those products
to the reactants,

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.950
and there'll be a lot of
products for reactants.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.600
So let's just think
about this for a minute.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.840
So when K is greater
than 1-- K is

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.990
products over reactants
at equilibrium--

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:33.170
that's going to
mean high products.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.950
So you'll have a
higher number there.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.580
But if you have a
small value for K,

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.760
then you're going to have
low products at equilibrium.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.005
So this is a good thing just to
think about and check yourself

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:48.380
when you're doing
these problems.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.810
Does my answer
actually make sense?

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:53.780
And if you see a big value
for K, you're like, great.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.110
If I want products, I want a
big value for the equilibrium

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.200
constant, means
that this reaction

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.010
is going to give me
a lot of what I want,

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.380
a lot of my products.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:07.380
Because again, K is products
over reactants at equilibrium.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.120
All right.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.680
So let's do an example here.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.900
So here is an example
where K is greater than 1.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.450
It's actually 6.84
at room temperature.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:21.590
We have a delta G0 of minus
4.76 kilojoules per mole.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.870
Two NO2 molecules going to N2O4.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.740
So we're going to start
with 1 bar of our reactants

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.680
and no products.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.520
So we can look at
what that's going

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.380
to look like in our plot of
concentration versus time.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.430
And here the
concentration is indicated

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.270
as partial pressure, which
is one type of concentration.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.490
So we're starting only
with our reactants.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.130
It will go down.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.030
We'll have no products
in the beginning.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.880
At time 0, no products,
and that will grow up.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.180
The curves will level off as
you reach the equilibrium.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.040
Again, the reaction's
still going

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.680
in the forward and
reverse directions,

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.430
but the rates are
equal so there's

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:06.300
no net change in the
concentrations then.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.790
So now we can
actually do some math

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.600
and figure out how this changes.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.300
And so this is one way
that you can set up

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.880
these kinds of problems.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.910
And we will be doing
these types of problems

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.930
in chemical equilibrium,
acid-base equilibrium.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.580
There'll be many
examples, so it's

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.000
good to become
familiar with them

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.030
if you haven't seen it before.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.980
So we can calculate
the partial pressures

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.230
at equilibrium using
this information.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.120
So when we started, we
only had our reactant.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.050
We had 1 bar, 1.000
bar, to be specific,

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.610
and we had no product.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.610
As the reaction goes,
we will form product,

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.856
so it's plus X. Some amount of
product is going to be formed.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.120
What is the change
in partial pressure

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.590
as you go to equilibrium?

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.880
What happens to this?

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.810
What changes?

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:00.544
What do I put in this area?

00:29:00.544 --> 00:29:01.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.460
CATHERINE DRENNAN: What?

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.446
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:03.446 --> 00:29:04.862
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
I heard minus--

00:29:04.862 --> 00:29:06.812
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:06.812 --> 00:29:09.270
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So I heard
minus X. I heard somebody say

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:09.770
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.380
It's minus 2X because you have
to remember the stoichiometry

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.930
of the reaction.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.120
And so we have two of these
going to one of those,

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.060
so it's minus 2X.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:28.230
And then at equilibrium,
we have 1.000 minus 2X is

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.380
our concentration
of our reactant,

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:36.120
and our concentration
of product is plus X.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.370
So now we're going
to solve for this,

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.970
and we need to write an
expression for the equilibrium

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:42.970
constant.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.586
So why don't you
write that for me.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.160
All right.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.026
10 more seconds.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:17.340
I'd like 90%.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.290
Oh, so close.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:24.980
OK.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.390
So again, the trick here, you
have products over reactants,

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.550
and you have to remember
the stoichiometry.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.360
So we can go back over here.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.190
So we have partial
pressure of our product

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.160
over partial pressure
of our reactant.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.890
And we have the
stoichiometry there,

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.530
and now we can
continue to plug in.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.650
So the concentration,
the partial pressure,

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:52.340
of our product is
X at equilibrium.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:57.400
The partial pressure of
our reactant is 1 minus 2X,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.532
and that whole term
is raised to the 2.

00:31:00.532 --> 00:31:04.210
So it's all that
whole term is squared.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:12.910
And if you solve for X,
you will get 0.38 bar.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.830
So you definitely want to
remember calculators and things

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.190
on this exam.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.210
And that value,
then, is our product.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.950
So that's the answer to the
partial pressure of the product

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.660
because that's what X is.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.460
Another thing that
I've seen on exams

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.130
is that people solve for X.
They're happy to solve for X.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.200
But then they don't
remember what X was.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.640
So keep track of what
things belong to what.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.400
So then we want to also
find the partial pressure

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.690
of our reactant.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.790
That was 1 minus 2X.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:48.080
So here we have 1
minus 2 times X.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.780
And you can see the
significant figure fun

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:56.510
that one can have in this
because we have multiplication,

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:00.020
division, subtraction, and
pretty soon we're going to have

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.650
log significant figure rules.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.060
So there's going
to be a lot of fun.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.580
And of course, then this
is our reactant over here.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.060
So let's just go back
to the diagram, which

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:15.530
is up above in your notes, on
the same page in your notes,

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.450
and plug these in and think
about what this means.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.440
So we've done the math.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:27.700
And we see that our reactant
at equilibrium is 0.238 bar,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:32.360
and our product at
equilibrium is 0.381 bar.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.920
So K is greater than
1, more products,

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.240
and you see that that works out.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.570
So if you were asked just to
explain what you expected,

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.480
you could say K
is greater than 1.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.020
I expect more products.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.410
But if you do the math, and
you'll often do the math,

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:50.090
you can calculate what
the partial pressures

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:56.211
are at equilibrium of the
reactants and of the products.

00:32:56.211 --> 00:32:56.710
All right.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:00.590
So now let's think about
the relationship, again,

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:07.580
between delta G0
and K. So here is

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.150
our expression we saw before.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:14.630
We can also rewrite
this to solve for K.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.460
So sometimes you will be given
information about delta G0

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:23.330
and asked to calculate a K
at a particular temperature.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.650
But we can also think
about what we would expect.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:31.880
So if K is large, what is going
to be true about delta G0?

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.352
And so why don't you
tell me what you think.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:56.450
All right.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.980
Let's just do 10 more seconds.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.340
So it would be a
large negative number.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.989
And we can think about
this, that if you really

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:28.650
are lying on the side of
products in your reaction,

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:31.530
then that would be
consistent with a bigger

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.510
value and a negative value.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.219
So you can think
about-- again, we

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:37.560
talked about in
terms of formation,

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.489
is the thing that's being formed
more or less stable compared

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:44.100
to its elements, the
same sort of idea.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.920
You can think about
the relative stability

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.650
and whether you'd expect more
products or more reactants

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:53.980
at equilibrium based
on these values.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.280
So let's do an example and
prove that this is true.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.240
So let's consider
baking soda again.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.750
Baking soda works really well
for this unit on thermodynamics

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.730
and chemical equilibrium.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:08.340
So again, we have
our baking soda

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:13.800
going to CO2, which is very
important, the CO2 gas, which

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.020
helps our bread rise.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.160
And we calculated last
week that the delta G0

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.110
at room temperature
for this process

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:25.660
was plus 36 kilojoules per mole.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.930
And that would
mean that it's not

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.210
spontaneous in the
forward direction, which

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.390
is really bad for our bread,
because we need the CO2

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.430
gas to cause it to rise.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.770
But the good news was
that if we remember

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.200
to turn on the oven
in baking bread

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.380
and put it at a normal
temperature in the oven,

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.500
that the delta G0 is minus
15 kilojoules per mole.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.460
So then it becomes a
spontaneous reaction.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.620
Now we can think
about this in terms

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:57.540
of our equilibrium constant
K. So if we do the math here,

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:03.540
at room temperature K would be
4.9 times 10 to the minus 7.

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.300
That is a small number.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.100
That means that there is very
little product at equilibrium

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.450
at this temperature.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:17.070
Very little CO2 gas to be able
to be used to make our bread

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.060
rise.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.150
But now if we calculate
K at this value,

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:27.510
at a negative number for
delta G, K is now 55.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.210
So we have quite
a lot of product

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.640
then to be used to
make the bread rise.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.410
So you can think
about things in terms

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.390
of delta G's and
whether something's

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.510
going to be spontaneous and
give you the product you want.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.670
But the equilibrium
constant gives you

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.410
that information as well.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:46.344
If it's a very small number,
you have very little product.

00:36:46.344 --> 00:36:47.760
And if you want
product, if you're

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.100
trying to industrially
make something,

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.260
that's a very bad thing.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:58.200
But if you have a big value for
K and this negative delta G0

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.560
value, then that's
good if you want a lot

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.390
of the product at equilibrium.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.030
So equilibrium
doesn't just matter

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:11.940
for things like baking soda or
forming ammonia from nitrogen

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.820
and hydrogen.
Chemical equilibrium

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.830
applies to large
molecules as well,

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.810
such as enzymes in your body
that are catalyzing reactions.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.230
So I'm going to share with
you an In Their Own Words.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:29.700
And this is Nozomi
Ando, who I will just

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.460
mention is an MIT
undergraduate-- was

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:38.040
a graduate of MIT, was an
undergraduate here in physics,

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.840
majored in physics.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.637
And she is now a professor
of-- do you want to guess?

00:37:43.637 --> 00:37:44.470
AUDIENCE: Chemistry.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.261
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Chemistry, that's right.

00:37:46.261 --> 00:37:49.140
She's a professor of chemistry
at Princeton University.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.340
So here is a good example
of what can happen.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.980
And she was very
happy-- actually,

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.380
I think 5.111 didn't exist then.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.420
I think it was 5.11
when she was here.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.150
But nonetheless, so
here in her words

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.534
about chemical equilibrium
and the proteins she studies.

00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:07.200
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.995
-My name is Nozomi
Ando, and I study

00:38:09.995 --> 00:38:14.760
a protein called Ribonucleotide
Reductase, or RNR for short.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.440
It catalyzes the reaction of
converting ribonucleotides,

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.490
or the building blocks of RNA,
into deoxyribonucleotides,

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:25.970
or the building blocks of DNA.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.890
It's the only means of
getting those letters for DNA,

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:32.880
so it's important for
DNA synthesis and repair

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.320
and replication.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.620
It knows, for
example, when there's

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:43.440
an imbalance in the pools
of the letters for DNA

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:48.480
or if there's a lot
of letters of the RNA.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:54.600
And this controls the sort
of state that RNR is in.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.890
And RNR can be in an equilibrium
of active and inactive states

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:03.030
that are sort of regulated by
the alphabet soup in the cell.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.070
When it's active,
it's very compact,

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.800
but then it has to make a really
dramatic structural change

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.500
to go into an inactive state.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.870
I have this imagery
of Transformers

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.230
because it's just so dramatic.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.740
So when it's active,
it's compact, like when

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.330
a Transformer's a car.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.080
And when it's inactive and it
makes a sound, che, che, che,

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.360
che, and then it
expands into a robot.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.980
The letter A, or adenosine,
pushes this equilibrium

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.050
from the active
to inactive state.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:36.680
And it tells RNR, OK, we have
enough of the DNA letters,

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.760
so stop.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.280
For humans, it's really
important to study RNR

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:46.220
because it's the protein that
is essential for making letters

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:46.790
of DNA.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:50.390
So it's essential for
DNA replication, which is

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:54.500
essential for cells to divide.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:59.330
And we want RNR to function
normally for our health.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:03.360
But in cells that are
dividing too quickly,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.740
such as tumor cells, we
want to slow it down.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:10.490
So actually, RNR is a
really important target

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:13.530
for anti-cancer drugs.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:17.570
But also, because RNR
exists in every organism,

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.000
we can start looking
at differences

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.620
between different species.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:27.193
So for example, it could be
anti-bacterial and not just

00:40:27.193 --> 00:40:27.693
anti-cancer.

00:40:30.431 --> 00:40:31.014
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:31.014 --> 00:40:32.990
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
So that's an example

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:36.350
of how you have a
shift between two

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.130
states, an inactive
and active state,

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.810
that it's just a
chemical equilibrium.

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:44.480
And binding one thing shifts
the equilibrium one way.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.190
Binding something
else shifts it back.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.990
So chemical equilibrium--
a lot of nature

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:51.500
works by just suddenly
shifting the equilibrium

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.060
between different states.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.770
So understanding
chemical equilibrium

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.191
is pretty important.

00:40:56.191 --> 00:40:56.690
All right.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:41:02.300
So now we're going to apply
stress to our chemical

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:07.180
equilibrium, and we're going to
talk about the principle of Le

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.630
Chatelier.

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:15.650
So here, a system in equilibrium
that's subject to stress

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:23.750
will react in a way that
tends to minimize that stress.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.240
And whenever I talk to
MIT students about this,

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.410
I feel like I need to
really emphasize this point.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:34.040
MIT students experience
a lot of stress,

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.040
but often do not tend
to react in a way

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.920
to minimize that stress.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.850
They say, all right, I am just
struggling with this double

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:44.360
major.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.660
I don't know what to do.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:46.890
It's just so much work.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:50.003
So maybe I should
triple major instead.

00:41:50.003 --> 00:41:50.502
No.

00:41:50.502 --> 00:41:53.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.830
Ask yourself, what
would Le Chatelier do?

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:56.600
Minimize.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.860
Double major, single major.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.010
So this is a principle that
can apply to your life.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:08.942
And I recently saw a chemistry
major, and we had lunch.

00:42:08.942 --> 00:42:10.650
He was a former MIT
student, and now he's

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.580
a CEO of a company, small
company, in Cambridge

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:18.050
that's designing computer
software platforms.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.260
He was a chemistry major, and
he's doing software design

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.620
and building like
little computer tablet

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.010
things for restaurants.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.780
So I said, would you use
your chemistry at all?

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.490
And he goes, oh, I use some
things all the time, especially

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.080
Le Chatelier's principle.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.510
I'm all about
minimizing the stress.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:38.090
So that was one
thing that he really

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.430
grabbed onto in chemistry.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:43.220
So again, if you
think about this,

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:47.240
about minimizing the
stress, you can predict

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.515
the direction of the reaction.

00:42:48.515 --> 00:42:51.140
And in nature, this
really works pretty well.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.090
So Le Chatelier's
principle gives us

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:56.210
a way to predict the
direction the reaction will

00:42:56.210 --> 00:43:03.530
go if you ask, which direction
will minimize the stress?

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.760
So let's look at an example.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.680
We're back to N2 and
H2 making ammonia.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.890
So here's a slightly different
plot than I drew over here.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:15.350
Now, this is a reaction
sensitive to temperature,

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.850
so the equilibrium
constant's going

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.030
to change with temperature.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.488
So every plot of this may look
a little different depending

00:43:20.488 --> 00:43:22.580
on what temperature it's at.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.364
But some things are the same.

00:43:24.364 --> 00:43:26.030
If you start with
hydrogen and nitrogen,

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:27.980
you'll have some of
those to begin with.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.750
They will be above 0.

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.630
But ammonia will start--
if you had no product,

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.984
you'll have ammonia at
0 and it'll rise in.

00:43:34.984 --> 00:43:36.650
The other thing that
should look similar

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:39.470
is that as the reaction
runs for long enough it'll

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:43.820
reach equilibrium, and you'll
have the lines level out.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.860
You'll reach an
equilibrium state.

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:49.950
Now what happens if you
stress that equilibrium state?

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:54.340
So say you add hydrogen. And
so this line adds the hydrogen,

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.030
then it goes down.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:59.840
Then you're also going to use
up some nitrogen as you're

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.790
using up the
hydrogen. You're going

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:05.300
to shift it to
make more product.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.570
Now, say, you make product.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.600
You add product-- sorry,
you're adding product.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.880
It's going to shift to minimize
the stress, use up the product,

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.020
have the product dissociate,
and make more hydrogen and more

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.800
nitrogen.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.230
So here's the plot.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:28.500
Now, let's just think about
what's happening at each step.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.400
So if we're adding
more reactant,

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.360
you have more reactant.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.580
You have too much reactant.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:39.800
Shift to minimize the
stress, and you will shift

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.390
the reaction toward product.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:43.760
Get rid of the reactant,
use up the reactant.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.780
Let's get back to the
equilibrium condition,

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.220
minimize the stress.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:54.126
Now, we can think about this
in terms of Q and K again.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:01.580
So when you have
reactants added,

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:05.850
then Q is going to fall
below K momentarily.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.620
And so that means-- if you think
about our equation over here,

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.130
recall this equation,
this important equation.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:18.170
So with Q less than K, you
get a negative delta G,

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:21.200
and that's going to be
spontaneous toward the right,

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.440
toward products.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.240
So again, you respond
by making more products.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.720
You shift to the right.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.390
And you saw that over here.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.890
It's shifting toward products.

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:37.040
You're using up the hydrogen.
You're using up the nitrogen.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.390
You're trying to return to
an equilibrium condition.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:47.360
Now what happens if
we add more product?

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.230
And so when you're adding more
product, Q is greater than K

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.890
momentarily.

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:55.910
You have too many products
now compared to equilibrium.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:46:02.360
And when Q is greater than K,
you get a positive delta G.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.250
And that means that
it's spontaneous

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:06.680
in the reverse direction,
or non-spontaneous

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.160
in the forward direction.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.710
So you shift toward reactants.

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:11.910
You shift to the left.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.460
So again, you can
use this equation

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:17.550
to think about what direction
is now going to be favorable.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.610
And so here you added product.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.140
The product gets used up.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.210
It's shifting toward
reactants, and you're

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:27.590
making more reactants until
you reach equilibrium again.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:32.060
And we have one minute left
for a last clicker question.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.990
What happens when
you remove products?

00:46:54.631 --> 00:46:55.130
All right.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:56.795
So let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:11.130
All right.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.540
So we'll just put
it up over here.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.690
So that means that
delta G is going

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:19.580
to be negative in that case
because you remove products.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.710
So Q is less than K,
and so the reaction

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:25.170
is going to be spontaneous
in the forward direction.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:26.910
Delta G will be
negative, and you'll

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:28.710
move to make more products.

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.870
Again, minimize the stress.

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:32.080
You took away products.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.780
You need to make more.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.620
Minimize the stress.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:40.650
Do problem set 5 and
minimize your stress.
