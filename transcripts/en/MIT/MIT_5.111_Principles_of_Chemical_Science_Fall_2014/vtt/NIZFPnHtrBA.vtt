00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.760
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So
that is electron affinity.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.750
But honestly, chemists
don't really talk so much

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.000
about electron affinity.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.010
They prefer to talk
about electronegativity.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.450
And these are highly
related terms.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.440
So this was also re-copied,
although completely identical,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.750
I think, between the handouts.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.300
I just thought it was weird
to have re-copied this and not

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.800
this.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.430
So your handout for today
is perfect on this point.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.730
So electron negativity,
the net ability

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.610
of an atom to attract an
electron from another atom.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.090
So you can see that electron
affinity and electronegativity

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.970
are very similar.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.230
In fact, all of these terms are
highly related to each other.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.310
And this idea of
electronegativity,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.400
of this as a term for a
way of thinking about atoms

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.460
initiated with Linus Pauling.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.860
But here I have up
a different picture.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.790
I have Robert Millikan.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.610
And the reason why I
picked this picture

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.830
is because he helped, a few
years after Linus Pauling came

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.790
up with this idea, coming
up with an equation

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.030
that help people think better
about what electronegativity

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.760
is.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.360
And another reason why
I picked his picture

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.890
to put up here instead
of Linus Pauling

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.470
is that he was an
MIT undergraduate,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.390
and he was a chemistry major.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.810
I'm not sure in
1917 or whenever--

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.530
that was the yearbook picture--
when he took-- I don't think

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.380
it was 5.111 at that point.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.140
But at some point, he was
here studying chemistry just

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.140
like you.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.150
And then when he got a
faculty position later on,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.070
he did some beautiful work that
had to do with bonding that he

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.360
got the Nobel Prize.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.539
So some of you may have a Nobel
Prize in chemistry one day.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.620
And so you want to make
sure your yearbook picture

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.720
is at least as good as this
one for other generations

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.850
of professors to
show your picture

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.640
and describe the work
that you did to contribute

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.020
to the field of chemistry.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.110
Oh, and he was born
in Massachusetts too,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.730
so he is a native to this
area in more than one way.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.230
All right.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.410
So the way that he-- and
this is a little bit more

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.740
of a squishy definition.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.460
So electron negativity is
proportional to a 1/2--

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.334
and IE stands for what?

00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:45.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.860
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Ionization energy.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.330
And EA-- our electron affinity
that we just discussed.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.830
All right.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.390
So it's related to
these other terms

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.080
that we have already
talked about.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.460
So let's think about
then what this means.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.950
So we can consider an atom
with high electronegativity

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.482
and an atom with low
electronegativity.

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:10.550
And we want to think
about whether an atom

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.730
with high electronegativity
is going to be an electron

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.080
acceptor or an electron donor.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.060
And that you can
tell me, and that is

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.690
going to be a clicker question.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.090
So you can try to grab
your handout while clicking

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.835
at the same time.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.580
All right.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.850
So we'll take 10 more seconds.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.900
Yes, 88%.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.970
That's great.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.570
Of course, if you looked
and if you didn't believe

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.420
it could be a donor, then that
ruled out three of the four,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.670
but that's OK.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.710
Those are good things.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.990
So yes, if it has high
electronegativity,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.730
it's going to be an
electron acceptor.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.600
And part of the
reason for that is

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.400
that it has a high
affinity for electrons.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.420
And another part of
the reason for that

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.320
is that if you look
at the equation, when

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.260
you have a high
ionization energy,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.320
something that has a
high ionization energy

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.970
is not going to be a good donor.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.920
So that wouldn't make sense.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.830
So both of those terms having
high in both categories

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.050
is consistent then
with this trend.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.060
So let's take a little
bit more of a look at that

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.640
and why this is true.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.070
So high
electronegativity, an atom

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.570
with high electronegativity
is an electron acceptor,

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.510
and then low would be a donor.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.012
And so if we think about this--
and this is our periodic table.

00:05:28.012 --> 00:05:29.720
And again, it's not
going to be including

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.100
our noble gases, which really
don't want to be accepting

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.770
or donating anything.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.070
So in this corner then we had
our high ionization energy,

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.670
and we had a high
electron affinity.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.650
And we saw last class we
had high ionization energy.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.160
So it doesn't want to
give up an electron,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.910
but it does want to accept one.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.070
So we have things that are
going to be good acceptors.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.560
And down here, we have
low ionization energy,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.855
so it's easy to
donate an electron.

00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:01.570
Oh, let me just put
these up, sorry.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.940
So we have then if you're
high and high up here,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.080
you have something
that's a good acceptor,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.950
and it's going to have a
high electronegativity.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.980
So high high means
high over there.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.330
And then down here,
we have low low,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.310
which means we have
low electronegativity.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.270
Low ionization energy-- it's
easy to give something up.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.310
Low electron affinity--
it doesn't want electrons.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.180
It's happy to give up electrons.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.220
And if it gives up
electrons, then you

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.390
can get a complete octet.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.191
It can have a noble
gas configuration.

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.690
So on this side,
you need electrons.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.920
This side, it's happy
to give them up.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.240
So if we look then just
at a periodic table again,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.220
this makes sense.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.140
We gain an electron over here.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.300
We get our happy noble
gas configuration.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.970
We lose electrons over here.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.480
We do the same thing.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.491
So that's a way to think
about electronegativity.

00:06:53.491 --> 00:06:53.990
All right.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.350
So why should we care
about electronegativity?

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.120
And that's because a lot of
atoms that are electronegative

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.620
are used in
pharmaceutical molecules,

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.170
and that this gives
them special properties.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.860
So to hear in their
own words, we're

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.910
going to hear from a former
uropper, Kateryna, talking

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.187
about why you should care
about electronegativity.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.420
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.550
- My name is
Kateryna Kozyrytska.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.120
I come from Ukraine.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.370
And I'm interested
in how microorganisms

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.350
fight each other.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.630
Humans are very smart.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.320
They have found chemical
ways to make new drugs.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.520
And so we spend a
lot of time and money

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.140
on making a new antibiotic,
and then we put it into people

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.090
and we hope for the best.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.390
Bacteria are also
very, very smart.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.690
And they somehow learn to
resist this new antibiotic

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.740
that we just made.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.170
Bugs, on the other hand,
have been fighting each other

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.382
with the same
molecules for thousands

00:08:04.382 --> 00:08:06.850
and thousands of
years, and we see

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.060
no resistance developing there.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.680
So we want to learn what
it is about the antibiotics

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.260
that bugs make to
fight each other that

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.710
makes them so difficult
to develop resistance to.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.830
Normally, living organisms
use 20 amino acids.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.080
But these bugs get
very tricky in building

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.410
their anti-other bugs molecules.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.049
So to add the
functionality, bugs

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:35.409
can do chemistry on
the building blocks,

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.630
the amino acids themselves.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.419
And so one of the
things that they can do

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.290
is chlorinate carbons, which
activates these carbons

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.360
for future chemistry.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.740
The protein I study,
the halogenase SyrB2,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.450
takes chloride ion from the
environment and a molecule

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.270
of threonine, the amino
acid, and puts those together

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.380
forming a chlorine-carbon bond.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.150
Since chlorine is so
electronegative, when bonded

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.350
to carbon it pulls electrons
away from the carbon atom.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.270
And so it makes
the carbon to which

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.340
it is attached
much more reactive

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.020
toward other molecules.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.190
And this increased reactivity,
at least partially,

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.470
accounts for the antibiotic
effect of the molecule.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.370
I am hoping to figure out how
SyrB2 positions all the atoms

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.900
in such a way that they react
in this very controlled, very

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.740
appropriate manner, so
that later we could maybe

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.670
re-engineer this or
other proteins to make

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.550
them do chemistry that
we want them to do.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.870
My hope is that we
could understand SyrB2

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.020
well enough that we'll
be able to remake it

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.840
into a protein
that will actively

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.426
participate in synthesis
of new antibiotics.

00:09:48.305 --> 00:09:48.888
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:49.888
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:51.410
So that is Kateryna.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.570
And so how adding
halogens, because they

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.355
are so electronegative, is
actually a very important area,

00:09:59.355 --> 00:10:01.700
and I'll give you a
couple more examples.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.365
I also haven't watched
that video in a little bit,

00:10:04.365 --> 00:10:06.060
and she said she was
from the Ukraine.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.210
She's technically
now part of Russia,

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.070
I think, from part
of Russia, so.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.820
Anyway, that's a topic
for a different day.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.340
So this is big business,
actually, putting halogens

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.390
on things.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:28.310
And if you become interested--
if you're taking an antibiotic

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.300
or something, start looking
at what the molecule is,

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.920
start counting how many
halogens are on that molecule,

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.700
you will find a lot.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.470
So a lot of antibiotics have
halogens, either chlorides

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.920
or fluorine, as shown here.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.680
Also a very common
antidepressant

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.780
has it, another
example of something

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.820
that is an anti-diabetic.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.220
Huge numbers of molecules
have halogens added to them.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.760
Some of these are derived
from natural products.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.530
So nature was making these
molecules to kill other bugs,

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.480
as you heard about in the video.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.220
Other times, they came
up with this molecule

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.950
and they said, well, we need to
make it a little bit different.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.947
It's being consumed too fast.

00:11:14.947 --> 00:11:16.530
It's broken down too
fast in the body.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.890
Let's add some halogens.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.600
So sometimes it's sort
of a man-made tailoring,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.740
but often it's a tailoring
that nature came up with.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.140
So why all these halogens?

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.710
What's the benefit of having
a carbon-fluorine bond instead

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.840
of carbon-hydrogen?

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.870
And one reason is that having
a fluorine, this really

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:43.150
electronegative atom, on, say,
an aryl ring like this one,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.610
it actually sucks the electrons
out of the ring and makes it

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.800
what we call, or organic
chemists like to call,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.040
electron poor.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.560
So it just kind of hauls
those electrons away.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.210
And when you make
something electron poor,

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.950
so by replacing
C-H with C-F, that

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.180
can make a potential drug
molecule electron poor.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.000
And what this does
often is make it

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.060
harder to oxidize the molecule.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.370
So we're going to talk about
oxidation-reduction much later

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.160
in the semester, and we'll
come back to this idea.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.600
But this turns out to
be really important,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.660
because the way that the body
metabolizes or breaks down

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.530
these molecules is
that it can oxidize it.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.120
And there are a number
of enzymes in your liver

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.780
which will oxidize and
break apart these drugs.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.500
And so if you make
it harder to oxidize,

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.780
that makes the drug more
stable in your body.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.290
So if you want to
take a drug, you

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.590
want it to last for a while.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.990
And especially if it's
something, an antibiotic,

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.050
you want it to last till it
kills all of the bacteria,

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.345
not just half of them.

00:12:50.345 --> 00:12:53.060
And most medicines, you
need them to be around

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.520
for them to have their effect.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.770
So you want to tailor
those molecules

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.850
so that they don't get broken
down as easily in the body.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.360
And so this is one reason,
and this is big business.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.530
And a lot of the times,
adding those halogens actually

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.330
involves pretty toxic chemicals.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.800
So some people, like Kateryna,
are interested in using enzymes

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.990
to do it instead.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.330
Some people who are still using
organic synthesis-- example

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.210
is Steve Buchwald's laboratory.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.960
In fact, if you go to almost
any top chemistry department,

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.460
I think there's
someone who's trying

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.112
to find out new methods of
putting halogens on molecules.

00:13:30.112 --> 00:13:33.320
It's a very important area
in designing new molecules

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.240
and improving them.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.110
OK.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.770
So that is electronegativity.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.460
So one atom added to
a big number of atoms

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.160
can change the property
of the molecule

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.750
by sucking electrons away.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.540
And now we're going to talk
about atomic and ionic radius

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.280
and also isoelectric atoms.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.000
So these trends are pretty good.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.760
We're back to some pretty
good-- fewer glitches.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.400
So what is the atomic radius?

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.090
So here we have 2r, 2
times the atomic radius.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.630
So the atomic radius
is defined by the value

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.590
of r that has about 90%
of the electron density.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.540
I mean, technically,
an electron could

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.520
be infinitely or close
to infinitely far away,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.020
but pretty much most of them are
going to be about within 90%.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.540
We call that the
radius of the atom.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.730
So they're trends.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.580
Trends are pretty good.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.090
So across the periodic
table, what matters

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.620
is the Z effective.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.770
See, everything we've
learned about it comes back.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.190
If you didn't
learn it on exam 1,

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.740
still learn it because
we're going to use it again.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.310
Across the periodic table,
Z effective matters.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.810
Down the periodic table, n, or
the principle quantum number,

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:48.650
matters.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.460
So how do these matter?

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.800
So across the periodic table, Z
effective is going to do what?

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.613
Increase or decrease?

00:14:56.613 --> 00:14:58.277
AUDIENCE: Increase.

00:14:58.277 --> 00:15:00.110
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So
it's going to increase

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.640
across the periodic
table, and this

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.710
results in a decrease
in the atomic radius.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.870
So again, it increases going
across the periodic table

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.970
because you're adding both
electrons and protons.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.850
But the electrons are not
giving you complete shielding,

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.250
so you're not canceling
out every proton

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.520
with every electron.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.480
So overall, you get an
increase in the Z effective.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.540
And because of that, when
you have this increased Z,

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.590
it's kind of pulling
the electrons in.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.690
And then it isn't until you
go down the periodic table

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.690
when n increases that you start
to see the radius increase.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.750
So there, the electrons
are getting farther away,

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.510
and so you are getting
this bigger thing.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.968
So I like to think about it as
sort of the mom at the park.

00:15:48.968 --> 00:15:52.990
There are some moms, their kids
are sort of running everywhere,

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:57.190
but other ones are sort
of hauling their kids in.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.110
They have this
positive force that

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.240
seems to keep them all sort
of in the general area.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.855
And so they're
shrinking the size

00:16:03.855 --> 00:16:07.070
of their kids' play
area with this force

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.230
that they're exerting.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.790
But if the kids
get too far away,

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.600
it's like, yeah, they're
not going to hear you call.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.900
They're not going to hear
you jump up and down.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.190
They're not going to see you.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.160
And so they're just
going to be out there,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.880
and the radius of your kids
is going to be farther away.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.620
So we can look at these trends.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.800
If we're over here
in the beginning,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.130
we're starting on this side.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.760
We're going across
the periodic table.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.960
We go down, then we have a
jump up when we increase n.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.610
And then we go down again,
then we have a jump up

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.900
when we increase n.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.010
We go down again, except over
here there's a little glitch.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.007
Those d electrons, they're back.

00:16:43.007 --> 00:16:44.840
They're going to give
you a couple glitches.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.890
I love d electrons.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.317
We're going to talk about
them more around Thanksgiving.

00:16:48.317 --> 00:16:49.900
That's my favorite
part of the course.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.990
Those d electrons are
always causing trouble.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.489
OK.

00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:55.200
Then we go up again, and
then we go down, and go up,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:55.840
and go down.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.756
Those are pretty good.

00:16:56.756 --> 00:16:58.820
Those are pretty good trends.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.760
All right.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.960
OK.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.040
So ions.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.030
Ions are different than their
neutral parent, once again.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:12.670
So we saw this before, that
when you start filling the 3d,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.710
the energy levels change.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.710
So ions can have
different properties

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.420
than their neutral parents.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.410
And so if we have
two kinds of ions,

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.670
we can have cations, which
are positively charged.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.300
And so a positively charged
ion will have lost an electron,

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.520
and so it's going to be
smaller than its parent.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.620
And so we can see here lithium.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.460
And then in the center,
that's lithium plus.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.470
So when you lose the
electron, the radius

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.990
actually shrinks quite a bit.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.420
It's like that electron
was just really kind

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.190
of causing a bigger radius.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.300
And when it's
finally gone, you're

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.930
at a smaller size over there.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.480
Anions-- negatively
charged ions.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.660
So they're gaining an
electron, and their radius

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.510
is larger than their parent.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.810
And so you can see over here,
we have oxygen in the center.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.950
Oxygen minus 2 is much larger.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.090
And again, we can see
some of the other trends.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.850
Some of them are the same.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.860
The ionic radius
also will increase

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.940
when we're going down a group,
so when n is increasing,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.720
so from lithium to sodium.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.830
We have an increase
from fluorine

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.440
to the top of the periodic
table to chlorine.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.990
So we still, as we increase
n, increase in size.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.200
But you have to think about the
ion-- did it lose an electron,

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.220
or did it gain an
electron-- to think

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:38.430
about how its size changed
with respect to its parent.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.380
So why does this matter?

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.510
There's one example
of-- if you're

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.320
interested in
biology or anything

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.870
to do with the brain
or neurons, then

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.990
you should care
about ion channels.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.600
So there are channels in
membranes that bring ions in,

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.440
and this is really important.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.890
So ion channels are in
muscle cells and in neurons.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:08.020
So if you want to move or think,
something that MIT students

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.220
generally like to do
both of those things,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.470
you need ion
channels to do that.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.510
So ion channels should
be important to you.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.120
And you want ion channels.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.680
They regulate the influx
of ions into the cell

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.140
and allow for really
rapid responses,

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.310
which is also really important.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.750
And amazingly, they're highly
selective for certain ions.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.360
So this is important.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.120
It needs to be tightly regulated
to say how much sodium you

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.710
have in there or
how much potassium

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.080
that you have coming in.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.380
And if the ion
channel took potassium

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.580
when it was supposed to take
sodium, that would not be good.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.990
So these channels are
designed by nature

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.380
to be highly
selective, and so they

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.960
care to be highly selective.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.280
And you're talking about a
plus 1 maybe or another plus 1,

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.400
they have to think
about the radius.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.480
So why don't you tell
me what the differential

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.150
is in the radius from smallest
to largest for these three

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.030
different ones.

00:20:56.745 --> 00:20:57.870
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.470
OK, great.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.080
So most people got that right.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.370
Let's just kind of
take a look at that.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:27.400
So here we want to
think about the neutral,

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.690
and then this one has
one less electron.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.380
So that's going to be smaller.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.530
And then when you compare
potassium with sodium,

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.180
you have to think about n.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.310
And so this is down
farther, so that's

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.170
going to be bigger than sodium.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.670
So here we're thinking
about the difference

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:48.490
in electron configuration, and
here we're thinking about n.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:48.990
All right.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.130
So amazingly, these channels
have it figured out,

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.290
and so look at this.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.035
This is about
significant figures.

00:21:56.035 --> 00:21:58.160
Too many people lost points
on significant figures,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.370
I have to say, on the exam,
so make sure you learn them.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.620
But if you had,
say-- you say, oh,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.410
what's the difference between
1 to 3 significant figures?

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.680
The difference is sort of the
potassium versus the sodium

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.330
radius.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.420
So 1.38 times 10
to the minus 10,

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.450
1.02 times 10 to
the minus 10-- those

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:17.820
seem like pretty small numbers.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.880
Does it really matter
if it's 0.2 versus 0.38?

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.400
And the answer is,
yes, you'd be dead

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.930
if nature could not distinguish
between these significant

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.260
figures for you.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.680
So these channels
are designed to be

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:36.370
selective at that kind of atomic
scale, and only let one ion in.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.720
And so Rod MacKinnon,
who's a crystallographer,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.520
won a Nobel Prize for solving
some of the structures

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.950
of these ion channels.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.940
And this just shows
a ribbon drawing,

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.720
and this shows an all
atom drawing of a channel,

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.900
and there's an
ion going through.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.600
That's its hole, and its
radius is perfect for that ion.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.130
And the other one,
even though it's not

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.370
that many significant figures
different, doesn't fit.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.610
And that's pretty amazing.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.320
Nature is truly amazing.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.110
That's the hole.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:08.530
It makes a perfect hole
just for the one kind of ion

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.160
that it's supposed to accept.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:11.750
All right.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.912
So now, there are
one more definition

00:23:16.912 --> 00:23:17.870
that we're going to do.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.330
There are things that can
have the same electron

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.650
configuration.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:27.170
Those are called isoelectronic,
and let's think about those.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.220
They don't necessarily
have the same size,

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.400
but they have the same
electron configuration.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.370
And I'm just going
to write these out.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:40.480
So when we think around other
ones near neon, noble gas, that

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.820
would have that exact
configuration-- so how

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.990
do we get flourine to
have that configuration?

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.380
What does it need to do--
gain or lose an electron,

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.110
and how many?

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.728
What would its state be?

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.270
So what do I write-- what's
the thing for flourine that

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:05.480
is going to be the same electron
configuration just in terms

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.390
of its charge?

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.870
I'd write F what?

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:08.780
AUDIENCE: Minus.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.030
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Minus.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.480
For O, what am I going to write?

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.021
For oxygen, what am
I going to write?

00:24:13.021 --> 00:24:13.850
AUDIENCE: 2 minus.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.300
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 2 minus.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.590
And, say, nitrogen?

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.620
We'll stop there.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.310
What's that?

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.170
AUDIENCE: 3 minus.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.295
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 3 minus.

00:24:20.295 --> 00:24:20.960
Great.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.490
Let's go on the other side.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:23.900
What about for sodium?

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.510
What does sodium have to do
to have that configuration?

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.440
AUDIENCE: Plus.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.440
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Plus.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.910
What about Mg?

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.330
AUDIENCE: 2 plus.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.290
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 2 plus.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.780
Aluminum?

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.419
AUDIENCE: 3 plus.

00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:40.335
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK.

00:24:40.335 --> 00:24:42.850
And silicon-- 4 plus.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.050
So you get the idea.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.300
And now, we can think about
which will have bigger

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.700
and which will have
smaller radii as well.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:59.287
So are these going to
be bigger or smaller?

00:24:59.287 --> 00:25:00.162
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:00.162 --> 00:25:01.203
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Right.

00:25:01.203 --> 00:25:06.400
So they're going to have
larger radii than their parents

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.510
because they've all gained.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:11.550
And then over
here, these will be

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.140
smaller since they've
lost electrons

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.270
compared to their parent ion.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:22.150
OK, so let's just do one,
which should be very fast,

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.130
clicker question.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.820
It is a clicker
competition after all,

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.363
so we've got to get in some
extra clicker questions.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.290
And this should be
very fast, I think.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.138
All right, let's just
do 10 more seconds.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.345
You have a periodic table
up here in case you need it.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:17.030
Yeah, OK, that's not going to
distinguish the recitations

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.000
very much.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.110
Yeah, so you just have
to look at what is nearby

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.760
and think about how many
electrons it needs to gain

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.220
or lose to have the
same configuration.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:32.090
All right, bonds--
now, we're up to bonds.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:36.294
There are three types of
bonds we will discuss today.

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:37.960
We probably won't get
to them all today.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.300
After all, the handout stuff.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.450
But anyway, then we will
discuss in the class over time.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.600
Now, some of you have probably
figured out-- almost everyone

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.120
has probably figured out that
one of the things I love to do

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.940
is teach chemistry.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.860
I love to teach chemistry.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.530
Some of you have come to my
office hours or pizza forums

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.350
or even paid attention
to some of my slides

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:03.910
about office hours may
realize that I love dogs.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:08.100
So I love teaching
chemistry, and I love dogs.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.140
What is the most amazing
thing that you can think of?

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.026
Dogs teaching chemistry.

00:27:18.172 --> 00:27:18.838
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:18.838 --> 00:27:21.303
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So now,
I'm going to let dogs--

00:27:21.303 --> 00:27:23.275
- Welcome to "Dogs
Teaching Chemistry!"

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:25.108
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
--tell you about bonding.

00:27:25.108 --> 00:27:27.712
- --is chemical bonding.

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:31.163
Chemical bonds are what
holds atoms together.

00:27:31.163 --> 00:27:34.121
A chemical bond is an
attraction between atoms

00:27:34.121 --> 00:27:37.079
that allows the formation
of a chemical substance.

00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:40.530
The electrons that
participate in a chemical bond

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.009
are called valence electrons.

00:27:42.009 --> 00:27:44.967
These are electrons that are
found in an atom's outermost

00:27:44.967 --> 00:27:47.450
shell.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.674
Let's take a look at the
types of chemical bonds

00:27:49.674 --> 00:27:51.168
that can be formed
between atoms.

00:27:56.646 --> 00:27:59.634
An ionic bond is formed
when one of the atoms

00:27:59.634 --> 00:28:02.640
will lose its electron
to the other atom.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.335
This results in a
positively charged ion

00:28:05.335 --> 00:28:09.279
called a cation and a negatively
charged ion called an anion.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.586
Positive and negative
attract, and the result

00:28:14.586 --> 00:28:16.038
is an ionic bond.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.030
Covalent chemical bonds
involve the sharing

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:29.361
of a pair of valence
electrons by two atoms.

00:28:29.361 --> 00:28:32.464
There is also what is
called polar covalent bonds.

00:28:32.464 --> 00:28:34.844
These are covalent
bonds in which

00:28:34.844 --> 00:28:38.180
the sharing of the
electron pair is unequal.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.515
The result is a bond
where the electron

00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:43.872
pair is displaced toward the
more electronegative atom.

00:28:49.848 --> 00:28:52.836
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you guys next time.

00:29:02.796 --> 00:29:03.792
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:09.768
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:14.055 --> 00:29:16.180
CATHERINE DRENNAN: There's,
I think, one other one,

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.090
but that is totally
the best one.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.860
And everything they
say is exactly right,

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.900
so it's really exciting.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.070
I even love it when
they had the two--

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.750
they put two balls in there
that they were sharing.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.220
It's just really very well done.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.050
OK, so now, you've probably
filled in some of your notes

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.950
here, but in case you
missed some of them,

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:38.260
I will tell you exactly
what the dogs just told you.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.240
The dogs had it
completely correct.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:47.170
So ionic bonds is the transfer
of an electron, as you saw,

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:51.220
and then the generation
of a cation and an anion

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.490
that are attracted to each
other due to the charge.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.860
So the bonding comes
from that attraction

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.610
between the positively charged
and the negatively charged

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:04.380
atom, and an example that you're
probably all familiar with is

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.190
table salt, NaCL.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.490
And so you have Na plus
and CL minus that are

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.640
attracted to each other
and form these bonds,

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.110
which creates table
salt. So let's see

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.110
how far we can get in
thinking about, really,

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.990
this interaction
between ionic bonds,

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.990
and we'll see if we can
get through ionic bonds.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.260
We might have to wait until
covalent bonds until Monday,

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.940
but let's see if
we can finish this.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:35.160
So the formation of NaCL from
neutral Na and neutral CL

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.620
will first involve forming
your cations and your anions.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.940
So you have Na going to
Na plus plus an electron,

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.690
and so here, you're
talking about a process

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:50.400
where the energy is going to be
equal to the ionization energy

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:50.900
again.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.580
So we're not moving far
away from these terms

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:58.580
because you're talking about
ionizing a neutral atom to Na

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.350
plus, and there's
a value for that.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:06.610
And then we're talking about
neutral CL, neutral chlorine,

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:10.950
going to CL minus, and so
it's gaining an electron.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.080
So here, the process
you're talking about

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:18.720
is the electron affinity,
and so the energy change here

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.960
is equal to the negative
electron affinity, which

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.520
is minus 349 in this case.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.320
So this is a
favorable process here

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:36.130
to gain this extra electron,
and so overall, the Delta E here

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.520
is negative.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.300
So now, if we're going to
talk about this process here,

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.800
we have two of
these, so we're going

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.050
to go-- we're going to
put these guys together.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.070
So we need both of
those to ionize,

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.940
and so we can add up
what energy difference

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.890
we should expect to
form Na plus and CL

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.360
minus together
from their parents.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.480
And so we have,
now, a plus-- we've

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:04.940
added these two together-- a
plus 145 kilojoules per mol.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.700
So this seems weird.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.280
It's plus, and so
now, we're seeing

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.120
that the formation of these
ions from their neutral atoms

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.350
has this positive value, which
means it requires energy.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:20.510
But we think about NaCL as being
this natural table salt thing,

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:27.510
so why is there so much table
salt if this requires energy

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.550
to do it?

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:32.190
And the answer is that this
is only part of the process.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.030
You need to form your
cations and anions,

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:38.200
but then you have energy
of them coming together.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.850
So they're attracted
to each other,

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.980
and that's a really important
part of forming the bond.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.540
And they're attracted by a
simple coulombic relationship

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.530
here.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:51.170
So the attraction between
the positively charged

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.830
and the negatively
charged ion has

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:59.100
an energy of minus 589
kilojoules per mol,

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:05.520
so overall then, if you consider
both forming Na plus and CL

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.480
minus and the
attraction between them,

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.080
we have a negative Delta E 444.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:18.510
So the net energy here is
in favor of forming NaCL.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.230
We have a decrease in energy.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:24.490
This is a stable compound,
so let's look at where

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.240
this number comes from.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.240
So we just put this out.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.680
That's the coulomb
thing, but let's

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.540
actually calculate this and see
where that number comes from.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.220
So we're back to
coulombic equations again.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.650
We never get very far away.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.880
They turn out to be very
important in chemistry.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.690
So we have the
coulombic potential.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.460
We have z's, our
charge on our ions.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.590
We have the absolute
value of the charge

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:53.500
of an electron squared
over 4 pi, our permittivity

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:57.750
constant in r, our distance
between those ions.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.620
And for any CL the bond
length, or the distance

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:06.310
between Na plus and CL
minus, is 2.36 angstroms,

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:09.900
so we can use that and just
plug it into the equation.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.010
And we have plus 1 for the
sodium, minus 1 for chloride,

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:17.944
so overall, this will
be a negative term.

00:34:17.944 --> 00:34:19.360
And if you work
out the math, it's

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.610
minus 9.774 times 10 to
the minus 19th joules,

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.730
and we have three
significant figures.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.504
What's limiting our
significant figures?

00:34:29.504 --> 00:34:30.452
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:30.452 --> 00:34:32.493
CATHERINE DRENNAN: What--
yeah, the bottom length

00:34:32.493 --> 00:34:34.100
is limiting it here.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.270
I'm just going to talk
about significant figures

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:39.449
for a while, until Test 2
when you can demonstrate I

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:41.860
can stop talking about
significant figures.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.760
All right, so then we want to
convert to kilojoules per mol

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.810
because that was the
number I gave you,

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:51.750
was in kilojoules per mol, so
we have our conversion factor

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.136
between joules and kilojoules.

00:34:53.136 --> 00:34:54.719
And I guess I should
mention up here--

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:57.820
coulombs cancel, and
our meters cancel,

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.810
so we're left in
joules up there.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:01.980
Units are also important.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.690
Then we can use
Avogadro's number,

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.380
because we're given
kilojoules per mol,

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.690
and we can get out the
number I gave you before.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.820
So this number really
just comes right out

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:16.250
of this equation minus
589 kilojoules per mol.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.620
So we have our ionization energy
to tell us about forming ions.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.660
We have our electron
affinity, and now, we

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:26.120
have a coulombic relationship.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.250
So I said before-- this
is what I showed you

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:32.370
before-- that we have this
attraction that's favorable.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.420
We have forming
the ions, which had

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.120
a positive energy
associated with it,

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:42.380
but overall, this process
has a lower energy.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.710
It forms a bond.

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.560
But this is just based
on this calculation.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.880
So we can ask what is the
experimental measurement

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.480
for this interaction,
and we note

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.480
that it's somewhat different.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.155
So we have, instead
of minus 444,

00:35:58.155 --> 00:36:02.510
we have minus 411
kilojoules per mol.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:06.000
So why the difference?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.330
So again, our ionic model,
which just considers

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.940
ionization energy,
electron affinity,

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.360
and that positive
coulimbic interaction

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.990
in our experimental result--
so problems with this model

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:24.630
that we did up here include
that we only thought

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.710
about favorable interactions.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:30.510
There are also going to be
some that are not favorable;

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.900
protons against other protons,
repulsion, electron electron

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.000
repulsion.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.330
So there are some negatives.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.030
It's never all positive
in any relationship,

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.640
whether it's sodium
chloride or anything else.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.710
Always some negatives,
and we ignore those.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:46.360
And the result of
this is that you're

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.590
going to get a larger
Delta E predicted

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.310
than the experimental value.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:53.550
So it seems like this
is more favorable,

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.770
like that's a stronger bond,
a stronger interaction;

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:59.010
but really, if there's
some repulsion,

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.830
that's overestimated.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.800
It's really going to be
a lower value, which is

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.890
what you see in the experiment.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:10.450
Also, we just said that sodium
plus was one point charge

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.280
and CL minus was another.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.590
It's more complicated.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.460
Their interactions are
more complicated than that.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:21.160
And we ignored quantum
mechanics, but in doing that,

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.220
we did pretty well.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.950
If we had one
significant figure,

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:28.460
we would have been perfect,
so to one significant figure,

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.380
these approximations
work really well.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.900
OK, that's it for today,
and I will see you Monday.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.800
Have a great weekend.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.435
All right, let's just
take 10 more seconds

00:37:48.435 --> 00:37:49.434
on the clicker question.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.890
Great, so people are
getting the hang of this.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:10.520
If you hadn't yet,
there's still time.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:17.040
So as you're going across
the periodic table,

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.340
you are increasing z and
increasing the z effective

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.240
as well, because you don't
have total shielding,

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.370
so aluminum is the
correct answer.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:27.930
It has a lower z effective,
and so therefore,

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.280
a smaller ionization energy.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.890
The electrons aren't
held as tightly.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:35.790
All right, so we're talking
about chemical bonds,

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.860
and it seems like
an appropriate topic

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.340
to talk about when we're
also talking about bonding

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.930
as a community, so that
seems like a good thing.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:47.690
So a chemical bond is
an arrangement of atoms

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.770
so that they come
together in such a way

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.290
that they're lower
in energy than they

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:54.720
were when they were apart.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.610
So they're more stable
together than they were apart,

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.910
and that's a chemical bond.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:02.380
So this is page five of
the handout from last time.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.600
And excitingly, we have
Lecture 10 handouts today,

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.180
so there's lots of
things working today.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.590
All right, so this is
lower in energy, i.e.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:15.140
more negative, when these
atoms come together.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.080
So a chemical bond--
as you saw last time

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.260
with those wonderful
dogs sharing a pull toy,

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.490
a covalent bond is a bond
where the electrons are shared

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.860
between these two
atoms, and each atom

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:33.020
is giving up one bond to share.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.240
So we can think about this
more graphically of what

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.490
is happening, and we have this
little plot on your notes,

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.420
where you're going to be
filling in a bunch of details.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.740
So we have the internuclear
distance, r, the distance

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:48.980
between the two nuclei.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.730
And we're back to
hydrogen for the moment,

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:54.990
so we're going to talk about
a bond between two H atoms.

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:58.640
And on the axis over
here, we have energy.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.670
So we have energy versus the
distance between these two

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.180
hydrogens.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.340
So at 0 energy, we just have
the hydrogens by themselves.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.050
They're not interacting with
each other in any kind of way

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.230
that lowers either
one of their energies.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:17.350
There's no interaction,
no energy change.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.510
They're not interacting.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.560
Down here at this dash
line, we do have a bond,

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.210
so we formed H2.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:27.090
The hydrogen atoms are
interacting with each other,

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:29.960
and this is lower in energy.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.150
So what does this
plot look like then

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:37.750
if you draw energy
versus this distance?

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:42.060
So up here, it's above and
higher energy, above 0--

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:47.080
this is unfavorable-- going
down to this dashed line

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.740
and then going back up to 0.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.277
So let's think about
what's happening here,

00:40:52.277 --> 00:40:53.860
and there's a bunch
of different kinds

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.610
of interactions you can have
between those two hydrogen

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.110
atoms.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:00.070
There are repulsive
interactions,

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:04.030
nuclear nuclear repulsion,
electron electron repulsion;

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.540
and there are
positive interactions

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.330
like the electron nuclear,
the positive and negative.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.840
So up here, these atoms
are very close together,

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.720
and that is-- they're really too
close, and that's unfavorable.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.970
Two objects trying to occupy
the same space at the same time

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.530
is unfavorable.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.990
But as you start
separating out these atoms,

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.700
then they become
more comfortable,

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.920
and you get to a
distance where you

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.800
have the sharing of electrons.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.020
They're next to each other.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.490
They're interacting
in a positive way,

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.390
and they're sharing.

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:40.010
But then if you bring
them too far apart,

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:42.090
they're no longer
communicating with each other.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.890
We don't even know where one
of them is at this point.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.310
They're just kind of
infinitely far apart.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.870
No interaction.

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:55.180
So we go from too close to
just right to too far away.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:42:02.770
So this distance here that
has this minimum energy-- OK,

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:05.980
so we have this
minimum energy here,

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.760
and that's the distance at which
you have this really favorable

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.770
interaction, this bond length.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:15.760
That's the bond length between
those two hydrogens right here.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.750
Now, we can think about this
energy difference over here,

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.840
and it has a special name.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:28.040
So this is the dissociation
energy, or Delta E sub d.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.160
Sometimes, it's just called
big capital D in your textbook.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.940
So this is the
energy that's needed

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.060
to dissociate those atoms.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.310
So if the atoms come together,
and they're lower in energy,

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:41.350
if you then want to
break them apart,

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:45.250
you need to put energy in so
that they can be broken apart.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:48.090
And that's called the
dissociation energy.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:49.960
And if it's a really
big number, that

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.240
means it's very hard
to dissociate them,

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.990
and if it's a small
number, it's pretty easy.

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:58.030
So this is our
dissociation energy here.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:04.430
So for hydrogen, this value
is 424 kilojoules per mol.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:07.690
And if we were putting
it on this axis here,

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.520
it would be right
down here, so it's

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.130
going to be a negative
value on this axis.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:17.250
We're below 0, so the negative
of the dissociation energy

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:21.410
is found down here, minus
424 kilojoules per mol.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.490
And if you wanted
to break that bond,

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.930
you would need to put in
energy, so dissociation energy

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:27.870
is positive.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:33.110
It's the energy you need to
put in to break those bonds.

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:38.480
So we can think about this
plot now and consider looking

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.230
at the plot and evaluating what
you can and cannot say about

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:45.610
different kinds of compounds,
their bond lengths,

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:48.990
and also their
dissociation energies.

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:50.350
So we good people?

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.530
Mostly got this written down?

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:56.440
And today, for some of the
people who wanted to come late,

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.540
we can post versions
of this, too.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.020
All right, so now let's
consider this plot

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.830
and ask which bond is stronger?

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:07.220
So we have hydrazine,
and we also

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.840
have molecular nitrogen, N2.

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.930
And in your dashed line,
you have nitrogen, N2,

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.190
and in the solid line,
you have hydrazine.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.960
So can you just
look at this plot

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.700
and tell me which is stronger?

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.160
Is nitrogen or
hydrazine stronger?

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.225
And you can just yell
out what you think.

00:44:29.225 --> 00:44:30.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.780
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.440
So nitrogen is going
to be stronger here,

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.430
and people knew that
because it's a deeper well.

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:41.870
So you go way farther down,
there's more stabilization.

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:46.580
It's a lower energy, a lower
negative value of energy,

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:50.060
so that means it's going to have
a greater dissociation energy.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.230
You'd have to put in more energy
to dissociate nitrogen nitrogen

00:44:54.230 --> 00:45:00.660
than these two submolecules
here in hydrozine.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.720
All right, so we can
also look at this plot

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.091
and ask the question,
which has a shorter bond?

00:45:07.091 --> 00:45:07.840
What do you think?

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.050
Which bond is shorter?

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:10.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.200
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Nitrogen as well, right.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.730
So nitrogen is also
the shorter bond,

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:18.630
and we know this because
this is increasing distance.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.820
And this is closer to the axis,
so this has a shorter distance.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.550
And later, we're
going to be doing

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.867
Lewis structures and
other things of nitrogen

00:45:26.867 --> 00:45:29.200
and discover it has a triple
bond, which you may already

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.490
know, and we'll talk more about
nitrogen's amazing triple bond

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.230
as we go along.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:37.450
And so that's a very short bond
and a very, very strong bond

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:38.217
as well.

00:45:38.217 --> 00:45:40.050
So you should be able
to look at these plots

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:44.010
and evaluate what kind
of dissociation energy

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.250
it would have, is it
bigger or smaller,

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:49.620
and also what kind of distance
you expect between them.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.460
And you should be able to
draw these kinds of plots

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:56.790
on the exam, if asked, in
just kind of simple detail.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.630
Nothing too fancy.

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:04.310
All right, so in terms
of bond strengths,

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:07.390
carbon monoxide has one
of the strongest bonds,

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.430
so it has a very large
dissociation energy.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.387
And iodide, I2, has
one of the weaker ones.

00:46:13.387 --> 00:46:14.970
And later in the
semester, we're going

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:19.260
to be doing a demo that shows
why that's kind of cool,

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:25.110
that weak bond leads to
some cool, cool demos.

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:29.020
OK, so those are covalent bonds.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.880
And, Ashley, could you just
close that door, please?

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.130
All right, so let's
finish polar covalent,

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.780
and then we'll have
our moment of silence,

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.180
and maybe it'll be silent in
the hallway by then as well.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.500
All right, so polar
covalent bonds--

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.250
so last time, the dog
showed you that you

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:48.414
can have equal sharing
and unequal sharing.

00:46:48.414 --> 00:46:49.830
And of those of
you who've watched

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.790
dogs play with pully
toys, most of the time,

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:55.350
the sharing is pretty
unequal, and so whenever

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.769
you see that again, you
can think polar covalent

00:46:57.769 --> 00:46:59.560
and tell your friends,
and they'll be like,

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.310
"I don't know what
happened to you at MIT.

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:02.630
Those are two dogs playing.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.630
What are you talking about?"

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:10.280
So this is unequal sharing of
electrons between two atoms,

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.553
and this happens when those
atoms have a very different

00:47:13.553 --> 00:47:14.303
electronegativity.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:21.140
So in general, a bond
between two atoms

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.600
is considered a
polar covalent bond

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.310
when the difference in electric
negativity between the atoms

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:32.670
is greater than 0.4
and less than 1.7,

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:37.380
and that's Linus Pauling's
scale and works quite well.

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.200
So if we look at
this little plot,

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.760
we could see that carbon
hydrogen bond only

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.490
has a 0.4 difference,
so that would not

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.450
be considered a
polar covalent bond.

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:51.510
But nitrogen hydrogen
is a difference

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:55.740
that is greater than 0.4, so
that would be a polar bond.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.250
And so you can use these
values to think about

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.880
whether you're going to
have unequal sharing,

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.280
and the more
electronegative element

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.780
is going to be pulling
on those electrons.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.480
We also can use this to
think about polar molecules,

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.660
and this is kind of a little
bit of a flash forward

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.410
to Friday's lecture.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:18.010
We're going to talk
about shapes of molecules

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:21.750
because a polar molecule
has to have polar bonds,

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:25.230
but also has to have those
bonds arranged in such a way

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:27.950
that there's a net difference,
there's a net dipole,

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:31.000
there's a net kind of
pulling of those electrons

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.540
in a different way.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.690
So here is carbon
dioxide, a molecule

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:37.180
that causes global warming.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.090
Yes, I said it on the videotape.

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:42.210
Yes, I believe that
human beings are

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.530
responsible for some
of the global warming,

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:47.220
and we should do
something about it.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.340
This molecule does
have polar bonds,

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.150
so we have carbon in the
middle and oxygen here.

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:57.100
So carbon and oxygen have an
electronegativity difference

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:02.070
greater than 0.4, but it's
not really a polar molecule.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:05.610
It's a non-polar molecule, and
that's because of its shape.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.910
So shape matters.

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:11.410
So we have pulling
of electrons one way,

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:14.149
but we have equal and opposite
pulling of electrons other way.

00:49:14.149 --> 00:49:15.690
This would be really
cool if the dogs

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.180
could have done this as well.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.930
So in this case, we have
a non-polar molecule

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:22.670
that has polar bonds.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.800
Now, there's only very few
cases where this would actually

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:30.270
be true, and you really need
to think about the shape.

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:33.170
And so that's why we're
going to talk about shape.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:40.380
Another molecule that also
has polar bonds is water.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.600
So here, we have polar
bonds between the oxygen

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:49.090
and the hydrogen, so oxygen
and hydrogen, greater than 0.4.

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.880
But in this case,
the shape of water

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.740
is such that they
don't cancel out,

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.690
and you do have a net dipole.

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:01.440
You do have a net
charge on that molecule,

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.890
makes it a polar molecule.

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:07.530
So we need to know
about the shape,

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:11.150
and we need to know
about electronegativity.

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:14.370
So in large, organic
molecules, sometimes we

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:16.920
just talk about the
number of polar bonds

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.520
and then think
about whether that's

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.814
likely to be a polar
molecule or not.

00:50:20.814 --> 00:50:23.230
You can't always think about
the shape of something really

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:27.660
complicated and what direction
all of the pulling of electrons

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:31.960
is going, but we can at
least count polar bonds.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:36.960
So here are two vitamins,
vitamin A and vitamin B-9,

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.610
which I think is also B-10
and a number of other B's.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:42.960
Its name is folic acid.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.730
They kept finding
it again and again,

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:47.640
so there's a whole gap of
b-vitamins where they're like,

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:52.080
oh, B-9, folic acid;
B-10, also folic acid;

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.970
B-11, I think also folic acid.

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:55.970
B-12 something
different, though.

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:59.114
So anyway, this is a
very important B vitamin,

00:50:59.114 --> 00:51:01.530
and I'm actually going to come
back to this molecule later

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:02.900
in the course.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.434
But we can think about how
many polar bonds it has,

00:51:06.434 --> 00:51:07.684
and that's a clicker question.

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.020
And there, you have the
molecules up here to look at.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.470
All right, let's just
take 10 more seconds.

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:31.440
It takes a while to
count, but I think

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.700
you probably can answer it
without maybe fully counting

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:35.535
all of them.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:49.840
All right, so over here now,
the answer is the folic acid,

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.670
and I'll just highlight.

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:54.400
You might not have found
all of these polar bonds,

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.650
but you should have at least
seen that this one really

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:57.950
didn't have many.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.450
Vitamin A only has one.

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.760
So we have polar bonds down
here between carbon and oxygen

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.230
over here, carbon and oxygen,
nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:12.750
oxygen again, nitrogen with
hydrogen, oxygen with hydrogen,

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:15.080
nitrogen with
hydrogen over here.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.950
So folic acid is quite
polar, and if we're

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:22.860
going to think, now, about
whether it is a water

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:26.510
soluble vitamin or a fat
soluble vitamin-- which

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:29.350
is something that a lot
of times your supplements

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:31.900
will tell you about.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.630
If it's water soluble-- and
we'll talk about this more

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:36.940
later-- like dissolves likes.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.460
So water likes polar
molecules, which

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:44.150
makes folic acid water
soluble and makes vitamin

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:45.850
A fat soluble.

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:50.070
It's not very polar, doesn't
dissolve very well in water.

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:53.100
And this kind of turns
out to be important,

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.740
in that if you read your
vitamin supplements,

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:59.640
if you take vitamin supplements,
it will often tell you

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.950
interesting things like
how many hundred times

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:05.890
over the daily
recommended allowance

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:09.980
this vitamin tablet is, and
if things are water soluble,

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.810
it doesn't matter
so much that you're

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:15.290
taking way more than
your body actually needs.

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:19.120
You just have a
very expensive pee.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.547
But if it's fat
soluble, then it's

00:53:21.547 --> 00:53:23.630
going to stay in your body,
and you don't need it,

00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:25.450
and it can be a
little bit toxic.

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:27.930
So try to think
about the vitamins.

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.850
Not everything-- even though
vitamins are good for you,

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:34.150
they're not good in every kind
of amount that you could take,

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:38.680
so you will now use your
knowledge of polar bonds

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.510
to figure out whether you
should be taking certain vitamin

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:43.060
supplements.
