00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.670
CATHERINE DRENNAN: There
are five types of problems.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.880
We just did two.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.430
And now I'm going to convince
you that salt and water

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.600
problems are in fact the same
as weak acid weak base problems.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.985
So we're going to move
now to today's handout.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.340
So the pH of a salt
solution is determined

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.850
by what made that
salt. So a salt

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.290
is formed when you neutralize
an acid with a base or a base

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.660
with an acid.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.310
And so depending on
what acid and which

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.550
base were used and
mixed together,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.050
the salt might have
a different pH.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.930
So an example here if
we had HCl and NaOH,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.635
that's going to give our friend
table salt NaCl and water.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.300
The pH of the salt and
water is not always neutral.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.980
In this case it would be,
but it's not always neutral.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.450
It depends on the
nature of the acid

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.440
and the nature of the base
that were mixed together

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.960
to form that salt. So
there are some rules

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.130
to help you figure out
whether something's

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.700
going to be acidic or basic.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.790
And if you have a
salt that contains

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.330
a conjugate acid of
a weak base, so it

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.160
has a conjugate
acid in it, it will

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.630
produce an acidic solution.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.940
And if you have a salt that
has small highly charged metal

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.470
cations like iron plus 3,
that will also be acidic.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.090
So we saw last time I had
the prescription medicine

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.615
for my daughter, which was iron
sulfate, was highly acidic.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.620
So note that periodic
table group 1 and group

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.750
2 ions, lithium plus 1,
calcium plus 2, sodium plus 1--

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.190
these are all
going to be neutral

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.710
and in fact, anything
plus 1 neutral.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.150
And then salts that can take
conjugate bases of weak acids

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.840
will produce basic solution.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.710
So you're going to
be asking yourself,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.560
does this solution have a
conjugate acid of a weak base?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.280
Does it have a conjugate
base of weak acid?

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.122
Does it have group 1,
group 2-- what's in there?

00:03:03.122 --> 00:03:05.080
And then you can think
about whether it's going

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.100
to be acidic, neutral or basic.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.180
So let's look at some examples.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.850
So we have a salt, NH4Cl.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.300
And we want to
figure out is this

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.360
going to produce an acidic
solution, a neutral solution

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.130
or a basic solution.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.110
So we need to think about what
went in to making this salt.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.610
And we're going to break
apart the salt and we're going

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.340
to think about NH 4 plus and
we're going to think about Cl-.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.380
So let's think about
NH 4 plus first.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.230
And we're going to ask
the question is NH 4

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.680
plus a conjugate
acid of a weak base

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.970
and therefore, a
weak acid itself?

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.920
One way to answer
this question is

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.220
to look up the Ka for
NH 4 plus, which happens

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.670
to be 5.6 x 10 to the -10.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.890
You could also ask about the
weak base that it came from.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.790
The weak base in this
case, its conjugate base,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.380
is NH3 and ask if
that's a weak base.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.936
So if you have something
that is an acid here,

00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:13.560
you can think about
what the base would

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.480
be by removing H plus.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.029
If you remove H plus from
NH 4 plus you get NH3.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.970
And you can say, is NH3 a
weak base and look up a Kb.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.410
In this case, it's 1.8
x 10 to the minus 5.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.150
So what do you think?

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.330
Is this a weak base and this a
weak acid with those numbers?

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.550
What do you think?

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.080
Is that a weak acid?

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.550
Is that a strong acid?

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.410
So it's a weak acid.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.450
Is this a weak base?

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.950
Yeah.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.400
So we can look also in
this chart down here

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.030
and so NH3 is a moderately
weak base and NH 4 plus

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.440
is a very weak base, but
it is very weak acid,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.870
but it is a weak acid.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.980
So we do have a conjugate
acid of a weak base.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.330
So it is acidic, not super
acidic, but it is acidic.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.050
NH3 is a weak base
and so we probably

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.890
had NH3 as our base
that was being added

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.180
and it formed the
conjugate acid in this.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.340
So then this would produce
an acidic solution,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.900
because we have this
conjugate acid that's formed.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.000
So from this part, just
from the NH 4 plus,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.230
it should be acidic and
now we can consider Cl-.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.070
So here we're asking
the question is Cl-,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.570
a conjugate base of a
weak acid and therefore,

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.900
itself a weak base.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.110
And if you tried to
look up the Kb of Cl-,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.490
you would not find
it in any table.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.240
But you could find in a
table its conjugate acid.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.660
So if you add H to
Cl-, you get HCL,

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.570
and so you could look up a Ka
for that in the table and its

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.510
times 10 to the 7.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.660
So is this a weak acid?

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.350
AUDIENCE: No.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.450
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
It's a strong acid.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.840
So it's not a weak acid,
it's a strong acid.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.660
So is Cl- going to be basic?

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.570
No.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.160
So it is not, it is not
going to be a basic solution.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.700
If we look over here, we
see HCl is a strong acid

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.270
and so its conjugate base
is ineffective in it's base.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.180
It just doesn't work
as a base at all.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.900
So with a number of
10 to the seventh,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.240
it really goes to completion.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.800
It's a strong acid
by our definition.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.740
And so Cl- is not going to
do anything to the solution.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.210
It's not going to be
useful as a weak base.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.610
So this solution is
going to be neutral,

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.740
or at least the part of
the solution due to Cl-

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.130
will be neutral.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.310
So here we have something that
is acidic and something that's

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.400
neutral.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.745
And so overall, the
solution is acidic.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.560
So you need to break
down the two parts.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.080
You had an acid and
a base being mixed.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:25.810
Here we had HCl mixed with
NH3 and formed this NH4 salt.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.160
And that's going to be acidic,
because HCL was a weak acid

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.120
and its conjugate
is ineffective.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.220
Whereas, NH3 was a weak base.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.860
So it has a
conjugate acid that's

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.990
a weak acid, a very weak
acid, but still a weak acid.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.810
All right.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.120
So that's how you think
about these salt problems.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.860
So they really break down
to weak acid and weak base

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.810
problems.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.650
So why don't you
give this one a try?

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.578
[AUDIENCE MUMBLING]

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.180
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right,
let's do 10 more seconds

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.680
[AUDIENCE MUMBLING]

00:08:17.222 --> 00:08:18.680
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
That is correct.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.690
All right, let's look
at why that's correct.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.170
So it will produce
a basic solution.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.210
So we're going to
break it down to NA .

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.110
That's one of the
things in there.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.250
And we ask is NA a conjugate
acid of a weak base?

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.250
Is it going to be
neutral, acidic or basic?

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.070
And what's it going to be?

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.380
It's going to be neutral.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.760
It is not a conjugate
acid of a weak base.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.170
It's group 1.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.930
It'll be neutral.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.590
So this is not
contributing to the pH.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.320
So let's look at the second
part and look at CH3COO-.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:08.970
So we have-- this can be
divided into Na+ and HC3OO-.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.080
And then we ask is this a
conjugate base of a weak acid?

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.370
Or we could ask
the other question

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.420
is this over here a weak acid?

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.700
And the Ka for that was given.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.165
So is that a weak
acid or a strong acid?

00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:28.710
Is it weak or strong?

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.890
Weak, yes.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:30.970
So the answer is yes.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:37.130
It's weak and so it's conjugate
base would also be a weak base.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.830
And so therefore,
this will be acidic.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.650
So sometimes you'll be given Ka,
sometimes you'll be given Kb's.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.220
If you're given
either one of them

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.750
you can answer the question.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.930
If you want, you can
convert your Ka to your Kb.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.890
What would you use
to convert Ka to Kb?

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.450
Kw, right.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.950
But just with one of these
pieces of information,

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.200
you should be able to
answer this question.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.380
So let's just look at
the general rule now.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.570
You have a compound XY.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.480
That can be broken
up into X and you'll

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.110
ask yourself is X a conjugate
acid of a weak base?

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.490
If yes, then the
solution will be acidic.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.270
If no, it will be neutral.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.790
For Y, you have Y-.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.750
Is Y- a conjugate
base of a weak acid?

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:32.260
If yes, then it's going to be
add some basic nature to this.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.240
If no, neutral.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.610
And then over all,
you say, if it's

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.300
acidic plus neutral,
that's acidic, basic plus

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.520
neutral, basic, neutral
plus neutral, neutral.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.840
And if I give you a
question of something

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.300
that is acidic and basic,
you can answer the question

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.940
without doing
math, because it'll

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.730
depend on the Ka of one thing
and the Kb of the other thing.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.760
And you'll have to see
which one's a stronger acid

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.420
and which one's a stronger base.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.290
And so you can't just
simply answer the question.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.950
Now you may note,
that I did mention

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.520
that problem set 7 is long.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.110
It takes a long time
to do these problems.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.930
And so on the exam, writing
a fair exam when the problems

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.570
take a long time to do is hard.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.190
But these are short
little things.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.690
I could ask you to predict the
pH of salt by just thinking

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.290
about things and looking
up some Kb's and some Ka's.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.870
So these are good short
questions on the exam.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.950
So I'm probably not
going to give you one

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.060
if it's supposed to be
a short question that

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.280
is an acid and a base mixed
together, because then you'd

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.430
have to do some math.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.930
So keep that in mind.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.070
All right, so salts,
salt and water problems,

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.770
are really just weak acid
in water or weak base

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.410
in water problems, which
you already know how to do.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.575
So we're going to move
on now to buffers.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.210
Buffers.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:00.960
So a buffer is a solution
that maintains approximately

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.000
a constant pH, there'll be a
little range of pH can change,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.440
but the buffer tries to
keep the pH constant.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.570
You use a buffer to
keep pH constant.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.810
Why is this important?

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.820
Well, buffers are very
important in biology.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.390
We all work at a constant pH.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.560
Living things need to
be at a constant pH,

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.800
but a lot of times
chemical processes

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.560
also need to be
at a constant pH.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.800
And here's just one example
of why buffers are important.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.850
We're looking for
alternative energy.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.160
We're trying to develop
alternative energy.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.770
There's this idea of
creating fuel cells that

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.070
employ microbes.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.350
These little red circles
are microbes here.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.350
There are microbes
like shewanella

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.390
that will live,
adhere, to electrodes.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.460
Will live on surfaces of
electrodes, metal electrodes.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.640
And they will eat things
like sugar and organics.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.640
And they will
respirate electrons

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.640
into the metal electrodes.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.530
So the electrons go in and
you create an electric current

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.120
and you can do--
have a fuel cell.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.870
So it's a way of generating
an electric current.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.980
And then people have other ideas
that some like some microbes

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.690
live in electrodes, other
microbes like moorella

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.480
thermoaceticum, they
live on carbon dioxide.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.530
They convert carbon dioxide to
things like acetyl CoA, which

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:28.490
is a fuel.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.910
So you throw those in there
and then you like pump in CO2

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.890
and you make electric current.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.980
So there's a lot of great
ideas of using microbes.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.560
So some of my research
relates to understanding

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.252
the fundamentals
of these pathways.

00:13:41.252 --> 00:13:42.710
And every once in
a while I venture

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.920
to hear one of these
big energy talks

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.580
about how is the development
coming of these ideas.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.480
And so I heard one talk and I
was listening I wanted to know

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.727
is this really working?

00:13:54.727 --> 00:13:56.060
Are people getting this to work?

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.300
What's the status?

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.760
And they talked about a lot
of technical difficulties

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.870
of getting it to
work, but they had

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.520
discovered something amazing.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.970
Something that might really
change the ability to do this.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.340
And it turned out
that when you're

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.280
generating all this
negative charge

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.490
you need to have positive
charge around, like H plus,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.670
for example.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.150
And so you need to
have protons, but it

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.020
mattered, the concentration
of those protons.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.060
And they kind of had
to be kept constant

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.230
and they discovered buffers.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.510
Fifty minutes of my life.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.330
This was a talk at MIT.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:40.320
The person discovered buffers.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.200
I just felt like writing a
letter to Washington saying,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.690
can I have their research
dollars because I already

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.440
know about buffers.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.280
I don't need to
do a big research

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.760
project to discover that buffers
keep things at constant pH.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.130
And that when you're
using living organisms

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:00.000
and doing experiments and
doing reactions, pH matters.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.150
I already knew that.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.480
Everyone who takes 5.111
already knows that.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.070
And so this is part of the
reason I'm teaching you this.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.884
Because some of you will not
go on and study chemistry.

00:15:10.884 --> 00:15:12.050
You'll be doing engineering.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.300
You'll be doing
alternative energy.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.674
Doing all sorts
of things and you

00:15:14.674 --> 00:15:17.380
can be the person in the room
that raises your hand to go,

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.480
it's called a buffer.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:24.310
And that is going to change
the speed of that research.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.920
They're just like
right away they're

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.540
going to be using buffers.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.350
And when you do
Problem Set 7, you're

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:30.860
going to know how
to make a buffer.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.980
So you cannot only
raise your hand and say,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.270
it's called the buffer, you
can tell people how to make

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.160
a buffer to use in
their experiments.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.500
So this is why the material in
teaching was really important.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.410
I go out there and
I hear these talks

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.120
of people who are trying to
do these innovative things,

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.260
but they're lacking the
fundamental chemistry

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.780
knowledge that's hindering
their ability to do it.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.040
So I want all of you
to have this knowledge

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.640
whether you study
chemistry anymore

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.270
or not, so that you
can be the person who

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.770
brings the case of
chemical principles

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.710
into the design process.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.842
And I care a lot about
alternative energy.

00:16:04.842 --> 00:16:06.800
It's going to be super
important in the future.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.580
I care that we don't
destroy our planet going

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.350
after some forms of energy.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.390
And this idea of using
microbes is a great one,

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.230
but we just need
people who know how

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.140
to work with them to
get it to go right.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.380
All right, so buffers.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.850
What are buffers?

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:26.620
You've got to know
about buffers.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.940
A buffer consists,
an acid buffer,

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.030
consists of a weak acid
in its conjugate base.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.420
They're often
supplied as a salt,

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.450
which means you have a counter
ion that comes with it,

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:40.620
like sodium plus or Cl-.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.400
And it buffers on the
acidic side of neutral.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.050
A base buffer or a basic
buffer has a weak base

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.880
in its conjugate acid,
often supplied as a salt,

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.340
and it buffers on the
basic side of neutral.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:01.030
So the key to a buffer is
that it has a conjugate acid.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.770
It has NHA.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.410
But it also has
the conjugate base.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.400
It has A-.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.770
If it just has HA,
it's a weak acid.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.530
That's not a buffer,
that's a weak acid.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:18.930
If you just have A-,
you just have your base.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.410
That's not a buffer.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:27.869
You need to be both an acid
and a base, a base and an acid,

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.990
an acid and a base.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.380
On the exam people
do buffer problems

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.730
and they just have one,
they don't have the other.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.290
That's not a buffer.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.120
And I'm going to write
on your little exam,

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.410
remember me twirling
around the room.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.300
It was an acid and a base.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.930
I don't think you
can ever forget this.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.050
This will be in
your brain forever.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.660
Buffer has an acid
and a conjugate base,

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.480
a conjugate base and
a conjugate acid.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.985
OK, let's look at some examples.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:04.230
So if you mix acetic
acid and acetate salt,

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.470
it's conjugate base supplied
in the form of a salt.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.690
So here we have the acetic acid.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.980
Here we have the acetate,
the conjugate base

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.230
often will be supplied.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.550
There are probably going
to be some NA around.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.660
And you get this
dynamic equilibrium.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.350
It goes forward, it goes back,
it goes forward, it goes back.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.340
So when you have
this, if you added

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:34.420
a strong acid to this solution,
you put in more acid into this.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.620
And you had equal
amounts of this and this,

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.390
then you're conjugate
base is going

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.680
to react with the strong acid.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.680
And you're going to go
in the back direction.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.640
And you're going to neutralize
that acid that was added

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.930
and the pH should stay
more or less the same

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.840
if you did a good job
making your buffer.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:04.000
So the buffer can respond
to the changes in pH

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.450
by shifts in
different directions

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.930
to use up the extra added
acid or the other way,

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.740
the extra added base.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.870
So in this case, the acid that's
added is effectively removed

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.570
and the pH stays the same.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:26.830
So a buffer can
respond to add acid.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.160
A buffer can also
respond to added base.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.200
If you add a base, a
strong base or any kind

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.250
of base, and in this
case hydroxide ion,

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.640
would then remove a
proton from the weak acid

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.300
from the acetic acid
forming water and some more

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.890
of the conjugate base.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.510
And it's effectively
removed as well

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.360
and those OH ions are
effectively removed.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.930
And again, if you did a good
job designing this buffer,

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.490
the pH should stay constant.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.830
So that's why you need
the conjugate acid

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.370
and the conjugate base.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.980
You need the acid to react
with the base that's added

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.560
and keep the pH constant.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.660
You need the base to react
with the acid that's added

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.490
and keep the pH constant.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:18.000
If you just have one, it's
not going to be a buffer.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.020
So buffer action.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:24.350
Again, weak acid transfers,
its protons, it's H plus, to OH

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.440
supplied by the base.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.910
So here we have
added base and it's

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:36.510
going to be reacted with
the acid to be neutralized.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.621
The conjugate base, A-, can
accept protons from a supplied

00:20:40.621 --> 00:20:41.120
acid.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.730
If you add an acid,
it will take those

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.390
and will neutralize
the acid that's added.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.880
So let's think about what type
of acids and conjugate bases

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.470
are going to work to
make a good buffer.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.060
A strong acid in
its conjugate base

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.060
does not make a good buffer.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.270
Why don't you tell me why.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.000
Yeah, so 67%.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.970
So it's really about the
fact that the conjugate base

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.640
of a strong acid is
really not a base at all.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.510
It's ineffective as a base.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.060
And that's why it's
not going to work.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.360
Buffer solution has to be
in a dynamic equilibrium.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.950
You have to be able to push
it both ways, otherwise,

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.340
it's not going to work.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:57.580
So a conjugate base of a strong
acid is ineffective as a base.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.710
And so if you added acid,
it won't be neutralized

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.250
and the pH will change.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:06.370
So you need to have something
that works as a conjugate base.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.650
Something that's
able to interact

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.010
with the hydro ion or the
acid that's added and take

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.100
its proton to neutralize it.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.130
If this doesn't happen,
the pH will be affected.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.880
So you need to have weak acids
and weak bases in your buffers.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.410
They could be moderately weak
or very weak or whatever,

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.520
but you have to have
a conjugate set that's

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.100
going to be able to push both
directions where the acid can

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.000
interact with the added base
and the base can interact

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.810
with the added acid.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.780
All right, so all
of this is really

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.490
the same for a basic buffer.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.420
So we can look at an
example here of ammonia

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.720
plus water going to ammonium
ion and hydroxide ion.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.180
And we can think
about the same things.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:57.050
When you add a strong acid, the
base will accept the protons

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:01.640
and make more of
your conjugate acid.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.660
When a strong base is
added, the conjugate acid

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.390
will donate its proton.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:11.050
And it will form NH3 again,
that conjugate base, and water

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.740
and the pH will stay the same.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.900
So it's the same idea,
the only real difference

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.460
between an acidic buffer
and a basic buffer

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.120
is whether it pH's in the acidic
range or in the basic range.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.580
But the buffers
work the same way.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.470
So I can redraw this picture
to have our different symbols

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.950
on it, but the idea is the same.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.910
The weak base will take
the proton supplied

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.640
by the acid and
the conjugate acid

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:50.410
BH is going to probate the OHH-
and again keep the pH constant.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.530
So the idea again
of the buffer then

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:57.590
is that a buffer is a mixture of
weak conjugate acids and bases.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.780
Again, they're weak
because its partner

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.335
needs to be effective
as an asset or a base.

00:24:02.335 --> 00:24:04.350
It can't be ineffective.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.380
Weak acid base mixtures
that stabilize pH

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:12.170
by providing a source
or a sink for protons.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.260
It either adds protons
or takes protons away.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.370
It can respond to add acid.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.580
It can respond to add base.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:26.730
So again, pH is important
and buffering is important.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:30.150
Our body has its own
buffering system.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.170
So we have carbonic acid
and bicarbonate buffering

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:35.990
agents in our blood.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.300
And our blood has to be kept
in a sort of neutral range

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.340
over here.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.710
If it gets too acidic, that
is very unhealthy for us,

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.250
leading to some
pretty severe symptoms

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.450
and too much leads to death.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.980
If it's too basic,
that's really bad.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.170
Also, we have death and
notice these are not

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.210
all that far away.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.750
There are a number of
different medical conditions

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.640
that can affect
the pH, diabetes,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.540
there are metabolic diseases.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:08.890
Something else that is under
your control, hydration,

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.600
you need to drink enough water.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.580
And as the weather
gets colder in Boston,

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.195
people so often stop
drinking as much water

00:25:18.195 --> 00:25:20.210
or start drinking
like hot beverages,

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.930
which don't hydrate as well.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.440
So keep hydrated.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.000
If you're not hydrated,
if it's gets really bad,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.090
it can start affecting the pH of
your blood, which is really not

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:30.880
good.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.660
So buffering, very important.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.930
All right, so let's do
a sample buffer problem.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.500
So sample buffer problem--
and this is important.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.960
I actually know of at
least one professor

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.900
that if you want to
do a UROP with them

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.510
or come to their
office and they're

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:52.870
going to say, write down how
you would design a buffer for me

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.190
and do those calculations.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.220
So I can tell you later who
that is, maybe I won't, I

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.150
don't know.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.280
But this is one of
the tasks that someone

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.550
uses to see if they
want you as a UROP.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:09.480
OK, so here we have
one mol of formic acid

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.430
and 0.5 mols of the
conjugate base supplied

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.570
in the form of a salt
with sodium ions.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.820
And those are added
to water and diluted

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.760
to a total final
concentration of one liter.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.920
And you're given the Ka and
told to calculate the pH.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.660
So the first step is to
write out the equation.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.370
So we have an acid
and water going

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:41.540
to hydronium ions and a
conjugate base over here.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.580
And we want to think
about what's there now

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.290
and what's at equilibrium.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:52.880
So initial molarity, change in
molarity and your equilibrium

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.070
molarity.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.770
So it's important
this word molarity.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:02.030
Don't put mols in here,
put molarity in here.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.880
But I made it
really easy for you,

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.360
because we have one mol and
one liter so the molarity is 1.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:12.260
0.5 mols and one liter,
the molarity is 0.5.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.120
And this is also
really important.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.080
You're so used to only
putting things here.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.990
When it's a buffer
problem, you've

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.310
got to put something here, too.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:25.730
So you're adding the acid
with the conjugate base

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.210
at the same time.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.750
This is not zero.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.940
This is 0.5.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.800
So now as this dynamic
equilibrium goes

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.410
you're losing some of this
and gaining some of these.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:44.020
So at equilibrium we
have one molar minus x.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.680
X is our hydronium
ion concentration,

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.740
which is what we want
to know to calculate pH.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:57.250
And our conjugate base our
formic ion is 0.5 plus x.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.990
We're given a Ka and we've
written this expression as acid

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.410
in water so we can use Ka.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.800
The equilibrium constant is
for the expression as written

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:16.310
so we can put that in and
we can fill the rest out.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:17.420
We have our products.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.120
We have the concentration
of hydronium ion

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.410
times the concentration of
formic ion, the conjugate base,

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.910
over the concentration
of our formic acid,

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.430
and again water does not
appear in the expression

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.420
because it's the solvent.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.740
Hydronium ion
concentration is x.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.840
The conjugate base
concentration is

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.640
0.5 plus x and the
conjugate acid concentration

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.480
is 1 minus x.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:51.820
So we can now try that
assumption that x is small

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.850
or we can use the
quadratic equation,

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:58.032
but why don't you just
try that assumption.

00:28:58.032 --> 00:28:59.490
I'm going to take
this expression--

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.820
if you haven't written it all
down yet, put it right up here.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.450
And now with the
clicker why don't you

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.030
tell me, if we use
the approximation

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.400
that x is small compared
to 1 and 0.5, what

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.980
does this simplify to?

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:27.420
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:46.720
So 70 something percent.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:51.020
Yep, so let's take
a look at that.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.660
So here we're making
the assumption

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.560
that x is small compared
to 0.5, compared to 1.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.370
So that means that we drop
the plus x from the 0.5 term

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.620
and drop the minus
x from the one term.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.230
So we're saying
that these are going

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.190
to be small enough
that it's still going

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.670
to be pretty much 0.5 and 1.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.640
And then we have to
test that in a minute.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.800
So if we use this,
we can calculate x

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.280
and it comes out to 3.54
times 10 to the minus 4,

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.660
and then we can
check the assumption.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.300
And before you told me
how to check assumptions.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.140
And that was I take
x and I'll divide it

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:37.150
by 0.5, which is the smaller
of these two, and times by 100%

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.790
and we get 0.69%,
which is less than 5%

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.590
so the assumption is OK.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.020
And we don't have to
check it against 1,

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.060
because if the assumption x is
small compared to the smaller

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.380
number is valid, it will also
be valid for the bigger number.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.280
So you only check it
for the smaller number

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.750
and then we can solve.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.260
So we have to think
about-- we solved for x.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.160
We're happy with x.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.470
Our assumption was OK.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:05.845
But then we have
to remember what

00:31:05.845 --> 00:31:11.030
x is and x is the
hydronium ion concentration

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.640
and you always want to make
sure to think about this,

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.980
because if it's hydroxide
ion that's different.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.620
So we can calculate pH.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:24.110
pH is minus log of 3.54
times 10 to the minus 4,

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:29.120
which is equal to pH of 3.45.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.710
And here we have two
significant figures

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.010
after the decimal point,
because the volume

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.320
we had before only had
two significant figures.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.420
Everything else had three,
but the volume was just 1.0.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.340
So that is our answer there.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:48.380
All right, so I'm going
to just briefly start

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.120
what happens when you--
actually we'll do-- this

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.450
is how you would design
the buffer for this.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.850
Next time we'll see what
happens if we stress

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:00.760
the buffer we design
by adding acid to it

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.390
and see what the new result is.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.450
All right, so today we're
going to finish lecture 22.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:10.691
So take out those lecture
notes on acids and bases.

00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:12.190
And when we're done
with that, we'll

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.240
just continue with
acids and bases.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.360
And we're going to
continue with some acids

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.190
and bases on Wednesday.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:20.610
We should finish on
Wednesday and move on

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:26.710
to oxidation reduction and that
will end exam three material.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:30.080
So exam three is
sneaking up on us

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.780
and it'll have thermodynamics,
chemical equilibrium,

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.518
solubility, and acid base.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.230
So you should have
already filled

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:42.950
in your handout with
all the information.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:47.590
The parts that you were
filling in are in bold here,

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:51.080
but I just want to remind you
of what we were talking about.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.580
So we had a sample
buffer problem.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.720
We had one mol of the
conjugate acid and a half

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.220
a mol of its conjugate base
supplied in the form of a salt,

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.240
were put in water and
diluted into one liter.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.510
So we calculated what the
hydronium ion concentration

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:14.230
would be and therefore,
the pH, using information

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:17.230
that was given to
us about the Ka,

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.140
the acid ionization constant.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:24.470
So we got a pH of 3.45.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.820
Someone asked me after class,
but isn't this conjugate base

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:33.080
also reacting with water and
forming some of this weak acid.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.550
And the answer is yes.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.620
That we are writing this
as a problem of acid

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.310
in water, because
we can use the Ka.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.854
But we could've also
written it the other way.

00:33:44.854 --> 00:33:46.770
And written it, and this
is not in your notes,

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:50.530
but I just want to let you know,
that the weak base and water

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.910
could be written that way
forming a conjugate acid

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.180
and hydroxide ions.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:01.340
And so then it would be 0.5
minus x and 1 plus x and x.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:05.240
Use Kb then, because it's a
base in water to solve for x

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:10.840
and calculate pH from POH and
if you try it, you get 3.45.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.690
So you can do these
problems either way.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.909
You can think about
them as a weak base

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:17.889
problem or a weak acid problem.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.370
You just have to remember
that this is not zero

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:22.580
when you start.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.960
The conjugate has some amount.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.650
That's what makes
it a good buffer.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.360
So this can work either
way, but you also

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.239
want to remember if you write
it as an acid in water, use Ka.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:34.650
If you write it as a
base in water, use Kb.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.330
Because those
equilibrium constants

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:40.100
are telling you about those
ratios of the conjugate acid

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.400
and the conjugate
base at equilibrium.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.239
So within the Ka and
the Kb is information

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:50.389
that you need about this
dynamic chemical equilibrium.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:54.520
So both of these ways work and
by the end of, sort of halfway

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.240
through today's lecture,
you'll see yet another way

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.130
to solve buffer problems.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.960
And probably will be for most
of you, the preferred way

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.060
to do it.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.880
So there's a number
of different ways

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.500
which makes grading
the exam lots of fun.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.470
And we have option 1,
option 2, option 3--

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:14.400
to make sure that all
the options are possibly

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.100
accounted for.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.780
All right, so the
purpose of a buffer

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.500
is to keep the pH
pretty much constant.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.140
So you can add a
strong acid to it

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.640
and the acid will
be neutralized,

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.840
keeping the pH constant.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.720
You can add a strong
base to it and the base

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.500
will be neutralized, keeping
the pH pretty constant.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.590
So what you want in a buffer is
to have a weak acid conjugate

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.570
base pairing that
allows it to be a source

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.790
or sink for a strong
acid or a strong base

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.710
to keep the pH constant.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.370
So now in this
problem we're asked

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.940
to calculate what
would happen to the pH

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.360
if 0.1 mols of the strong
acid had been included

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.380
in our 1 liter solution.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.350
And because 0.1 mols
of our strong acid

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.480
would react with
equal number of mols,

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.140
all of that conjugate
base, that's

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.310
what the conjugate
base does in a buffer,

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:11.970
it reacts with the strong
acid that is supplied.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:17.150
And it will form equal
mols then of the conjugate,

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.050
its conjugate acid.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.070
So we have to do
some subtraction.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.930
So for the conjugate
acid, we had 0.5 mols.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.080
For the conjugate
base, we had 0.5 mols.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.430
We used up one of
that, 0.1 of that,

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:40.800
reacting with the strong
acid and we have 0.4 left.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:46.150
So we have a new concentration
for our conjugate base, 0.4

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:51.300
divided by 1, keep the
math simple, 0.4 molar.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.320
So for our conjugate acid,
we had one mol to begin with,

00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.260
but we formed 0.1 more when
that strong acid was added.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:06.400
So now we have 1.1 mols
and a new molarity.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.680
So now we have to go back and
we can use this expression again

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.290
and determine what x is
now, what the hydronium

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:18.490
concentration is now using Ka.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:22.290
So why don't you tell me
how I would solve this.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:25.610
What is the correct
expression for Ka?

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.800
You can fill in your
little table as you do it.

00:37:39.518 --> 00:37:41.226
All right, let's just
do 10 more seconds.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:38:00.240
All right, so let's
just fill in that table

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.970
if you haven't already.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:06.690
So here now, we can write this
as an acid and water problem.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:09.090
Again, again, you could
have done the base in water

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:13.010
and used Kb, but we'll just do
it the same way we did before.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.630
So we have our acid 1.1 molar.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.437
Now remember, this is molarity.

00:38:18.437 --> 00:38:20.020
So you don't want
to put mols in here,

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.770
you want to put a
concentration and some of that

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.220
will be minus x.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.680
Then we have our
0.4, 0.4 plus x.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.370
We can fill out the Ka.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.220
The Ka again, weak
acid and water problem.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:37.910
We have products-- hydronium ion
times our conjugate base over

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:44.620
our conjugate acid equals
0.400 plus x times x, these 2,

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:49.490
and 1.1 minus x on the bottom.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:53.020
So you can always solve then
for x, which will tell you

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.040
about the pH by using the Ka.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.670
And you just have to remember
molarity and remember

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:04.060
these are the new molarity
after the reaction has occurred.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.660
All right, so we can
use the approximation

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:13.430
that x is small compared to
1.1 and 0.4 to simplify this.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.310
Or we could use the
quadratic equation.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:21.060
If we simplify it, we
calculate x as 4.87 times 10

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.440
to the minus 4.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.060
And remember again,
that the approximation

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:30.510
is you get rid of the plus
x and the minus x here.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.909
And then, you have to
check it with the 5% rule.

00:39:32.909 --> 00:39:34.700
If you did that, if
you used the quadratic,

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.030
then you don't have to check.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.230
But if you use the
5% rule, then you're

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:43.690
asking is this number 4.87
times 10 to the minus 4

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:48.210
within 5% of the smaller value,
which is 0.4 and it is here.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.980
It's 0.12%.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.430
So the assumption is OK.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:52.920
That's less than 5%.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.790
X is small.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:58.540
And then we can
solve for the pH.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.420
So pH is minus log of the
hydronium ion concentration,

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.720
which here is 3.31.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.710
This only has two significant
figures after the decimal,

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.780
because if you remember,
back on the other page,

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.360
the volume only had two.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.870
So actually all these
numbers here really just

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.970
have two significant figures.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:20.300
We carried an extra, but
it really just had two.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.050
All right, so our
buffer was pretty good

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:27.390
so we added 0.1 mols
of a very strong acid.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:29.260
And we only changed the pH.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:34.680
We only lowered it
from 3.45 to 3.31.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:40.970
So that was a pretty good buffer
that we had designed there.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:44.831
All right, so that is how
you do a buffer problem.

00:40:44.831 --> 00:40:46.830
And there are other kinds
of things that you can

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.170
be asked about with buffers.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.490
In particular,
you can also often

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.780
be asked to design a buffer.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.620
And when you design
a buffer, you

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.070
must consider the
following things.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:03.280
The ratio of your
conjugate acid base pair

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.940
and that they
should also be weak

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:10.590
conjugate acid base
pairs-- the pKa and the pH.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:13.400
OK, so here comes a derivation.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:19.090
So here is our expression
that should be familiar to you

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.690
at this point, for a
weak acid, HA and water,

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:27.540
going to hydronium ions
and our conjugate base, A-.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.070
It should also be
familiar to you

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:32.710
that you can write
the equilibrium

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.190
expression for
this acid in water

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:38.830
as hydronium ions concentration
times the concentration,

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.150
the conjugate base,
over the concentration

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.440
of the conjugate acid.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.090
Water, which is our
solvent, doesn't

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:46.380
appear in the expression.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:50.320
We can rearrange this expression
now and solve for hydronium ion

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.170
concentrations.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:56.320
We can take a log of
both sides, and get this,

00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.140
log of hydronium ion
concentration, log of Ka,

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:07.900
plus log of HA over A-, multiply
by negative to get this.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.530
And so we have
minus, minus, minus,

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.020
and minus the log of the
hydronium ion concentration

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.450
is what?

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:22.300
pH minus log of Ka is pKa
and this is the same as that.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:29.010
So that gives us this expression
that pH equals pKa minus

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:32.300
the log of HA over A-.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.390
Now it's important to point
out that these are equilibrium

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:39.870
concentrations of HA and
A-, because we derived this

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:44.630
expression from Ka and that's
an equilibrium constant.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:47.140
So these are
equilibrium expressions.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.430
And that makes this particular
expression slightly less

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.040
useful, because we
often don't want

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.400
to have to calculate the
equilibrium concentration.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.200
We know how much we added
and so we often want

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.520
to use initial concentrations.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:04.370
But we can consider whether
the initial concentrations

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.530
are actually pretty similar to
the equilibrium concentrations

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:08.170
i.e.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.920
the x is small, less than 5%.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.830
So we know that a
weak acid typically

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:17.010
only loses a fraction
of its protons,

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.030
hence the definition
of weak acid.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.880
Weak acid in water
doesn't ionize that much.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.380
And a weak base typically
only accepts a fraction

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.070
of the protons that it could.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.930
It's a weak base.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.700
So the initial
concentration is often

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.354
approximately equal to the
equilibrium concentration

00:43:36.354 --> 00:43:37.770
and that's what
we've been finding

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:38.811
in a lot of the problems.

00:43:38.811 --> 00:43:41.760
We've found that the 5%
rule works pretty well.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.710
It's usually less than 5%.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:48.670
X is usually less than 5% of
the initial concentration we had

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:51.180
of HA or A-.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:55.530
And so therefore, we can
say that the pH is in fact,

00:43:55.530 --> 00:44:00.760
approximately equal to the pKa
minus the log of the initial

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.950
concentration of your HA over
your initial concentration

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:06.330
of A-.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:10.080
And this expression is known
as the Henderson-Hasselbalch

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.420
Equation.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:18.420
And so this equation is only
valid when your hydronium ion

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:23.700
concentration is small
compared to HA and A-, i.e.,

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.740
less than 5%.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:30.250
So this 5% rule must apply to
use the Henderson-Hasselbalch

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.450
Equation.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.590
The Henderson-Hasselbalch
Equation

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:37.240
is a great equation to
use for buffer problems.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.140
And so, we've
showed you a couple

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.170
different ways of
doing buffer problems.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.170
This is the final way I'm
going to show you using

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:46.050
the Henderson-Hasselbalch
Equation,

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.620
but you can only use
it if x is small.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.860
But most of the time,
x is going to be small,

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.970
because buffers are
only buffers when

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:57.600
you have a weak acid with
a conjugate weak base.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.090
And when you're talking
about weak acids and bases,

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.310
x is small.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.690
They don't ionize that much.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:07.440
And importantly, and
I'll emphasize this,

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.410
this equation only
works for buffers.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:15.970
Don't apply it for just regular
weak acid in water or weak base

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:19.770
in water, a strong acid in
water, a strong base in water--

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:22.805
it only applies for buffers.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.420
Buffers, buffers.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.700
Now I know that MIT
students love equations

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.990
and they love doing
math, and so they

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:36.910
try to apply this
equation to every type

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.080
of acid-base problem.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.830
Don't do it.

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:42.715
Buffers, buffers.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:49.270
You'll remember that now, right?

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:51.870
Because I'll make noises
again if you don't.

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:53.215
You remember that now, right?

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.890
All right, so let's use
the Henderson-Hasselbalch

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.760
to design a buffer then.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:06.450
So say we want to design
a buffer of pH 4.6.

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:10.560
Say you're interviewing for
a UROP position and the UROP

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.030
supervisor, the PI
says, tell me how you

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:17.630
would design a buffer pH 4.6.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.790
And you might go to the shelf
and see what was available

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:25.150
and then look up what
the Ka and the pKa are,

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:28.350
because a buffer solution is
most effective in the range

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.860
of the pKa plus or minus 1.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:35.500
In fact, the closer the
pH you want is to the pKa,

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.460
the better the buffer
is going to be.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.760
So we can look and see
what's in the range.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.340
There are several that are close
to 4.6 that we can choose from.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.370
And probably would
end up choosing

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.110
acetic acid, because that
would be on the shelf,

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.980
whereas, some of the others
of these would not be there.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.830
All right, so acetate
is going to work.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:56.480
It's a pretty common buffer.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:04.220
So we can use acetic acid
with a suitable pKa of 4.75.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:07.370
Then we can use the
Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.170
because we're
designing a buffer.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:12.110
So we can use that
equation and figure out

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:18.110
what the ratio of acetic acid
to its conjugate base should be.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:20.980
So we can rearrange
this expression.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:26.360
We know the pKa and we
know the pH that we want,

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.390
and so we can subtract those.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:35.630
And we get that the log of
the ratio should be 0.15.

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:38.280
And then inverse
log will tell us

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.100
that the ratio then of the
acid to the conjugate base

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.560
should be 1.4.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.820
So you should use
things with that ratio.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:53.330
So for example, you could
use 1.4 molar of the acid

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:56.300
to one molar of
the conjugate base

00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:03.070
and the total amounts are often
less important than the ratio.

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:07.980
The ratio is very important,
but if you go too low

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.640
in concentrations,
then that will

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.900
affect what's known as the
buffering capacity, which

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.040
is the ability of the
buffer to resist changes.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.640
So if it's too dilute,
and a lot of strong acid

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.810
or a lot of strong
base is added,

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:24.280
then it won't be a
good buffer anymore.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.600
So the ratio is very important.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.750
The amounts are important such
that you have some resistance

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:32.350
to change.

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:36.520
So the higher concentrations,
the more resistant to change.

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:45.460
And also, if you use
too low a concentration,

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:49.680
the Henderson-Hasselbalch
Equation is no longer valid.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.280
So you could be
asked to calculate

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.490
sort of what the
minimum concentration is

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.570
that you would need to use.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:49:02.580
And so for a pH 4.60, you
can back calculate what

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.910
the hydronium ion
concentration is.

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:08.370
And it's 2.5 times
10 to the minus 5.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:12.740
So for our 5% assumption
to hold or to be valid,

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:16.740
that this number, the
hydronium ion concentration,

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.390
is less than 5% of
either one of these.

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.700
The concentrations
here would have

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:26.510
to be greater than 5
times 10 to the minus 4.

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:28.360
So if we use one
molar or something,

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.980
that's way above this, but
that would be the minimum.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:34.250
If it's less than that,
that 5% doesn't really hold

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:37.240
and you would not have a very
good buffer in that case.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.570
It wouldn't be very
resistant to change.

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:42.490
X would be big compared
to those numbers.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:44.916
So that's how you go
about designing a buffer.

00:49:44.916 --> 00:49:46.540
And in that, there
were two things that

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.190
are really common mistakes.

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:50.630
When I'm reviewing a
paper for publication,

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:53.340
two of the things that
I see the most often

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.720
is that people one, do
not use the right buffer

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.730
for their experiment.

00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.410
They say, oh, I'm at pH 8.

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:02.160
And they'll use a
buffer that is in fact,

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.150
not a good buffer at pH 8.

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:07.120
So who knows what their
data is telling us.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.610
And the other thing
that people will do

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.810
is that they'll say, oh
yes, it was buffered.

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:15.140
And the pKa might be right, but
the concentration of the buffer

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.190
is so low that you
don't really imagine

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:19.680
the buffer's doing anything.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:24.050
So now you know how to avoid
both of those pitfalls.
