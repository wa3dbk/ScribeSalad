00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.935
PROFESSOR: OK, let's just
take 10 more seconds.

00:01:15.493 --> 00:01:15.993
OK.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.698
Does someone want to
explain the answer here?

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.010
I'm not sure if this is on.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.310
Give it a try.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.920
AUDIENCE: So it
says in the problem

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.000
that the X-rays have
the same wavelength,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.220
so you know that they also
have the same frequency,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.280
so that discounts
1, 2, and 5 and 6.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.100
So then it's just a
choice between 3 and 4.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.890
And in the video
the other day, you

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.300
said in order to
image these proteins,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.640
you need high intensity light.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.380
So, 3.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.590
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.750
That's a great explanation.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.850
Here, I don't really
know what these-- these

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.950
might come in handy today.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.491
I don't know.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.950
OK.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.050
Yeah, so the trick was
better quality data,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.210
so you probably figured
out that that, then,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.370
was the higher intensity.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.120
So this is a true thing.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.610
So we have data collection.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.620
There's equipment here
at home, and a lot

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.370
of universities have what
they call home data collection

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.900
equipment, but we often travel
to synchrotrons where we have

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.550
higher intensity, i.e.
more photons per second,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.180
and then you get
better quality data.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.100
And so sometimes people
do these things remotely

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.600
where you ship your samples
and someone else collects it,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.850
but my lab likes to go.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.300
And you stay up all night
and collect great data,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.280
and it's a bonding experience.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.920
You saw a little bit
of that on the video.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.690
OK.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.030
We ended last time looking
at the Schroedinger equation

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.600
and seeing that the
Schroedinger equation could

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.100
be solved for a hydrogen
atom, giving information

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.300
about binding
energy, the binding

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.650
of the electron to
its nucleus, and also

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.454
a wave function, which we
haven't talked about yet.

00:03:14.454 --> 00:03:15.870
So we're going to
continue talking

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.250
about this binding energy,
and then next week we're

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.980
going to move into wave
functions, or orbitals.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.270
So the binding
energy that comes out

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.270
of the Schroedinger
equation, no one

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.100
should ever just believe things.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.830
It looks fancy, but
does it really work?

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.880
Is it really doing
this right estimation?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.830
And again, it just came
out of Schroedinger's mind,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.310
so it's always nice to
verify that this equation is

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.850
working pretty well.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.160
So today we're going
to talk about how

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.100
we were able to verify
that the binding energy

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.820
that the Schroedinger equation
was predicting actually

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.170
agrees with experiment.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.640
So we're going to continue
talking about binding energies,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.680
then go on to the
verification, with a demo,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.010
of how people were
able to show that there

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.650
was good agreement here.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.150
All right.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.700
So let's continue
with binding energies.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.680
So we're still talking about
the hydrogen atom and energy

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.360
levels, and we saw the last time
that the Schroedinger equation

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.560
could be derived
for a hydrogen atom

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.810
such that the binding
energy, or e to the n,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.520
was equal to minus this Rydberg
constant, RH, over n squared

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.600
were n is the principle
quantum number.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.590
And so this is what
we saw last time,

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.880
and now we have a graphical
depiction of this.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.780
And you'll note that this is
a negative value over here.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.200
So if n is 1 and we have
the principle quantum

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.280
number of one, we have
minus RH over one squared.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.550
And so we just have
the negative value

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.690
for the Rydberg constant,
2.18 times 10 to the minus

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.760
18th joules.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.240
And as we go up
here in energy, we

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.440
would get to an energy of zero.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.240
And if energy here is zero,
what must be true about n?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.840
What kind of number is n here?

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.860
Infinity, right.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.700
So if this is infinity,
that number goes to zero.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.020
And so if the electron
is infinitely far away

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.550
from the nucleus, it's
basically a free electron.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.920
It doesn't feel any
kind of attraction.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.780
It's infinitely far away.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.130
Then your binding energy
would be zero, i.e.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.640
it's not bound,
and that would be

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.180
true with this infinitely
far away distance.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.750
And then in between the n
equals 1, 2n equals infinity,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.790
we can use this equation
for the hydrogen atom

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.280
to figure out what
these energy levels are.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.990
So when we have the
n equals 2 state,

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.670
it would be minus RH
over 2 squared, or 4,

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.720
and so we can calculate
what that number is here,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.160
minus 0.545 times 10 to
the minus 18th joules.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.710
N equals 3 so we have
RH over 3 squared.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.610
We can do the math over here.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.280
4-- you get the idea--
minus RH over 4 squared,

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.510
and we have then over 5
squared, over 6 squared,

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.230
and you can see the energy, and
you can calculate the energy

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.750
levels here.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.250
All right.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:44.800
So when you have an electron in
this n equals 1 state, that's

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.280
the lowest energy, it's
the most negative number,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.010
and that's known as
the ground state.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.200
And when you have an electron
in this ground state,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.100
that's the most stable
state for the hydrogen atom.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.070
So again, from these lower
ground state up to this state

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.810
here.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.300
Now we're going to
introduce another term which

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.370
you'll hear a lot, and
this is ionization energy.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.110
So the ionization energy,
the amount of energy

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.580
you need to put in to ionize
an atom or release an electron.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.630
So the ionization energy of a
hydrogen atom in the nth state

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.380
is going to be equal
to the binding energy,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.030
but the signs of these
are going to be different.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.480
So we have this equation where
binding energy equals minus IE,

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.140
the ionization energy.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.900
So we talked about the fact that
the binding energy is negative,

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.800
and the ionization energy
is always positive.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.630
So for the binding energy, when
the binding energy is zero,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.520
it means the
electron isn't bound.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.930
So a negative value
for binding energy

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.230
means that the
electron's being held

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.420
by the nucleus-- the
electron's bound.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.980
For ionization energy,
that's the energy

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.905
you need to add to the system
to release the electron,

00:08:05.905 --> 00:08:08.030
and you're always going to
need to add some energy,

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.000
so that's a positive number.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.060
So when you think about
ionization energy,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.770
it's a positive
number that you're

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.570
going to be expecting there.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.940
Now we can consider
this same diagram,

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.990
and we already talked
about these energy levels

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.850
and now we can think about these
in terms of ionization energies

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.070
as well.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.030
So the difference
from this state,

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.570
where energy is 0, to the
ground state down here,

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.880
the ionization energy--
the energy that's

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.070
needed to ionize an electron
that's in n equals 1 here,

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.290
is going to be equal
to minus the binding

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.310
energy of that electron in
that n equals one state.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.290
So again here, it's
not too hard if you

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.190
know this information
and this equation

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.530
to figure out what the
ionization energy is.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.960
So that's just, then, going
to be the positive value

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.540
of the binding energy.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.880
So binding energy
minus Rydberg's

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:11.310
constant here, 2.18 times
10 to the minus 18th joules.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.920
So the ionization energy,
then, for a hydrogen atom

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.070
in the ground state is positive
2.180 times 10 to the minus

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.760
18th.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.760
And I'm just going to try
to use the same number

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.320
of significant figures.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.930
I always try to pay attention
to my significant figures.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:28.430
All right.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:34.530
So we can do this again
for the n equals 2 state,

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.480
or the first excited state.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.040
So here's the n equals 2 state.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.290
So now we're going to be talking
about this differential energy

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.970
here.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.780
So the ionization
energy for an electron

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.120
in this first excited state.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.080
Again, that will be ionization
energy equals minus the binding

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.490
energy for that state,
and so that's going to be,

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.640
then, the positive value here.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:09.110
So the binding energy was minus,
if we change this to-- this

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:14.910
is 18.5 to the 18, or 5.0
to the minus 19th joules.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.190
Try to keep the significant
figures the same.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.690
All right.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.155
So why don't you
give this a try now

00:10:21.155 --> 00:10:23.170
and we'll have a
clicker question.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:14.940
OK.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.606
10 more seconds.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.440
A very long one second.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.814
OK.

00:11:40.814 --> 00:11:41.314
Interesting.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:51.990
So maybe you can talk to
your neighbor and someone can

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.590
tell me what the trick is here.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.440
OK.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.530
We have someone who is going
to tell us what the trick is.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.560
AUDIENCE: The ground
state is n equals one,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.830
and from there, the
excited states go up one.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.900
So the first excited
state is n equals 2,

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.220
and then the third one
will be n equals 4.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.760
And since you're looking
for the ionization energy,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.950
you go to the energy
for n equals 4,

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.810
and you multiply by negative
one, which is 40.14 10

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.120
to the negative 18th.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.430
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.520
Yeah, so let's see what I have.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.086
I need to get some more stuff.

00:12:51.086 --> 00:12:52.310
Sorry.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.900
OK.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.481
So the trick.

00:12:56.481 --> 00:12:57.480
It's not a hard problem.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.660
You just had to figure out what
the third excited state meant,

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.610
so once you've figured
that out, it was

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.350
pretty easy to get it right.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.120
OK.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.930
So keep that in mind.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.190
Now that you've potentially
made that mistake,

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.600
you will not make
that one again.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.460
All right.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.540
So now we can think about this
also in more general terms--

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.630
only slightly more
general terms,

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:28.660
frankly-- which is to consider,
for other one electron ions,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.180
we can have a more
general equation.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.840
So we had, for
the hydrogen atom,

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.640
the binding energy, En, is minus
Rydberg's constant, RH, over

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.560
n squared.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.260
And now I've added z squared,
which is the atomic number.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.670
And for hydrogen, it's
1, so it wasn't around.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.330
We didn't need it before.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:55.470
But we can consider other ions
that also have one electron.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.370
They will also work
with this equation.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.530
So there's a couple of things
that kind of fall out of this.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.140
One, that an electron is
going to be bound more weakly

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:12.150
when n is a big number here, and
so that makes sense from what

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.500
we were looking at before.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.130
And that an electron
is also going

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:21.254
to be bound more
tightly when z is big,

00:14:21.254 --> 00:14:23.670
and we haven't really talked
about that because we've just

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.970
been talking about
the hydrogen atom,

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.450
and so it always has the same z.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.280
But if you have a
different z, you're

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.100
going to have a bigger
positively charged nucleus,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.490
and so it makes sense that
you would then have a tighter

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.200
bonding electron.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:39.970
All right.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.560
So you might think, what
are other things that

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.020
have just one electron that
this is going to apply to?

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.450
And so far, of
course, we've just

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.730
been talking about
our friend, hydrogen,

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.720
that has its one
electron and z equals 1.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.400
But we have ions that can
also have one electron.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.510
So helium plus, and it has a z
of 2, but when it's helium plus

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.200
it only has one electron.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.470
Lithium, plus 2, also
only has one electron,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.730
and it has a z of three.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:17.570
And then what about something
that's a one electron

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.250
system with a plus 64.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.840
Without looking at your
periodic table, what does

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.520
the z have to be here?

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.590
Yeah.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.330
So, 65.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.450
So in working these
kinds of problems,

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:36.410
if you're talking about a
one electron ion or atom

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.280
and it's not hydrogen,
don't forget about z.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.546
And we need to have
that in our equation.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.490
All right.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:49.860
So talking about these
binding energies now,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.650
out of the
Schroedinger equation,

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.960
you can calculate
ionization energies

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.280
if you know the binding energy.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.990
All of this is
good, but how do we

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.660
know that we can trust
the Schroedinger equation,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.460
that equations
really are working?

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.790
So the way that they
figured this out

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.630
is from experiment, and
particularly, experimentally

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.830
figuring out what the energy
levels were, and thinking,

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.380
does this match with the
Schroedinger equation?

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:20.240
So they were able to use photon
emission to be able to do this.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.720
So let's consider what
photon emission is,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.570
and then we're going to prove
that this equation that I've

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.430
been showing you actually holds.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.570
So photon emission,
this is a situation

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.320
that occurs when
you have an electron

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:44.590
going from a higher energy
initial state going to a lower

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.660
energy state.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.070
And as it goes from
this high energy state

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:54.320
to the low energy state, there's
a difference between these two

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.870
energy states,
delta E, and that's

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.710
going to be equal
to the higher energy

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.940
initial state minus the
energy in the final state.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.670
So there's this difference in
energy between the two states,

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:12.750
and the photon that gets
emitted when this energy

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:17.310
transition happens has the
same energy as the difference

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.359
between those.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:23.140
So the energy of the emitted
photon is also delta E.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:28.079
So you emit all of that energy
as you have that change.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:33.310
So the difference here-- we
can consider an actual case

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.360
where we're going from
an energy difference of n

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.660
equals 6 to an energy
level of an equals 2,

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.880
and we can think about what
the energy difference is

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.060
between these two and we can
just write that equation out.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:55.940
So the initial energy, the
electron started at n equals 6,

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.090
the energy of the
n equals 6 state,

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.130
and it goes to the energy
of the n equals 2 state.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:08.040
So energy n equals 6
minus energy n equals 2.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.360
All right.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.690
So of course if you
know energy, you

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.300
can know a lot of other
things about the photon.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:20.120
So you can calculate frequency
of that emitted photon.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.410
So again, we have our
energy difference here

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.170
and we can then solve
for the frequency

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.040
of the emitted photon, which is
equal to the energy difference.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.070
That energy, divided
by Planck's constant,

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.150
and you could also write
it out, the initial energy

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.780
minus the final energy over h.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.900
All of these are
equivalent things.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.630
And when you know
frequency, we're

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.290
talking about light here, so you
can calculate the wavelength.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.850
So let's think now about
what we might expect

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.520
in terms of frequencies
and wavelengths,

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.470
depending on the energy
difference between the two

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.790
different states.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.490
So here, if we think
first about this electron

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.700
with the purple line, we have
a large energy difference

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.300
here between this
state and this state

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.530
down here, between n
equals 5 to n equals 1.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.500
So when we have a large
difference in energy,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.080
what do we expect
about the frequency

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.910
of the emitted photon?

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:32.010
Is it going to be a high
frequency or low frequency?

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.010
High.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:33.910
Yep.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.840
So large energy, high frequency.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.150
And so then what would be
true about the wavelength

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.780
of that emitted photon?

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.920
Short.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.020
Right.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.800
Now if we had a small
difference, say n equals 3 to n

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.400
equals 1, which is a smaller
difference in energy, what's

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.421
true about the frequency here?

00:19:56.421 --> 00:19:56.920
Right.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.120
Low frequency.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.150
And wavelength?

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.050
Right, long wavelength.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:04.850
Right.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:10.310
So now we're actually going to
see some photons being emitted,

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:16.140
and let me just build in to
this experiment a little bit.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:22.270
So we have an evacuated glass
tube filled with hydrogen.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.160
And if you have negative
and positive electrodes,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.670
you can emit light from
this and then analyze

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.930
the different wavelengths.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:37.560
So we are not going to be
the first people to see this,

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.400
but we're going
to try this and we

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.190
should observe these different
wavelengths coming off.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.840
And after we observe
them, we will

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.650
try to calculate
what they're due to,

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:54.910
and then if the experimental
results of the wavelength

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.860
and frequency observed can be
explained by the Schroedinger

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.520
equation.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.100
But first, let's actually
see the visible spectra

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.310
that is created by hydrogen.
And so we have our demo TAs,

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.390
and actually if all our
TAs can help pass out

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.840
some little glasses to
help everyone see this.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.530
And when we're ready, we're
going to do lights down.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.350
But let's get everything
handed out first.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.930
All right.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:25.745
I got the lights.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.230
TA: So this is a hydrogen
lamp, and when you turn it on,

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.310
the electricity excites
all the hydrogen inside

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.730
and then you see this glow from
the electromagnetic radiation

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.420
being emitted by these excited
hydrogens relaxing down

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.496
to the ground state.

00:21:53.432 --> 00:21:54.920
PROFESSOR: Want
to try the light?

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.050
TA: So we're going to
try this for those of you

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:04.042
who don't have the glasses,
but let's see if this works.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.440
It was kind of there.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.792
Is that what we're
supposed to see?

00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:15.250
You're supposed to
see all of them.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.333
I guess you can't, really.

00:22:18.515 --> 00:22:20.390
I guess depending on
how you move this thing,

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.234
maybe you end up
seeing all of them.

00:22:23.234 --> 00:22:25.704
Is it working?

00:22:25.704 --> 00:22:26.870
PROFESSOR: It's not working.

00:22:32.486 --> 00:22:34.996
TA: It's not working?

00:22:34.996 --> 00:22:35.496
No?

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:39.630
Yeah, I know.

00:22:42.792 --> 00:22:45.000
It kind of works, depending
on how I move this thing.

00:22:48.824 --> 00:22:50.574
PROFESSOR: Sometimes
it works really well.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.098
Should we just try walking?

00:23:03.098 --> 00:23:06.180
Can we hold it up and see
whether people also can see it?

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:06.930
TA: All rights.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.220
So we're going to hold it up.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.830
See if you guys--

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.521
PROFESSOR: Can just see
it without the camera.

00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:16.285
TA: OK.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.174
So what you should
be able to see,

00:23:21.174 --> 00:23:22.840
for those of you that
have your glasses,

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.220
is a continuous spectrum
with the various colors.

00:23:33.394 --> 00:23:35.435
PROFESSOR: You might have
to get the angle right.

00:23:35.435 --> 00:23:37.940
Are people in the middle
of the room able to see it?

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.130
Can anyone see it?

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.150
Yeah?

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.620
People on the edge of
the room, can you see it?

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.660
I think it's harder
from-- and the camera's

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.900
blocking people a little bit.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.450
TA: It works.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.032
I can see it.

00:24:03.032 --> 00:24:05.490
PROFESSOR: Do you want to move
it up farther, like in front

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:05.990
of that?

00:24:16.244 --> 00:24:17.160
Try turning it around.

00:24:19.842 --> 00:24:21.190
All right.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.840
Maybe we'll turn it
slightly, and then we

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.690
can come down, maybe,
and try it after class

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.070
if it's not working very well.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.567
When it's tilted, are you
having better luck over here?

00:24:51.046 --> 00:24:51.696
All right.

00:24:51.696 --> 00:24:53.320
I guess we'll bring
the lights back up,

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.153
and I'll show you what
you should have seen,

00:24:55.153 --> 00:24:56.924
if it didn't work for you.

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.280
So how many people were
able to see the spectra?

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:04.780
OK.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.279
All right.

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:06.410
So a good number of people.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.080
Great.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.415
I feel like this room is
not as perfect for this

00:25:11.415 --> 00:25:13.370
as some other rooms.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.510
But there are some rooms that
actually don't get dark at all,

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.043
and then you can't
really see anything.

00:25:19.043 --> 00:25:20.770
All right.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:28.090
So maybe if we have a chance,
we can try again at the end.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:28.600
All right.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.160
So this is what you
should have seen.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.820
You should have seen these
different series of lights,

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:42.440
or series of colors coming off,
and we're not the first people

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.870
to see it.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:51.420
So J.J. Balmer, in 1885,
reported seeing these colors,

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.180
and he wanted to calculate
the frequencies of the lights

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.010
that you were seeing
emitted from this.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.420
And so he did calculate
the frequency,

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.470
and then he tried to figure out
the mathematical relationship

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.440
between the different
frequencies of light

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.800
that he was observing.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.660
And he found that the
frequency equaled 3.29 times 10

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:17.610
to the 15th per second,
times 1 over 4 minus 1

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:23.540
over some number, n, where
n was either 3, 4, or 5.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.390
And he really didn't understand
what the significance of this

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.320
was, but it was pretty.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.760
You had hydrogen in
this sealed tube,

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.780
and there were colors that came
off, and they had frequencies.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.370
So that's kind of where that
stood for a little while.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:43.080
So now let's think about what
those different colored lights

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.600
were due to.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:51.070
So we have here energy
levels, and the transitions

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:56.000
that we were observing
are all going to be n

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.550
equals 2 final state.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:02.110
And we can think about why you
didn't see any transitions to n

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.680
equals one.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.560
Think about that.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.791
We'll come back to
that in a minute.

00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:07.540
But there were these
different transitions

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.180
that were being observed
from 3 to 2, 4 to 2, 5 to 2,

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.540
and 6 to 2.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:18.340
So now let's think about which
colors-- which wavelengths--

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.730
are due to which
of the transitions.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:25.740
So for the red one,
what do you think?

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.890
3, 4, or 5 transitioned to 2?

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.300
3.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.520
It is 3.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.420
And you could think about that
in terms of the smaller energy.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.210
That's the smallest
energy, so that

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.470
would be a low frequency
and a long wavelength.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.540
So the one with the longest
wavelength-- and red

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.820
is the longest
wavelength-- so that

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:55.160
must be the transition from an
initial n of 3 to n equal 2.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.700
And then we can fill in the
rest, so this one over here

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.850
must have been n equals 4 to 2.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:09.990
This one here, then, would
be the blue, n equals 5 to 2.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:15.240
And then the purple or indigo
at the end, n equals 6 to n

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.810
equals 2.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.970
So they saw these
four colors, there

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.040
were these different
transitions,

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.720
and so then, now,
we can calculate

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.680
what the frequencies
of these are and think

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.040
about this, then, in terms
of Schroedinger's equation

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:37.090
and test Schroedinger's equation
to see if it predicts this.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.740
So we can calculate
the frequency, then,

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.320
of the emitted
photons, and we had

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.860
frequency equals the initial
energy minus the final energy

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:54.940
state, or this delta E,
over Planck's constant.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.350
And from the
Schroedinger equation,

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:01.500
we know about what these energy
levels are from Schroedinger.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.090
And this is, again, for
hydrogen, so z equals 1, so z

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.360
isn't shown.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.530
We have the binding energy
equals minus RH, Rydberg

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.080
constant over n squared.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.200
And now we can put these
equations together.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.200
So we can substitute these
energies in using these,

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.920
and so we can do that here.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.680
We'll pull out Planck's
constant, so 1 over h.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:38.980
And then we can substitute in
minus RH over the initial n

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:47.820
level squared minus minus
RH over the final n squared.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.180
And we can also simplify
this a little more,

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:57.560
pull out RH over here, and now
we just have 1 over the final--

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.920
we have minus a minus,
so we've rearranged

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:06.950
this-- 1 over n final squared
minus 1 over n initial squared.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:10.510
And we have an
equation that solves

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:15.490
for the frequency in terms of
Rydberg, Planck's constant,

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:20.450
and what the principle quantum
numbers are, what n is.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.380
So let's look at
this a little more.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:28.470
Now remember, this is all
going to n final of 2,

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.720
and so we can put that
equation up here again.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.290
So when this is
2, 2 squared is 4.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.960
And if you remember
back, Balmer had

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.430
a 4-- had this part
of the expression--

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.640
but he had a strange
number over here

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.470
that he experimentally
determined.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.300
But if you take RH and divide
by Planck's constant, Rydberg

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.420
constant divided
by Planck's, you

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.980
get that number that
Balmer had found back

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:03.710
in 1885-- 3.29 times 10
to the 15th per second.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:08.330
So when we plug in the values
from Schroedinger's equations,

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.300
you come up with the
experimentally determined

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.830
values for frequencies,
or wavelength,

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.480
of the emitted light.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.210
And of course,
from the frequency,

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.100
you can calculate
the wavelength,

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.560
and the wavelengths that
were observed experimentally

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.280
agreed with the wavelength
you would calculate

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.020
from the Schroedinger's
equation to one part, n times 10

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:29.900
to the 8th.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.070
So the agreement was
absolutely amazing.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.950
So Schroedinger's
equation, which

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:38.280
was taking into account
the wavelike properties

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.090
of the electrons,
were able to predict,

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.890
for a hydrogen atom,
what wavelengths

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.980
you should see emitted in
that hydrogen atom spectra.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.330
So this was really exciting.

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.630
Schroedinger
equation was working,

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.700
we had a way of
describing the behavior

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.300
that we were observing
for these electrons,

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.730
and that was really incredible.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.940
And I think Balmer should
get a lot of credit as well

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.450
for all of this.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.720
And the people who were doing
these early experiments,

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.090
they didn't know
what it was meaning,

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.200
but they were coming up
with the data that allowed

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.500
to test theories later on.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.000
OK.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.760
So this was a series
going to a final n of 2,

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.630
and so we have
the Balmer series.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:24.620
That was the visible
series that we were seeing.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:30.701
So what about, why wasn't
anything going to n equals 1?

00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:31.950
And that's a clicker question.

00:33:17.354 --> 00:33:19.770
So at the end, I'm going to
ask you to put up the winners.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.460
Is my number good?

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.010
OK.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:29.890
10 more seconds.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.420
OK.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:54.090
So 71%.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.970
So the trick here is to
think about-- well, actually,

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.210
someone can tell me, maybe.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.392
What was the trick
here to think about?

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.090
I'll get a little exercise.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.320
I'll come up.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.650
How's everyone doing up here?

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:15.050
AUDIENCE: So for
the Lyman series,

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.580
there's a more difference
from the Balmer series,

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.199
so there's more energy in
the transition when it goes

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.690
down back to the ground state.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:23.150
So for that, with
more energy, it's

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.870
going to be a
shorter wavelength,

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.489
and that's ultraviolet.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:30.050
PROFESSOR: So here it would
be convenient to remember

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:34.139
your orders of what are short
and long wavelength kinds

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.233
of light.

00:34:37.233 --> 00:34:37.732
OK.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.080
So we have the UV range, then.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.790
And so that's why you
didn't observe it.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.090
It was happening,
but you didn't see it

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.719
because it was in the UV.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:53.219
All right.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:56.580
So then we can go on and
look at the other things that

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.230
can happen here.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:02.910
So we can have n
final of 3, and you

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.420
don't need to know the
names of these series,

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.930
but that would be near IR.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:12.730
N equals 4 would
be in the IR range.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:17.720
So only some of what's happening
is actually visible to us.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.140
We see beautiful colors
from transitions,

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.010
but there's other
things happening, too,

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:27.430
that are not visible to us.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:31.960
So at this point, we're feeling
pretty good about those energy

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.190
levels, about the
Schroedinger equation being

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:40.310
able to successfully predict
what kind of energy levels

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:41.850
you have, that binding energy.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:48.850
And now, this
verification was good,

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.990
from your photon emission.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:53.390
But there's another
property that you can have,

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.480
which is photon absorption.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.810
So why don't we do yet
another clicker question

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:02.834
as a competition, after
all, about absorption.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.046
OK, 10 seconds.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.350
OK.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:15.300
So now we're talking
about a different process.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.730
We were talking before
about electrons.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.515
They're starting up in a higher
energy level, going lower.

00:37:21.515 --> 00:37:23.160
But with photon
absorption, we're

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.240
going the other direction, so
we're going from a lower state.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.860
We're being excited.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.760
They're absorbing energy
and being excited,

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.420
so we can have a final
state that is higher,

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.505
and the energy is gained in this
process, so it's being excited.

00:37:43.011 --> 00:37:43.510
All right.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:45.370
So we can think about
the same things,

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.190
then, in terms of absorption.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:51.430
So if we have a big
energy difference,

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:57.160
if it's absorbing a lot of
energy, big energy difference,

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.780
it's going to be absorbing
light with a high frequency

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.210
and a short wavelength.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.680
If there's a small
energy difference,

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:12.370
it'll absorb a photon with a low
frequency or a long wavelength.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.570
And we'll come back to
some of these ideas,

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:16.760
actually, well into the
course, and we'll actually

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.360
look at some pretty colors.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:23.460
So in this case now, we can
calculate frequency again,

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.270
but our equation is a
little bit different.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:30.390
So we have the Rydberg constant
and Planck's constant again,

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:37.220
but now we have 1 over initial
n squared minus final n squared,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:41.160
and so this term should
be a positive term.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.623
We should be getting out
a positive frequency.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:50.020
So if I take this again
and put it up here,

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.900
you want to think about
whether, if you're

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.040
talking about
absorption or emission,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.310
that's what's telling you if the
energy is being gained or lost.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:02.171
So you're not going to have
negative frequencies in one

00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:02.670
case.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.610
You're going to be
absorbing the light

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:09.980
of a particular frequency, or
emitting light of a frequency.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.297
So pay attention
to your equations,

00:39:12.297 --> 00:39:14.130
and think about whether
your answer actually

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:16.040
make sense when you do them.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.810
And again, all
these equations are

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:20.841
going to be provided to
you in an equation sheet.

00:39:20.841 --> 00:39:21.340
OK.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.720
So let's consider the summary
of both of these things now.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.910
So we're talking about
admission versus absorption.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.090
And so we have this
Rydberg formula,

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.590
which is what this
is called, and it

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.220
can be used to
calculate the frequency

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:42.370
of either emitted photons
or absorbed photons, so

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.450
from either process.

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:46.490
And if we want to
make it more general,

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.600
again, it's just a
one electron case,

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:53.530
but we can put our z in
for any one electron ion.

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:57.910
So frequency equals Z squared,
Rydberg constant over Planck's

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:04.780
constant, and we have 1 over
the final minus initial,

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.450
or initial minus final,
depending on which

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:10.730
process you're talking about.

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:14.730
And over here, we'd be
talking, then, about emission.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:19.612
So our initial energy is
higher going to lower,

00:40:19.612 --> 00:40:21.070
and when that
happens, you're going

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:26.470
to be releasing light with
the energy difference that

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:30.460
is due to the difference
between these states.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.630
So we're going to
have our electron is

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.220
going to emit this energy.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.690
In the absorption process
for this equation,

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:41.910
we're going to go from
an initial state that's

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:45.020
lower to a higher state.

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.110
So we'll have a final state
that's higher than initial.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.020
That's absorption.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.190
It's absorbing energy.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.450
It's getting excited,
and so the electron

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:58.490
is absorbing that energy.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.850
So this really summarizes,
now, what we need

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.820
to know about binding energies.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.570
Schroedinger equation
also tells us

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:12.440
about wave functions, which is
what we're moving into next.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.970
So that's all for
today, except we

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:20.710
have a very important
announcement, which is

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.430
congratulation to recitation 6.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:27.624
Lisa, you are the first winner
of the clicker competition.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.040
Have a great weekend, everybody.
