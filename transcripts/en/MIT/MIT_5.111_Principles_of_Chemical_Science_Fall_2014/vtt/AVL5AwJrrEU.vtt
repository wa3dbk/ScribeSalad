CATHERINE DRENNAN: So
problems set 5 was due now.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.330
And problem set 6
is due next week.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.440
It will be posted later today.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.750
Welcome to the parents.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.670
We will have clickers too.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.860
Thank you for coming.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.840
So today's topic,
we're continuing

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.564
with chemical equilibrium.

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:44.230
And depending on when
the clickers come,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.810
the fun video may be at
the top of the lecture.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.820
But before that, today is going
to be a clicker competition.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.030
And hopefully, for the
parents in the room,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.910
your child has told you what
these clicker competitions are.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.820
The parents will be in
their own recitation.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.480
If you win, I think you have to
come back next week for snacks

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.580
at recitation.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.880
So we'll explain that.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.210
But some recitations have been
doing very well in the clicker

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.950
competition, but
they have not won.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.085
So I just want to share with
you another extra-credit clicker

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:25.585
assignment.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.400
And this extra-credit
clicker assignment

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.460
is something you can do this
weekend with your parents.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.500
So again this is optional.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.170
This is to win for your
recitation extra-credit points

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.590
to get into the championship
at the end of the semester

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.400
to win the geeky T-shirt.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.200
The geeky T-shirt is itself a
prize, or a extra-credit thing

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.030
to get in.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.740
OK.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.360
So in class, I have been
showing science videos.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.930
And these are the stars
of the science videos.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.000
They're MIT undergrads,
graduate students, post-docs,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.289
and faculty.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.170
And they've been talking about
how they use basic chemical

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.840
principles in their
research and how

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.970
that research is
important for addressing

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.900
a real-world problem.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.990
So the extra credit
assignment is

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.030
that each of these
individuals also

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.100
has a two to-- I think
the longest one is about--

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.150
five-minute personal video.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.600
And so the extra
credit assignment

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.860
is to watch one or all,
as many as you want,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.260
of these personal
videos, and then

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.920
send Allena an e-mail
with your recitation

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.820
number in the subject line
saying one thing that surprised

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.990
you in a personal
video or one thing

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.540
to which you could
really relate,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.430
that someone said in
their personal video.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.140
So it can just be
one or two sentences.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.850
It doesn't have to be long.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.950
When I gave this
assignment before,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.700
I'll give you a little help on
where you might want to start.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.060
We had the most comments
about Ben's personal video

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.070
and Samuel's personal video.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.430
And some people also commented
on my personal video.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.680
So these are personal
videos that kind of

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.410
tell people's path to science
or people's path to chemistry.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.910
So

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.890
I thought this might
be a fun thing to do.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.170
It's available online here.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.690
You can watch some of these-
again, two-to-five-minutes--

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.830
with your parents.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.310
And that might also help your
parents understand a little

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.980
about the people
who are here at MIT.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.470
So this is something,
and it's due November 3.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.550
But I thought it
might be a fun thing

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.940
to do homework with their
parents on visiting weekend.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.490
That's an awesome
thing to be able to do.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.360
All right.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.950
So clicker competition.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.240
Recitations 7-- Dan
must unseat him.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.580
Here's one that parents
might know the answer to.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.990
We'll see.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.860
And again, you can share.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.627
But remember, your parents
are competing against you.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.530
All right.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.640
Let's just try 10 more seconds.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:17.982
Very good.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.210
So that's the answer.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.830
So that was yesterday.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.970
And so this, every year,
it's National Chemistry Week

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.010
on the week of Mole Day.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.170
So this is national
chemistry week.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.296
So if I can get most of
the way through lecture,

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:42.670
I'm going to share
with you a fun

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.970
video at the end that celebrates
national chemistry week.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.320
So hopefully we'll get there.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.720
But first, let's
talk a little bit

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.950
about chemical equilibrium,
the subject for today.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:00.050
So chemical equilibrium--
it's all about staying calm.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.640
So we want the rate in to
be equal to the rate out.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.790
We like to be at this
equilibrium place.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.690
But sometimes, often, all the
time-- frankly, all the time,

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.530
stress is applied to our
equilibrium situation.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.090
And systems must respond in such
a way to alleviate that stress.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.090
So Le Chatelier's
principle suggests

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.370
that, when a stress is
applied to the system,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.660
the system will respond in such
a way to minimize the stress.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.210
Again, this is about keeping
calm, minimizing stress.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.260
And if you think about what
direction the reaction will

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.010
go to minimize the
stress, you can predict

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.570
the direction of the reaction.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.357
So today, we're going to talk
about some of the stresses

00:05:46.357 --> 00:05:46.940
to the system.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.010
Last time, we talked
about adding and removing

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.540
reactants and products.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.940
This time, we're going
to talk about gases.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.610
And we're going to talk
about changing the volume.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.800
That's our first
stress to the system.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.580
So if you decrease the
volume of a gaseous system,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.750
it will cause an increase
in the total pressure.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.520
And we know this from
the ideal gas law

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.240
and other relationships also
between pressure and volume.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.370
So the ideal gas
law is something

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.070
most MIT students are
familiar with, because it

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.540
is, in fact, the T in MIT.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.230
So PV equals nRT.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:33.380
where P is pressure, V is
volume, T is temperature,

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.560
n is the number of
moles of that ideal gas,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.180
and R is our ideal gas constant.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.900
So this relates
pressure to volume

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.950
at a constant temperature
and relates pressure, volume,

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.880
and temperature and also
number of moles to reach other.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.340
So this is a very
important expression,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.520
and we won't actually be talking
very much about the ideal gas

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.120
law.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.610
But you need it in this
unit, because in this unit,

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.760
we're thinking about stresses
to equilibrium situations

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.070
and how reactions
are going to respond.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.240
So if you decrease the
volume of a gaseous system,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.930
causing an increase
in total pressure,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.120
the system's going to respond in
such way to minimize the stress

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.450
or decrease the total pressure.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.190
And so Le Chatelier's
principle would

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.980
predict that, if
possible, the system's

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.950
going to respond in such a way
to reduce that total pressure.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.030
So you increase the pressure,
reduce the pressure.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.670
Minimize the stress.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:40.010
So let's look at a reaction
of a gas to another gas.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.100
So here we have the
molecules of gas P2

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.430
going to one molecule of P4.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.210
And if we had a container
with a particular volume

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:56.090
and we compress that volume, the
reaction that is at equilibrium

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.670
is going to respond.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.840
And here, a decrease
in volume is

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.250
going to shift the
reaction toward product.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.480
So why is this?

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.510
Why is it going to
shift it toward product?

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.250
And it's because, for
every two molecules of P2

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:22.220
that are consumed, only one
molecule of P4 is formed.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.770
And thus, the shift toward
product, shift toward P4,

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.470
is going to reduce the
total pressure, because you

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.900
have fewer molecules of gas.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.429
So each of them is a little bit
happier in this now decreased

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.110
Volume

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.570
So you can also just think
about what direction,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.670
where are the moles, and
how this is shifting.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.160
But you can also think about
this in terms of Q and K,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.720
and I highly recommend this.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.480
I'm a big fan of thinking about
the relationship between Q

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.790
and K. So let's
think about this now.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.620
Let's just suppose
that the volume

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.200
is decreased by a factor of 2.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.680
So we were at equilibrium.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.680
Q was equal to K. K
is the equilibrium

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.350
constant, or the reaction
quotient, at equilibrium.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.130
But now, we have
changed the volume by 2.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.940
So we can think about
what has happened to Q.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:25.640
So Q is products over
reactants at any time point.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.270
Product is the partial
pressure of gas P4--

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.510
that's our product--
over the partial pressure

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.990
of the reactants, the
partial pressure of P2 gas.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.580
But there are two
of them, so we have

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.590
to remember the stoichiometry
of the reaction.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.430
So both of these are affected.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.760
But because of the
stoichiometry of the reaction,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.810
Q is now a half.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.360
So Q has changed.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.860
We have decreased
Q by a factor of 2.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:03.650
So Q is now less than K. So
tell me what happens to delta G

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.600
in this situation.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.990
Let's try just 10 more seconds.

00:10:42.665 --> 00:10:44.400
Yep.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.690
So it is a negative value,
and let's take a look at why.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.890
So delta G is negative.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:59.340
And we recall this relationship
that delta G RT natural log

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.140
of Q over K. So when
Q is less than K,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.590
you get a negative
value for delta G.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.070
And when you have a
negative value for delta G,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.840
the reaction goes in
the forward direction.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.810
So a negative value
for delta G means

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.180
it's spontaneous in
the forward direction.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.580
The forward direction
is toward products.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.910
And this will happen
until Q equals K again.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.550
So you can think about
this based on the equation.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.920
Always ask yourself,
this Q changing?

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.710
Is Q less than K
or greater than K?

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.560
And that'll predict
the direction to which

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.750
the reaction will switch.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.740
So it's going to go in
the forward direction

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.440
if delta G is negative.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.880
All right.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.610
Now let's increase the
volume and think about what

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.820
happens in the container.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.250
So we have a container here.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.400
We increase the volume.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.190
So now, we're going to
shift to the reaction

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.590
toward our reactants.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.690
So the increase
in volume is going

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.090
to lower that total pressure.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.610
And we can think
about this switch.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.930
We have one molecule
of P4 on the products,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.210
two molecules of P2 here.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.000
So for every one
molecule consumed

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.140
in the backward direction, two
molecules of P2 are formed.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:27.630
So the shift will
compensate for this change,

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.390
and we're going to increase
the delta pressure, which

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:34.170
was decreased before, by
this increase in volume.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.510
So again, you're
shifting it in such a way

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.550
to minimize the stress.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.960
Even if the stress is
a decrease in pressure,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.150
you want to be back at
your equilibrium place.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:50.670
So you'll shift to then
increase the total pressure just

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.250
to compensate in any
way, minimize the stress.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.280
Whatever the stress is,
you want to minimize it.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.910
All right.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.050
Let's do something
slightly trickier.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.560
Let's add an inert
gas to this reaction.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.490
So we're going to add an
inert gas to a container,

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:13.080
increasing the total pressure
at constant temperature.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.341
Why don't you predict
what's going to happen?

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.090
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.010
Yes, this is a tricky one.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.125
Since it's a clicker
competition, we won't repoll,

00:13:56.125 --> 00:13:58.110
and we'll put up the answer.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.168
Ooh, by a slight edge.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.360
So this seems very
counter-intuitive, so let's

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.520
discuss it.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.080
So nothing happens.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.040
But why?

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.750
So Q depends on the partial
pressure of these gases.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.020
And under the scenario
described here,

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.110
the partial pressures were
actually not changing.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.760
So Q was not changing.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.160
And therefore,
there was no shift.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.010
So to understand this, we have
to do a little partial pressure

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.230
review.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.550
So partial pressure of gases.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.630
The partial pressure
is the pressure

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.920
that each gas would exert
if it were by itself.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.480
That's the definition
of partial pressure.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.610
So if we have oxygen at
one atmosphere and nitrogen

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.970
at one atmosphere, and
you add them together,

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.540
and now you have a total
pressure of two atmospheres-- 1

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.070
plus 1 equals 2-- but the
partial pressure of O2

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.700
here is identical to
its partial pressure

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.790
here, its partial pressure
as if it was there by itself.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.240
It has no interest
in this inert gas.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.900
It ignores it and feels no
different as a result of it.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:22.390
Very just sort of isolationist
with these ideal gases.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:26.020
So the partial pressure
of O2 here is the same.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.880
And so we can look
mathematically

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.260
at this expression.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.900
So the partial
pressure of gas A is

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:37.390
equal to the number of moles
of that gas, RT over volume.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.660
The total pressure is equal
to the partial pressure

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.590
of gas ABC, how many
ever gases there are.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:48.220
But the partial pressure
of each gas, like O2 here,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.890
just depends on the number
of moles of that gas

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.680
and the volume of
that container,

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.330
assuming constant temperature.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.650
So if the partial
pressure isn't going

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.920
to change-- so if you add
inert gases, increasing

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.990
the total pressure, the
partial pressure is unchanged.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:12.240
And when the partial pressure
is unchanged, Q is unchanged.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.560
Remember, Q equals
the partial pressure

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.200
of the gas products over the
partial pressure or the gas

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.130
reactants.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:22.360
So if partial pressures don't
change, Q does not change.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.800
And if Q doesn't change,
then Q is the same as K,

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.200
and there is no shift.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.560
So we have to always
ask ourselves,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.120
what's happened
to the container?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.440
What's the partial pressure?

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.767
Did the partial pressure change?

00:16:38.767 --> 00:16:39.850
Let's try another example.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.440
Let's add another inert gas.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.310
But this time, we're going
to add it to a container.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.220
And the total pressure
and the temperature

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.260
are kept constant in this case.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.750
So this is another
clicker question.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.345
Why didn't you see what you
think is going to happen here?

00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:14.750
All right, let's
do 10 more seconds.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.906
All right.

00:17:35.906 --> 00:17:37.030
This is a good clicker day.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.230
Sometimes whenever the
answers are all 90%,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.820
then it's decided that these
questions will determine it.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.250
All right, so
let's look at this.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.730
So we're going to
shift toward reactant.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.370
Again, let's consider why.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.870
All right.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.080
So in this problem,
we're adding inert gas.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.940
Total pressure and
temperature are constant.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.520
Well, temperature
was constant before.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.280
But total pressure wasn't
in the last example.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.570
So let's go back to
our picture here.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:15.050
So if the total pressure
was to stay constant--

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.770
and normally, if you
add, one atmosphere of O2

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.340
and one atmosphere of
N2, the total pressure

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.860
is two atmospheres,
because total pressure

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.020
equals partial
pressure of one gas

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.420
plus the partial pressure
of the other gas.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:34.090
So if the total pressure is
constant, what has to happen?

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.190
Tell me.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.590
What happened?

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.610
So the volume must have changed.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.950
So if the temperature
stayed the same,

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.610
the volume of the container
must have increased.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:52.390
Because otherwise, the
pressure, the total pressure,

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.640
should have changed.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.840
And it didn't.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.850
So the system was manipulated.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.920
The volume must have increased.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.600
So now, let's think
about what happens

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.430
when the volume increases.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:09.605
When the volume increases, the
partial pressures decrease,

00:19:09.605 --> 00:19:11.230
because they're now
in a bigger volume,

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.396
because partial pressure
depends on number of moles.

00:19:13.396 --> 00:19:16.780
It depends on volume at
constant temperature.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.420
And so if the partial
pressures decrease,

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.170
then Q is also going to change.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.710
And when Q changes, the
reaction is going to respond.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.440
And in this way, it's going
to respond in such a way

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.061
that you want to
increase the pressure,

00:19:32.061 --> 00:19:33.310
because we have this decrease.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.290
So now we want to increase.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.500
And so we're going to
switch from one mole to two.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:43.730
And so the reaction is going
to shift toward the reactants.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.610
So in doing these problems with
partial pressures and gases,

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.330
you always have to ask
yourself, did Q change?

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.750
And whether Q changed is whether
the partial pressures change.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.280
And partial pressure
will definitely

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.270
change if you change moles
or if you change the volume.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.020
So often in these
problems, you're saying,

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.460
did the volume change?

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.710
Volume change, partial
pressure change.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.640
Q is different.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.530
The reaction is going to shift.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:13.120
So there's lots of examples
on this in problem set 6.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.670
So you can go work on those.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.750
All right.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:20.650
So that is about volume.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.420
We've had temperature constant.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.350
Can't do that forever.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.371
Now it's time to
change the temperature.

00:20:28.371 --> 00:20:28.870
All right.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.050
So changing the temperature
of an equilibrium mixture

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:38.200
by adding heat is going to
shift the reaction in such a way

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.600
that some of that
heat is absorbed.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.260
So again, this is consistent
with Le Chatelier.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.180
Minimize the stress.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.280
Add heat, absorb heat.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.710
Remove heat, create more heat.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.400
Again, you're minimizing
the stress to the system.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.280
So now let's think of
different types of reactions.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.370
We have endothermic and
exothermic reactions.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.100
And let's think about the effect
of changing the temperature

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.900
on those reactions.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.130
So let's think about
raising the temperature

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.830
of an exothermic reaction.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.780
Is that going to
shift the formation

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.490
of reactants or products?

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.285
What do you think?

00:21:19.255 --> 00:21:20.740
Reactants.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.447
All right, let's consider why.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.510
So for an exothermic
reaction, that

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.480
means that the reaction
in the forward direction

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.020
is exothermic, which also
means that the reaction

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.320
in the reverse direction
is endothermic.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.930
So for an exothermic
reaction-- exothermic

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.610
in the forward
direction-- heat is

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.370
produced when you go from
reactants to products.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:49.850
And in the endothermic
direction, heat is absorbed.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.340
So if you raise the
temperature, you're

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.230
going to want to
minimize the stress.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.350
So you want to shift it in
the endothermic direction.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.210
You want to shift
it in the direction

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.840
that heat is absorbed, which, in
this case, is toward reactants.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.760
Now let's think about
an endothermic reaction.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.280
Raising the temperature
of an endothermic reaction

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.190
is going to shift
toward products.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.550
And if we put our
pictures again,

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:18.860
an endothermic
reaction is endothermic

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.290
in the forward direction.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.150
So heat is absorbed from
reactants to products.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.420
And in the reverse direction
of an endothermic reaction

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.390
is the exothermic direction
in which heat is produced.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.710
So if you raise the
temperature, then you're

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.780
going to want to shift
in such a direction

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.320
to minimize that
stress in a direction

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.520
to absorb heat,
which, in this case,

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.490
sends you toward products.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:46.710
So here, the predictive
tool is our friend delta H.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.470
So delta H tells us
whether reactions

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.530
are exothermic or endothermic,
whether delta h is

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.150
negative or positive.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.170
So for some things,
the prediction

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.760
is what's happening
to delta G. Here,

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.690
our predictive tool is
the sine of delta H.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.140
So let's do a clicker
question, and tell me

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.480
what direction you think
this particular reaction is

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.570
going to go if you add heat.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.760
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.380
All right.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.300
So is this an exo- or
endothermic reaction?

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.130
Exothermic, because we
have the negative sign.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.830
And so then we can think
about what's going to happen.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.160
So you add heat.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.260
You're going to want to
shift it in the direction

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.810
to absorb the heat.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.790
So you're going to shift
it toward reactants

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.330
in the endothermic
direction, absorb the heat.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.710
So again, delta H is
the predictive tool.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:05.620
You have to remember
negative delta H exothermic,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.740
positive delta H endothermic.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.180
And then just think
about shifting

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.800
to minimize the stress,
always minimizing the stress.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.300
All right.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:25.240
So our equilibrium constant K.
It's a constant, except that it

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.450
changes with temperature.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:32.840
So the equilibrium constant
has a temperature dependence.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.380
So big K, the
equilibrium constant,

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.640
can change with temperature.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.710
Reaction rates can also
change with temperature.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.680
So when we talk
about kinetics, we're

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.250
going to have little Ks,
which are reaction rates.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.990
And they're going to change
with temperature as well.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.110
So how does the
equilibrium constant

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.020
change with temperature?

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.660
And you might feel a
derivation coming on,

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.350
and you would be right.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.460
So let's think about what we
know, equations that involve

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.350
the equilibrium constant.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.800
We saw before that
delta G0 equals minus RT

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.420
natural log of K.
What else do we

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.120
know about delta G0 equations?

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.535
What else does delta G0 equal?

00:25:16.535 --> 00:25:22.610
It equals our friend delta
H not minus T delta S0.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:27.620
And we can rearrange
this expression,

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.580
solving for the
natural log of K.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.980
And if we assume-- and
it's a good assumption--

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:40.650
that delta H and delta S0 are
independent of temperature,

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:46.370
that means that K is going
to change with temperature.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.610
And we can think about
two different temperatures

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.240
and come up with a
unified equation.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.440
So if we consider a reaction
carried out-- temperature T1

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.190
and temperature T2-- we would
have natural log of K2 equals

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:06.190
minus delta H0 over R
and over temperature 2

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:10.130
plus delta S over R. And
we have the same thing now

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.420
but for equilibrium constant
1 and temperature 1.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.270
So we can combine these,
and things will cancel.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.520
So subtracting those two
equations gives you this.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.740
And it's a named
equation in chemistry,

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.920
which means that it's probably
pretty important, because a lot

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.550
of things don't have names.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.150
So we have the natural
log of the equilibrium

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:35.140
constant K2 over
equilibrium constant K1

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:41.140
equals minus delta
H0 over R, which

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:46.130
is a constant, in brackets,
1 over temperature 2 minus 1

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:47.950
over temperature 1.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.910
Van 't Hoff equation.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.410
And later in the
semester, I'm going

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.020
to ask you to recall
this equation.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.500
And I'll have a special prize
for the first person who

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.150
comes up with the Van
't Hoff equation, so you

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.520
can keep that in mind.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.730
I think it's a lecture 34.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.680
So we have a ways to go.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.910
All right.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.000
So let's think about
what is true, then,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.540
if delta H0 is less than 0.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.466
First of all, is that
exothermic or endothermic?

00:27:17.466 --> 00:27:19.021
Exothermic.

00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:19.710
All right.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.980
So now we're going to
think about increasing

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.730
the temperature of an
exothermic reaction.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.760
So temperature 2 is going to
be greater than temperature 1.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.450
And we already thought about
what was going to happen.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.880
But let's make sure this
equation is valid and works

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.410
for what we just saw.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.370
So if we increase
the temperature here,

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.980
what's true about this equation?

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.490
Well, what's true is you
have a minus sign here.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.830
Delta H is negative
for exothermic.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.710
And if your temperature 2 is
greater than temperature 1,

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.260
that's also a negative.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.120
So overall, you're going
to have a negative value.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.450
And if you have a
negative value here,

00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:00.630
that's going to mean that
K1 is greater than K2,

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.300
which means that, at
your new equilibrium,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.461
there'll be fewer products.

00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:05.960
All right.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.020
Well, this works with what
we were just talking about.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:13.110
If you increase the temperature
of an exothermic reaction,

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:16.430
it shifts it toward
reactants to absorb the heat.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.430
So there would be less products.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.050
We've shifted toward reactants.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.970
So you can just
think about what's

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.680
happening and moving
in the direction

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.000
to minimize the stress.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.630
And you can also
look at the equation

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:32.480
and mathematically
figure out what's

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.400
going to be true about
the equilibrium constants.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.230
It's great to have
a backup plan.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.730
All right.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.920
So if we decrease
the temperature,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.630
T2 is less than T1.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.230
So now we have our minus.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.010
We have a minus.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.230
But now this is a plus term.

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:52.590
And so that's going to mean
our K1 is less than K2.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.360
We have more products here.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.000
So if we decrease
the temperature

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.990
of an exothermic reaction, the
reaction responds in such a way

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.550
to minimize the
stress, add more heat.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.230
So you switch to the
exothermic direction.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:08.450
And so you should
have more products

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:12.110
at this new equilibrium.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.870
All right.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.540
So now, why don't
you tell me what

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.860
should happen for
the scenario where

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.320
delta H0 is greater than 0?

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.110
Which of the following
should be true?

00:29:42.152 --> 00:29:43.276
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:03.210
Yeah, so most people are
right in that-- yeah.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.030
I think this is a
good example of how,

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.030
when things are
expressed different ways,

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.990
sometimes it's hard
to see that it all

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.060
is consistent with each other.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.900
So yeah, all of those
turn out to be true.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.530
All right, so let's
look at it over here.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.670
So this is an
endothermic reaction.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:28.740
When we increase the temperature
of an endothermic reaction,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.300
you still have this minus sign.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.380
But now this is plus.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.965
But when we've increased the
temperature, this is minus.

00:30:34.965 --> 00:30:38.040
So you get an overall
plus in signs, which

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.380
means that K1 is less than K2.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.060
Increasing the temperature
of an endothermic reaction

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.250
shifts it toward products.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:51.340
If we decrease the temperature,
the net sign is negative here.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.400
So K1 is going to
be greater than K2.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.930
We decrease the temperature.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.100
It shifts in the exothermic
backwards direction,

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.530
and we have less products.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.000
All right.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.620
So K changes with temperature.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.850
You can see this equation
on your equation sheet

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:13.570
or just think about
minimizing the stress.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.670
So what is this useful for?

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.480
Well, figuring out
how to maximize

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.630
the yield of a reaction can
be very important in industry.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:26.550
One process that is an
important industrial process

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.690
is the Haber-Bosch
process, where

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:33.270
you take nitrogen gas and
hydrogen gas and make ammonia.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:37.930
This process, which was
developed a long time ago,

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.700
is still used today.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.290
And each year, you
make 1.6 times 10

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.640
to the 10th
kilograms of ammonia,

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.160
which you use for
fertilizer and other things.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.250
You know what other
things ammonia is often

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.330
used for besides fertilizer?

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.120
Explosives, yeah.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:00.190
So if you look at the dates
of these process development

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:04.530
and the names of these
people, they're German.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:09.030
And so we have World
War I and World War II.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.190
I'm thinking that the push
to come up with this process

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:17.170
was probably not for fertilizer
and the farmers at this time.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.170
This was an important
part of the war effort,

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.310
to get this process to
work to make explosives.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.450
So Haber over here
also is considered

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.850
the father of chemical weapons.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:33.030
He came up with gases,
such as phosgene.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:38.080
And he would study the effects
of how they killed people.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.540
And one of the ironies
is that he was Jewish.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:46.350
And so a lot of his discoveries
were used and resulted

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:49.890
in his relatives dying.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:55.130
So he was an interesting
figure in history.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.620
Carl Bosch, on the other hand,
disapproved strongly of Hitler

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.690
and was fired from his post.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.780
He didn't lose his life,
but his career was ended.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:08.850
But he still had his Nobel
Prize, so maybe it was OK.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:14.700
So this is an interesting
little history about chemistry.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.370
But this process
is still used now.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.560
No one has come up
with anything better.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.320
And we could think about,
what are the challenges

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.110
of making this reaction go?

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.090
So it's an exothermic reaction.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:30.600
So what temperature
would you want

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.860
to use to get more products?

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.060
Right, you want to
use low temperature,

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.920
because that would
favor your products.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.570
But low temperature is
also sometimes not great,

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.340
because it slows the
rate, which is bad.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.930
So the compromise temperature
that's used in this process

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.120
is 500 degrees Celsius.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.470
So it's pretty hot.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:56.100
So this works, again, maximizing
the yield of products.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:00.900
So what are other ways to
drive this toward products?

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.900
So can someone suggest
another way [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.362
I don't think I have
two [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:07.362 --> 00:34:08.820
If you have your
parents here, they

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.920
might want this lovely
residential water bottle.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.884
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:13.884 --> 00:34:17.586
What are other ways to
drive this toward products?

00:34:17.586 --> 00:34:20.790
Maybe someone could
run the mic up there.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.699
Is this-- yeah, it's gone.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:37.512
You could decrease the volume?

00:34:37.512 --> 00:34:38.590
Yep.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:39.427
Yes!

00:34:39.427 --> 00:34:39.927
Yep.

00:34:39.927 --> 00:34:40.923
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:34:40.923 --> 00:34:43.110
[CHEERING]

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:47.170
So there's a couple
things that you can do.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.580
One is you compress the volume.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.040
And the reason why
this works is that,

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.739
if you note you have four
molecules over here-- 1

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.690
plus 3 going to 2.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:00.780
So if you compress
that volume down,

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.600
you're going to shift it toward
the fewer number of molecules,

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.220
which is 2.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.390
So that shifts it
toward products.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.230
The other thing that they do is
they actually remove products

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.530
from the reaction.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.760
So they liquefy out the
product at some point.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.040
And when you remove
the product, that also

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.080
shifts the reaction
toward more products

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.590
to minimize the stress.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.530
So these are two of the
things that are done.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.980
So you have to
have high pressure

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.250
to compress that volume
down and high temperatures.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.870
So this process costs
a lot of energy.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:35.910
So we spend a lot of
energy in this country

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:37.470
doing this reaction.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.680
And the reason why
is because it's

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.670
really hard to split
nitrogen. So what kind of bond

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.164
does nitrogen have, N2 have?

00:35:46.164 --> 00:35:46.955
Triple bond, right.

00:35:46.955 --> 00:35:47.859
It's very hard.

00:35:47.859 --> 00:35:48.900
It has a high bond order.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.730
It's very hard to
break that bond.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.430
And so you really have
to work at breaking it.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.300
So if you're doing
industry, there's

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.190
lots of nitrogen in the air.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.080
So a lot of it is available.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.860
But it's just very hard to
utilize it to fix that nitrogen

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.420
into another form.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.540
So lots of nitrogen in the air.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.610
Nitrogen is needed
by all living things,

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.880
but it's really hard to
break that triple bond.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.270
But if you're a bacteria, you
have a much easier time doing

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.000
this than if you are a person.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.320
And bacteria have an
enzyme called nitrogenase.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.280
Adding the "-ase"
means it's an enzyme.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.850
So this is an enzyme
that works on nitrogen.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.470
Most people call it
"nit-raw-genase,"

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.390
but it's really "nitrogen-ace."

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.620
And it splits nitrogen.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.760
And it does this by these
really complex metallocofactors.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.440
Lots of metals in here.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.150
You have iron and molybdenum.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.190
You also have inorganic sulfur.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.720
And it's those d-orbitals
that let you do this.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.560
So you can use high
temperatures, high pressure.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.740
Or you can get a transition
metal with beautiful d-orbitals

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.152
to do your work for you.

00:36:54.152 --> 00:36:55.860
And a lot of people
are trying to come up

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.650
with their own catalyst inspired
by nature to get this to work.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.950
So this is an ongoing
area of research.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.770
And I just want to mention one
of the leaders in the field.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.890
This is a husband-and-wife
team, actually.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:11.460
And Markus Ribbe is a
German with a very heavy

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.600
German accent.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.840
And so Germans have been
dominating this nitrogen fixing

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.730
field for a very long time.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.520
But Markus Ribbe is like the
nicest person you would ever

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.380
meet in your entire life.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.330
And he's trying to figure out
environmentally friendly ways

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:25.830
to do it.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.770
So again, chemistry
is a powerful tool

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:29.790
to change the world.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.990
But let's change it
for the better, please,

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.910
and try to come up with ways
to protect our environment.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.340
All right, so there's
one application

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.610
of Le Chatelier's
principle, maximizing

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:44.790
the yield of a reaction.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:49.860
Another example comes in
medicine and Le Chatelier's

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.340
principle with respect to
another metalloprotein,

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.300
which is hemoglobin.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.350
So hemoglobin has a "heme,"
which is iron, more d-orbitals.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.110
If I'm this excited now, wait
till I get to d-orbitals.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:02.430
It's very exciting.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:03.210
I can't wait.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.210
I love transition metals.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:08.820
So anyway, so we
have hemoglobin.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.570
So hemoglobin Hb plus
oxygen yields oxyhemoglobin.

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.610
It's hemoglobin
with oxygen bound.

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:17.520
And this is an incredibly
important reaction,

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.960
because otherwise your air,
your O2, would be in your lungs

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.050
and wouldn't leave.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.020
But hemoglobin carries
it to the body, where

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.020
it can be used to make energy.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.540
So we really need the reaction.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:31.278
We want to maximize the
product of that reaction.

00:38:31.278 --> 00:38:35.980
So this disequilibrium
can be shifted

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:41.610
if you have less O2 around, a
lower partial pressure of O2.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:45.910
And this can happen as
you go up in altitude.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.980
The pressure of
oxygen decreases,

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.400
and that's a real problem.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.340
So any of you real
serious mountain climbers?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.850
At least one.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:59.790
How about somewhat
serious, climbed

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.980
a mountain, maybe worried
about your hemoglobin

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.780
levels, altitude thickness?

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:04.940
A few, OK.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.400
So what can happen
here is, when you have,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.700
again, lower pressure,
then the reaction

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.660
shifts in the
opposite direction.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.770
It's like you have a
lower amount of reactant,

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.380
so you shift to
make more reactant.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.550
And this is what happens.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:23.700
You have less
oxygenated hemoglobin,

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.690
and that can make
you pretty sick.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.840
So for some of you
if you want to say,

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.100
what can you do about this?

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.320
How can you shift the
reaction back the other way?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.653
Do you know what your body does?

00:39:33.653 --> 00:39:34.800
Your body is very clever.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.594
What does it do?

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.080
Yeah, so it makes
it more hemoglobin.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.630
So that's why you need to
give your body a little time

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:47.010
to adjust.

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:48.570
Can't do it immediately.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:51.230
You have to give it a little
time to make more protein.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:56.010
But when you increase
the amount of reactant,

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:57.910
it'll shift toward product.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.820
So when you increase
the reactants

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:04.770
to minimize the stress, it
shifts to make more products.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:10.860
So this is how the
body compensates.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:15.690
So I'm going to tell
you very briefly

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.450
about significant
figures, and then I'm

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:22.400
going to have time to
show you a Mole Day video.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.450
And it's actually
from UC Irvine,

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:26.130
where Markus Ribbe is from.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:29.460
So today, we're celebrating UC
Irvine chemistry department.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.090
Anyway, I just want to
mention significant figures.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.750
I have a confession to make.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.080
I didn't know the rules
of significant figures

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.890
for logs when I started
teaching this course.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.370
And this will be
information that I

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:46.680
think now I'll have to purge
from my brain on my deathbed.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.860
But pay attention
to these, and we'll

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.370
have some clicker
questions on them.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:52.300
So that'll be fun.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:52.800
OK.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:58.870
So let's look at these two--
log of two different numbers.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:02.730
Note the 3 here is
the 3 over here.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:09.510
The 23, 10 to the 23-- 10 to the
23, Mole Day-- is the 23 here.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.400
But those are not significant.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.940
That 3 and that 23 are
not significant figures.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.900
These are the significant
figures-- 7.310.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.320
So there are four
significant figures here.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:27.730
Those four significant figures
end up after the decimal point.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.940
So those are the
significant figures

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.020
after the decimal point.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.090
And if you go the other
direction, if you have a 0.389

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:39.670
here, that has three
significant figures.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.790
So three significant
figures here.

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:45.420
But if you have
12.389, you still

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.660
have three significant figures,
because that 12 ends up

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.070
over here.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.150
All right.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:54.468
With that, give it a try.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:02.240
This could be for the clicker
championship of today.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:18.510
All right.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.060
Let's just do 10 more seconds.

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:35.450
Should I show my
video first, or do you

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:36.650
want to do the winner first?

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:37.820
Do winner first.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.650
Winner first, OK.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:41.480
All right.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.767
OK, so 3 after
the decimal place.

00:42:45.767 --> 00:42:47.600
And let's look at the
winner, and then we're

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.245
going to end with a short video.

00:42:51.245 --> 00:42:53.750
Oh, man!

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.200
All right.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.446
Dan, whoa.

00:42:57.446 --> 00:42:57.945
OK.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.890
All right, so we're going
to end with a short video.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.060
And here it is.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.485
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:12.365
[MUSIC - "LET IT GO"]

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:23.409
- (SINGING) Snow looks white,
'cause it's scattering light

00:43:23.409 --> 00:43:23.908
elastically.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.313
Atoms are everywhere I
look, though none of them

00:43:31.313 --> 00:43:33.870
can be seen.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:41.400
Molecules have always been
a challenge to resolve.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.370
Light microscopes don't work.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.142
Heavens knows we tried.

00:43:48.058 --> 00:43:50.220
Do they exist?

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.663
Can they been seen?

00:43:51.663 --> 00:43:55.090
Maybe using some spectroscopy!

00:43:55.090 --> 00:44:01.190
For centuries, we didn't know.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:04.636
Well, now we know!

00:44:04.636 --> 00:44:08.880
Chemists know,
chemists know what

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.675
makes water freeze and flow.

00:44:11.675 --> 00:44:18.980
Chemists know, chemists
know why fireflies can glow.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:29.330
All chemists know
Avogadro order 10 to 23.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.884
The moles never
bothered me anyway.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:43.640
Angstroms measure distance,
nomenclature hard to say.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:50.820
Though we are macroscopic,
we always find a way!

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:55.628
We love to see what we
can do, synthesizing

00:44:55.628 --> 00:45:02.487
novel molecules from Exclusion
Principle of Pauli-- chemistry!

00:45:05.409 --> 00:45:12.714
Chemists know, chemists
know about ozone in the sky.

00:45:12.714 --> 00:45:19.600
Chemists know, chemists know
sigma bonding versus pi.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:26.488
We understand Le Chatelier.

00:45:26.488 --> 00:45:26.988
Equilibrium!

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:41.526
There's chemistry to be
found from the air down

00:45:41.526 --> 00:45:44.418
to the ground.

00:45:44.418 --> 00:45:48.360
We make these compounds
form in flasks

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.839
with bottoms that are round.

00:45:51.839 --> 00:45:58.545
We hope they crystallize,
'cause columns are the worst.

00:45:58.545 --> 00:46:06.230
Still we strive to do all this
for the chance to be the first!

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:13.136
Chemists know, chemists know why
it's red at the break of dawn.

00:46:13.136 --> 00:46:17.600
Chemists know,
chemists know where

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.576
reactants go when they're gone.

00:46:20.576 --> 00:46:31.488
We need to know every single
way to form or break bonds!

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.140
The moles never
bothered me anyway.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.610
[END PLAYBACK]

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:43.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.230
All right, have a great weekend.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:48.910
