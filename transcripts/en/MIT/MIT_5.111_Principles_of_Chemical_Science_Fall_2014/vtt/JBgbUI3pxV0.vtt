00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:27.240
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.950
So moving to today's
handout, this

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.840
is one of my favorite
parts of the course.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.500
Honestly, when I first
started teaching 5.111,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.430
I said transition metals
are rarely covered

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.080
in the intro chemistry courses.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.810
Is it really necessary
to cover it here?

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.940
And I was told it
absolutely was.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.110
It's one of the reasons
that a 5 on the AP exam

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.450
is not good enough, that you
have to take the Advanced

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.440
Standing exam.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.690
Because the people who
teach inorganic chemistry

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.750
found that people who
placed out of 5.111

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.220
didn't do as well
in their course

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.620
as people who took 5:111 here.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.570
So this is one of the reasons.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.250
And then I started
teaching it, and I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.590
realized this is
one of the-- even

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.200
though people haven't
seen it before

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.270
and sometimes will get a
little scare-- it's actually

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.500
one of the most fun units.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.720
So I absolutely love
it, and hopefully you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.729
will love it by the end.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.270
People are like, we
never covered it.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.270
Why are you covering it?

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.090
We're in chapter 16.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.960
It's fun.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.860
OK.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.140
So transition metals,
d-block metals,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.330
because they have
those d orbitals.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.720
Yes, we're going back to
talking about orbitals again.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.280
And they're called
transition metals

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.760
because you transition from
this part of the periodic table

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.140
with your, what
kind of orbitals?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.895
AUDIENCE: s.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:44.770
CATHERINE DRENNAN: s.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.950
To this part of your periodic
table with your, what kind of

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.440
orbitals?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.930
AUDIENCE: p.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.805
CATHERINE DRENNAN: p.

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:51.900
So they are the
transition metals,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.720
and they're often really
reactive and very cool.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.510
And many of them, since
we're on a biological theme,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.850
many of them are super
important in biology.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.100
And I have some of these
written down in your notes,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.140
but here they are up here.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.980
In the transition metals,
you have a lot of metals

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.139
that we could not live without.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.650
Iron carries oxygen to
our blood, very important,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.020
hemoglobin.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.940
We talked about cobalt just now.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.220
That is the metal
in vitamin B12.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.200
So we know why that's important.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.040
We have zinc everywhere.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.210
Nickel's important for
bacteria, not so much for us.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.650
But bacteria is
important for us,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.690
so therefore nickel's
important to us.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.480
So all of these are
really important.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.950
Also, this part of the periodic
table is a part of the table

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.160
that people love that want to
make pharmaceuticals or want

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.100
to make new kinds of
electrodes or batteries

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.450
or all sorts of things.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.080
There's a bunch that
are used as probes.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.470
We talked about imaging agents,
detecting cancer, and all sorts

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.970
of different things like that.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.680
Many of these transition
metals are used in those probes

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.590
and also in pharmaceuticals.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.770
And so this is sort
of a very rich part

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.740
of the periodic table,
where those d orbitals allow

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.810
for properties
that are incredibly

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.410
useful for our health and
for doing all sorts of stuff.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.360
So I love this part.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.470
Again, some of the biological--
global cycling of nitrogen.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.110
We talked about nitrogen
fixation, that triple bond.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.570
It's really hard to
break nitrogen apart,

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.130
but bacteria can do it.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.010
It does it using
transition metals.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.640
Fixing carbon,
hydrogenase, if you

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.740
want to make hydrogen fuel
cells that are more biological.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.980
Again, biology uses
transition metals in this.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.670
Making vitamins, making
deoxynucleotides, respiration,

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.260
photosynthesis, it's all
due to transition metals.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.760
All right.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.000
So we'll start with
just one example,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.790
or one of In Our
Own Words segment.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.250
And this focuses on
nickel, which is something

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.410
very important in bacteria.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.890
And this is actually an example
from a collaborative project

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.780
between my lab and course 6.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.280
And I know a lot
of you are thinking

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.560
about being course
6 majors, so I

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.560
thought I would tell you
about some research of Collin

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.390
Stultz, a course 6 professor.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.910
So he was doing some
computational analysis

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.040
on these proteins
that we're studying.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.579
So many of you at this
point in the semester

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.730
probably feel like you
might be getting an ulcer.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.579
But unless you have
H. pylori in your gut,

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.180
you probably are not
actually getting an ulcer.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.600
And you just take a little
B12, you'll feel a lot better.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.360
OK.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.650
So here's the video.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.316
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:28.316 --> 00:04:31.740
- My name is Sarah Bowman, and
I am a post-doctoral fellow

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.240
at MIT.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.930
I am working on
studying a protein

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.220
from Helicobacter pylori,
which is pathogenic bacteria.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.570
Its kind of ecological niche
is in mammalian stomachs.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.140
It's actually very difficult
to treat using antibiotics,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.480
because a lot of times
when you're given

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.900
antibiotics they're going
to actually be broken apart

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.050
by the acidity of the stomach
before they actually ever

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.980
get to killing the
Helicobacter pylori.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.050
Transition metals in
biological systems

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.120
are actually really important.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.850
They increase the
range of reactivity

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.020
that proteins and enzymes
are able to access.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.180
Nickel is a transition metal.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.000
I mean, it's a transition
metal that's actually fairly

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.300
rare in biological systems.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.380
So one of the big things that
H. pylori uses nickel for

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.440
is an enzyme called urease.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.700
Urease requires something like
24 nickel ions, which is a lot.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.680
Urease is one of
the proteins that

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.730
allows for a lot of buffering
capacity of the organism,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.180
of the H. pylori organism.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.170
The stomach pH is very
low, so pH 2-something.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.470
And this bacteria has to
swim through the stomach

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.820
and then colonize it.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.460
And you'd think that the stomach
would just break it apart

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.700
like it breaks apart your food.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.560
But in fact, the bacteria
itself has mechanisms in place

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.990
that allow it to
create buffers that

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.550
allow it to move
through the stomach

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.839
and live in the stomach.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.380
And one of those enzymes, and
it's really important for that,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.015
is urease.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.600
In humans, nickel, as
far as we can tell,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.560
is not essential
for any enzymes,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.000
whereas in Helicobacter
pylori, for instance, nickel

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.280
is an essential
transition metal.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.750
And so a really intriguing
thing to kind of think about

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:42.350
is just whether we could somehow
target the nickel requirement

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.220
in this organism and
in other bacteria that

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.660
would allow us to kill these
pathogenic bacteria while not

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.027
doing anything that would
be harmful to humans.

00:06:55.027 --> 00:06:55.610
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.350
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
So I like that video

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.600
partly because it brings back
acid-base and buffers, as well

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.760
as talking about
transition metals.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.650
And I love the bacteria
being attacked by the acid

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.080
and then making a buffer
and saving itself.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.770
It's awesome.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.780
OK.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.890
So one of the reasons why
these transition metals are

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.740
so powerful, they can
do so many things,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.890
is that they like
to form complexes,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:32.450
and they like to form complexes
with small molecules or ions.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.800
And those ions often will
have a lone pair of electrons,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.865
and the metal wants
that electron density.

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:42.140
It wants the benefit
of that lone pair.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.550
So when you have this
lone pair, the metal

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.380
will come in contact
with that lone pair,

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.470
and it'll make a very
happy, very happy metal.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.230
And we can think
about this interaction

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.510
here as the donor atoms
are called ligands.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.210
And now let's review something
we learned before about

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.738
whether this is a Lewis
acid or a Lewis base then.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.407
OK, 10 more seconds.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.039
That's right.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.940
So it's a Lewis base.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.909
So if we put this
up here, donor atoms

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.580
are called ligands,
which are Lewis bases,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.750
and the Lewis bases donate
the lone pair of electrons.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.250
And again, we can think about
the definition that we've been

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.120
more used to, where
a base is taking H .

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.570
It's accepting the
proton from the acid.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.960
But there, when it's taking
H , it's taking H without its

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.950
electrons.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.770
So it's actually donating its
loan pairs to form a bond.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.770
And then we can think
about Lewis acids.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.180
So the acceptor atoms, which
are our transition metals,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.320
are Lewis acids.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.150
They accept the lone pair.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.100
And when an acid that has
a proton on it loses H ,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.160
it is taking the
electrons with it,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.560
because H is leaving
without its electrons.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.810
So these definitions
work, but these are

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.430
sort of more broad definitions.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.790
So here, our metals, any
of our transition metals,

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.370
are going to be our
acceptors, our Lewis acids.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.810
And here are a bunch of ligands.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.530
We have water.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:39.470
We have NH3.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.600
We have CO.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.800
They have lone pairs.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.510
They can be donor atoms.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.290
And the ligands form
complexes with the metals.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.960
And the kind of
complexes-- they're

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.400
often called
coordination complexes,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.300
and that's a metal that's
surrounded by ligands.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.000
And here's a little example,
a metal in the middle,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.520
and it has the
ligands around it.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.850
So let's consider this
coordination complex now

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.410
and think about what this
picture is telling us.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.390
So we have our
coordination complex.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:14.770
We have cobalt in the middle,
and we have NH3 groups

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.750
as our donor ligands.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:21.810
And here this bracket indicates
the overall charge is plus 3.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.750
Again, the transition metal
is going to be the Lewis acid.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.680
It's going to be accepting
the lone pairs from the Lewis

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.250
bases, which are the
ligands, or the donor atoms.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.530
Now, we can think
about a new term

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.440
called "coordination number."

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.900
And that's simply
the number of ligands

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.950
that are bound to the metal.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:51.960
So a CN number of 6 would
indicate six ligands make up

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.120
what's called the
primary coordination

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.350
sphere, which is the things
that are bound directly

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.340
to the metal.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:05.250
So CN numbers for transition
metals range from 2 to 12,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.970
but 6 is probably
the most common.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.340
So before we think about the
shapes of these molecules,

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:17.220
let's just look at
the notation for this,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.730
so coordination
complex notation.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.690
So I would write this
structure up here

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.970
within brackets--
cobalt bracket NH3.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.820
You have parentheses around NH3.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.530
There's six of those.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.440
Another bracket here
with a plus 3 charge,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.850
indicating the
charge on everything,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.470
this whole structure.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.400
But often, coordination
complexes with a plus charge

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.310
will have counterions around.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.420
So there might be, say, three
chlorine minus ions around,

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.670
and so that could be
written like this,

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.150
or it could be
written like this.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.870
If you see Cl3 outside
of those brackets,

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.270
it means that
they're counterions.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.480
So if I looked at this, I'd
say NH3 is within the brackets.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.080
That means it's bound to the
cobalt. So that would tell you

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.720
there are six things bound to
the cobalt. The Cl is outside.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.310
That indicates
it's a counterion.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.730
There are three of them.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.630
So there are three counterions,
which then tells you

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.281
the charge must be plus 3.

00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:18.780
All right.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.170
So there is our notation.

00:12:23.281 --> 00:12:23.780
All right.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:28.190
So now we're back to
thinking about geometries.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.800
So this is one of the things
I love about this part.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.470
I feel like some
people in the course

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.790
are just like, new
topic, new topic.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.005
Oh, man, when is the new
material going to end?

00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:40.130
Well, you find you get
enough into chemistry,

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.790
and you start revisiting topics
you've already seen before.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.440
So this is great.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:45.940
All right.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.430
So coordination number 6.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.550
We haven't maybe heard
coordination number 6,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.010
but that's pretty
easy to remember.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.940
It's the number of atoms bound.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.552
What type of geometry is this?

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.241
You can just yell it out.

00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:04.740
Right.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.270
So that's octahedral geometry.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.640
Again, the solid
triangles coming out

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.670
indicate they're
coming out at you.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.041
Back dashes are going back,
and we have our axial.

00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:17.540
All right.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:23.607
So let's see how well you
remember CN 5 structures.

00:13:23.607 --> 00:13:25.190
And you can keep
this up here, and you

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.310
can tell me what the name
of those two geometries are.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.970
All right.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.800
Why don't you take
10 more seconds.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.710
And here are our structures
in real life down here.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.480
People are just like,
I want to put see-saw.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.170
No, no.

00:14:08.145 --> 00:14:10.195
That is the parent
geometry of see-saw,

00:14:10.195 --> 00:14:11.600
but not see-saw itself.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.200
OK.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.440
So we have the
trigonal bipyramidal

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.790
and the square pyramidal.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.810
So I'm holding up the
square pyramidal right now.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.220
And then we have the trigonal,
because it's trigonal

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.320
along here, bipyramidal.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.620
So it's sort of like
one pyramid here,

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.380
one pyramid there,
so bipyramidal.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.950
And if I took off one
and we had a lone pair,

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:41.580
then we would get our
friend the see-saw.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.130
OK.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.200
Next we have this.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.020
What's that one called?

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:49.910
AUDIENCE: Square.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.502
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Square--

00:14:51.502 --> 00:14:52.210
AUDIENCE: Planar.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.100
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Planar, yep.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.472
And this one?

00:14:58.472 --> 00:14:58.972
Tetrahedral.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:09.230
And now CN number of 3.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.592
What is this one?

00:15:10.592 --> 00:15:12.362
AUDIENCE: Trigonal--

00:15:12.362 --> 00:15:13.820
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Trigonal planar.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.110
It's in a plane kind
of, if I hold the bonds

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:20.580
and they don't fall off,
and it's kind of trigonal.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.120
And then what
about the last one?

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.997
AUDIENCE: Linear.

00:15:23.997 --> 00:15:25.080
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Linear.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.770
OK.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.350
And let's just run through and
think about the angles as well.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.320
With octahedral,
what are our angles?

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.580
AUDIENCE: 90.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.530
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 90.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.200
Trigonal bipyramidal?

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.670
AUDIENCE: 90 and 120.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.100
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 90
and 120, that's right.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:50.710
So we have one 120 around here,
and then the top parts were 90.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.160
OK.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.530
We have the square pyramidal.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.340
90.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.060
Square planar?

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.200
AUDIENCE: 90.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.220
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 90.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.090
Tetrahedral?

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.412
AUDIENCE: 109.7?

00:16:02.412 --> 00:16:04.590
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 109.5.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.465
Give credit for 0.7 too.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.930
That's quite close.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:08.940
Trigonal planar?

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.524
AUDIENCE: 120.

00:16:09.524 --> 00:16:10.481
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 120.

00:16:10.481 --> 00:16:11.170
And linear?

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:11.820
AUDIENCE: 180.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.260
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 180, right.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.779
So you're going to need to
remember these for this unit,

00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:19.320
but that's OK because you need
to remember them for the final

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:19.820
anyway.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.620
So it gives you a nice review.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.870
All right.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.770
So we got every one.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:28.940
We got them down.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.300
Can look up your old notes.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.670
Just review.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.730
All right.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.560
So coordination complexes
also have another name.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.620
They can be called chelates.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.110
Just another name for
coordination complex.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.990
So chelates can be the thing.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.880
But you can also
say that the ligand

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.310
will chelate as
another way of saying

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.060
that it will bind to a metal.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.730
And it can bind more than
once with one or more sites

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:54.990
of attachment.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.570
And the word "chelate"
comes from claws,

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:58.650
and I like that picture.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.300
I feel like, yes, these
ligands coming in like claws

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.850
and binding that metal.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.230
They're chelating that metal.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.720
So there are different
names depending

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.960
on how many points of
attachment they have.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.960
And we have what's
known as monodentate--

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.510
"dent" for dentist or tooth.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:23.130
So that's one point
of attachment.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.819
And I bet that without having
seen this material ever

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.490
before you can tell me
what the rest of these are.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.320
What do you think
bidentate means?

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.280
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.330
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Two.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.350
Tridentate?

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.747
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:17:35.747 --> 00:17:37.080
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Tetradentate?

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.329
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:17:38.329 --> 00:17:39.620
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Hexadentate?

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.180
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.429
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Six, right.

00:17:41.429 --> 00:17:42.490
There's not one for five.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.450
But this is good.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:44.912
So don't lose a point on this.

00:17:44.912 --> 00:17:46.620
I feel like sometimes
people lose a point

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.950
on this on the exam.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.800
You knew it in class
before I taught it.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.790
You don't want to like
somehow work backwards.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.330
So this is easy
points right here.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.190
Just remember on the
exam, wait a minute,

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.171
maybe I already know this.

00:17:59.171 --> 00:17:59.670
All right.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.870
So let's look at some
examples of chelating

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.560
ligands that bind with
multiple points of attachment.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.480
And the first one--
we're kind of on a theme

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.020
today-- is vitamin B12 that
we're going to look at.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.940
So this is called
the corrin ring.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.300
Cobalt is in the
middle, and that ring

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.050
binds with four
points of attachment.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.430
So it is a tetradentate
ligand, this corrin ring.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.950
There is also an
upper ligand, which

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.460
is 5 prime-deoxyadenosine,
and a lower ligand that's

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.320
called dimethylbenzimidazole.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.850
You don't need to
know their names.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.470
Overall, it has six ligands
in octahedral geometry.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.920
But the corrin ring is a
very nice biological example

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.590
of a multidentate ligand.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.050
Heme would be the same.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.780
I thought I would show you
this rotating around so you

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.780
get a better sense and tell
you that this structure

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.650
of this vitamin was determined
by Dorothy Hodgkin, who

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.950
won the Nobel Prize in
1964 for determining

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.350
the structure by
crystallography and also solving

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.990
the structure of penicillin.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.810
This was the most
complicated molecule

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.450
to be solved by crystallography,
and a lot of people

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.040
said that technique
could never be

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.720
used to do something that big.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.760
She showed that they were wrong.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.070
In terms of determining the
structure of penicillin,

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.860
it was during the war.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.110
And people wanted to
make more penicillin,

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.270
but they had no idea what
the structure was so they

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.704
didn't know what to make.

00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:33.120
And she figured
out the structure.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.536
And it's a
weird-looking molecule,

00:19:34.536 --> 00:19:37.380
so no one would have guessed it
without knowing the structure.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.650
So for her pioneering
work in crystallography

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.730
she won the Nobel Prize.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.250
All right.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:49.140
So vitamin B12 is one
example of a chelate.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.830
Another that's probably more
that you probably hear about

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.850
the most-- it's almost
synonymous with the word

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.480
"chelate"-- is EDTA.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.560
Here is the EDTA
molecule, and you

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.070
see that it has
lots of lone pairs

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.910
that are just dying
to grab onto a metal.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.010
So we have six.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:15.120
We have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, six things

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.140
that are capable of
chelating that metal.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.990
And so here is what
the complex looks like.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.170
So the red oxygen can chelate.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.430
The green oxygen
here can chelate,

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.835
the nitrogen here in dark
blue, the other nitrogen

00:20:29.835 --> 00:20:34.530
in dark blue here, light
blue oxygen here, and also

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:38.310
the purple oxygen.
So now why don't you

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.860
tell me what the
geometry of this

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.560
would be as a clicker question.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:53.957
You ready?

00:20:53.957 --> 00:20:54.582
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:54.582 --> 00:20:54.960
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.210
10 more seconds.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.560
Should be fast hopefully.

00:21:09.804 --> 00:21:12.660
Yeah, great, 86%.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.400
It is octahedral.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.800
And sometimes it's a little
bit hard to see that,

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.690
but I helped you out by
drawing those bonds in black

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.390
that you needed to look at.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.990
So we have four that are in
the plane here, one above

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.140
and one below here.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.820
So that is octahedral geometry.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.580
Also, how many
points of attachment?

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.410
What kind of dentate
ligand is this?

00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:39.190
It's hexadentate as well.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:44.361
So it has six points
of attachment here.

00:21:44.361 --> 00:21:44.860
All right.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.480
So EDTA is a really
good metal chelator.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.040
And part of the reason that
it is such an awesome metal

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.110
chelator is because of entropy.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.100
So we're back to entropy again.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:04.630
So the binding of EDTA to the
metal is entropically favored.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.240
And the reason for this is
that metals that are, say,

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.500
in your body, like if you
happen to eat some lead paint,

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.540
and that lead is hanging out.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.800
It's not just by itself.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.640
It's coordinating hopefully
just to water and not

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.670
to proteins in your body.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:25.180
But when you take some EDTA to
prevent your lead poisoning,

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.900
one molecule of EDTA
will bind to metal,

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.760
and all of these waters
are going to be released.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.240
So I have over here some
lead with a whole bunch

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.935
of little waters.

00:22:35.935 --> 00:22:39.650
This is quite an ordered system.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:45.870
But if I take out all
of those waters here,

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.220
that's a lot more entropy
going on than what we had.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.380
And then you have one
chelating ligand here,

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.460
and that's a pretty
simple system.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.770
So this is ordered.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.300
This is disordered.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:04.067
So the binding of EDTA, one EDTA
releases six water molecules,

00:23:04.067 --> 00:23:11.300
and that makes it very
favorable to do this.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.230
And because of that,
chelating molecules,

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.680
or the chelate effect,
molecules that are chelates,

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.200
like metal bound to EDTA,
are unusually stable

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.540
because of this favorable
entropic effect,

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.220
this release of water.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.730
So the release of water, the
release of increasing entropy,

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.620
drives that metal chelation,
and you sequester your metal,

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.050
which is really good if you're
trying to avoid lead poisoning.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:40.090
So I think this is a nice
example of our friend entropy

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:41.630
driving a reaction.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.350
So a lot of you did really
well on the exam talking about

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.770
factors of delta H and entropy
and when you'd have favorable

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:48.730
delta G's.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.560
Here's another
nice example where

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.700
the chelate effect explains why
metal chelates are so unusually

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.200
stable.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.070
All right.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.690
So uses of EDTA.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.300
I already just told you one.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.860
Lead poisoning-- all ambulances
have EDTA in case someone

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.910
is eating some lead paint.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.820
Another thing that EDTA is
used for, which I think is fun,

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.030
you should all go check if
you buy little packaged goods,

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.460
and they have a long list
of chemical ingredients.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.600
Look for EDTA.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.680
It's often there.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.790
And it says it's "added
for freshness," which means

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.120
that bacteria need metals.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.840
You have EDTA.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.600
EDTA sequesters the metals.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.850
The bacteria can't live on
the food that you're eating.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.660
So instead of
saying, food additive

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.870
added to kill the bacteria
that were otherwise growing

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.220
on your food, they say
added for freshness.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.240
And I do think that
is an improvement.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.740
All right.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.230
Another thing, we've already
talked about the importance

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.300
of cleaning bathtubs.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.650
To chelate calcium
out of bathtub scum,

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.650
you have EDTA or
other metal chelates.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:25:00.040
And then I have my
favorite other example

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.950
of the use of EDTA.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:09.730
This favorite example is in
Hollywood, the movie Blade.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.830
How do you kill a vampire?

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.033
Vampires drink what?

00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:14.840
AUDIENCE: Blood.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.881
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Blood.

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:16.660
Blood has?

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.530
AUDIENCE: Iron.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.000
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Iron.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.740
EDTA chelates?

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.630
AUDIENCE: Iron.

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:22.950
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Iron.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:25.330
So you get a little
dart, and you

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.940
have-- you can kind of see
them maybe up here-- they're

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.830
filled with liquid.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.750
That's EDTA.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:37.030
You shoot the vampire with
EDTA, and the vampire just

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.635
disappears, just kind of
turns to sort of dust.

00:25:39.635 --> 00:25:41.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.720
Because it's like mostly iron,
and the iron gets chelated.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.267
But it happens right away.

00:25:45.267 --> 00:25:46.600
But anyway, I think that's cool.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.540
Yes, what a good way
to kill a vampire.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.310
EDTA, it's brilliant.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.450
Excellent use on
Hollywood's part for EDTA.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:55.950
OK.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.740
Metal chelates, all
sorts of potential values

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.300
that they have.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.220
OK.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.220
So when we're talking about
coordination complexes,

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.320
we're talking about geometries.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.260
Sometimes the atoms can be
arranged in different ways.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:18.450
And when you have these
geometric isomers,

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.490
they can have very
different properties.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.560
So just look at an example here.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.340
It's a platinum compound,
a platinum compound

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.600
who has two NH2 groups
and two chlorine groups.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.880
And you could arrange those
in two different ways.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.470
You could put the NH3 groups
on one side and the chlorine

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.230
groups on the other side,
and that would be cis.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.520
These are cis to each other.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.210
Or you could put a
transconfiguration, where

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.430
chlorine is here, and
then another chlorine

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.070
is trans on the other side.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.080
And the same with this.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.340
So cisplatinum here is a
potent anti-cancer drug.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.860
And it has to be cisplatinum
because it binds to DNA,

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.800
and the two bases of DNA
displace these chlorines.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.790
So if they're not on the same
side, it can't bind to the DNA.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.840
And so this prevents
the cancer cells

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.330
from being repaired
from damaging agents.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.670
Transplatinum does absolutely
nothing that anyone knows.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.020
So it's exactly the
same composition,

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.370
but because they are different
isomers from each other--

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:31.830
and I have, let's see, ah,
over here-- different isomers

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.460
of each other-- and so
chlorines on the same side,

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.880
cis versus the trans--
have completely different

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.150
properties.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.440
So cisplatinum got a lot
of fame because it cured

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.450
Lance Armstrong of cancer.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.390
Lance Armstrong now, of course,
is a much more controversial

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.880
figure than he was at the time.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.580
But still he created
an amazing charity

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.840
that hopefully is still doing
well despite some of his fall

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.280
from fame.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:27:59.970
OK.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:04.470
So another type of
isomer are called

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:09.300
optical isomers, also
called enantiomers or chiral

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.800
molecules.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.690
And these are one, again, you
have the same composition,

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.520
but they are non-superimposable.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.080
They are, in fact, mirror
images of each other.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.020
So if my head was
a mirror, these

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.460
would be mirror
images of each other.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.810
And I could try very
hard to superimpose them,

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.180
bringing the blue
molecules over here,

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.820
but then the green and
the red don't match.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.230
You can come and try.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.170
These are, in fact,
non-superimposable mirror

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.910
images from each other.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.540
And sometimes they can have
very similar properties.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.200
It depends.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.450
But if you put
molecules like that that

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.680
are known as chiral,
chiral molecules,

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.630
i.e. enantiomers--
non-superimposable mirror

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:52.840
images.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.170
The human body is very much
of a chiral environment.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.180
You have enzymes
designed to bind things

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.920
in a particular way.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.950
So they can have very,
very different properties.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:02.610
OK.

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:08.950
So we have to do some d-electron
counting before we end today.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:13.020
And I love this because
it's really pretty simple

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.940
to count d-electrons.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.390
And so we're going to just
take a look at some examples.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.640
And for doing this
part, we're going

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:26.430
to start using our friend
the periodic table again.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:30.510
And we need to find oxidation
numbers, which we just

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.540
talked about in the last unit.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.050
So if we have a coordination
complex with cobalt,

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:44.580
and this cobalt has those
six NH3 groups and our plus 3

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.550
charge-- so this is the complex
that we have been talking

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:51.660
about-- let's now figure
out what the oxidation

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.550
number of this is.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:59.490
And so this NH3 is neutral,
so that's given as a hint.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:04.350
Many of our ligands are
going to be neutral ligands.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:09.000
So if that is 0, what is
the charge on the cobalt?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.350
AUDIENCE: Plus 3.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.240
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Plus 3.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.370
Now we're going to use
the rules of d-count.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.560
So we have a d-count.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:25.060
We need to look up the group
number from the periodic table,

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.660
which, in this case, is 9.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:34.770
Then we have minus the oxidation
number, so we have 9 minus 3,

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:36.120
or 6.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.900
And so this is a d6 system.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:44.280
And that is all there is
to doing these counts.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.640
So let's just try another one.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.620
So we heard about nickel.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.530
We'll do nickel.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:56.130
Nickel is coordinated
by carbon monoxide,

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.150
and there are four of those.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:04.140
So what is my charge on
the nickel going to be,

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.420
my oxidation number
of the nickel?

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.156
So what's my overall
charge of this complex?

00:31:09.156 --> 00:31:09.870
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.700
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 0.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.300
CO is also going to be 0.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.310
There's no charge on CO.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.230
So what is the oxidation
number of nickel?

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.730
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.680
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 0.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.212
So then we can do our d-count.

00:31:26.212 --> 00:31:30.316
The d-count, what is the
group number for nickel?

00:31:30.316 --> 00:31:31.250
AUDIENCE: 10.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:31.920
CATHERINE DRENNAN: What is it?

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.461
AUDIENCE: 10.

00:31:32.461 --> 00:31:34.770
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 10.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.680
This is the kind of math that
always makes me very happy.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.540
10 minus 0 is 10.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:46.621
So that is a d10 system.

00:31:46.621 --> 00:31:47.120
All right.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.286
We'll do one more over here.

00:31:48.286 --> 00:31:50.350
And the next one is
a clicker question.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:24.837
Gives me time to write

00:32:24.837 --> 00:32:26.170
AUDIENCE: Whenever you're ready.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:27.120
We're out of time.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:27.600
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yep.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.150
All right.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.730
Let's just do 10 more seconds.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.360
Yep.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.620
So here our overall
charge is minus 1.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:54.310
We have the chlorines
are minus 1.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.220
NH3 is 0.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.560
Water is 0.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:05.040
So this has to be plus 2 because
plus 2 minus 3 is minus 1.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:14.120
We have 9 minus 2 is
7, so it's a d7 system.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:14.850
All right.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:18.510
So Wednesday, d orbitals.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.260
I cannot wait.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.060
Yes.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.040
All right, 10 seconds.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:51.500
OK.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:56.153
Does someone want to tell me
why that's the right answer?

00:34:02.225 --> 00:34:02.725
Anybody?

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:13.121
We got a nice dangly
thing for your keys or ID.

00:34:13.121 --> 00:34:13.621
No?

00:34:16.513 --> 00:34:19.600
All right.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.000
So here we're thinking about
whether things are better

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.780
reducing agents or
better oxidizing agents.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.960
And here we're given two
different redox potentials--

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.460
minus 600 and minus 300.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:38.620
So the one that is going
to be the lower number

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.780
is going to be better at
reducing other things.

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.340
It wants to be oxidized itself.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.159
And then we can think
about whether it's

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:53.320
a favorable process in terms
of whether the thing that

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.469
likes to reduce is actually
doing the reducing.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:59.271
That's going to make it
a spontaneous process.

00:34:59.271 --> 00:34:59.770
All right.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:03.070
So these are the
kinds of questions

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:06.550
for the oxidation-reduction
unit that we just finished.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:10.660
And this will be on exam 4,
which, amazingly, we just

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.150
finished an exam, and
there's another one.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:17.790
So exam 4 is two
weeks from today.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:18.880
All right.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.440
From Friday, sorry,
two weeks from Friday.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:21.940
All right.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.640
So today we're going to continue
with this unit on transition

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.240
metals.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.970
The next exam is going to
have oxidation-reduction

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.280
and transition metals and
a little bit of kinetics.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.454
Kinetics is our last unit.

00:35:31.454 --> 00:35:33.745
So we're getting very close
to the end of the semester.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.860
So we're finishing up the
handout from last time.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.180
Again, we're back to
the periodic table.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.000
We're thinking about
transition metals.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.660
We're thinking about that middle
part of the periodic table,

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.505
and so we're thinking
about d orbitals.

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.990
So there are five d orbitals.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.317
How many s orbitals are there?

00:35:58.317 --> 00:35:58.900
AUDIENCE: One.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:35:59.858
CATHERINE DRENNAN: One.

00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:01.140
How many p orbitals are there?

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.680
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.721
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Three.

00:36:02.721 --> 00:36:04.649
And so d orbitals have five.

00:36:04.649 --> 00:36:06.690
And we're not going to
talk about really anything

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.340
beyond d orbitals in this class.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.740
And frankly, not
very many people do.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.300
But d orbitals are amazing,
so we have to fit them in.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:13.800
All right.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.870
So there are five d orbitals.

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:18.630
And they're up
here, and you need

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.820
to be able to draw their shapes.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.420
And the bar for drawing the
shapes is actually pretty low.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.900
So these are my
drawings that I made.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.351
And so you can probably
do just about as well.

00:36:32.351 --> 00:36:32.850
All right.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.930
So the one that has
the most unusual shape

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:40.590
is the dz squared.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:44.740
And so it has its maximum
amplitude along the z-axis.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.980
And for this unit,
our z-axis is always

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.080
going to be up and down here.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.790
y is in the plane of the screen,
and x is coming out toward you

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:55.560
and also going into the screen.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:00.300
And so dz squared has its
maximum amplitude along z,

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:05.610
and it also has a
doughnut in the xy-plane.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.180
And so I also brought
a little model of this.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.310
So here's dz squared.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:16.540
We have maximum amplitude
along the z-axis, up and down.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:22.050
And we have our little
doughnut in our xy-plane.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:25.950
So then we have dx squared
minus y squared, which

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:31.590
has maximum amplitude
along x and along y.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:35.100
And that would look like this.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.620
So we have our
maximum amplitudes

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.340
that are right on axis.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:43.530
So if this is y-axis and x
is coming out toward you,

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.680
those orbitals are
pointing right along

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.320
that coordinate frame.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.020
The other three orbitals
look a little bit

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:57.120
like dx squared minus y squared,
but they're not on-axis.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.170
They're off-axis.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.570
They're in between the axes.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.120
So we have dyz.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.740
It has its maximum
amplitude 45 degrees off

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.650
of the y and the z-axis.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.490
So if this is
z-axis here, there's

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.840
no maximum amplitude along here.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.300
It's 45 degrees off.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:24.540
So it's right in the middle
between the z and the y.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:33.870
So dxz has its maximum amplitude
45 degrees between x and z.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.110
So that would be
pointing the other way.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:39.990
And so I tried to
draw this keeping

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:42.330
the reference frame the same.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.040
It's a little hard
to see the orbitals,

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.570
but it would be kind of this.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:48.690
So we rotate that
around, and so that's

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.220
what that would look like.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:56.340
And then dxy we have maximum
amplitude 45 degrees in

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.880
between the x and the y.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.790
So x coming out, y in the plane.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.100
And so this is, again, a
little bit hard to draw.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.530
If I drew it absolutely
perfectly and not tilted

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:09.630
at all, you kind of
wouldn't see anything.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.130
But that's what that
would look like.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.130
So again, the names
of this, it tells you

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:17.910
about the relationship
between that orbital,

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:23.730
that maximum amplitude, and
the axis that we have defined.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:27.510
So this is very
important to know

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:30.660
that these guys are in
between the axes, right

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.430
in the middle, 45 degrees.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.150
And you'll see why in a few
minutes why that's important.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.840
OK.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:41.670
So just to practice, here are
some slightly better pictures

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:42.960
of the orbitals.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:48.010
And this is the coordinate
frame over here,

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.800
and now we have the
orbitals inside that.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.680
So again, z is going up, y is
in the plane of the screen,

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.860
and x is going back and
also coming out toward us.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.540
So which is this d orbital?

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.006
You can just yell it out.

00:40:03.006 --> 00:40:03.880
AUDIENCE: dz squared.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.796
CATHERINE DRENNAN: dz.

00:40:04.796 --> 00:40:06.360
Yeah, that's easy to remember.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.120
That's the unique-looking one.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.430
What about this one?

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:13.110
First think about the plane.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.300
So it's the xy-plane.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.160
And then, is it on or off-axis?

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.166
So which one is this?

00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:19.311
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:19.311 --> 00:40:20.310
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:21.750
So this one is on-axis.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.940
You can see the
maximum amplitude

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.810
of the orbital pointing
right along those axes.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:31.170
So it's right in the corners
of that square there.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.515
And then what about
this one down here?

00:40:33.515 --> 00:40:34.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:35.550
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yep.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.230
So that would be dxy.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:41.605
So it's in the xy-plane, but
it's 45 degrees off the axes.

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:44.730
So it's in between
the axes here.

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.222
And what about that one?

00:40:46.222 --> 00:40:47.699
AUDIENCE: .

00:40:47.699 --> 00:40:48.740
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Right.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:55.260
So it's along both z and y here.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.240
And then this last
one, which is drawn

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.770
to kind of come out toward you,
so that is along x as well.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:05.754
So that's dxz, and
it's going up along z.

00:41:05.754 --> 00:41:07.920
So you can look at the
coordinate frame, which we'll

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.610
try to keep consistent,
and ask yourself,

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:14.700
is it on-axis or off-axis,
and which plane is it in?

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:19.230
And that will allow you to name
them and also to draw them.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:23.180
So just to kind of give you more
of a three-dimensional sense,

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.420
there's these little movies
that I'll show you now.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.581
And so you can get a better
sense of that awesome doughnut.

00:41:29.581 --> 00:41:30.830
It's going to make you hungry.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.410
They even colored it like a
really nice original doughnut

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.090
that you would get
at Dunkin' Donuts.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:42.240
So the doughnut is
in the xy-plane,

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.220
and these other
lobes are along z.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:51.570
So now we have dx
squared minus y squared,

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:54.900
and you can see that the
maximum amplitudes, again,

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.350
are along the axes.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:59.910
Key-- they're along
the axes here.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.650
I don't know why it
comes out towards you

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:03.720
and-- I didn't, yeah.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.810
But it gives you a good
three-dimensional sense

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:07.991
of this.

00:42:07.991 --> 00:42:08.490
All right.

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:13.470
So dxy now, again,
in the xy-plane.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.920
But instead of being on-axis,
it's 45 degrees off-axis.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.750
So you can see, I think,
in this really nicely,

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:23.610
it's right between the axes,
but it's not touching them.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.232
The axes sort of
separate these orbitals.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:33.000
And then we have xz.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.380
So now we're going up along
the z-axis and in the x-plane.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:44.730
And here it comes at you again,
45 degrees in between z and x.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:51.850
And then our last
one, we have yz.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.230
So the shapes of
those later three,

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.780
actually even four of
them, are the same.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.910
It's just a matter if
they're on or off-axis

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.620
and which plane they're in.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.211
So this is not too hard to draw.

00:43:06.211 --> 00:43:06.710
All right.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.460
So why is this important?

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:13.220
Why should we care exactly
how the orbitals are oriented?

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.860
And the reason that you
should care about that

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.550
is because it can explain a
lot of the special properties

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:21.760
of transition metals.
