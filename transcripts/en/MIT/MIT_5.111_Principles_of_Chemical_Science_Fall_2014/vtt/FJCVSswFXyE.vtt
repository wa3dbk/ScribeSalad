00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.020
PROFESSOR: So
collective knowledge

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.490
got us a bunch more points.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.230
So the rules for
significant figures

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.290
are on the back page of
the handout from Friday.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.430
And so we want to think
about how many are

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.692
after the decimal point here.

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:46.150
So there are three after the
decimal point, which gives you

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.470
three here in your answer.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.200
Log significant
figure rules-- yes.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.700
So in base, and some in
chemical equilibrium, which

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.900
are all kind of
the same thing, you

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:06.080
can have subtraction and
addition, then multiplication

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.000
and division, and
then end your answer

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.130
with logs-- three significant
figure rolls in one problem.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.450
Yes, it's coming.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.370
So you want to get those
get those rolls down.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.750
OK, so today we're going
to talk about solubility.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.610
And this is really a direct kind
of growth out of thermodynamics

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.110
and chemical equilibrium.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.820
You're going to be seeing
a lot of the same ideas

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.220
in solubility.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.850
And then at the end
of the class we're

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.933
going to start acid-bases.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.740
So far, we have been discussing
mostly pure substances,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.340
and that is all
changing right now.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.200
Because most substances
are actually mixtures.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.710
So most of the time, you have
two things mixed together.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.900
So mixtures-- you have
a homogeneous mixture

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.260
of something, something's
dissolved in something else,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.970
and a solution is a
homogeneous mixture.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.260
And so in your solution
you have a solvent,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.040
which is the thing that is
dissolving the other thing,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.770
and the other thing
is the solute.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.670
So the solute is any dissolved
substance in a solution,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.170
and the solvent is the substance
that does the dissolving.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.520
And water is a great solvent.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.160
One of the most common
solvents is water.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.260
So when you have your
solute in your solvent

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.040
and it's nicely dissolved,
then you have a solution.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.860
So let's look at
examples of things

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.750
that dissolve in other
things, and first we're

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.660
going to talk about
NaCl, common table salt,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.720
dissolving in water.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.780
So any NaCl is held
together by an ionic bond

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.650
and it forms crystals
where you have

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.230
these beautiful arrangement
of our sodium plus

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.670
and our Cl minus.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.480
And a polar solvent, like
water, will, what's called,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.060
hydrate the ions and pry
them away from the surface.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.940
So if we look at this picture,
and we have our sodium

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.130
and our chloride surrounded
in our salt crystal,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.440
we have water, which
is red with those two

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.360
little white dots, which are
the hydrogens on the water.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.620
And so we have our bent geometry
for our polar water molecule.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.060
And the water is coming in,
and it's hydrating the ions.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.570
And so here, you see the
edge of the salt crystal,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.650
and now the water is kind of
pulling one of the ions apart.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.280
And here you see the ions are
coming out of the salt crystal

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.790
and dissolving in your solution.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.130
So a polar solvent
like water can just

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.830
pry that crystal apart.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.770
So stirring can speed
up this process.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.070
It doesn't often
change the properties.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.610
It doesn't make
things more soluble.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.860
But it will speed it up,
because if you stir it,

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.490
you're going to get
more of that water

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.830
having access to the edges
of the salt crystals,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.160
and helping to pry apart and
hydrate those ions so that they

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.470
solubilize.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.550
We have an equilibrium
expression for solubility,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.230
so we're just
following right along

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.840
with chemical equilibrium.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.780
And so we have our solid NaCl
going to our hydrated ions,

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.870
our Na plus, that was pulled
out by water, and our CL minus.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.160
And this in here,
it says aqueous,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.690
abbreviation for aqueous, so
we have our dissolved ions.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.580
That's how we would
interpret that.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.980
And S here as for solid.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.290
So we've also not
paid much attention

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.540
to phase of things at
this point-- a little bit

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.710
when we were talking
about increasing entropy.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.760
We were talking about gases
going to liquids and solids,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.820
and vice versa, and predicting
the change in entropy

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.190
for those processes.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.940
But now we're going
to spend a lot of time

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.150
paying attention to the phase.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.070
And so solubility, something
solid, going to its aqueous

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.470
ions.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.500
So we can write an equilibrium
expression for this.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.270
And it has a special
name-- KSP, SP

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.840
stands for Solubility Product.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.520
And so KSP would be equal to
the concentration of sodium ions

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.780
and the concentration times the
concentration of chloride ions.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.290
And equilibrium constants
are products over reactants.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.070
We don't have our
reactant in this equation

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.400
because it is a solid.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.980
So it doesn't appear in
the equilibrium expression.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.070
So our equilibrium
expression, which

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.290
here has the set
special name of KSP,

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.280
is just those ions in
solution, the concentration

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.220
of each ion times each other.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.290
All right, so let's
have a little practice

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.400
with writing KSPs.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.720
And so we have a clicker
question on that.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.800
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.480
Great.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.650
Yup, so again, we
don't want to have

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.230
the solid in the
expression, and we

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.910
need to remember
the stoichiometry,

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.580
always need to remember
the stoichiometry.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:53.110
OK, so they're
solubility product.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.910
OK, so now let's think about
something that is not ionic.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.226
Let's think about glucose.

00:07:00.226 --> 00:07:01.600
We've talked a
lot about glucose.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.860
Let's think about glucose
dissolving in water.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.890
And here I have a
picture of two beakers,

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.340
a beaker where it's
clear, and a beaker

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.060
where there's a lot of
glucose sitting on the bottom.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.530
And so we can think about
the solubility here.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.140
So how can this dissolve?

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.460
It can't form ions.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.870
It's not made up of ions
like sodium chloride.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.310
So how does it dissolve?

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.840
Well, it can dissolve,
again, water molecules--

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.840
water's amazing-- water
molecules form hydrogen

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.740
bonds with the glucose and pull
one of the glucose molecules

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.360
that is at the edge of the
solid piece of glucose,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.060
pulls it out into solution
by hydrogen bonding to it.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.790
So again, it's
solubilizing the glucose

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.500
that's in this solid form by
interacting at the surface

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.080
and prying layers
of glucose molecules

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.890
off by hydrogen bonding to them.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.310
Luckily, you know all
about hydrogen bonds,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.280
so just to do a little clicker
practice, why don't you tell me

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.760
what kind of hydrogen
bonds glucose

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.470
is capable of forming if it is,
in fact, capable of forming.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.895
But I kind of gave away
one of the answers here.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:33.009
10 more seconds.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.980
All right, good.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.320
Zero put four.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.490
That's awesome.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.520
You were listening
to what I was saying.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.640
Yes, so that is correct.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.300
And if we look back at the
molecule for a minute--

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:06.490
so it's a hydrogen bond donor
because of these OH groups

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.040
all along here.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.450
And so OH, there's an
electron negativity difference

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.990
of greater than 0.4, so it's
capable of being a hydrogen

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.190
bond donor.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.490
But this double
bonded O here, it's

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.010
not a complete Lewis structure.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.930
It's missing its lone pairs.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.010
But it has lone
pairs on that oxygen,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.760
and that could be a
hydrogen bond acceptor.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.370
So we have hydrogen bond donors
and hydrogen bond acceptors

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.460
in this molecule, and water
can also be a hydrogen bond

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.820
donor and acceptor.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.340
It has two hydrogens that
can form hydrogen bond.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.620
It also has to lone pairs,
which gives it its bent shape.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.530
So it can be a
donor and acceptor.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.210
So it's capable of
interacting with glucose

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:53.110
and pulling that solid
glucose into solution.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.580
So if we look at
these two pictures,

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.030
this could be glucose
[INAUDIBLE] in solution.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.230
You can't see any glucose, but
here you see a level of glucose

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.630
at the bottom.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.810
And a solution is
considered saturated

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.760
when all of the solvent has
dissolved as much as it can,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.650
but a little bit of
undissolved solute remains.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:17.080
So this over saturated.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.380
Often it's just saturated when
you have just a little bit more

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.430
than can be dissolved.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.370
You've gone past that point.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.800
You can't get any more dissolved
in that volume of water.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.540
This has a pretty large excess.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.900
So sometimes when you
get your solution,

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.530
you get your solution clear,
your glucose has dissolved

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.820
or whatever it is you're
working on has dissolved,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.980
and then you maybe add
a little bit too much,

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.960
and it all crashes
out of solution again,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.220
you have the precipitant
just coming out.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.350
So undissolved
solute, another name

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.640
for that, the name that's used
more often, is precipitate.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.980
So it precipitates
out of solution

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.930
if it has too much in it.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.490
So if you are not
part of the solution,

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.855
you are part of the precipitate.

00:11:04.472 --> 00:11:05.222
That's my t-shirt.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.340
OK, so dissolved and
undissolved solute-- they're not

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.460
doing nothing.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.010
They're in dynamic equilibrium.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.790
Just like all other kind
of chemical equilibrium,

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.672
there is no net change,
but the process is still

00:11:21.672 --> 00:11:22.630
going forward and back.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.660
In fact, the rate
going forward is

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.390
equal to the rate going back.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.790
The same is true here.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.790
The dissolved and
undissolved solute

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.580
are in dynamic equilibrium
with each other.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.640
So how much can
you get in there?

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.420
How much solute can you
get into your solvent?

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.560
And that depends on the
particular substance

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.000
and its molar solubility.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.970
And molar solubility is
defined as S. Either little s

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.760
or a big S. I've seen it
both ways in textbooks.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.040
So the molar solubility, S,
is the molar concentration

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.280
in that saturated
solution, where

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.630
you've put just a
little more in than can

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.670
be completely dissolved.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.210
And so that represents
the limit of the ability

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:14.180
of that solvent to dissolve
that solute, that particular

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.450
compound.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.840
And its units are, perhaps
unsurprisingly given its name,

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.470
is molar, moles per liter.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:31.220
So molar solubility is
related to our friend KSP,

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:37.310
but it's not the same thing,
or at least most of the time.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.830
I think none of the
time exactly the same.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.830
So when you're talking about the
molar solubility of either ion,

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.350
you're talking about that
concentration of sodium plus

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.960
or chlorine minus.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.300
So you're talking about
the moles per liter

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.120
that can be dissolved in that
particular amount of solvent

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.350
or kind of solvent.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.380
And so those concentrations
are the molar solubility.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.210
And again, our
KSP is going to be

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:06.580
equal to the concentration
of the sodium in solution

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.850
and the concentration of that
chloride that's dissolved.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.020
So in this case,
the relationship

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.610
is that KSP would equal the
molar solubility squared,

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.570
the molar solubility
of this times the molar

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.420
solubility of that.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.330
So if you know one, you
can derive the other,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.530
and you can do that on a
problem set, in particular.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.610
So those are the
definitions of those terms.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.740
So molar solubility,
how much of something

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.480
dissolves in another,
whether it dissolves it all

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.350
will depend on, again,
the nature of the material

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.800
and the nature of the solvent.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.830
Are they miscible?

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.740
Is there a way, like
water, getting in there

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.420
and forming hydrogen
bonds, for example.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.890
And this leads to a rule that
a lot of people tend to know,

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.560
which is like
dissolves like rule.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.690
So if it's a
non-ionic substance,

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.580
then you need to pull it out of
the solid by hydrogen bonding,

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.810
if that material has
nothing to hydrogen bond

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.970
to, if it's
completely non-polar,

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.550
water is not going to be
able to solubilize it.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.700
So polar things, polar
liquids like water,

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.890
are generally the best solvents
for things that are ionic,

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.950
like salts, or polar compounds.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.670
So it doesn't have
to be a salt. It

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.160
can be a compound
made of carbon,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.680
but it needs to be
a polar compound

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.200
so that the water
can get in there

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.790
and form those hydrogen bonds.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.730
So you can see that knowing what
is capable of forming hydrogen

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.750
bonds can be really
useful to think

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.260
about what's going
to be dissolved

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.890
in what other type of material.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:46.890
So non-polar liquids,
like hexane, for example,

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.650
are better for non-polar.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.250
So non-polar like
dissolves likes.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.240
And so that's why people
go to dry cleaners,

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.536
because you don't want to use
water to wash certain things.

00:14:59.536 --> 00:15:00.940
You want to be dry.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.930
You want to get your
non-polar stains out.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.410
So this is very important.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:11.250
There's a number of applications
of these principles.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.890
This is important in the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.090
So we talked about some
of the molecules that

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:22.080
are used as
pharmaceutical, in terms

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.970
of being polar and non-polar,
and vitamins the same way.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.500
So when you're
designing a molecule

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.860
that you want to get into the
body and react with a target,

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.500
if you design something
that is really non-polar,

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.550
the human body-- there's
a lot of water parts.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.240
And it's not going
to necessarily get

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.340
to where you want it to go.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:46.730
But if it's too polar, it
might just get washed out.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.440
So you want the right
amount of polar non-polar

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.020
to stay in the body
long enough, but also

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.900
to get to where it needs to go.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.770
So a lot of people who
are designing molecules

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.220
to treat disease are
very concerned about,

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.560
can we make this
molecule more polar?

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.230
Can we make it more soluble?

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.120
It hits our target beautifully.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.190
It really destroys that enzyme.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.110
It would be a fantastic
chemotherapeutic agent.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.560
But we need to figure out how
to make it get into the cell

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.670
that it needs to target.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.320
And of course, so if you're
going to go into drug designer

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.082
medicine, you care about this.

00:16:21.082 --> 00:16:22.540
If you're going to
become a parent,

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.660
you care a lot about cleaning.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.700
And it's a daily event.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.000
How am I going to get this
stain out of my child's clothes?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.610
Every day this is a question.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.510
So this is important.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.480
All right.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.960
And one other example in the
longs of cleaning-- I just

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.410
want to share with you a
short story about a chemist,

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.610
Robert H. Black,
and a life altering

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.670
event that happened to him.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:57.270
So one day, Mrs. Black said to
Mr. Black, clean the bath tub.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:02.280
This was an unprecedented
event in the Black household.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.160
So Robert Black went in
to clean his bath tub,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.150
and it was really hard.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.609
And he scrubbed, and he
scrubbed, and he scrubbed,

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:09.780
and he scrubbed.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.030
And he was a chemist, so he
knew what kind of chemicals

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.950
you would need to
clean a bath tub.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.280
You want to have things
to dissolve your likes,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.300
so you want to have your
polar and non-polar.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.810
You want to have
a chelating agent

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.950
to pull the heavy metals
out of the tub scum,

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:32.050
a surfactant, to make them bead
up so you can wash them away,

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.390
alcohols, to remove sort of
the more greasy kind of stains.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:36.870
So he knew all of this.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.500
But he realized that if
you didn't apply cleaner

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.510
on a regular basis, the tub
scum got so thick and so nasty,

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.680
that the cleaner couldn't
penetrate the scum,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.170
and you need surface area.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.060
These things work
by dissolving out.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.130
They touch the surface.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.450
So you need to have a surface.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:00.610
So he had this idea that instead
of having this tub scum build

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.890
up so much that it was a
real problem to clean it,

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.090
that you could take
all of these things

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.880
that chemists knew
would be useful

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.430
and package them in something
that was a daily cleaner.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.220
So he advertised these
things that, every time you

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.340
take a shower, you just
spray the shower or the tub,

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.967
and then you never have
to scrub your tub again.

00:18:22.967 --> 00:18:24.550
Because you do a
little bit every day,

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.530
where there's not
a lot of surface,

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.230
so it gets it right
off, right away.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:34.330
And Mr. Black and his wife never
had to clean their tub again,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:38.870
because this resulted in sales
of about $70 million per year.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.740
And it's important
to point out that he

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.740
wasn't using anything new.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.200
He was just packaging his
chemicals for daily use,

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.380
rather than, say, for a
weekly or monthly use.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.940
So I think there's a couple
important lessons from this.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.030
One, it's always important
to clean your bathroom.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.770
Two, you never know where
chemistry knowledge is going

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.520
to come, what life
altering event

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.450
will cause you to realize that
you have in your mind chemistry

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.100
knowledge that can make
you $70 million a year.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.600
And when that life
altering event occurs,

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.800
remember that I take cash
and checks and stock options.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.790
I added the last one.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.240
I thought, cash and checks--
I should be more flexible.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.230
So I'm also going to
take stock options.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.610
And this is why I teach you all
the fundamentals of chemistry,

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.860
cover everything that's really
important for you to know,

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.400
because then if you use any of
it, you've learned it from me.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.690
So just keep that in mind.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.416
One never knows what life
event is ahead of you.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.580
So what about gas solubility?

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.300
We talked about solids.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.330
Now let's talk about gases.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.520
So whether a gas is
going to be soluble

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.090
is going to depend
on Henry's Law,

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.320
or we can find out
about it solubility.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.460
So a solubility of
a gas-- we're going

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.850
to call that little s,
that's our solubility--

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.480
is directly proportional
to the partial pressure

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.370
of the gas and a constant
called Henry's Constant.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.580
And that depends on
the nature of the gas

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.380
and the solvent and
the temperature.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:24.240
So let's think about this
rule in this plot in a clicker

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:24.740
question.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.170
All right, just take
10 more seconds.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.530
Awesome.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.336
That is correct.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.870
So let's just take
a look at that.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.370
So one of the clicker
questions, which

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.430
is kind of getting
you to read the graph,

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:16.150
and so it was asking,
say at 0.5 atmospheres,

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.990
it said oxygen is more
soluble than helium.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.120
This is molar solubility
versus partial pressure.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.070
At point 0.5, sure enough,
oxygen is more soluble.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.350
So that was just
reading the plot.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.840
The other one was just
interpreting Henry's Law again,

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.830
that solubility would increase
as partial pressure increases.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.930
You can see that
from the equation.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.960
But you can also think about why
that's true, and why it's true

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.430
is the answer to the three,
that the solubility of a gas

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.020
is proportional to
its partial pressure.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.330
An increase in
pressure corresponds

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:55.480
to an increase in rate at
which the gas molecules strike

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.140
the surface.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.750
And that makes
them more soluble.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.720
So again, solubility
really has to do

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.830
with getting at that surface.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:06.910
If you get at the surface, then
you can dissolve your material.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.290
All right, so why
should you care

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.930
about the solubility of gases?

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.570
And I'm going to
give you an example.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.100
This is another
in your own words,

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.800
so we'll watch the video.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.850
And I think tonight there's
some kind of big climate change

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:21.350
thing.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.740
I've seen fliers around.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.150
I haven't paid enough
attention to what's going on.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:29.590
But climate change is
certainly a very hot topic,

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.721
if you'll excuse that right now.

00:22:32.721 --> 00:22:33.720
I didn't really mean it.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.620
It just kind of came out.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.140
But CO2 is a greenhouse gas.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.530
It's a big problem.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.870
And so a number of
researchers here at MIT

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:46.170
are thinking about ways that
you can capture and store it

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.070
somewhere, get it out
of our atmosphere.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.010
Other people are
thinking about ways

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.660
that you can change industrial
processes to make less CO2.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.480
There's a lot of
research going on.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.080
So today you'll hear from
Hector Hernandez, who

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.850
had a Ph.D. in chemistry
from the chemistry department

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.640
here at MIT, did his post-doc
here at MIT in chemical

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.330
engineering, and is now
a professor of chemical

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:14.610
engineering at Masdar Institute
in the United Arab Emirates.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:18.020
So this is one of the MIT
satellite universities

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.470
that are popping up
all over the world.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.120
So Hector was born,
I think, in Honduras,

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.530
and then lived in
Florida, ended up in MIT,

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.800
and now he's at the
United Arab Emirates.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.680
So that's just
another example of,

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.020
one never knows what's
going to happen to you.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.745
All right, so you can hear
from Hector in his own words.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:44.710
So Hector's personal
video's online.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.076
I think it's a fun one to watch.

00:23:46.076 --> 00:23:47.700
There's a couple
things that are really

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:52.140
interesting about his personal
story, including the fact

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.760
that as he mentioned in past
life he did some construction,

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.630
he started undergrad
at age 30, I think,

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.810
where he was basically
building houses and fixing cars

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.820
and he realized that his
back might not survive this

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.500
being his permanent career.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.490
So he decided to use his
brain instead of his back.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.280
And so started undergraduate,
now he's a professor.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.550
So it just shows there's a lot
of different paths to success.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.240
All right so C02-- big problem.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.859
We were trying to
use, in that case,

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:26.775
he was interested in
turning it into biofuels,

00:24:26.775 --> 00:24:28.880
they were interested
in ways to store it.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.780
You care about
solubility of gases

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.850
and you care about Le
Chatelier's principle

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.010
of driving things the
direction that you want

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.890
to make the products you want.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.680
OK, so let's think more
about these factors that

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.610
affect solubility.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.670
And one thing that's
very important,

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.450
for sure, is temperature.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:53.980
So temperature-- most
substances dissolve more quickly

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.950
at higher temperature, which
is often what you want.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.890
But it doesn't always mean if
you increase the temperature

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.210
that you're going to
make it more soluble.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.460
You may just make
it dissolve faster,

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.270
but not actually
change the end product.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.520
Some things are more sensitive
to temperature than others.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.340
So most gases, for example,
are less soluble in warm water

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.390
than in cold water,
but with solids, it's

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.450
much harder to predict what
effect temperature might have

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.670
on their solubility, even
though for many things

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.940
it will make it faster.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.070
So let's think now about
how to drive a reaction,

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.820
and what factors are
involved, and what's favorable

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.410
and what's not favorable.

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.690
And when we're talking
about those things,

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.200
we're going to be back
to our thermodynamics,

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.440
back to enthalpy, entropy,
and Gibb's free energy.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.120
So all these have little
special sub names.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.090
So when we're
talking about delta H

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.510
and we're talking about
solutions, things dissolving,

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:02.110
we're talking about
delta H sub sol,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:07.710
for solution, or if you could
think of it as solubility.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.850
And one point that I'll
make-- a lot of times

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.180
when people are learning
a new field, they're like,

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.130
oh, there's so much to learn.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.000
But you get to some
point, everything

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.750
is just kind of like a subtle
difference in something

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.880
you've already learned.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.820
So if you already
learned about delta H,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.680
this is just a
slight modification

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.130
of what you learned.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.020
You don't have to learn
a whole new thing.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.210
So that's one of the good
things about the course.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.880
You start recognizing, I
already pretty much know this.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.680
I just need to add a
little sol to the end.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.540
So delta H of solution
can be measured.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.860
You can measure it from
heat released when something

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.720
dissolves, or measure
it by the heat absorbed

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.550
and at constant pressure.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.390
And so the sign of delta
H sol will tell you

00:26:55.390 --> 00:27:00.190
about whether heat is
released or heat is required

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.920
when something dissolves.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.760
So a negative
enthalpy of solution

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.390
tells us that heat is released
when something dissolves.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.660
And many of you may have
just experienced this.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.382
If you're mixing
something together

00:27:13.382 --> 00:27:15.590
and you're holding the
container, and all of a sudden

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:21.760
it heats up, then you know
delta H sol is a negative value.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.590
And of course a
positive value tells you

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.930
that that energy is absorbed,
and sometimes things

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.890
can get very cold when
they're dissolving.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:38.400
So you already kind of knew that
that negative delta H tells you

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.730
that heat is released, and
positive delta H tells you

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.380
that heat is absorbed.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.070
So this is basically the same
thing that you already learned.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.290
It just applies to things
dissolving just the same

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.470
as it does to any reaction.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.970
All right.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:57.530
Now, suppose we want to
know whether the reaction is

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.140
going to be spontaneous
at constant pressure

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.590
or temperature.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:07.060
If we want to know whether it
will dissolve spontaneously,

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.430
what am I asking about?

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:09.900
What term do I want to know?

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.460
I want to know about
delta G. I sure do.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.290
Delta G tells us whether
things are spontaneous or not.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.890
It does with thermodynamics,
it does with solubility.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.320
Delta G is to predictor
of whether something

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.060
is going to be spontaneous
or non-spontaneous

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:35.370
by the sine of delta G.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.160
So entropy-- don't want
to leave out entropy.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.840
Never leave out entropy.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.050
My t-shirt's still
unaccounted for,

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.800
after they got back
to Massachusetts,

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.320
they left for New Jersey
and Cincinnati again.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.000
Last time I checked,
they were still in Ohio.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.780
Entropy.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.980
So since disorder
typically increases

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.400
when a solvent dissolves,
typically, entropy

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.390
should increase.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:03.889
And there's a little
star, and we'll

00:29:03.889 --> 00:29:06.840
get back to the star, because
it doesn't always increase.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.240
But typically, it
should increase.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.700
So if we're looking at
these pictures here,

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.950
over here you have
your nice molecules all

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:20.280
lined up in your solid, and
it's going to then dissolve.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.470
And you can see that
when it's dissolved,

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.550
that's a lot more
entropy over there.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.600
There are a lot more
freedom moving around.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.600
This is more constrained.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:33.650
So typically, entropy
increases when things dissolve.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:39.020
So if delta H is negative,
and delta S increases

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.620
when a solutes
dissolves, then what

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.996
do we expect about the
dissolving process?

00:29:44.996 --> 00:29:46.245
And that's a clicker question.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.350
Yeah.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.630
So most people have, so
we'll take 10 more seconds.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.910
So let's look at both
of them, because we're

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.300
going to do this one
in a few minutes.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.832
So let's just continue
with our notes,

00:30:29.832 --> 00:30:31.540
and we're going to
come back to that one.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.081
I don't know.

00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:35.384
Can we just leave that one
up, maybe for a minute?

00:30:35.384 --> 00:30:36.800
I don't know how
long it was going

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.260
to take to me to get there.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:44.652
All right, so when we're
talking about this--

00:30:44.652 --> 00:30:46.110
we'll just keep
things in the notes

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.443
and we'll come back to that one.

00:30:47.443 --> 00:30:51.810
So if this is
negative and delta S

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:56.480
is increasing-- so if this is
negative and this is positive,

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.990
then you're going to have
a spontaneous process here.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.520
So if you can put in your notes
that this should be spontaneous

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.490
under these circumstances.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:10.240
Now let's continue on and
think about getting around

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.010
to the next one.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:18.840
So in some cases-- I don't
know, hopefully people

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.330
can see this-- in some
cases, entropy of the system

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.860
is actually lowered when
something dissolves.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.760
And this is because of what's
known as this cage effect.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.860
If you have water molecules,
when something dissolves,

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.460
sometimes order
around the thing.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:38.970
And so the water entropy
is determining the process.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:45.070
And have this new order
because of the water structure.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.380
So this can change.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:50.430
So it's not always the case that
entropy of the overall system

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.780
is going to increase.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.700
So here, even if this
is a negative value,

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.110
delta H solution is negative,
delta G might be positive.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.790
It might not be a
spontaneous system.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.860
And so the cage effect
is why some things that

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.960
are hydrophobic, just
you're having a hard time

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.250
dissolving them, even if they
have a negative enthalpy, even

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:14.210
if you would just look
at the negative enthalpy

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.500
and predict that it
should be spontaneous.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.820
Because even if this
is negative, if delta

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.880
S is also negative
because you have

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.400
more order due to
the water molecules,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.770
then the overall
term can be positive.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.940
It would depend on
the magnitude of these

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:30.962
and on the temperature.

00:32:35.366 --> 00:32:37.240
This is actually more
slides than I remember.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.600
Before we get to the next--
oh, this is the last one.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:45.776
OK, so when gases are
dissolved in a liquid,

00:32:45.776 --> 00:32:46.900
there is much less freedom.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.890
Gases not dissolved
can be anywhere.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:54.320
But when they're in a liquid,
then there's much less freedom.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.140
And so the entropy then
is going to be negative,

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:03.480
and the solubility will decrease
as the temperature rises.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:08.540
And so that brings us then
to our question about delta

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.500
H of solution being positive.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.587
And now we can look
at the answer to that.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.830
Now I guess we can go
maybe to the other slide.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:24.470
So that was the question
that you had here,

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.220
and I've just put
up the answers.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.990
So here, delta H is positive.

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:35.850
And so we have positive
minus T delta S again.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:39.930
We weren't told anything about
delta S in this particular.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:43.390
Just ask what if it's positive.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.530
And so for the first one,
it said dissolving is never

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:47.880
spontaneous.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.230
And that isn't necessarily
true, because you

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.540
don't know what delta S is.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.750
Dissolving is only
spontaneous if T delta S

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:01.160
is positive and larger
than delta H solution.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.790
And that was the correct answer.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:06.950
If this is a big term here,
it's larger than that term,

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.320
and this is a positive
value, then you

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.880
would get a negative
delta G, and it

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.969
would be a spontaneous process.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:19.110
If we look at number three here,
dissolving is only spontaneous

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:24.030
if this is negative-- that
does not help us at all.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.520
And the rate will be slower.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.870
Delta H is not going to tell
us anything about rates.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.790
Rates are determined
by kinetics.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.710
Temperature can
affect the rates,

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:37.489
for sure, stirring can
affect the rates for sure,

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:44.500
but delta H being positive is
not telling us about the rates.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.600
So you'll see in
this particular unit,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.530
when you're thinking
about solubility,

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.370
you're thinking about
equilibrium expressions,

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:56.120
especially equilibrium
expression KSP,

00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:00.270
you're thinking about
partial pressures again,

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:04.550
you're thinking about effects
on the solubility that

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.100
have to do with
temperatures, you're

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.810
thinking about delta H,
delta S, and delta G.

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:14.470
So it's really an outgrowth
of thermodynamics and chemical

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.100
equilibrium, but you're
just applying, really,

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.240
what you've already
learned to thinking

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.470
about a solute
dissolving in a solvent.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.500
So that's one of the
things that sets really

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.270
great about the course
and the next couple units,

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.830
is that everything's
very connected.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.070
So we can just briefly
introduce you to the next unit,

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.310
and we're going to be talking
about acids and bases now

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.440
for several lectures.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.435
And I have to say that this
is one of the units when

00:35:42.435 --> 00:35:44.820
we get to kind of
acid-base titrations

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.200
that MIT students
seem to struggle with.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.380
So we're going to slow
this down and really

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.343
go over it, and have you be
awesome at acids and bases.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.550
And I'll mention that one of
the reasons why I spent time

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.010
on solubility and acids, bases,
because these are topics that

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:09.340
are really important for medical
school, and I know a lot of you

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.230
are not pre-med,
but I want everybody

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.620
in this class to have that
background that they could

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.610
go to med school
if they wanted to,

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:21.240
or they could just advocate
for their own health

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.800
with a doctor who doesn't
know about acids and bases.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.230
And I'll tell you a story
about that a little later.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:33.480
Anyway, OK, so acids
and bases-- we're

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.820
just going to some definitions.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.910
So the simplest
definition of this

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.960
is that an acid is a substance
that when dissolved in water,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:50.540
increases the concentration
of hydrogen ions, H plus.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.060
Whereas a base is
a substance that

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:58.800
increases the hydroxide
concentration, OH minus.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.040
So there are acids and
bases that definitely

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.940
fit this description, but this
is a very narrow description

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.910
of acids and bases.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.600
The next one, the
Bronsted-Lowry,

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.910
is a bit broader.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.390
So an acid is
something that donates

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:20.390
a hydrogen ion, H plus,
and a Bronsted-Lowry base

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.750
is something that
accepts a hydrogen ion.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:25.220
And this is really
the definition

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.990
we'll be spending the most
time with in the class.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:33.730
So let's look at some
examples of this.

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:38.620
So here, we have an acid.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:44.070
And if it's an acid, it's going
to be donating a hydrogen ion,

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.090
and it's going to donate
it here to the water.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:52.360
The water acts as a base in that
it accepts the hydrogen ion.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.400
When it accepts
the hydrogen ion,

00:37:54.400 --> 00:38:01.030
it has one extra hydrogen
ion, so it's H3O plus.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:04.350
And when the acid
loses its hydrogen ion,

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.070
it becomes this base over
here, the same molecule

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.760
minus the hydrogen ion, so
now it has a negative charge.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.200
And so you'll will
see hydronium ions

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.660
quite a bit, which is H3O plus.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.590
That's really the
more accurate form,

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.110
rather than just writing
H plus somewhere.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.750
So that's the kind of
true nature of things.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.680
So let me just show you a little
animation of this happening.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.790
I think it's kind of cute.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:40.155
So here we have our water
molecules and we have our acid.

00:38:40.155 --> 00:38:43.000
It donated a hydrogen
ion to these,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.420
and then another water
came and stole it away.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.330
And so there's our H3O plus.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.370
And so in solution,
you have this exchange

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:52.590
of hydrogen atoms.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:55.040
The acid is donating,
the base is accepting.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.340
And as they donate
and accept, they

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.410
become different molecules.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:04.920
So it gives rise to this idea
of conjugate acid-base pairs.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:10.440
So here you see that
this acid is paired

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.170
with this base over here.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:15.780
They're the same, except
that one has the hydrogen ion

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.690
and one does not.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:20.600
And then the other pair is here.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.370
It's another acid-base pair.

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:27.300
We have water and hydronium
ion that also differ by H plus.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:32.250
So every time an acid donates
a hydrogen ion or proton,

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:34.050
it becomes its conjugate base.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.560
Every time a base accepts
a hydrogen ion or proton,

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.140
it becomes its conjugate acid.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:44.140
So the conjugate
base of any acid

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.480
is the base that is formed when
the acid has donated a hydrogen

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.030
ion or proton.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.440
The conjugate acid
of a base is the acid

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:58.500
that forms when the base accepts
a hydrogen ion or proton.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.780
So let's take a look
at one more example.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:06.080
If this over here-- is this
acting as an acid or base,

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.021
this molecule here?

00:40:07.021 --> 00:40:07.770
What do you think?

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.550
You can just yell it out.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.650
It's acting as an acid, right?

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:15.430
This is acting,
then, as the base.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.140
When this base accepts
the hydrogen ion,

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.400
it forms its conjugate acid.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.380
And this then forms
its conjugate base,

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.910
which differs by H plus.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:32.638
So why don't you try one of
these, then, on your own?

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:44.410
10 more seconds.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:07.780
OK, so we can go back
to that over there.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.420
So you most people
got this right,

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.830
and so you're looking at
what's acting as the base

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:16.920
and what's acting as the acid.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.600
Again, the base is going to
be accepting a hydrogen ion.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.340
So this is acting as the acid.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.240
This forms it's
conjugate it and this.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:32.880
And quickly, with the idea of
something that's amphoteric,

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.920
which is molecule that can
act as an acid or a base.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.030
You just saw some
nice examples of that.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:45.110
And finally, just one last
definition for acid-bases.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:52.300
And we'll just put this up
and that's kind of the end.

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.060
So the final definition,
the Lewis Base,

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.700
donates a lone pair,
whereas a Lewis Acid

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:01.170
accepts such electrons.
