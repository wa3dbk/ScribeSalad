00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.150
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Next
hand out-- thermodynamics.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.520
Yes.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.010
Yes.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.520
I love thermodynamics.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.062
All right.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.090
So what is thermodynamics?

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.700
So thermodynamics and
kinetics I feel go together,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.390
but for kind of weird reasons
we do thermodynamics now

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.260
and we do kinetics at the very
last unit of the semester.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.040
Part of the reason for this is
that kinetics is often a unit

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.830
that students can
pick up really fast,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.220
and so I like doing it at
the end when everything--

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.560
your world is sort
of crazy and you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.650
have something that you can
get a grasp on pretty easily

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.784
for the last unit.

00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:13.950
So anyway, I'll tell you a
little bit about kinetics

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.760
now because we won't get
to a lot of it until later.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.230
So thermodynamics deals with
energy change and spontaneity

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.180
of reactions.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.500
And thermodynamics brings you
three of my favorite things

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.550
in chemistry, which are
[MUSIC PLAYING] delta H,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:45.600
[CYMBAL CRASH] Delta S,
and [DRUM ROLL] delta G.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.790
I love these.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.760
I live my life
around these things.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.050
I believe entropy should
always be increasing.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.150
And I love nothing
more than free energy.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.860
That's great stuff.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.310
So today we're going to talk
about delta H. Next week we

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.479
have delta S and delta G.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.620
What about kinetics?

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.030
What does kinetics bring us?

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.970
Well, kinetics brings us the
rate or speed of a reaction.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.070
It can bring us fast
reactions and it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:31.370
can bring us slow reactions.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.190
I like kinetics too.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.200
I kind of like the fast
to be honest with you.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.700
All right.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.190
So thermodynamics and kinetics.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.560
One. thermodynamics tells
us whether something

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.830
is going to happen
spontaneously or not,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.860
but kinetics tells us the
rate at which it happens.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.910
So let's just think of
an example for a minute.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.220
You may have heard--
this commercial happens

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.380
a lot around Valentine's Day.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.600
Diamonds are forever.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.860
So actually,
thermodynamically, graphite

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.080
is favorable to diamonds.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.210
It's more stable.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.520
So graphite or coal--
thermodynamically,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.680
this is the stuff.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.880
Diamonds-- diamond
is not forever.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.800
That's really a
kinetic statement.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.060
It's there for a very long time,
but you know it isn't inert.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.650
So here's an important question.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.670
What is the best ring for one
geek to give another geek?

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.690
The thermodynamically
stable one or one

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.180
that is more kinetically slow to
react, more stable, more inert.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.210
Inert is reaction.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.520
What do you-- I should have
a clicker question on this,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.020
I know.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.430
I don't know what you think.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:06.520
But actually, the answer is, in
my opinion, neither of these.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.416
Come on.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.810
There's only really one ring
that any geek really wants.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.750
Green Lantern's
ring has the power

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.050
of chemistry at your fingertips.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.780
Who cares if something's inert?

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.840
If you're the Green Lantern
you can do whatever.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.780
So that's the ring.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.100
Anyway--

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.587
AUDIENCE: What
about the one ring?

00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:35.920
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Oh, one ring.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.430
Yeah.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.470
I like the Green Lantern
ring, but I guess next-- maybe

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.910
we should open a blog on this.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.020
It's a really
important question.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.930
So let's think about
bonding for a minute.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.970
So thermodynamics is telling
us about energy change.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.510
It's telling us
about spontaneity.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.630
And so we need to think
about energy that's going in.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.760
So kinetics is telling
us about how fast.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.850
Thermodynamics is really
telling us about stability.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.960
How stable is something?

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.960
How much does it cost
to break it apart?

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.870
So we're back to bond
association energies.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.750
We have the change
in the dissociation

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.720
energy E to the little d.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.650
It's the energy to break a bond.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.570
We've seen this plot before.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.130
Now we have methane.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.380
We're breaking off a
hydrogen from it, which

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.060
is actually very hard to do.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.180
Scientists would love to
break apart methane and make

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.090
methanol, but it's
a hard thing to do.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.460
Up here we have
unfavorable reactions.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.590
When the atoms are
too close, then you

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.140
have a sweet spot where
the positions of the atoms

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.790
are just right to form a bond.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.380
That's when you get methane.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.440
And then, if you put in
energy, you can pull this off,

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.450
is they go far apart
with the radius this way.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.230
Your bond will dissociate.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.160
You always have to put energy
in to get it to dissociate.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.500
So now we can think about
it-- we thought about this

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.150
in terms of bond dissociation.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.190
We've seen this
before, but now we

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.500
can think about it in
terms of a new term, which

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.550
is delta H B, or bond enthalpy.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.770
So bond enthalpy is the
change in heat accompanying

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.250
the dissociation of a
bond and that's measured

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.150
at a constant pressure.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.490
In fact, if we relate
delta H to Delta E-- delta

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.520
H equals delta E plus whatever
change in pressure or volume.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.590
And often, this term
is pretty small,

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.990
so people often really
think about reactions

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.320
in terms of these being
pretty similar to each other.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.240
So for gases, the difference
really is 1% to 2%.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.110
And if you're talking
about a liquid or a solid

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.200
it's really a
negligible difference.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.700
So we often really kind of
think about these things

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.420
in the same way.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.730
We think about the energy
going into a system

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.850
to break the bond, or we think
about the bond enthalpies.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.980
And bond enthalpy, delta H,
is often easier to measure,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.870
so it's very convenient.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.900
So again, bond
enthalpies You always

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.990
have to put energy in if
you're going to break a bond.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.850
So it's always going
to be positive.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.020
It always takes heat.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.370
It always takes something
to break a bond.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.200
And so breaking a
bond is endothermic.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.556
Heat must be added.

00:07:21.556 --> 00:07:24.560
Whereas bond formation
is exothermic.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.270
Heat is being released.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.250
And so we can think
about this-- again,

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.500
when you form a bond those--
we saw with MO theory--

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.640
there's more electrons in lower
energy in the bonding orbitals

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.530
than in the
antibonding orbitals.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.130
They're happy.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.600
This is a lower energy state.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.900
So if you're going
to break that bond,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.270
breaking up is hard to do.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.527
And there's a song that
verifies that statement.

00:07:48.527 --> 00:07:49.610
Breaking up is hard to do.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.500
You always have to have heat.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.710
But when you go from
that stable stay

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.470
out-- when you form
those bonds, it's

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.420
like kind of the married couple,
often get a little boring.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.670
They're in a low energy state.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.250
It's hard to get
them out of the house

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.310
and so they release
all of their energy

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.980
and they form this nice,
little, happy, stable couple.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.197
So when you do bond formation
that's an exothermic process.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.720
So we can talk about
standard bond enthalpies.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.240
When you see this
little circle up there

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.530
that means it's a value that's
at standard conditions, where

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.558
your reactants and products
are in their standard states.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:41.230
And so we can think about what
are some delta H or some bond

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.900
enthalpies for different kinds
of carbon hydrogen bonds.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.607
So here's our friend methane.

00:08:47.607 --> 00:08:49.190
If you're going to
pull off a hydrogen

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.320
you have to put
energy in to do that,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.960
and the bond enthalpy
for that is 438.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.790
Now we can think about some
other kinds of carbon bonds.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.110
We talked about this one.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.480
We have it here
in the classroom.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.980
So if we pull off a hydrogen
from that, it's plus 410.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.660
So similar but not the same.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.470
If you now substitute
three flourines for three

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.930
of the hydrogens that
changes your value

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.700
a little bit, but not much.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.050
If you substitute chlorine
it changes it a lot more.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.720
Same with bromine.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.930
So it depends.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.990
The bond enthalpy depends on
what else is around that atom

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.120
that you're pulling around.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.915
So it's not always
the same value.

00:09:34.915 --> 00:09:35.540
It's different.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.820
It depends on what
else is there.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.630
So often you'll have a table
that will report mean bond

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.700
enthalpies.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.540
And they take all
the bonds enthalpies

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.820
and they get the mean
value, and they're usually

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.820
within 8% of each other.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.960
And for a carbon
hydrogen bond it's

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.410
around 412 is the
mean bond enthalpy.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.500
But when you're using
mean bond enthalpies

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.880
to calculate something,
you have to realize

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.870
that there can be some pretty
big differences depending

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:08.210
on what's around that bond
that you're going to break.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.310
So those are some
bond enthalpies.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.450
Why are they important?

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.750
Well, they're important
because the difference

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.260
in bond enthalpies between
a product and a reactant

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.980
can tell you about the
enthalpy of that reaction.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.680
The enthalpy of the reaction
of breaking of bonds

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.610
and forming new bonds, or the
enthalpy of reaction, which

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:34.670
is delta H R-- sub R. And
that is in the standard state

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.750
in that case.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.530
So let's talk about
enthalpies of reactions.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.300
So we have this symbol again.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.690
Standard bond enthalpy
for a reaction.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.750
So if it's a little B
it's a bond enthalpy.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.780
If it's a little R it's
a reaction enthalpy.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.830
If it's negative value it means
it's an exothermic reaction,

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.490
and if it's a positive
value it means that it's

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.840
an endothermic reaction.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.050
So we'll use these
terms a lot and you'll

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.890
get very familiar with them.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.720
So let's look at some
examples of reactions.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:15.801
And here is one of my
favorites, and it is yes.

00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:19.170
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.220
It has it's own song.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.552
- (SINGING) Photosynthesis Aah.

00:11:24.552 --> 00:11:27.426
Photosynthesis.

00:11:27.426 --> 00:11:29.342
Aah.

00:11:29.342 --> 00:11:31.591
Photosynthesis.

00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:32.090
Aah.

00:11:39.373 --> 00:11:42.810
Photosynthesis does not involve
a camera or a synthesizer,

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.283
although that's interesting too.

00:11:44.283 --> 00:11:46.901
Photosynthesis is how the plants
take in light from the sun

00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:48.702
and turn it into energy.

00:11:48.702 --> 00:11:51.648
It's actually a thing on
which most life depends here

00:11:51.648 --> 00:11:53.121
on the planet Earth.

00:11:53.121 --> 00:11:55.576
Photosynthesis.

00:11:55.576 --> 00:11:56.494
Aah.

00:11:56.494 --> 00:11:57.410
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.640
That gives you an idea.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.520
Unfortunately, every time
you will hear the word

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.100
photosynthesis you'll go Ah.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.180
It happens.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.340
I'm sorry about that.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.470
So photosynthesis.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.640
Amazing reaction.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.660
People right now are trying
to duplicate it in industry

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.200
to solve the energy problem.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.650
Good luck with that.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.060
But I know.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.330
I wish them good luck.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.480
That would be awesome.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.680
We use the opposite of that
reaction for our energy.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.400
So we take sugar and use
oxygen to break it down,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.670
which is an awesome
thing because this

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:39.470
has a really negative
enthalpy of reaction

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.560
minus 2816 kilojoules per mole.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.360
It's huge.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.610
And we store this in
something called ATP.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.877
So since this is-- and I'm going
to need the help of the TAs

00:12:50.877 --> 00:12:53.210
for a minute because we're
going to do a very quick demo

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.340
at the end of today's class.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:00.050
This reaction is
exothermic big time.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.620
It's a big negative,
which raises the question,

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.950
if it's that exothermic--
really big value.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.590
We have sugar in air.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.900
Why we should feel heat?

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.560
Heat should be released.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.360
So I think we should do
this demo now and see

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.710
whether that's true.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:24.620
So I have a bag of sugar and
it is sealed under nitrogen

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.020
so there's no oxygen in there.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.995
And I forgot my safety glasses
but I'll try to-- sorry

00:13:31.995 --> 00:13:32.870
about the front room.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.610
I should have had a stellar
announcement that you

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.840
might want to sit back.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.010
But I'm going to cut
this open and let O2 in.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.552
So there should be a
lot of heat coming out.

00:13:44.552 --> 00:13:47.439
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the things
inside it individually wrapped?

00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:48.980
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Oh, you know what?

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.060
They are individually wrapped.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.800
All right, so this
is not going to work.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.850
So I need the TAs to
come down here, please,

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.250
and you've got to
help me unwrap them.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.520
Has anyone done
the experiment yet?

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.410
Do you feel heat coming out?

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.369
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:05.369 --> 00:14:06.452
CATHERINE DRENNAN: You do?

00:14:06.452 --> 00:14:10.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.610
All right.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.610
I better try it up here.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:14.480
Let's see.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.630
I'm going or unwrap mine.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.730
It's not working very well.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:27.320
So it turns out
that heat should be

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.730
released but this is very slow.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.650
So we don't feel the heat when
we unwrap our Hershey's Kisses.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:41.420
I encourage everyone to try
this experiment at least once.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:46.880
But the way that we harness
this energy in our bodies

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.370
is that we have catalysts,
which are enzymes,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.170
that speed up the reaction.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.910
And that's how we get the full
force of this reaction out.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:02.170
So that is actually our
introduction to thermodynamics.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.940
And next time
we're going to talk

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:11.600
about how we're going to
calculate these delta Hr,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.140
these heats of reaction.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.140
So we were talking
about delta H,

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.360
and so we want to pull out
the handouts from last time.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.980
And we were at the
bottom of page two

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.480
with three different ways
to calculate delta H.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:37.120
So our delta H of reaction,
delta Hr, the reaction

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.920
enthalpy.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.620
So I introduced you
to bond enthalpies,

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.480
and today we're
going to look at how

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:49.170
you use bond enthalpies to
calculate reaction enthalpies.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.030
And remember, bond enthalpies--
sometimes it has nothing.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.740
Just delta H.
Sometimes it's delta

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.030
H sub B. Capital B for bond.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.800
And we're going to look at that.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.200
Then we're going to look
at how you can calculate

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.490
delta H for reaction from
the standard enthalpies

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:09.770
of formation, and I'll introduce
you to what that means.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.130
And then, also tell
you about Hess's law

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.430
where you can combine
known reactions that

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:19.090
have known delta H's
to get a new equation

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.400
and calculate a new delta
H for that reaction.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.590
So three different ways.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:28.810
So we're going to start with way
one, which is bond enthalpies.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:33.700
So here is the equation for
calculating bond enthalpies.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.710
So we have the delta
H0 of the reaction

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:43.570
equals the sum of all
of the reactants bond

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:49.270
enthalpies minus the sum of all
the product bond enthalpies.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:55.090
And so this is bonds
broken minus bonds formed.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.950
And so let's think
about this for a minute

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.770
and think about
what would be true.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:05.200
If you had stronger bonds in the
products than in the reactants,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.040
what would be true?

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.354
And this is a clicker question.

00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:16.470
All right.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.003
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.180
OK Yep.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.790
So now let's think
about why this is true.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.730
So it's good news
that most of you

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.850
know that negative means
exothermic and positive

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.710
means endothermic.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.593
And let's look at
why this is true.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.310
So let's look at both of these.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.210
So if we have bonds
stronger in the products--

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.650
you can just think
about the equation.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.710
So if you are bond
stronger in the products

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.480
this is a bigger
number and that's

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.040
the smaller number,
which is going

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.050
to give you a negative answer.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.390
And a negative
value is exothermic.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.620
And you can think about the
equation stronger bonds here.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.690
A bigger number minus
the smaller number.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.670
Positive or endothermic.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.820
But let's think for a minute
about why this is the case

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.610
and rationalize it
because on an exam

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.310
this is one of the equations
that you're not given,

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.635
so let's help you remember
why this would be true.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.930
We can think about this-- if
you're going to break bonds--

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.290
and this isn't in your notes
but people get confused by this,

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.950
so I'm just going to write
a little bit on the board.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.970
So if you're going
to break bonds

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.820
you need to put energy into
the system to break bonds.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.070
And we talked about this before.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.460
And since we have
exam two coming up

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.100
we'll just do a little
review of some of the things

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.580
that might be on the exam.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.140
So you don't have this in the
handout we're doing right now,

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.120
but you had this in the
lecture nine handout.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.670
And something like this
might be on the exam

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.100
so we should be
thinking about it.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.920
So remember, if
there was no energy

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.510
that you needed
to put in to break

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.540
a bond-- if breaking the bond
required no energy there would

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.230
be no bond.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.990
So when the energy is
zero there's no bonds.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.630
These two are not-- these
things are not bonded together.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.100
And when you do form a
bond, you go down an energy

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.440
here so it's at a lower state.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.610
It's more stable.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.470
That's why it forms a bond.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.990
If it was less stable it
wouldn't be forming a bond.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.720
But if it's more stable,
lower in energy, a larger

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.530
negative number,
then a bond forms.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.610
So to break this bond you have
to put energy into the system.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.360
So breaking bonds always
involves energy in.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:56.220
But forming bonds-- so if
we're forming bonds then

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.380
we're going to have energy out.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:06.580
So we're at a lower place here.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.440
So if we want to break bonds
we have to put energy in,

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.630
but if we're forming
bonds then we're

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.870
going to have energy that
these guys had that is

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.460
going to be released somewhere.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.040
So energy goes
out of the system.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.090
And the farther down we have the
stronger bonds, the more energy

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.350
you have to put in to break.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:29.360
But also, the more energy that
comes out when the bonds form.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.910
So energy in to break
a bond, but when

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.900
a bond is forming it goes to
a lower state and that energy

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.100
is released.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.160
So now we can think about
what happens if you have

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.610
a reactant with weak bonds.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:53.220
So if the reactant
then has weak bonds,

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.310
how much energy do you have
to put in if it has weak bonds

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.260
to break them?

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.010
Not a lot.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:02.760
So we have just sort of a
little bit of energy in.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.460
Little energy in to
break those bonds.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:16.010
Now in the products, if
we have strong bonds,

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:21.040
how much energy goes out if
we're forming strong bonds?

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.970
A lot.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.850
So energy out.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:29.630
We have lots of energy out.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.140
So that was the first
case that we had.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.420
So we had something where
the bonds were stronger

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.740
in the product and we said
that this was negative.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:47.990
So net here we have heat
or energy out is released,

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.390
and so that's an
exothermic system.

00:21:53.452 --> 00:21:55.016
Oh, the boards work today.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.930
And if we have the other--
if we have, say, strong bonds

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:08.450
in the reactants, then we have
to put a lot of energy in.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.190
Big energy in.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:13.910
And if we have weak bonds
that are being formed,

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.670
we're not getting
much energy back

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:22.595
so the net here is that you
have heat in or heat absorbed.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.220
And it's an
endothermic reaction.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.010
So this is just one
way to think about it.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.966
Remember, whenever you
are going to break bond

00:22:35.966 --> 00:22:38.090
you always have to put
energy in to break the bond.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.120
And when a bond is formed
that energy is released.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.080
So we are thinking about
the net of the processes,

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.250
and that's why this
equation works for us.

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.360
So keep this in mind.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.280
This is one of the
points that people

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.440
get confused on the exams.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.449
And sometimes like they
say, oh, thermodynamics.

00:22:57.449 --> 00:22:59.240
I just don't understand
it, and they're not

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.460
keeping calm and sciencing on.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.150
They're getting all
stressed by thermodynamics,

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.860
and it's only this confusion.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:07.520
That's it.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.040
So if you work this
out then thermodynamics

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.920
will be your friend and you
will love thermodynamics

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.042
like I do forever.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.260
Just kind of keep this in mind
and those diagrams in mind

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.500
and you'll be all good.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.000
All right.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.340
So let's do an example now.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:30.860
So we can use these bond
enthalpies in this equation

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.690
where we're summing
up all our reactants.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.710
And sometimes you see
some of a little i

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.430
here for i reactants
minus j products.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.090
So the sum of all
of the products.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.650
And it really is a lot
here because we're talking

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.370
about breaking every bond.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.050
We're talking about
forming every bond.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.960
So this is not a huge
molecule, but let's think

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.640
about how many
bonds we're actually

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.450
going to be breaking here.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.890
So these are all the
bonds that are broken.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.410
They're not quite as
many being formed here.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:04.430
So bonds broken.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:10.190
We have carbon hydrogen bonds,
and we have seven of those.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:14.900
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- let's see if
I can count them-- 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.370
5, 6, 7.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.240
There it is.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.280
I need my glasses.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.180
OH bonds.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.190
We have these guys up here.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.380
One, two, three, four, five.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:33.480
We have CO bond over a
one double bond over here.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.800
So we also are going to
have these ones here.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.660
One, two, three, four, five.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.120
We have the double
bond over there.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.820
We have five carbon bonds.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.920
The one single bond here.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.980
And the carbon bond is one,
two, three, four, five.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.480
And we have OO bonds.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.506
We have six of those.

00:24:51.506 --> 00:24:52.130
Thank goodness.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.421
I didn't have to count anymore.

00:24:53.421 --> 00:24:54.530
It's already labeled.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.390
And then the bonds formed.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.730
So we're going to have these.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:01.310
So it's six of those,
so we have 12 altogether

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.930
and we have also 12 over here.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.390
So first you have to count.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.430
And counting is not
one of my strengths,

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.870
so I don't like
doing it this way

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.536
and I'm going to show
you two other ways

00:25:10.536 --> 00:25:12.430
to calculate the same thing.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.950
But we can take this
and sum these all up.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.280
We can look up the mean bond
enthalpies for every single one

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.950
of these types of
bonds, multiply them

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.770
by the appropriate
coefficients, and come up

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:29.360
with a sum for all the
bonds for i number of bonds

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.100
that you have in the reactants.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.790
And you can do the same in the
products for j number of bonds

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:39.330
that you have in the products
and come up with these numbers.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.750
So if you were told
that you have to do it

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.080
this way-- use bond enthalpies
and you know how to do it--

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.330
or if it's an easier problem
and you're only, say,

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.690
breaking two things and forming
two things this isn't a bad way

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:51.470
to do it.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.180
For big molecules this
is definitely a nuisance.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.830
And if we sum all of
this up together-- and so

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:03.400
for the total number we have
reactants minus products.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:08.890
And so if we subtract
this we get minus 2,740.

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:15.550
And the actual value
is minus 2,816.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.560
So it's not even
the best agreement

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.940
when you do it this way.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.130
And the reason was, if
you remember last time,

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:23.320
we were talking about the bonds.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.540
Mean bond enthalpy is
about 8% difference.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.370
So if you had, say,
CH in a system that

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.910
has all the rest of the
atoms on carbon or H,

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.290
that's a somewhat
different value

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.750
than if all of
those other H atoms

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.260
were substituted with bromine or
if all those other H atoms were

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.110
substituted with carbon.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.650
Then the bond enthalpy for that
CH-- it depends on what else

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.430
is bonded to the C. And so
there's about 8% difference

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.750
usually in the values.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.830
And so overall, you're not
going to get much better.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.200
You certainly are not going
to get better than eight.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.510
So agreement of
3% is pretty good,

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.670
but it's not all that
precise because we're

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.310
using these mean bond
enthalpies, which

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:11.530
don't depend on the actual
value in that particular system.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:16.180
So we can do better than this,
and it can be also easier.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.710
And it'll be easier if we use
standard heats of formation.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:26.920
So this is delta H sub
f, f for formation.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:33.970
So the delta H sub f
not for standard value

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:38.380
is equal to the
reaction, delta H,

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.500
if you're talking about
a reaction that involves

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:46.750
one mole of compound being
derived from its pure elements

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:52.000
in their most stable state
and in their standards state.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.310
So this is standard state
1 bar and room temperature.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:01.600
So let's calculate for the same
reaction glucose plus oxygen

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.860
going to CO2 plus
water and see if we

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.430
can get a little bit more
accurate value that way.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.650
So let's think about what's
happening in this reaction.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:16.720
So every time we oxidize
glucose we're forming water.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.840
And so we can think
about the heat

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.320
of formation for liquid water.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.090
So again, this would be one
mole coming from pure elements

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.190
in their most standard state.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.070
So we have to think about where
the hydrogen is coming from

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:35.350
and where the oxygen
is coming from.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:40.060
So hydrogen in its most
stable form is H2 gas,

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.800
and oxygen in its most
stable form is O2 gas.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.940
So that's then the equation
balanced for one mole

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.690
of H2O liquid being formed.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:57.520
And we can look up
the delta H for this--

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.180
that delta H of formation--
for this reaction as written

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:06.940
is the delta H of formation,
and it's minus 285.83 kilojoules

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.260
per mole.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.190
So now let's consider what
else that we're forming, water.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.610
And we're also forming CO2.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:20.890
So CO2 is derived from carbon
in its most stable state, which

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:26.080
is graphite as we discussed
before, and also O2, oxygen.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.890
And O2 oxygen gas is the
most stable state there.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.920
So for this reaction
as written that

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.160
is the delta H of
formation of CO2 gas

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:41.210
and it's minus 393.5
kilojoules per mole.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.740
So those are our products.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.890
We also have two reactants.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.830
One of our reactants is O2.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.740
So it's what's
doing the oxidation.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.570
And we're going from
O2 gas to O2 gas.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.680
This is the most stable state.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.610
So what do you think
the value is here?

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.490
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.420
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 0.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.490
Yes.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.400
So if you have an
element already

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.160
in its most stable state,
its heat of formation

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.450
is going to be 0.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.910
Because it's already
the most stable state,

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.950
so the heat of formation is 0.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.380
And every year, I think,
on an exam someone's

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.600
trying to see if
they can calculate

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.720
a delta H of a reaction
and they're looking

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.060
and they're like, oh, I want
to use heats of formation

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.810
because I know that's a lot
easier but a value is missing

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.010
from my table.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.650
And they're like, the value
is missing from the table.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.440
And the TA doesn't know how
much information or whatever

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.200
to give.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.325
And if you think you should
have a value on an exam

00:30:38.325 --> 00:30:41.230
and you don't think about,
is that element already

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.090
in its most standard state?

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.720
Perhaps it's zero and that's why
it's not listed on the table.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.160
So keep this in mind.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.291
This can be very
useful to remember.

00:30:51.291 --> 00:30:51.790
All right.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:55.250
One more thing is
involved in the equation.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.860
We have glucose.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.980
So we can think about the
reaction that forms glucose

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.170
from elements in its
most stable state,

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.900
and we've actually talked
about all these already.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:05.860
We have O2.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.660
That's in its most stable state.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.160
Carbon graphite.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.690
H2 gas.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:13.660
And so this reaction
as written--

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:19.250
it has a heat of formation
of minus 1,260 kilojoules

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.940
per mole.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.140
So now we can
calculate the delta H

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.800
for the oxidation of glucose.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:33.020
The delta H of the reaction from
these delta H's of formation.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.180
And here's the equation.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.810
Delta H of the reaction
is equal to the sum

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:42.020
of all of the delta
H's of formation

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:47.180
of the products minus the sum
of the delta H's of formation

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:50.250
of the reactants.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.620
So this now is one of
the sources of confusion

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.380
because if you're
using bond enthalpies

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.780
it's reactants minus products.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.300
If you're using
delta H of formation

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.880
it's products minus reactants.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.950
So that's why I
spend a little time

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:11.460
over here thinking about
what's going on with the bond

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:16.040
enthalpies, so hopefully no
one will fall into this delta H

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.890
pitfall over here
and you'll keep

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:22.520
the reactions-- the
equations straight.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.140
So now we can plug it in.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.860
If you remember the equations
this is pretty easy.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.880
So we have our
delta H of reaction.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.750
We have 6 times the
heat of formation

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.280
of our products over here.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.420
CO2.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.450
6 times the first
product and then

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.840
6 times the second
product, which is water,

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.310
minus the first reactant,
which is our glucose,

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:54.150
and we have one of those,
and we have 6 oxygens.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.960
So products minus reactants.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.330
Pay attention to
the stoichiometry.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.210
You need to multiply
the heats of formation

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:06.860
by the number of molecules so
then we can put in the values

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.180
that we just saw.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:14.810
C02 minus 392 for our
water minus 285 minus--

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:19.490
and here we have a
minus 1,260 for glucose.

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.550
And again, 6 times 0 because
the oxygen is already

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.380
in its most stable state.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.570
And if we do the
math correctly, you

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:31.050
get minus 2,816
kilojoules per mole,

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.070
and that is exactly
the experimental value.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.500
And it's because the
heats of formation

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.360
are also experimental, so
this is a very precise number.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.190
When you use the
heats of formation

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:50.180
you're going to get a much
closer value to experimental.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.280
And this was a bit
easier than thinking

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.530
about every bond
that would be broken

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:58.310
and every bond that
would be formed.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.550
One more way that
you can do this.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.800
And this takes
advantage of something

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:08.900
known as Hess's Law and
the fact that enthalpy

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:14.270
is a state function, which means
that it's independent of path.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.429
So if you were
climbing a mountain

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:19.159
and you wanted to go
from point A to point B,

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:22.130
you could climb all the way
up to the top and go back down

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:26.830
or you could just go right from
A to B and it wouldn't matter.

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:30.230
Your delta H would be
the same in both cases

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.540
because it's
independent of path.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:35.960
So it only matters
what the values

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.510
are for your reactants
and your final products.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.030
It doesn't matter how you
get from the reactants

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:42.290
to the products.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.050
Delta H is going to be the same.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:48.800
And because of this, you
can take different routes

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.969
if their equations for
different parts of your reaction

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.010
that are already known
with values of delta

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:59.360
H-- you can add those equations
together and then add together

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.450
the delta H's to
get a new value.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:06.380
So Hess's Law-- if there are
two or more equations that

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.260
are added to give another
chemical equations

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.520
then you can add up the delta
H for the reactions of each

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.040
of the individual
equations to get

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.140
the sum for your new equation.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:25.170
So let's do this now, again,
for glucose and oxygen.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.880
So if we have these
three equations

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.260
here-- this one
is showing glucose

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.470
plus oxygen being broken
down to the elements that

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.090
are in the most stable state.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.900
So graphite, H2
and O2 for glucose.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.730
And then our 6 O2s are
there on both sides

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.400
because it's already in
the most stable state.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.690
We're going to be forming CO2
from the elements in the most

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.210
stable state and also water.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:53.300
So we can add these
together, paying attention

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.520
to the stoichiometry.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.810
So we need to multiply this
equation by 6 and this equation

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:04.000
by 6, and then we should be
able to do some canceling

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.630
and make sure that we're getting
our equation of interest.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:12.080
So we can cancel these
6 O2s with these,

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.130
we can cancel these
O2s with these,

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:19.850
and we can cancel
this H2 with this.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:24.770
And that leaves us with
glucose plus 6 oxygens going

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:29.360
to 6 CO2s and 6 waters.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.820
So this is going to work now.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.300
And now, since we added
this together to get this,

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.360
we can add our
delta H of reactions

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.440
together to get a new
delta H of reaction.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.610
Oh, sorry.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.190
I forgot to cancel my graphites.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.870
There we go.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.420
Now we're good.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.310
Didn't notice them there.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.210
So our delta H for reaction.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:57.710
We saw before that the
formation of CO2 from elements

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.534
in its most stable
state was minus,

00:36:59.534 --> 00:37:01.700
so now we've just changed
the sign because now we're

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.660
going the opposite direction.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.880
So we have a positive value
for that delta H of reaction.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.210
Now we have 6 times
the heat of formation

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:16.070
of CO2 and 6 times the
heat of formation of water

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.870
because that's what
those equations are.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:20.170
Those are the heat of
formation reactions.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:25.770
And if we add this all
together then we get the number

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.170
that we saw before.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.470
So it doesn't matter
what path we take.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:32.570
We're going to get
to that same answer.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:34.740
And this one, since
we're using information

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.770
that all has to do
with heat of formation,

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.560
it's not really very different
from the one we did before.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.350
But you can use
Hess's Law for delta H

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:46.520
of reactions that are
not heats of formation.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.940
If equations are available
that can be added

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.310
or summed to get
your net reaction,

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:56.840
then you can add or subtract
these values to get a new delta

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:03.980
H. Don't forget
kilojoules per mole.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.130
So we have our three different
ways-- bond enthalpies,

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:10.450
heat of formation,
and Hess's Law.
