00:00:25.872 --> 00:00:28.580
PROFESSOR: So again,
the equivalence point

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.660
is where you've added all of
the moles of your strong base

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.240
that you need to convert
all the moles you

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.803
had of the weak acid
to its conjugate base.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.610
So if we have this
type of problem,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.780
a strong base
titrating a weak acid,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.600
the pH is going to
be greater than 7

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.660
at this equivalence or
stoichiometric point.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.090
And we can see that in the plot.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.880
Here is pH 7, little
arrow going up

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.590
indicating it's going
to be greater than 7.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.080
And that's because we have
just the conjugate base left

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.630
at this point.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.170
So again, pH depends
on the property

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.070
of the salt that's formed
at the equivalence point.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.620
And when it is a weak acid being
titrated with a strong base--

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.940
and that's what we have here,
weak acid, strong base--

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.970
you're going to get
a salt and water.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.600
But this salt, now, is going
to have basic properties.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.440
And we saw this before that
sodium has no effect on pH.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.780
Things in group 1 are not
going to have any effect on pH.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.810
But HCO2- is a conjugate
base of a weak acid.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.700
It is a weak base itself.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.580
So this is going to be basic.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.420
And so that's why the pH is
going to be greater than 7.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.290
Remember, salt
and water problems

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.690
really break down to weak
acid and water or weak base

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.820
and water problems,
depending on what

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.760
went into a form
that particular salt.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.180
So when you're doing
these problems,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.300
and if you're on the exam
and you get to the end

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.539
and you know that the pH
should be greater than 7,

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.695
but the pH you calculated,
for some reason

00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:14.000
and you don't know where
you made the mistake,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.440
is less than 7.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.120
If you say to me, this
doesn't make sense.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.690
It should be greater
than 7, because it should

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.460
be basic at this
point, should just

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.300
have conjugate base around,
you will get points back

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.360
for recognizing that the answer
you gave me can't be right.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.200
So always pay attention to
what answer you're getting.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.470
Does that answer make sense?

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.850
I really care more about
that people understand what's

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.990
going on, than they can
do the math perfectly

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.210
in a very short amount of time.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.560
But you'll often be asked
to calculate the pH.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.940
So let's think about how
we would calculate the pH.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.260
We know it's greater than
7, but what is it exactly

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.020
for this problem.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.840
And to do that, we
need to first know

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.660
what the volume is going to be.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.100
What volume of that
strong base do we

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.130
need to add to reach the
stoichiometric or equivalence

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.130
point?

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.450
So we had in the
beginning 2.5 times 10

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.190
to the minus third
moles of our weak acid.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.990
So that means that at
the stoichiometric point,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.200
we're going to form that number
of moles of conjugate base.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.900
And that also means
that to do that we

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.560
need to add that number of
moles of the strong base.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.250
So we need to add 2.5 times
10 to the minus third moles

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.960
of our strong base.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.150
We know the concentration in
the strong base, 0.15 molar.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.420
So we can calculate
that the volume we need

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.390
is 16.7 milliliters.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.370
Now, the total volume to get
to the stoichiometric point

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.310
was 25-- that's what
we had originally--

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:56.730
plus this 16.74, so 41.7
milliliters or 0.0417 liters.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.190
We can calculate the molarity
of the conjugate base that's

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.020
formed.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.090
How many moles in this total
volume gives us a molarity

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.740
of 0.0600 molar.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.670
And now, we can go ahead
and solve the problem.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.274
But why don't you
tell me how we're

00:04:15.274 --> 00:04:16.399
going to solve the problem.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.493
What are we going to use
to solve this problem?

00:04:33.826 --> 00:04:35.075
Let's just do 10 more seconds.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.690
Yep, so Kb, and so if we look
at this problem for a minute,

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.690
so this is, again,
the type of problem,

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.130
it's a weak base problem.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.090
We've converted
all the weak acid

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.490
we had to its conjugate
base, because we

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.440
added enough moles
of the strong base

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.150
to convert all the weak
acid to the conjugate base.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.150
So the equivalence point,
all we have is the weak base.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.610
So this is a base
and water problem.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.210
So we write our base plus water
going to the conjugate acid

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.810
plus hydroxide.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.610
And when it's a base
and water problem,

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.100
you should have hydroxide
on the other side.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.920
So we can set up
this expression.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.400
We get 0.06 molar
minus x, x plus x.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.650
And we can use Kb to
solve the problem.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.750
And Kb, in this case, is 5.6
times 10 to the minus 11th.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:52.910
That's going to be equal to x
squared over 0.0600 minus x.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.540
So if I was given Ka
and I now need Kb,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.616
what do I use to
convert Ka and Kb?

00:06:00.616 --> 00:06:03.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.350
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.470
And you can use Kw
to solve it, yep.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.460
So we can easily convert
between these two.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.770
Not a problem.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.501
So this is how you
would do the problem.

00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:16.750
And always remember, ask
yourself what type of problem

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.290
it is.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.530
If it's weak base and
water, you want a Kb.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.200
So can I use
Henderson-Hasselbalch for this?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.930
AUDIENCE: No.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.260
PROFESSOR: No, I can't.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.060
And you should not as well.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.680
So what do you do after this?

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.300
We should be able
to go from here.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.600
We're not going to go
through all the steps.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.710
We can simplify, pretend x is
small, make sure x is small.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.780
And in this case, x is
quite small of 1.83 times 10

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.000
to the minus sixth molar.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.380
From that, we have to
remember that x, now,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.410
is the hydroxide
ion concentrations.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.500
So we're going to calculate
pOH first and then calculate pH

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.730
by subtract 14.00 minus
pOH to get us the pH.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.680
And now, it's 8.26.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.960
That's above 7.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.670
That number makes sense.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.350
If I had stopped
and forgotten what

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.290
x was and realized
the pH was 5.74,

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.950
I should have realized
there was a problem there.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.470
So weak base in water problem.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.070
So we go up here.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.190
That's Point S, the
stoichiometric point.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.030
We have a pH of 8.26.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.947
Now, we've added this
little E at the end.

00:07:29.947 --> 00:07:32.280
We're just going to think
about the last type of problem

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.020
you might see, which is
past the equivalence point.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.870
So here, you are at a
volume beyond the volume

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.580
needed to get you to
the equivalence point.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.770
And at this point, you have
your conjugate base in solution.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:52.040
But you're adding a lot of
concentrated base of sodium

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.730
hydroxide to that solution.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.720
So the amount of the conjugate
base that you have there

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.450
is really not going to
contribute to pH anymore,

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.320
not compared to the
pH change that's

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.860
going to be caused by just
putting extra strong base

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.140
into solution.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.420
So the pH is really going to be
determined by the excess amount

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.160
of any OH you have.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.790
And you can pretty much
forget all the work you just

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.422
did in calculating what the pH
was due to the conjugate base,

00:08:21.422 --> 00:08:23.380
because that's going to
be overwhelmed by this.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.380
And I'll show you
that that's true.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.330
So what this is then is a
strong base in water problem.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.450
So beyond the
equivalence point now,

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.820
we're a strong base
and water problem.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.860
So how do we do this?

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.570
And we saw this
already, but we'll just

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.470
review it one more time.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.840
So we're 5 mills past
the equivalence point.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.280
So we're going to figure out
how many extra moles of OH

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.580
we added.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.320
5 mills times our
concentration, so we

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.380
have 7.5 times 10 to the minus
fourth moles that are extra.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.710
And now, we need to
calculate the concentration.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.230
And we have to
remember our volume.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.970
So we added 5 extra mills.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.090
We had 25 to begin with.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:12.280
And we use 16.7 to get
to the equivalence point.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.540
And so when you have the
whole volume in there,

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.580
you can calculate that your
concentration is 0.016 molar

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.600
OH.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.230
Then from that, we
can calculate pOH.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.140
And from that, we calculate pH.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.340
And it's 12.21.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.130
And just to convince
you that it was OK

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.180
that I forgot all about
that conjugate base--

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.870
remember, the
concentration that we

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:43.840
had calculated of OH that is due
to that weak base in solution?

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.420
This number, really small
compared to that number.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.880
And if you want to
be very particular,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.236
you can add this to this
before calculating this.

00:09:53.236 --> 00:09:54.860
But it's really not
going to give you--

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.060
to the number of significant
figures you have,

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.420
it's not going to make
any difference whatsoever.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.500
So this is a strong
base in water problem.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.970
We're only going to think about
how many moles extra of OH

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.350
do we have, and what
is the total volume,

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.650
and then you're done.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.590
So now, we've done
this whole curve.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.940
We started at the beginning.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.860
It was a weak acid
problem down here.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.850
We went into the
buffering region.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.260
We can use
Henderson-Hasselbalch here.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.810
We can do a very
simple calculation

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.460
at the half equivalence
point, pH equals pKa.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.370
Then at the
stoichiometric point,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.300
we're a weak base problem.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.980
And then we're a
strong base problem.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.920
So you can now do the
same thing the other way.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.684
Yeah, question.

00:10:40.684 --> 00:10:44.925
AUDIENCE: What if you
were given a problem like,

00:10:44.925 --> 00:10:46.865
figure out what the
buffering region was?

00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:48.805
We never calculated E.

00:10:48.805 --> 00:10:50.620
PROFESSOR: Yes, right.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.330
So we skipped E, because there
was a lot of different points.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:11:03.560
Yeah, so if you are
in a region where

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.220
you have both conjugate
acid, conjugate bass,

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.180
you can assume that's
in the buffering region.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.550
So you need to have both to
be in the buffering region,

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.270
if the problem only has
your weak acid in water

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.020
and initially you have
sort of zero of the other.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.940
But if you've added some of
the strong acid, strong base,

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.600
that means you've
converted some,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.620
but you know you're not at
the equivalence point yet.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.120
You can assume a buffer problem.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.190
And then pretty much, it's kind
of in the buffering region,

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.040
unless it's right
here or right there.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.250
So pretty much
anywhere in here, you

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.310
can assume it's going
to be a buffer problem.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.820
And when you do the
subtraction, you

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.994
should see that you
had your weak acid.

00:11:40.994 --> 00:11:42.785
And you've converted
some to the conjugate.

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:45.280
And you can see that
you have amounts of both

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.090
when you do that subtraction.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.080
And when you have
concentrations of both,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.580
then you're in the
buffering region.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.284
AUDIENCE: So you
would go from B to F?

00:11:52.284 --> 00:11:55.060
PROFESSOR: So you
would do D the same way

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.080
that you did B. Yeah,
that would be the same.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.175
And then if you want to make
sure that you're not there--

00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:02.800
but you should know
that when you start

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.010
the problem, because when you
start doing these problems,

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.840
you're going to calculate, say,
how much moles of the weak acid

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.540
you had.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.815
And then you calculate how many
moles of the base you added.

00:12:13.815 --> 00:12:15.440
And if they're equal,
then you're like,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.170
oh, I'm not in the
buffering region.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.496
I'm at the equivalence point.

00:12:18.496 --> 00:12:20.870
If they're not equal, if the
number of moles you've added

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.510
are lesser the strong
base but non-zero,

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.010
then you're in the
buffering region.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.314
Any other good questions?

00:12:30.314 --> 00:12:32.230
And we're not going to
go the other direction.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.479
We're not going to do all
the points in the other one.

00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:37.380
But there's a
problem set for that.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.850
But I'm not going to
leave acid-base quite yet.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.700
We're almost there,
but not quite yet,

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.550
because I've got to say a
little more about pKa's.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:52.570
So pKa's are not just important
in titration problems.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.160
And I want to share with you
one of my favorite videos

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.705
about why pKa's are important.

00:13:05.689 --> 00:13:06.355
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:06.355 --> 00:13:08.320
- My name is Samuel Thompson.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.774
I'm a rising senior at MIT.

00:13:09.774 --> 00:13:11.190
And for the past
three years, I've

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.090
been working with Alice Ting.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.660
My project is in the field
of chemical biology, which

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.490
means that I'm a tool maker.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.290
And I've been making
tools to allow

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.790
people to look at proteins.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.900
We want to see where they
are, what they're doing,

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.410
what they're interacting with.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.360
But all proteins
and all cells are

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.110
completely transparent
whenever you look

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.790
at them under a microscope.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.090
So we use an enzyme to attach an
organic molecule-- a very, very

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.760
small molecule-- to the
protein, so that we get

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.940
the same fluorescent output.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.410
We see a bright light whenever
we shine laser light on it

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.330
and look at it
under a microscope.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.100
After some very
complicated research,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.210
we came up with a very
basic problem in our design.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.170
We had a mismatch between our
probe and the pH of the cells.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.989
Cells typically exist
at about 7.2 to 7.5 pH.

00:13:57.989 --> 00:13:59.280
That's what's healthy for them.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.905
They need that.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.640
And if you go outside
those boundaries,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.890
they're very unhealthy,
and they behave abnormally.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.770
And the pKa of our
probe is also 7.5.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.670
pKa is the point where
any sort of species

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.580
is half protonated,
half deprotonated.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.070
And our probe needs
to be deprotonated.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.300
It needs to be in some
sort of basic solution

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.740
compared to its
pKa in order for it

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.450
to be visible, in
order for it to glow.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.020
Since our pKa of our
fluorescent molecule

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.320
and the pH of the
cells exactly match up,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.530
that means that our probe
is half protonated, half

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.160
deprotonated.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.920
This is a huge problem
for our labeling,

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.050
because it immediately means
that we're at 50% efficiency.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.990
We couldn't get more than half
of these molecules to glow.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.390
And we couldn't see more
than half of our proteins.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.087
Our solution was to change
the pKa of the probe.

00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:50.920
So we changed to a
different molecule that's

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.440
very, very similar and we hoped
would work with our system

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.610
but has a much lower
pKa, 3.5, which

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.650
allows us to work through
all these neutral pHs

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.070
and these physiological pHs
and still be very bright

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.300
and still be completely
deprotonated.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.100
A lot of diseases are
caused by mutations,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.460
which change where proteins go.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.910
It either locks them into
a specific compartment

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.290
or puts them in places
that they don't need to be.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.630
I hope that my work can
be used by other people

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.590
to study their own systems.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.080
They can use my process
to label that protein

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.920
and then look at disease
cells and find out

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.450
where that protein is
and what it's doing.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.360
Hopefully, this can
be used to unlock

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.410
the keys to new therapeutic
methods and medicine.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.690
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.860
PROFESSOR: So that was
Samuel-- he graduated;

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.950
he's now at UCSF in
graduate school--

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.470
and talking about his
research in Alice Ting's lab.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.600
Samuel was my academic advisee.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.020
He's a chemistry major.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.200
And then in the later
part of graduate school,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.570
he actually switched and
did research in my lab.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.000
And so that was one
of my favorite videos.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.650
And I miss Samuel.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.360
Anyway so it shows an
undergraduate, just like you,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.110
caring about pKa's So that's
why it's one of my favorites.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.870
So let's do a couple of
clicker questions related

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.550
to Samuel's video.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.370
And so now, consider, what
if the pKa of the probe

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.130
had been 10?

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:27.490
How much of it would
glow at physiological pH?

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.045
What can you say
about that probe?

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.460
10 more seconds.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.170
So let's take a
look at the answer.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:05.990
So most of it-- not much of
it is going to be glowing

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.660
is the answer to that part.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.250
And let's just look at why
that is true for a minute.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:17.020
So this is what Samuel
talked about in his video

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:22.089
that, at pH 7-- the
physiological pH,

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.520
they had one probe where the
pKa was equal to the pH they

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.640
were using.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.800
And so as Samuel
told you, if we think

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.050
about Henderson-Hasselbalch,
that's

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.810
going to mean that
the ratio of HA to A

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.440
is going to be equal to 1.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.710
It's one to one.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.680
And so that's going to mean
only 50% maximum efficiency.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.070
And so here you see that when
the pH is equal to the pKa,

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:50.150
you have equal moles of
HA as you have A minus.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.280
So you're not going to have
more-- you can't possibly

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:58.450
have more than 50%
efficiency, 50% more glowing.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.820
But then in their
design strategy,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.050
what they did was they
used another molecule

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.960
with a different
pKa, one of 3.5.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.465
And now, the pH is much
greater than the pKa.

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:14.500
And so as you go above,
pH above the pKa,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.150
you get more and more
deprotonated species.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.820
So if you use
Henderson-Hasselbalch here,

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.410
you could calculate the
ratio is 1 to 8,000.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.890
So you're going to have
a lot of glowing probe

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.300
under those circumstances.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.870
And then the clicker question
that I just asked you is,

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.070
what happens then
if your pKa was 10?

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:41.470
So now, you have a situation
where the pH is below the pKa.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.750
And if we did the
math, we would see

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.830
that the ratio now of protonated
to deprotonated is 400 to 1,

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.800
so very little glowing.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.050
So this is an important
thing to think about

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.460
in doing these other
kinds of problems.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.790
When the pH equals the
pKa, you have equal amounts

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:04.940
of HA and A minus; pHs
above, more deprotonated;

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.510
pHs below, more protonated.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:14.010
So let's try one more
clicker question.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:20.870
And see now thinking about the
pKa's of three different groups

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:25.040
here for this amino acid,
which structure would you get?

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.475
Should this amino group be
protonated or deprotonated, NH3

00:19:30.475 --> 00:19:35.800
or NH2, OH or O minus,
and OH or O minus here?

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.794
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:19:47.794 --> 00:19:49.251
I know a lot of
people aren't done,

00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:50.990
but we have a demo
that we need to get to

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.630
and a t-shirt vote to get to.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.139
Not bad.

00:20:05.139 --> 00:20:06.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.960
Oh, we have no answer to it.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:14.940
But it is D. So this
is the structure.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.220
So here, for these two, we
have pKa's that are high.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.210
They're above the pH, so we
expect them to be protonated.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.870
And here, we have a pKa
that's below the pH,

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.510
so we expect that
to be deprotonated.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.270
So again, you want
to think about, how

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:35.130
does the pKa relate to the pH.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:40.590
So that is now the
end of the acid-bases,

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:43.420
end of Exam 3 material.
