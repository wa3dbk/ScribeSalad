CATHERINE DRENNAN: So now
we go on to the breakdown

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.880
of the octet rule.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.720
So we've established
the octet rule

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.940
and now we're going to shake
it all up and see its flaws.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.490
So case 1, we're going to
consider what happens--

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.580
and this again is
today's handout--

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.780
consider what happens when
you have an odd number

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.990
of valence electrons.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.990
Case 1, all right,
so for molecules

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.490
with an odd number of
electrons, odd number

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.180
of valence electrons, it's
not possible for every atom

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.270
to have a complete octet.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.400
That involves
pairing, that involves

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.600
even numbers of electrons.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.830
So let's look at an
example of a place

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.800
where we have an odd number
of valence electrons.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.780
And this is our friend,
CH3, our methyl group

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.790
that we saw a few minutes ago.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.520
So we can also
write it like this.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.750
And we can come up with a Lewis
structure for our methyl group.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.380
So hydrogen, remember, it only
brings one valence electron

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.620
to the table.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.390
There are three hydrogens.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.180
Carbon brings four
valence electrons.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.920
So in sum, we have seven,
an odd number of electrons.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.260
To complete our
octets-- remember,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.760
hydrogen is an exception,
it only needs two,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.730
it just has that 1s orbital--
so we need two electrons for it

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.660
for it to be happy.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.130
There are three hydrogens.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.650
That's six.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.100
Carbon needs eight.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.780
So total you need 14 to make
carbon and hydrogens happy.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.090
So if you consider then how
many bonding electrons you have,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.780
that's the number of electrons
needed for your octet,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.890
minus the number of
valence electrons you have,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.580
so we get seven
bonding electrons.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.030
How do you have seven
bonding electrons?

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.870
A bond has two electrons in it.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.840
So let's look at
that, what do we do.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.510
Well, we can put
six-- six is good--

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.390
assign two electrons for
the bond between this carbon

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.130
and this hydrogen, two between
this carbon and this hydrogen,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.090
two between this carbon and
this hydrogen, six is good.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.430
But now what do we do
with the extra one?

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.690
We have seven.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.440
So we're just going to stick
that right there on the carbon.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.010
So what is this molecule, then?

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.630
Well, what this molecule
is is a radical species.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.250
So a radical species
is a molecule

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.920
with an unpaired electron.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.440
And usually radical
species are very reactive.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.230
Bonding electrons don't
want to be unpaired,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.460
they want to be in bonds.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.230
So they're highly reactive,
they're sort of searching out

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.900
to either get rid
of their electron,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.180
to get another electron.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.270
They're very, very
reactive species.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.120
So radicals turn out to be
very important in human health.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.590
And free radicals in biology
are both good and bad.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.500
So in the bad category,
we have the fact

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.810
that free radicals damage
DNA, that leads to mutations

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.160
in cancer and death.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.940
Not good.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.340
And there are a lot of
radical species, many of which

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.410
involve oxygen, oxygen
radical species that

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.750
can be byproducts of metabolism,
common cigarette smoke.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.380
So there are natural
causes and also

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.890
man-made causes of
radical species.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.840
And this is very harmful.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.070
But radical species can
also be really good.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.480
So they're also
essential for life.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.740
They're signaling
agents in the body.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.160
Radicals are short-lived,
they're highly reactive,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.750
so they're not around very long.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.329
That's a great signaling agent.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.320
You want the signal
to turn itself off,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.580
so you want to have
something short-lived.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.110
They're also essential
for enzyme reactions.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.070
We have no cell division,
no growth, no multicellular

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.740
organisms if it weren't
for radical enzymes.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.430
And we use radicals
in our body when

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.090
we're fighting off illness.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.310
We generate radical species,
or the white blood cells

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.420
do, to kill invading microbes.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.770
So we're using radical
defense in our bodies

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.350
to fight off illness.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.750
So radicals are
both good and bad.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.630
So we talked about oxygen
radicals a little bit.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.740
One other radical
species is nitric oxide.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.460
And now why don't you identify
for me which of these molecules

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.008
is nitric oxide, knowing
that it's a radical?

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.605
All right, just 10 more seconds.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.930
OK, so some of you
might have just known

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.390
that that molecule
is nitric oxide.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.970
But if you had done
the calculation,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.960
you would have
realized that NO is

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.490
the only one where you get
an odd number of bonding

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.350
electrons.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.290
For these other molecules,
you have an even number

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.970
and they can't be radical
species with an even number.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.500
You need an odd number
of bonding electrons

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.160
to have a radical species.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.216
So this is nitric oxide, NO.

00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:10.610
And what does NO do?

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.130
So NO is an important
signaling molecule in the body.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.740
So it activates something
called guanylyl cyclase, which

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.100
is an enzyme, which then starts
a second signaling system that

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.210
involves GTP forming another
signaling agent, cyclic GMP.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.680
And this causes vasodilaiton.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.540
So scientists were very
interested in this pathway,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.390
and they noted
that cyclic GMP can

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.280
be degraded by an enzyme
turning off this signal.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.960
And they thought, if
we inhibit this enzyme,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.670
then we can have a
more continued effect

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.090
of vasodilaiton.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.630
This could be good
for people who

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.110
are suffering from
heart disease,

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.830
they need to get more
oxygen to their lungs,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.480
they might have emphysema.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.440
This could be a very good
thing for these people.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.900
So they designed an
inhibitor for this,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.270
but it turned out it didn't
work exactly as they expected.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.860
It did increase
vasodilaiton, but only

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.100
in one part of the body and only
for one gender of individual.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.360
So this led to the bestselling
pharmaceutical molecule

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.360
of all time.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.140
So a good example of how science
sometimes doesn't take you

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.610
exactly where you wanted
to go but nonetheless

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.300
was highly profitable.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.290
All right, so
nitric oxide-- and I

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.860
could tell you
that actually a lot

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.640
of the early work on nitric
oxide was done at MIT.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.180
And for people
who came from MIT,

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.860
there's a whole just-say-no
club here at MIT.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.810
And if you see this just-say-no,
it's about nitric oxide.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.410
So just be aware of that.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.000
OK, so now let's do a
Lewis structure for this

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.450
and see this radical species.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.031
So again, we need an odd
number of valence electrons,

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.280
if it's going to be a radical,
and that's what we get.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.650
So nitrogen has five valence
electrons and oxygen has six.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.910
So overall, we have 11.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.130
To have complete octets,
nitrogen needs eight,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:27.150
oxygen needs eight, so we need
16, which gives us five bonding

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.320
electrons, 16 minus 11.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.710
That makes it a radical species.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:38.780
And now we have six remaining
and we can put everything on.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.480
So we can put four bonding
electrons in between.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.090
We have five, we
can only put four

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.790
because you can't have a
bond with just one electron.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.610
So the fifth one is why
it's a radical species.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.650
But we have also six
remaining valence electrons.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.980
And we can distribute those
around one, two, three, four,

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.270
five, six.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.330
And that would be our molecule.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.520
All right, so this is a highly
reactive radical species.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.162
Yeah.

00:09:07.162 --> 00:09:09.994
AUDIENCE: How do you know
that the radical one goes

00:09:09.994 --> 00:09:11.410
on the end instead
of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.080
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Yeah, I actually

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.970
was going to calculate
whether we could use this,

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.780
but that is in fact
where that one is going.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.030
So that can be a clicker
question maybe for next time.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.363
I didn't actually get to try it.

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:26.640
I was thinking, we should
calculate the formal charges

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.830
and think about where
things are going to go,

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.700
but I didn't do that.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.780
But that's a good question.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:39.620
All right, so let's just
look at another example.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.350
Let's look at molecular oxygen
for a minute and do this one.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.320
So we're getting lots of
practice with Lewis structures

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:47.820
today.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.330
So we need to think
about valence electrons.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.570
So we have six for
oxygen plus six,

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:02.080
so we have 12 valence electrons.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:10.540
And we need eight plus
eight, we need 16.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.660
Then we need to figure out
how many bonding electrons.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.150
That's going to be
16 minus 12, or four.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.390
And now we can assign.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:32.310
And so we'll put first
two, and we have two more.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.430
So we're going to assign them.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:42.210
We have two more, and
we'll put those in.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.220
So we have a double bond.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.100
And then we can think about
whether we have any left.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.080
And we had 12 valence electrons.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.090
Now we've used four,
so we have eight more

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.430
that we can distribute.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.080
So we're going to make
some lone pairs here.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.940
So we can put two up
here, a lone pair up here,

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.300
a lone pair down here.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:15.470
One, two, three, four--
our eight extra electrons.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.750
And that looks lovely.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.630
Everything is happy.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.450
That seems like a
great structure,

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.660
except for the fact
that it's wrong.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.740
Lewis structures have failed us.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:36.150
So it turns out that
it's a biradical.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:41.990
And this is really why we
live life as we know it.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.520
Oxygen-- there was a
time before oxygen,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.330
life was very different.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.880
Oxygen came around,
changed life as we know it,

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.740
partly because it's a biradical.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.350
It has amazing properties,
it can do amazing chemistry.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.070
It allows us to break down
sugars and make energy.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.470
And so in reality,
oxygen is a biradical.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.910
We know that it is not a
double bond, as drawn there.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.590
This is the structure.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:15.500
We have one bond, not a
double bond, lone pairs.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.330
But then we have a
single dot over here,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.630
a single dot over here.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.210
That makes it a biradical.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.920
One radical on this oxygen,
one radical on that oxygen.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.630
And we can't explain this
with Lewis structures.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.556
We need molecular
orbital theory.

00:12:31.556 --> 00:12:32.930
But you're in luck
because that's

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.160
what we're going to
talk about on Monday.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.750
So Monday, I'll explain to
you why this is a biradical,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.690
but you're going to
have to wait for then.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:45.360
Because we have more
problems to address first,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.172
we have octet
deficient molecules.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.540
Some of these atoms, they're
just messing everything up

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.540
for us.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:01.610
OK, but the good news is,
octet deficient molecules--

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.530
incomplete octet.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.370
There's only two of them you
need to know-- boron, aluminum.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.840
There they are, just those two.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.890
So let's look at boron.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.440
So we have boron
and three fluorines.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.677
So we put boron in the middle,
three fluorines around it.

00:13:21.677 --> 00:13:23.760
How come I'm not putting
a fluorine in the middle?

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.830
Yeah, fluorine is always
going to be terminal,

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.260
it does not want to
be anywhere else.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.880
OK, so now we can look at
part of the periodic table.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.800
We see here is boron.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.290
Right below it, aluminum.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.220
So that helps us remember
those exceptions,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.030
they're right there.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.900
And now let's just calculate
this Lewis structure

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:53.330
and see about the
octet deficiency.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:58.540
So normally we would say boron
has three valence electrons.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.680
And fluorine-- there
are three fluorines,

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.430
it has seven, then 24.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.500
OK, that actually
would always be true.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.310
But now we're saying
boron should want eight--

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.630
and we'll come back
to that assumption--

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.850
to have complete octet.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.391
That's definitely how much it
wants to have a complete octet,

00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:15.370
but doesn't really
need a complete octet.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.370
Fluorines also want eight.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.030
That's a total of 32.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:25.970
And now, if we subtract, we
have eight bonding electrons.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.070
So we can assign
two per bond first.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.800
Now we've used six,
and we have two more.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.520
So we have two extras
that we can put in,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.460
that gives us a double bond.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.830
We can look at our
extra electrons.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:46.020
We had 24, we used eight now to
do bonding, so we have 16 left.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.090
And so we can put
two on this fluorine

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.490
that has the double bond.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.020
We can put six on the
fluorine with the single bond,

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.160
and another six
on this fluorine.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.160
And that adds up, that's great.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.360
And now we can
assign formal charges

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.880
and think about how
good this structure is.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:09.820
So if we do the formal charges,
let's look at boron first.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.550
So it had three
valence electrons,

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.770
it has no lone pairs, and
it has half of eight bonding

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.370
electrons, minus 1.

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.980
Not bad for a formal charge.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.490
What about this fluorine
with the double bond?

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.280
And that's a clicker
question, I told you

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.863
you'd be really good
at formal charges

00:15:27.863 --> 00:15:29.006
by the end of class today.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.030
OK, 10 more seconds.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.596
I think we can get in the 90's.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.512
Ah, it's killing me.

00:16:03.182 --> 00:16:04.890
All right, we have to
keep working on it.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.745
There's going to be more
clicker competition Friday.

00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:11.600
There will be a formal
charge question on it.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.680
And by the way, it's
OK to sit in groups.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.950
We've had back-to-back
wins of one recitation.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.420
I have noted that some
of them sit in a group.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.580
Just saying that is allowed.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:31.960
OK, so here, we have seven
valence electrons for fluorine,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.170
and there were four
lone pair electrons.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:43.950
Half of four bonding
electrons, so we

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.910
have a plus 1 charge there.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.200
And then let's finish up.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:56.650
So our single-bonded fluorines,
seven minus six lone pairs

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:57.740
for those.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.620
And they have one
bond, so they have

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.030
half of two bonding electrons,
and then there's zero.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.430
Overall, this is a
neutral molecule.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:10.250
So we have plus 1, minus 1,
that's a neutral molecule.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:19.760
This all seems good, except
that someone did an experiment

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.000
and found that all
three boron fluorine

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.970
bonds were single bonds.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.230
So again, Lewis
structures failed us.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.680
Experiment tells us
it's a single bond.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.180
And this is in fact the
correct structure here.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.230
Poor boron has an
incomplete octet.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.780
So it does not have
all the electrons,

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.240
but it's happy with that.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.850
It's OK with that because
it's one of the exceptions.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.940
And if we look at the
formal charges for it,

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.630
now we have boron, it had
three valence electrons,

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:00.560
no lone pairs, half of six
bonding electrons is three.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.260
So now it has a
formal charge of zero.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.050
And all three fluorines,
we have seven minus six,

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.320
they have one bond, so half
of two bonding electrons,

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.220
they also have a
formal charge of zero.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.560
So most elements would
not be OK with this.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.220
But boron, with its
three valence electrons,

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.960
thinks that this is just fine.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.667
So it's one of the exceptions.

00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:24.250
And again, we wouldn't
have known this

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.880
except for experimental data.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.890
Lewis structures
work 90% of the time,

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.580
but there are some where
experiment tells us

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.730
that the structure
we normally would've

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:39.480
done with our rules of
complete octets don't hold.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.830
OK, and we can rationalize
this by the fact

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.907
the formal charges are more
favorable on this molecule.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:55.670
One more exception--
valence shell expansion.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:01.270
This again, is not a
property of just any atom.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.154
It needs to be elements
that have been an n.

00:19:04.154 --> 00:19:04.820
What is n again?

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.520
n stands for?

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.370
AUDIENCE: Principle
quantum number.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.850
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Principle
quantum number, yes.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.390
You can't forget anything,
we're coming back to it,

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.430
we're coming back to all of it.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.390
Have a principle
quantum number that's

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.098
equal or greater than three.

00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:28.260
And what do we know about
things, what kind of orbitals

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.780
do we start talking about
when we have principle quantum

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.870
numbers of n that are
equal to or greater

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.492
than three, what happens?

00:19:36.492 --> 00:19:37.562
AUDIENCE: d-orbitals.

00:19:37.562 --> 00:19:41.750
CATHERINE DRENNAN: We get
some d-orbitals, exactly.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.542
d-orbitals-- I love d-orbitals.

00:19:44.542 --> 00:19:46.000
Closer to Thanksgiving,
we're going

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.750
to have a whole unit where
we're talking about d-orbitals.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.190
We save that for a
really special occasion.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.580
I love d-orbitals.
d-orbitals allow

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.050
for all sorts of
craziness to happen,

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.650
including valence
shell expansion.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:09.360
So this is most common when
the central atom is large

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.970
and it has a bunch of little
small, electronegative atoms

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.320
around it.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.950
And the transition metals,
with their d-orbitals,

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.010
they like this.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:24.270
And other things with d-orbitals
are cool with this as well.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.450
So the first example
we're going to look at

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:30.740
is phosphorus with five
chlorines around it.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.460
Phosphorus is
pretty large, and it

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.950
has chlorine, which is a
fairly small electronegative

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:38.800
atom around it.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.900
And it has five
of them around it.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.270
So we'll put our
phosphorus in the middle

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.990
and we'll put our five
chlorines around it.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.640
Now we need to count
valence electrons because we

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.210
need to draw Lewis structures.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:58.300
So phosphorous brings five
valence electrons to the gain.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.400
The chlorines each have seven,
and there are five of them.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.530
So we have 40 altogether.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.870
Phosphorus, we
think, wants eight.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.230
It would, for a complete octet.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.250
Also, chlorine wants eight,
and there are five of those.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:18.710
So total, if we have complete
octets, we need 48 electrons.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:23.160
48 minus 40, the number
needed for the complete octet

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.755
minus the number of
valence electrons

00:21:24.755 --> 00:21:27.870
gives you eight
bonding electrons.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:32.610
So we're going to assign
two per bond, up to eight,

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.900
and there we go.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.360
Now does that look like a
good Lewis structure to you?

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.200
AUDIENCE: No.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.033
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah,
it's pretty obvious

00:21:39.033 --> 00:21:41.230
that there's
something wrong here.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.390
So this is not
going to work out.

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.790
We're not going to add
chlorine to another chlorine

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.050
because they don't
like to do that.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.270
Halogens really
like to be terminal.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.800
So that's not going to work.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.470
So we've got to use some extra
electrons and make a new bond.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.070
So we need to have
five bonds, so that

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.740
means we need to use 10.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.410
We need to have 10
bonding electrons.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:09.660
And when we borrow another
two, we can make another bond.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.430
We had 40, we've now used 10.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.730
We had no choice, we had to use
10, so we have 30 lone pairs.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:23.050
And we have five chlorines
that all want six lone pair

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.060
electrons to complete their
octet, and six times five

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.680
is 30, so this works
out beautifully.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.330
So this is a very
happy structure now.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.380
Phosphorus is OK, it's large.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.040
It has an n equal 3.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.520
It's OK being expanded,
and chlorine is very happy.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.100
So the bottom line is there
are certain kinds of elements

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.230
that you can expand.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.220
They can have more
than an octet.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.660
They can have five bonds.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.420
Others, carbon-- no, carbon is
not going to have five bonds.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.040
But phosphorus is OK.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.490
So some things can be expanded,
some things can't be expanded.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:04.410
So you have to think about
what the expansion would do

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.250
and whether that
would be allowed.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.275
Let's do one more example.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:19.450
Chromium with four
oxygens, minus 2 charge.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.360
We see chromium over here.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.540
It's got d electrons.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.170
Let's see what happens.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.700
So here we have our
skeleton structure.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.350
We put chromium in the middle
and our four oxygens around it.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.050
Now we have a bracket around
it with a little minus 2.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.040
Note the minus 2 because
it has a charge on it.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.430
Don't forget about the charge.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:47.720
And now we need to see how
many valence electrons.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.030
So chromium is
going to bring six.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.710
So we can look at where it is in
the periodic table-- one, two,

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.170
three, four, five, six.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.820
Our oxygen is up here.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.850
Also, have six
valence electrons.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:04.010
And don't forget about the
charge on the molecule.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.160
So when it's minus 2, you
have to add two electrons.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.150
It has extra two
electrons, so add those in,

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.910
which gives you a total of 32.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.640
What do you need for your octet?

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.520
So eight for the
chromium, four times eight

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.240
for all the four oxygens.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:27.040
We need 40, then we can
take our 40, minus 32,

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.900
and we have eight
bonding electrons.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.460
That seems good, two per bond.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.670
We'll put those on.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:38.430
Then we'll see if we have
any lone pairs, and we do.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.160
32 minus eight gives us 24.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.960
The oxygens are
going to want six,

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.490
and there are four of them,
so that just looks awesome.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.280
So maybe this doesn't
need to expand.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.960
Let's see.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.710
What do we do to test this?

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.400
Experiments, or, if we
don't have a lab, we do--

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.460
AUDIENCE: Formal charge.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.910
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Formal charge.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.850
Yes, that's easier to
do in the classroom.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.980
All right, so we'll
calculate a formal charge.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.420
Chromium brought six
valence electrons.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.740
It has no lone pairs, it
has half of eight bonding

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.960
electrons, or four
bonds, plus two oxygens,

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.250
have six valence electrons, six
loan pairs, one bond, so half

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.480
of two, or minus 1.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.220
So the total charge here,
because you have four

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.400
of those, plus 2, is minus 2.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.380
So that's OK.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.310
But this has a pretty
big charge distribution.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.850
Everything has a
formal charge on it.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.700
And that doesn't make
molecules very happy,

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.110
they want formal charges of
zero, maybe plus or minus 1.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.890
But this is a lot
of formal charge.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.270
So maybe we can do better.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.950
And as someone
said, someone else

00:25:54.950 --> 00:26:00.970
did an experiment and-- yup--
they're not single bonds.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.990
So the experiment showed
that it's somewhere

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.310
between a single
and double bond.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.890
So this is not the
right Lewis structure.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.630
And one of the tip-offs could
be, whenever you see plus 2,

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:18.310
make sure there's not another
possible structure, or minus 2.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.350
So you can make
double bonds here.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.770
And if you do that and
calculate the formal charge then

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:29.800
on chromium, it had
six, no lone pairs,

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.640
but now it has six bonds, so
it has a formal charge of zero.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.620
The double-bonded oxygens had
brought six valence electrons,

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.930
they have four lone pairs, and
they have half of four bonding

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.270
electrons, now they're zero.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.050
And the two single oxygens
here are still minus 1.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.980
There are two of them, so
that equals the minus 2.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.480
But this has much less
charge separation.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.010
You have lots of zeros.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.980
You don't have any more
things with charges of 2.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.760
But this is not done.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.197
What else do we need here?

00:27:08.197 --> 00:27:09.630
AUDIENCE: Resonance structures.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.629
CATHERINE DRENNAN: We
need resonance structures,

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:15.450
that's right, because I just
put the double bonds here.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.870
I could have put them there,
or maybe somewhere else.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.940
And you can tell me how
many other structures

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.780
you need to complete this.

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:38.715
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.630
Yup, this is a
good one, I think,

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.930
that helps when you
do it in a team.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.950
Everyone sees different ones.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.050
So there actually
are four other ones.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.910
You can try to write that
out and prove it to yourself.

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.720
There are four other
structures you can do.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.920
And you need all of those to
get the correct structure.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.790
So these structures are correct,
it is a resonance structure.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.600
There's less formal
charge separation.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.200
OK, so that's the end
of Lewis structures.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.590
And we're going to talk about
shapes and molecules on Friday.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.080
And problem set
is due on Friday,

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.390
and it has lots of
Lewis structures

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.940
in it, so don't leave
it to the last minute.
