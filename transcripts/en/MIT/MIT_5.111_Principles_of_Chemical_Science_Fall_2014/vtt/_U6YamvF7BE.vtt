CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Click in your response.

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:53.910
All right, let's
just do ten seconds

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.580
on the clicker question.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.150
OK, so 82%.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.250
I like it when we get into
the 90s, just FYI, for these.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.580
So since this is similar
to one we did last time,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.730
it's just to remind you again
of the first part of problem

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.130
set one where we
have this material

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.100
that you need to
learn how to cover.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.031
So does anyone want to tell me
how they got the right answer?

00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:37.780
And this is not going
to be a great prize.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.446
There's going to be
better prizes later.

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:42.070
This is an American Chemical
Society pen for this one,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.990
since we had a similar
question last time.

00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:47.840
I should've told
you it was going

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.820
to be a better prize later.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.861
Now no one's going to--
everyone's going to wait.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.470
See if that's turned on.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.500
No, I guess not.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.840
AUDIENCE: So you find
the limiting reactant

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.690
by dividing the amount
of moles for both

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.340
by the molar coefficient.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.480
And you see that it's
at the O. And then

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.160
you just do 12 times
the molar fraction,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.779
which is just one AL203 for
every 3FEO and you get 4.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:27.820
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Great.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.740
So if you haven't
practiced these yet,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.760
go ahead and practice.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.260
Yeah!

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.533
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.140
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK, so
let's think about what we

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.990
were talking about on Friday.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.460
We were talking about
discovery of the electron

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.050
and the nucleus, and realized
through the experiments

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.870
that the atom is
mostly empty space.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.200
But there is this
concentrated small part

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.370
of the nucleus that can
deflect alpha particles,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.110
or ping pong balls.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.610
And this is a really
small concentrated part,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.130
so that would be like the head
of a pin in a room somewhat

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.210
bigger than this, or a pea in
the size of a sports arena.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.330
The nucleus is very tiny
compared to the atom.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.150
And the atom is, again,
mostly empty space.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.750
So this discovery was amazing
of these subatomic particles

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.470
and was really changing what
people were thinking about.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.947
So at that time, they
started to realize

00:03:28.947 --> 00:03:31.030
in doing these experiments
and the experiments I'm

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.580
going to tell you today that
they needed a different way

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.650
of thinking about matter.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.070
And to explain the
observations that scientists

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.820
were making at the time, they
needed to think about the fact

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.960
that radiation had both
wave-like and particle-like

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.010
properties.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.390
And matter had, also, wave-like
and particle-like properties.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.330
And also that
energy is quantized

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.480
into these discrete
bundles called photons.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.230
So we're going to be talking
about these new discoveries

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.210
and the data that
didn't fit today,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.720
and how we came up with
this new mechanics that

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.200
helped to explain the properties
that were being observed.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.890
So we're going to start
today with a wave particle

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.660
duality of light.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.990
So we're going to talk
about light as a wave.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.330
And we're going to first talk
about the characteristics

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.620
of waves, which is
a little review.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.560
And then we're going to talk
about light as a particle

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.340
and get into the
photoelectric effect, which

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.670
was a really important
series of experiments

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.830
that help scientists
understand what was going on.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.480
So first we'll just have a
little review about waves.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.020
So some of you come from places
that probably don't have oceans

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.940
nearby.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.870
You are now living in a place
that does have an ocean nearby,

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.100
so you can go take the
blue line to Revere Beach.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.740
I always find doing a
chemistry problem set is

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.600
very relaxing on the beach.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.610
And you can watch
the water level

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.400
go up and down in this
repeated periodic fashion.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.230
So if you haven't
experienced water waves,

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.640
you should absolutely do that.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.030
So waves have this
periodic variation.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.950
So you could have
average water level,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.380
the water level will
go up and then go down

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.430
and go up and go down from
high levels to low levels.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.610
This same behavior is observed
for other types of waves,

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.470
such as sound waves.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.040
So here you would have
the average density,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.280
and the sound wave can go to
higher density, lower density,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.770
higher density, lower density.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.390
And this same periodic
behavior is also observed

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.370
with white light or
electromagnetic radiation

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.890
is also a periodic function.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.030
But here you have this periodic
variation of an electric field.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.600
So we have, whether
it's water waves

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.200
or if we have sound
waves or light waves,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.110
we always have this
periodic behavior.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.570
And you can define
this periodic behavior

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.870
by a number of different terms,
which we'll talk about now.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.300
Mostly we'll be focused
on light waves today,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.860
but these terms can apply to
other types of waves, as well.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.020
So we have amplitude.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.560
And that's the deviation
from the average level.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.200
So you can have a
positive amplitude

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.630
or a negative amplitude here.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.670
So this is the
height of the wave.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.530
You also have wavelength where
the abbreviation is lambda.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.730
And this is the distance
between successive maxima,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.910
so the distance from this
maxima to this maxima

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.210
is one wavelength.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.200
We also have frequency of the
wave, which helps to define it.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.510
Oh, I should say wavelength
can be up here or down here.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.260
They should be exactly the same.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:06.220
So frequency or nu is the
number of cycles per unit time.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.680
So we talk about wavelength,
amplitude, and frequency.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.370
And as you turn the
page, we can also

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.610
talk about the
period of the wave.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.400
So 1 over the frequency
is called the period,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.090
and it's the time it takes
for one cycle to occur.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.210
So the time that you
go from one maximum

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.150
to the other maximum
for one cycle

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.240
is the period of the wave.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.870
As with most things in
chemistry, there are units,

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.200
always think about your units.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.200
So units of frequency
are cycles per second,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.170
and that's also called a hertz.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.380
So you will often
just see per second,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.620
but sometimes you'll see
hertz in these problems.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.510
So those can be used
interchangeably.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.890
And one other term is
intensity, which is

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.920
equal to the amplitude squared.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.544
So for all of these
waves, there are

00:08:11.544 --> 00:08:13.460
these certain characteristics
you think about.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.940
The amplitude of the wave, the
wavelength, and the frequency,

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.920
the period of the wave, and
also the intensity of the wave.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.100
So now if we're thinking
about light waves, which

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.460
we will be most of
the time, we can also

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:35.030
think about the speed of
that light that is traveling.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.150
And so at time 0
if we're thinking

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:44.330
about the time it is going to
take this little orange dot,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.270
to move this pink
here that's labled,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.220
to move from here to
here, move one wavelength.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.030
So it has moved to
this second location.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.750
The time it takes
to do that is going

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.770
to be 1 over the frequency.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.700
If we think about then the
speed at which this will happen,

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.280
that it'll go from
here to here at time 0

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.500
to time 1 over the frequency or
one period as we just defined,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.310
now we can fill
out this equation.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.230
And see that the
speed is going to be

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.840
equal to the wavelength, lambda.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.120
So that's the distance
traveled, the wave

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.610
traveled one wavelength.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.490
And the time it took,
the time elapsed

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.300
was one period or 1
over the frequency,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.700
and then we can define
one of the equations

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.380
that you probably
don't really need

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.040
to have defined for you, which
is that the speed of light

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.740
is equal to the wavelength
times the frequency.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.740
And this is in usually
units of meters per second.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.500
So most people already know
what this speed of light,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.160
we're talking again about
light here, is equal to.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.860
And it has a constant speed.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.240
So electromagnetic radiation
has a constant speed,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.690
the speed of light.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.500
And the speed of light
is abbreviated c,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.840
equals the wavelength
times the frequency,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.290
which is 2.9979 times 10 to
the 8th meters per second.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.410
So most of you have
seen this before

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.180
and are well aware of it.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.420
This also has some of
the conversions on here.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.420
Speed of light is
quite fast and often

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.580
people have the expression
how fast [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.830
You're working at
the speed of light.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.260
And that's a pretty
valid thing to indicate

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.440
that you're doing things
very, very quickly,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.000
because that is fast.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.420
And in fact, if we had the
earth here and the moon here,

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.300
light would go like that.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.840
And it should take about
1.2 seconds to do that.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.660
So speed of light, very quickly.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.180
All right, so what's also
important in thinking

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.610
about this is that
the speed of light

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.180
is a constant, which
is going to mean

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.580
that these terms are related.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.790
So first before we move on,
let's do a clicker question.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.310
And you can all test
out that your clickers

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.340
are working again.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.590
How are we doing?

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.938
OK, let's do 10 more seconds.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.700
OK, 92%, that's awesome.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.610
All right, does
someone want to explain

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:29.190
how they could eliminate one
and two versus three and four

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.332
and get this one right?

00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:44.450
AUDIENCE: Sure, well it
looks like this problem

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.325
is asking us to look at
two different things,

00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:50.280
the wavelength of these
waves and the frequency.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.800
And you can look at the
distance between the two peaks

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.990
in both of the waves to see how
short or long the wavelength

00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.490
is.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.560
Wavelength A has a
much shorter distance

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.420
between peaks than B does.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.540
And then you're also looking
for nu, the frequency.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:13.830
So within a period of time you
can fit more waves of A than B,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:18.366
so it has a higher frequency.

00:13:18.366 --> 00:13:20.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:29.220
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So,
this prize here is LEGO.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.430
And LEGO has decided
to make girl chemists.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.560
So this is a little
LEGO girl chemist

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.760
that comes with pretty
colored erlenmeyer flasks.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.160
So that's very special.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.300
OK, yeah, so the
trick of that question

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.360
you just looked which was
the longer wavelength.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.600
And then you could rule
out that from the picture

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.450
and also realize that
there's connections because

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.590
of the constant speed of
light between the frequency

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.250
and the wavelength.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.200
So when you're talking
about wavelengths of light,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.690
c is always equal to a
product of the wavelength

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.110
times the frequency.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.030
So they're not
independent of each other.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.210
And if you know one,
you will know the other.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.060
So this is something you'll
come in very handy as you're

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.270
doing these problems.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.480
OK, so let's talk about
light for a minute

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.280
and look at these
different colors of light.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.120
So we go from red
at long wavelengths

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.510
to violet at the
shorter wavelengths.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:38.130
And so here the
wavelength is decreasing.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.570
And then if we think about
the corresponding frequencies,

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.660
up here then if we
have long wavelengths,

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.570
what are we going to have
in terms of the frequency?

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:53.790
Yeah, so we will have lower or
shorter frequencies going up

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.400
to higher frequencies up here.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.440
So again, we have
this relationship

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.140
because the speed of light
equals the wavelength

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.610
times the frequency.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.290
So you are not
responsible for memorizing

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.600
all of the wavelengths,
but you should

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.940
have a sense of the
order of the wavelengths

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.990
and certainly the relationship
between wavelength

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.490
and frequency.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.890
And there's going to
be a number of problems

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.380
later when we're talking
about colors of light that

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.320
are admitted from things or
colors that are absorbed where

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.640
it's really convenient to
have the order of wavelengths

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.780
memorized.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.730
So I thought I would
just help you out

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:38.190
with this by this
nice little song

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.180
from They Must Be Giants in Here
Comes Science's album, which

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.130
should help you always remember
the order of the wavelengths.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.190
So let's just see
if this will play.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.933
MUSIC: R is for red.

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:51.905
O is for orange.

00:15:51.905 --> 00:15:53.384
Y is for yellow.

00:15:53.384 --> 00:15:55.830
And G is for green.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.423
B is for blue.

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:58.776
I for indigo.

00:15:58.776 --> 00:16:01.700
And V is for violet.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.964
And that spells Roy G. Biv.

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:08.951
Roy G. Biv is a colorful man.

00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:13.280
And he proudly stands
at the rainbow's end.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.712
Roy G. Biv is a colorful
man and his name spells out

00:16:18.712 --> 00:16:20.008
the whole color spectrum.

00:16:20.008 --> 00:16:22.620
Roy G. Biv is a--

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.310
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK, so I
think you get the idea there.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.590
And it sticks in your head.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.470
And you may remember this
for the rest of your life,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.910
even if you don't want to.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.430
That's a very catchy song.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.260
In fact, my
six-year-old daughter

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.060
learned it when she
was about three,

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.860
and then we get very
upset if anybody

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.040
drew the colors that were
not in the appropriate order

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.160
of the rainbow.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.990
And she would come around
and correct their work.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.020
Anyway, it made her into a
little bit of a holy terror

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.990
but we're working on that.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.290
So in addition to the visible
light, which is actually

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:04.230
a very small part of
the range of waves

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.980
and so we have
visual light in here,

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.710
we can also think
about other waves that

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:15.810
go from then long wavelength
here and low frequency

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.569
to short wavelength
and high frequency.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:23.390
So we have radio waves on
the long wavelength end

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.130
and we have then microwaves.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.120
Microwaves are I think college
students' best friends.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.690
And as I am teaching this
course, since many of you

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.890
are freshmen, I feel the
need to compare my many years

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.860
of experience at MIT with you.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.500
Point number one, just
use the popcorn button

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.390
on the microwave.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.990
Don't think about how long
is it-- just use the popcorn

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.000
button on the microwave.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.480
I used to live in
Simmons for a while.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.250
3:00 AM fire drills or
fire things because someone

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.400
did not push the popcorn
button on the microwave

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.530
while making popcorn.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:10.890
Anyway, life lesson
number one, microwaves.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:15.930
So molecules behave differently
in these different kinds

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:16.550
of waves.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.360
So you can rotate infrared,
you're looking at vibrations.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.620
Of course here, visible light.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.690
We also have UV light.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.780
So when you go to the
beach on the green line

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.384
this weekend to do
prom set number two

00:18:30.384 --> 00:18:31.800
and look at the
waves, you'll want

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.230
to wear your sunscreen because
UV is, in fact, dangerous.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:40.640
So wear sunscreen,
advice number two.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.230
Then we have x-rays.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.660
Hopefully most of you do
not know one of the uses

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.790
to detect broken bones.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.830
And as you'll hear
later on, x-rays

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.190
can also be used to solve
structures of molecules

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.840
at atomic resolution.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.440
And then on the very
short wavelength,

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.830
then, we have
gamma rays as well.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.460
So again, you're not
responsible for memorizing

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.350
all of these numbers,
but you should

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.330
have a sense of the order of
these different types of rays

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.110
of the electromagnetic
spectrum, what's at short,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.510
what's at long wavelengths.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.130
All right, so waves
have other properties.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.120
And one of the most
important properties of waves

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.330
is that they can superimpose.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.020
So if you have two
waves, one drawn up here,

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.650
and one drawn down here, that
are in phase with each other,

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.610
which means that their
troughs are at the same place,

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.910
their peaks are
at the same place,

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.130
you can get constructive
interference

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.560
and that would look like this.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.120
So you have these waves
come together in phase

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.380
and you get this much larger
constructive interference.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.230
This property can
be very important

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:59.110
as we'll talk a little
bit more about later.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.810
You can also have what's called
destructive interference,

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.130
so when you have
out of phase waves.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.940
And the clicker, you can tell
me what that should look like.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.010
OK, ten seconds.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.710
Now looks like it's back
to being a darker color

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.820
box in the corner.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.960
Just likes to vary
it up on its own.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.126
OK, that's one second.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.370
Woo!

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.420
All right, 98%.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.430
We don't have to
explain that one.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.830
That one was pretty clear.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.410
So here you had they were
completely out of phase.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.170
So you had total
destructive interference.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:09.860
So that just looks
like a straight line.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.680
So the combination of
constructive and destructive

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.020
interference
actually has a number

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.830
of practical applications.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.300
So people who are
very interested

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.250
in constructive and
destructive interference

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:29.880
include people who are designing
symphony halls or classrooms.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.950
Actually, this is one
of the better classrooms

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.830
in terms of the acoustics.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.750
And the Boston Symphony
is actually, supposedly,

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.680
the third best in the world
in terms of acoustics.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.290
MIT students get nice
discounts, go check it out.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.160
Another practical
application was

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.550
in designing noise
canceling headphones.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.220
I brought a pair if some of
you have never tried them

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.150
and you want to come down after
class, you can give them a try

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.730
and see what you think.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.130
These headphones,
the Bose headphones,

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.490
were developed by a
former MIT professor.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.230
He passed away last year.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.710
He taught at MIT, taught
acoustics, for many years.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.160
And he was riding on an airplane
once and it was just so loud.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.070
And he was thinking, wow, I
was wondering if there a way

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.800
I can design some good
headphones to cancel

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.140
this noise.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.090
And he did and many billions
and billions and billions

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.660
of dollars later.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:30.060
So as you are an
MIT student, you

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.862
get a discount on
these headphones.

00:22:31.862 --> 00:22:34.320
So if you're going to buy them,
buy them while you're here.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:40.260
Also, when he died, the majority
share of his stock went to MIT.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.600
So you will buy
them, get a discount,

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.490
and you'll also be
giving MIT money

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.390
by buying these because we
get a lot of money for this.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:52.006
So I feel like this brings
up a really important point

00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:53.130
that I just want to stress.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.546
And I'll probably
mention a couple

00:22:54.546 --> 00:22:57.960
of times that the material
that you learn in your classes

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.200
here at MIT, and
in this class, you

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.520
will learn a lot of
really useful things.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.800
Some of that will lead to money.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.430
And as you make
lots of money, you

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:13.110
should remember where you
learned that and know that I

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.155
take both cash and checks.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.630
Another practical application
is actually in my own research.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.250
So we have a series
that I'm going

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.184
to be using I mentioned to
bring some different faces in.

00:23:26.184 --> 00:23:28.350
The first video I'm going
to show you in this series

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.190
is actually me.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.810
So it's not a different face.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.300
But when I asked other
people to make videos

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.800
about how they
were using chemical

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.869
principles in their
research, they said OK,

00:23:36.869 --> 00:23:38.785
but you're going to do
one, too, right, Cathy?

00:23:38.785 --> 00:23:41.010
So I was like, yes, I
guess I'm going to do one.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.750
And that just happens
to be the first one

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:43.990
that I'm going to show.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:48.560
So another practical use of
constructive and destructive

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.760
interference has
to do with x-rays.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.880
And you can use constructive
and destructive interference

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.520
to determine the structures
of very tiny things, protein

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.240
molecules or nucleic
acids in your body.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.990
So I'm going to try
to run this movie now.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.600
We'll see, this as a demo.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:07.590
Good to try it out with me and
see how this is going to work.

00:24:13.325 --> 00:24:15.450
CATHERINE DRENNAN (VIDEO):
My name is Cathy Drennan

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.720
and I'm a Professor of
Chemistry and Biology at MIT.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.210
And I'm also a Professor and
Investigator with the Howard

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.580
Hughes Medical Institute.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.660
And my lab uses the principles
of diffraction in our research.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.790
A wave shoots through
some kind of grating.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.640
You can have light, say light
waves, shooting through.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.080
And when the light waves
hit the metal lattice,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.450
they'll be diffracted.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.320
And some of those waves will
be in phase with each other

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.030
and will constructively
interfere

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.150
and you get a bright spot
in a diffraction pattern.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.000
Other waves will be out of
phase and they'll destructively

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.760
interfere and you'll see nothing
as a result of those waves.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.240
From this pattern of
spots and no spots,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.370
you can understand something
about the structure

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.900
of the grating that
it went through.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.510
So if I had two
different gratings,

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.760
the diffraction patterns
would be different for these.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.718
And so from looking at
the diffraction pattern,

00:25:07.718 --> 00:25:12.430
you can figure out how the
metal or whatever was arranged

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.850
that generated that pattern.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.040
This property works
whether it's a metal

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:22.260
grating or a lattice that's
made up of protein molecules.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.100
Because the protein
molecules are small

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.290
and crystals are
small, we use x-rays

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.380
and short wavelength,
high energy.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.240
But because everything
is really tiny,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.450
we need really bright
x-rays to do this.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:38.050
And I don't mean high energy
bright, I mean intensity.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.364
So we need more
photons per second.

00:25:41.364 --> 00:25:42.780
So we have to go
to a place called

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.880
the synchrotron, a
research facility, that

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.130
has really intense x-rays.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.490
And then we shoot those
x-rays through our crystal,

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.610
collect this
diffraction pattern,

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.310
and then figure out what the
shapes of these molecules are.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.830
The structure can
tell you so much.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.747
I mean, there can be
big questions of field

00:26:01.747 --> 00:26:02.830
about how something works.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.204
And all of a sudden, you see
what the molecule looks like

00:26:05.204 --> 00:26:07.600
and you're like, ha, of course.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.730
Sometimes there's a
problem with the DNA

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.360
that then gets translated
into a defect in the protein.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.760
But people often
don't know why does

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.790
it matter, why does it
matter that the protein is

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.070
this or that?

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.270
But we can look at
it and figure it out.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.360
So we can compare what the
protein structure looks

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.360
like for a healthy individual
with the protein structure

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.890
from someone who has a mutation.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.540
All of a sudden
you might see, wow,

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.480
the vitamin that this protein
needs can't bind anymore.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.340
So we can have a
sense of what's wrong.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.881
And then sometimes
you can figure out

00:26:37.881 --> 00:26:40.674
how to treat it once you
know what the problem is.

00:26:40.674 --> 00:26:42.340
Sometimes there'll
be a protein molecule

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.720
that everyone
knows is important.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.080
Everyone wants to know
what it looks like.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.040
But you might be
the one who does it.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.480
You might be the one to
figure out what it looks like.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.130
And you'll be the first one.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.380
You'll see these patterns,
these diffraction patterns,

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.629
and you'll build this model
and all of a sudden you'll

00:26:56.629 --> 00:26:59.170
be like wow, that's not
what people expected.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.210
And it'll just be this
incredible discovery.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.420
So you're an explorer
of the molecular world

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.986
when you're a crystallographer.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.152
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:11.152 --> 00:27:12.360
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Thank you!

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.760
OK, so that's the
first in the series.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.616
We're going to have
another one this week,

00:27:24.616 --> 00:27:26.365
as well, because we
have a lot of history.

00:27:26.365 --> 00:27:29.560
So we've got to counter it
with a lot of current research.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.760
And so you'll be learning about
quantum dots also this week.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.140
OK, so those are some of
the characteristics of waves

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.190
that are really important and
we talked about light as a wave.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.060
Now we're going to talk
about light as a particle.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.740
Light as a wave is a
little bit easier to grasp.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.530
Light as a particle is a
little bit more confusing.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.910
And it took a while for
people to really appreciate

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.170
that light had particle-like
properties, i.e.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.840
It was quantized.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.320
And this really came out of
the photoelectric effect.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.700
So what were people doing?

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.250
And this is around the time of
the discovery of the electron

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.530
and the nucleus.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.880
And what scientists
were having fun doing

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.990
were taking beams of UV light
and hitting metal surfaces,

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.335
and seeing if they
could inject electrons,

00:28:16.335 --> 00:28:17.460
which have been discovered.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.150
It's like, let's get
some electrons out

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.590
of those metal surfaces.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:24.130
We know they're there, let's see
them come off and characterize

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:25.770
their properties.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:32.110
So they found that if they had
some UV light and the frequency

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.770
of that UV light was below
something, below a threshold

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.810
that they referred to as
the threshold frequency.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.850
So we have a new zero here.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.450
If the frequency was lower
than this magic number

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:50.230
for frequency,
nothing would happen.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.930
But if they increased
the frequency,

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:57.610
if it was greater than or equal
to this threshold frequency,

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.950
then all of a sudden
they would see something.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:03.100
They would see an
electron being ejected.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.410
And the electron would come
off with a certain amount

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.740
of kinetic energy,
K.E. And kinetic energy

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.690
is equal to a half times mass
times the velocity squared.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.830
All right, so they decided
let's characterize this.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:21.560
Lets very some parameters
and see what happens.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.150
So they looked at constant
intensity of this light

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.000
and they changed the frequency.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.490
And then they looked at
the number of electrons

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.650
that were coming off.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:36.190
And so below this
threshold frequency,

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.960
no electrons came off.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.180
I just told you about that.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.700
Then when they were
at the threshold,

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.400
they saw electrons
coming off and then they

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.920
increased the
frequency even more,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.560
but they weren't getting
any more electrons.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.560
Hm.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.980
OK, this was interesting.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.520
So they thought what
else can we measure here.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.560
And they knew how to
measure the kinetic energy.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.150
So it's like, let's
start measuring

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:06.430
the kinetic energy of these
electrons that are coming off.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:10.750
So they plotted kinetic energy
of the ejected electrons

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:14.980
as a function of the frequency
of the incoming light.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.640
And again, below the
threshold, they saw nothing.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.090
But above the threshold, they
saw the kinetic energy increase

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:28.270
proportionally to the increase
in the frequency of the light.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.130
And this didn't
really make any sense

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.380
from what they knew at the time.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.910
They didn't have a way to relate
kinetic energy and frequency.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:40.560
So they really weren't
sure what this was about,

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.490
but they were having
fun doing experiments.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:48.310
It's like, let's keep going,
let's vary more properties.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:52.630
So then they decided
to look at how

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.360
the kinetic energy
of the electron

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.240
was affected by changing
the intensity of the light.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.790
And they thought that if
you increase the intensity,

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.060
you'd have more
energy in your system,

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.130
you should have
more kinetic energy.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.510
But that did not
seem to be the case.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.960
They increased the
intensity, the kinetic energy

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.970
stayed the same.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.430
They were having trouble
wrapping their head around it.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:23.290
But they said, all right, well
let's collect some more data.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:28.540
So now they decided to look at
the number of ejected electrons

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.264
as a function of the intensity.

00:31:31.264 --> 00:31:32.680
And they really
didn't think there

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.980
should be much difference.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.640
Increase the intensity,
number of electrons

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.810
should be the same.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:41.950
But experiments
showed otherwise.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.160
So when they increased
the intensity,

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.010
more electrons came off.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:51.029
And this is where they
were in the field.

00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:52.570
It almost seemed
like everything they

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:55.270
did was opposite of
what they expected.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.910
It's a pretty exciting
time actually in science

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.530
when you're getting results
that are unexpected.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:03.430
And some of this data
sat around for a while.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.070
And then Einstein decided
to take a little look at it

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.026
and see what he
thought of this data.

00:32:09.026 --> 00:32:10.900
And people were studying
all sorts of things.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.580
They're taking different metals,
you have a different metal,

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.850
you have a different
threshold frequency.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:20.080
And so people were
characterizing different metals

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.980
and figuring out the
threshold frequency

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.590
for all the different metals.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.310
And then plotting the
kinetic energy of the ejected

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.640
electrons as a function
of the frequency.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.300
And you look at this,
you realize huh,

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.260
there's different
threshold frequencies

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.620
for the different
metals, but they all

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.290
seem to have these
straight lines that all

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.964
seem to have the same slope.

00:32:43.964 --> 00:32:45.880
And sometimes when you
look at the discoveries

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.610
of really amazing
people like Einstein,

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:52.160
you're thinking
well, basically what

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.010
he did was solve the
equation for a straight line.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:59.000
You realize hey, maybe I can
contribute to science, as well.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.010
So we had a whole lot
of straight lines here.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.910
And when you have that, you
can solve for the slope.

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:10.540
So that's what he did,
he solved for the slope.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.380
And he got this
number, 6.626 times 10

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.640
to the -34th Joule seconds.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.190
And he saw that number
and he's like, I've

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:24.550
heard that number before.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:28.730
Planck came up with that number
when he was studying black body

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.740
radiation.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.220
So totally different
phenomenon, but yet

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.050
the number comes
up again, Planck's

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.990
constant, also known as h.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:43.150
Now that seemed like a
really strange coincidence.

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:47.290
So there must be
something to this number.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.490
So if you look at
this plot, we can also

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.380
think about what the y-axis is.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:59.590
So the y-intercept is minus
Planck's constant times

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.570
that threshold frequency.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.490
And when you have
all of this, you

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:09.020
can now write the equation
for the straight line in terms

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.020
of all of these variables.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.850
And so y-axis here
is kinetic energy.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:20.770
So we'll solve that equation
now in terms of kinetic energy.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:24.110
So kinetic energy is
going to be equal.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.050
We have our x-axis here.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.630
The x-axis is frequency.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.600
And again, now, the
slope of the line we know

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.080
is Planck's constant,
so that's h.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:41.139
And the y-intercept,
or b, was -h

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:45.820
times the threshold frequency.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.270
And this is a very
important equation.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.179
So just to define
those terms again,

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:56.290
we have the frequency
here, Planck's constant.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:01.660
Planck's constant times
the frequency is an energy.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.010
It is the energy of
the incident light

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:08.240
or the incoming light, e sub i.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.610
And on this side over here, we
have that threshold frequency

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.420
again.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.370
We also have Planck's constant.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.660
So Planck's constant times
a threshold frequency

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.350
is another energy term,
which is called the threshold

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:28.490
energy, or more commonly
a work function.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:32.950
So the kinetic energy
equals the incident energy,

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:38.470
the energy of the incoming
light minus the work function,

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.780
which has to do with the
threshold frequency which

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.780
depends on the
metal in question.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.800
So this was a really
important equation.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.270
And Einstein realized
that the energy of light

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:56.560
is proportional to its
frequency and it's proportional

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.220
by Planck's constant.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.890
And this really
changed how people

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.660
had been thinking about energy.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.200
And all of a sudden, a lot of
those observations made sense.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.870
Now, Einstein of course had
many important discoveries

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.340
in his career.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.410
But this one was the one
that he personally felt

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.800
was the most revolutionary.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.659
I don't know.

00:36:18.659 --> 00:36:20.200
People are always
their worst critic,

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.990
but even he realized
that this was important.

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:29.730
And in terms of units, because
units are always important.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.770
Notice usually you'll see
energy in joules or kilojoules.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:37.830
And Planck's constant has
the units of joule seconds.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.390
And frequency is per
seconds or hertz.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:46.640
So in this equation,
your units work out.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.160
So from this idea then
we have this notion

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.920
that light is made up of
these energy packets which

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.750
people call photons where
the energy of that photon

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:01.840
depends on its frequency.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.310
So we can go back to
the photoelectric effect

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.580
now and start thinking
about those observations

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.770
and try to rationalize now
what we had been seeing.

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:17.010
So here's this new model
for the photoelectric effect

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.430
where we can think about the
energy of that incoming photon,

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.870
or that incident photon.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:26.430
If it's greater than
the work function,

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:32.660
then you'll eject an
electron from the metal.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.600
And any left over energy
is the kinetic energy

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.550
of that ejected electron.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.470
So we can think about that here.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:43.260
That here we have
the energy coming in

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.660
of the incident photon.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.000
We have to get over
that threshold frequency

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.040
or overcome that work function.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.580
So you have this minus
this, and the leftover

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.470
is the kinetic energy.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.540
So we can also
write it this way,

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.080
that the kinetic energy
equals the incident

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.010
energy minus the work function.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:08.660
So if you just have
enough energy to do this,

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.290
you have very small
kinetic energy.

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.810
But if you have a
lot of extra energy

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.540
once you overcome
the work function,

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.470
you'll have more kinetic energy.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:20.040
We can also write the
equation this way,

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.250
that the incident energy
equals the kinetic energy

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.730
plus the work function.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.146
OK, so let's just try a
clicker question on this.

00:38:30.146 --> 00:38:32.270
And we're going to go back
and look at those graphs

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.561
and think about what they mean.

00:39:26.035 --> 00:39:27.576
All right, let's do
ten more seconds.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.530
Yeah, OK.

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:53.010
So here the trick was to think
about what the work function is

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:56.370
and how much energy was
coming in of the photon.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:01.350
But here the energy is lower
than the threshold needed,

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:05.660
so you're not going to
get any electrons ejected.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.642
Let's try one more.

00:40:06.642 --> 00:40:08.100
Let's see if you
can get up to 90%.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.760
So now we've changed
the energies.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.908
Or the energy, but not
the threshold energy.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:40.747
OK, ten more seconds.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.280
Yeah, 98%.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.920
Yeah, so now we're over
the threshold energy.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.090
So we need to subtract
the threshold energy

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.800
and the remaining is
the kinetic energy.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.340
OK, so these are the kinds
of questions we have on this.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.420
And now let's go back and
think about these plots again.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.970
So we don't have these a
second time in your notes,

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:20.480
but you have them one time.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.220
And let's just think about
how this makes sense now

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.750
with the new equations that
Einstein helped us achieve.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:33.570
So in the top here, we have
the surprising observation

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:36.550
that when you increase
the frequency of the light

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.800
that the kinetic
energy increase.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.470
Well, now this makes
sense, because if you're

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:43.720
increasing the
frequency of the light,

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.800
you're increasing the incident
energy of the photons coming

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.400
in.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.260
And so if you're
increasing this frequency,

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.520
so you're increasing
the incident energy.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.480
And once you're above
the threshold energy,

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:01.780
you'll have more extra
kinetic energy coming off

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:05.710
as the frequency, or the energy
of the incident light comes up.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:07.190
So that makes sense.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.190
All right, what about intensity?

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.870
We haven't really talked
so much about intensity.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:14.500
So let's consider
intensity for a minute

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.230
and think about the number
of electrons, as well.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.900
So both of these
are about intensity.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.280
So let's think about
the number of electrons

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.814
ejected from a metal surface.

00:42:24.814 --> 00:42:26.980
We're going to come back
to those plots in a minute,

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:30.010
sorry to make you go back
and forth in your notes.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.930
And that's going
to be proportional

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:33.740
to the number of photons.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.170
So the more photons
you have coming in,

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:39.670
the more electrons are
going to have coming out.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:44.320
That is, if the photons
have the appropriate amount,

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:49.750
if they're over the threshold
frequency over the threshold

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.990
energy, then you're going
to have an electron ejected

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:54.360
from the metal surface.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.110
So for each photon that
has greater incident

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.150
energy than the
threshold, you'll

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.610
have an electron being ejected.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.470
So what is intensity?

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:10.190
Well, the intensity is really
the photons per second.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.240
So it's proportional to
the number of photons being

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.610
absorbed by the
metal, and therefore,

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:20.080
the number of electrons
coming out of the metal.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.070
So intensity's units
are often in watts.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:27.380
You also can do a conversion
in joules per second.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.780
So the higher the
intensity, the more

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:36.160
photons with the
appropriate amount of energy

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.860
to overcome that work function,
the more electrons coming off.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:44.980
So now we can go back and
think about these plots again.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:49.720
So here the relationship between
intensity and kinetic energy

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.440
was flat.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.270
And that was unexpected.

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:55.630
But the kinetic energy
doesn't change here

00:43:55.630 --> 00:44:00.760
since the intensity means
more photons per second, not

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.150
more energy per photon.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:06.280
So you're just increasing
the number of photons.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.550
If none of the photons have
the appropriate energy,

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:12.880
you're not going to have
any electrons coming off.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:18.610
But if you have more
photons per second,

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.900
and they have the
appropriate amount of energy,

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:26.530
then you are going to see
these electrons coming off.

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.400
So the number of
electrons admitted

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.400
does change since high
intensity means more photons.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.150
More photons, more electrons.

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:40.840
So these things that
Einstein helped us with,

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.730
these equations, now
made sense of the data

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.190
that was being observed.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.520
So the photoelectric
effect was really

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.970
important in helping
derive these relationships

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:54.250
between energy and frequency.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.630
And so in particular, the
really important points

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:00.880
here is that light is
made up of these photons,

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.820
these discrete energy packages.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:08.230
And each one of those photons
has to have enough energy in it

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:11.500
to overcome the threshold
to emit an electron.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.710
So energy is proportional
to frequency,

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:18.100
which was a really new and
exciting idea at the time.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.480
E equals Planck's
constant times frequency.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.420
And the intensity of light
has to do with the number

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.540
of photons hitting per second.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.590
And if you keep
these things in mind,

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.900
you'll do really well finishing
up a number of the problems

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:36.340
on the photoelectric effect,
which are in problem set one.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.860
OK, see you on Wednesday.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.820
We're going to do a demo of
the photoelectric effect.
