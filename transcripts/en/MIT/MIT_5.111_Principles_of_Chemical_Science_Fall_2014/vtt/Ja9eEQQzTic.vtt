00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.910
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.205
All right, let us
take ten more seconds.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.190
All right, 92%.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.090
I like it.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.170
That's great, I told you there'd
be a formal charge question,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.450
and there was, and
you learned it.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.710
Awesome, that's what I like.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.730
All right, that was carbon
had four, no lone pairs.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.260
So, 4 minus 0 minus 1/2 of
eight bonding electrons,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.940
which is four.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.300
So, 4 minus 4 is 0.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.620
OK, so today we're having
a clicker competition.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.370
And problem set 4 will
be posted later today.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.640
And today's goal is for all
recitations, but recitation 12

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.720
to try to unseat recitation 12.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.130
And the goal of recitation
12 is, of course,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.380
to win an unprecedented
third week in a row.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.270
So, that's the goal
for everyone today.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.910
Now, remember recitations
that win a multiple weeks will

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.910
be in the playoffs for
the clicker competition

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.174
at the end of the semester for
a specially designed t-shirt.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.800
OK, more on clicker competitions
actually later today.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.350
So, if we can get settled in.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.900
I know it's exciting.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.390
And you are allowed to
talk to your recitations,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.510
other recitation members during
the clicker questions, that

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.410
is allowed.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.707
But I'll need to cover
a little material first.

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:24.040
So today, we're going to talk
about shapes of molecules,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.070
and I brought some molecules
with me today to help me out.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.880
And we're going to be
talking about VSEPR theory.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.420
So, why is shapes of
molecules important?

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.230
So shape, which we can
also call geometry.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.830
So, you're going to ask about
the geometry of the molecule,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.290
you are asking
what is it's shape.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.830
It's particularly
important in chemistry

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.680
because shape can
dictate properties

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.610
of a particular molecule.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.710
It can tell you
about-- or dictate

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.440
melting points, or boiling
points, or reactivity.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.480
And I'm a biological
chemist, so I

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.600
care a lot about shapes of
molecules because in biology

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.280
shape is really important.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.000
So, you have enzymes in your
body catalyzing reactions.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.970
And for those
enzymes to work, they

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.630
are specially designed
to react with one

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.820
particular kind of molecule and
not any molecule in the cell.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.010
So, they're designed
to recognize

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.010
the shape of that molecule.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.100
So, biochemistry really
works by shape recognition,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.830
so shape is very important.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.120
So, there's a lot of ways to
get information about shape.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.200
But there's one
very simple theory

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.910
that does exceedingly
well in predicting

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.760
the shapes of small molecules.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.930
And that is called the Valence
Shell Electron Pair Repulsion

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.550
theory, which is known as VSEPR.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.430
And is also known as
the V-S-E-P-R theory.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.350
I will call it VSEPR because it
is really hard to say V-S-E-P-R

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.950
theory.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.100
So, VSEPR is the
topic today and this

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.920
is based on Lewis structures.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.620
So, this is highly
exciting because you just

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.040
finished a problem
set that had you

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.250
draw lots of Lewis structures.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.530
And now on the next
problem set, you

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.740
can draw more Lewis
structures and then

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.690
tell us about his shape.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.950
So, that's very exciting.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.590
So, you're going to retain
all of the knowledge

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.500
that you've gained in
the last problem set

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.930
and continue on
with that problems.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.590
All right, so this is
a very simple theory.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.820
And it's based on the
idea that valence shell--

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.820
valence electron pairs
repel each other.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.900
Electrons repel each other.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.810
They're negatively charged,
they repel each other.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.900
That is the heart of
this theory, very simple.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.050
And as many of you
may have gathered,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.020
I love it one very
simple theories

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.730
explain a lot of stuff.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.120
I enjoy that.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.620
Gets it, it doesn't get
it right 100% of the time,

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.310
I'm OK with that, I'm
good with about 90%.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.900
So, this works
really pretty well.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.170
So, again we're talking
about the geometry

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.570
around a central atom.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.650
And the idea is
that the atoms are

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.320
lone pairs around that
central atom are going

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.880
to move in such a way,
attain such a shape, such

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.150
that the repulsion is minimized.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.990
So, this is all about minimizing
repulsion, minimizing stress.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.020
Again, I'm a big fan
of minimizing stress,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.230
so I also like VSEPR
for that reason as well.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.750
PROFESSOR: Lewis structures?

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.720
What causes stress?

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.460
Problem sets.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.280
Oh, but they build character.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.390
All right, VSEPR Very
simple nomenclature,

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.060
again I like simple
nomenclature.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.230
A is the central atom.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.520
Maybe should be C,
but atom is there,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.800
so central atom is A.
X is the bonding atom,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.700
and E is the lone
pair of electrons.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.810
So, E lone pair electrons.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.140
X is whatever bonding atom,
and A, A is in the center.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.650
A is the central atom.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.890
One more term you need to know
for VSEPR and that's steric

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.420
number, .

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.080
And that's used to
predict geometries.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.700
So, what is steric number equal?

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.260
Steric number is
the number of atoms

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.160
bonded to the central atom,
plus the number of lone pair

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.700
electrons.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.310
And you count one pair as one.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.800
And so, you want to
note, when considering

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.640
VSEPR double triple
bonds are all--

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.102
and single bonds all the same.

00:06:56.102 --> 00:06:58.560
So, you don't have to worry
about double triple bonds right

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.550
now.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.390
They're all counts the same.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.180
It's only the number
of bonded atoms

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.160
and the number of loan pairs.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.300
So, let's look at
some examples of this.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.250
So, we have our central atom
A, bonded to two bonding atoms

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.480
X, with one lone
pair of electrons.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.130
So, if you were asked what
is the formula for this,

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:24.320
the VSEPR formula, it would
be AX2E, as shown there.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.930
And then you might be
asked to steric number.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.440
And the steric number in
this case would be what?

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.726
Three.

00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:33.980
We have two bonding atoms.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.860
One lone pair of electrons.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.940
Again, the lone pair
just counts as one.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.590
So, I could also draw this
structure with a double bond

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.890
to one of the Xs.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:52.302
And this would have the equation
AX2E, exactly the same formula.

00:07:52.302 --> 00:07:54.760
Because we don't care about
the double bond in the formula,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.490
only the number
of bonding atoms.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.320
Only the number of lone pairs.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.460
And this would have
an SN number of what?

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.360
Three, right.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.970
Because it only matters about
the lone pairs and the atoms.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.580
That's all we care about here.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.190
We don't care about the double
bonds, triple bonds, whatever,

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.356
we'll care about them later.

00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:15.020
But for right now
for geometry, we're

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.010
only caring about bonded
atoms and lone pairs.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.830
Some of you will be very happy
after doing the last problem

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:30.410
set to know, that you can
apply VSEPR theory to all

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.789
the resonance structures that
you may come up with when

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.760
you're doing Lewis structures.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.190
So, if a molecule has one
or more resonance structures

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.440
that's OK.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.730
VSEPR can be applied
to any one of them.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.610
Also, if there's more
than one central atom,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.260
you need to consider
those atoms separately.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.110
So, in this case,
you would be asked

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.060
about the geometry around
the carbon and the geometry

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.400
around the oxygen. But a lot
of the examples we have today

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.200
just have one central atom.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.450
All right, so that's just a
little introduction to VSEPR

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.680
Now, there's two cases that
we're going to consider today,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.450
one are molecules
without lone pairs

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.530
and one are molecules
with lone pairs.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.460
Without lone pairs is
a little bit easier

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.840
than with lone pairs.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.550
So, let's start there.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.750
And we have a nice
table for you.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.820
I'll tell you that these
lecture notes are of high value.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.340
I've had people who've taken
this course want to come back,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.620
it's a nice summary
of all these shapes.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.650
So, you want to keep this
in a nice, secure location.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.420
A highly desirable notes.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.410
OK, so let's look
at a formula type.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.820
The simplest we have AX2 here.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.360
So, that has a SN
number of 2, because it

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.380
has two bonded atoms.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.890
And it has this molecular shape.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.910
And I brought an example here.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.860
And this is, of course, a
linear molecule and therefore

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.530
the angle-- and here we're
talking about the angle

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.850
around the central atom.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:08.030
So, from this black atom to
that black atom, we'd have 180.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.010
So, that's the simplest
linear molecule.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.910
So, it's got a little
more complicated

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.890
and add three bonding atoms.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.237
So, here we have a case of AX3.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.930
It has a SN number of 3.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.760
There are three things
bonded to the central atom.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.690
And its shape is
trigonal planar.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.880
Trigonal should be remembered,
it looks like a triangle.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.140
And you should also
remember that it's planar.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.860
You can hold it this way
and see all of the atoms

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.170
are in one plane.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.620
And I'm making
some of this point

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.880
because later on the
exam, when you're asked

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.560
to name geometries of things.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.020
People come up with all
sorts of crazy things.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.600
So, if I spend a little time
doing my demonstration here

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.480
of the shapes of molecules, it
will pay off later in the exam.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.860
It'll sear in your brain.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.060
It will be hard to forget.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.187
Trigonal planar.

00:11:01.187 --> 00:11:02.020
What are the angles?

00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:04.540
120.

00:11:06.352 --> 00:11:07.260
Right.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.680
OK, let's move on.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.900
We'll have four atoms.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.680
SN number of 4, AX4.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.740
So, this is our
tetrahedral geometry.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.510
And I'm going to just
note, as it says down here,

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.490
that when you have a
thick arrow coming out

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:32.800
at you, like this bond
and a thin one going back,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.590
that means the one coming
out is coming straight out

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.460
towards you.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.420
The dashed line is going
back into the screen.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.660
And the two that are
not thickened or dashed

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.010
are in the plane.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.520
So, if I hold it like this, we
have two atoms in the plane,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.160
one coming out, one going back.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.030
And so, that's how-- if you
see that drawn that way,

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.530
and you will, you can think
about it in three dimensions.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.366
All right, so what's the
angle of tetrahedral?

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.920
109.5.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.809
So, a lot of people have already
familiar with this is great,

00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:12.850
if you're not, you will
learn it quickly when you

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.354
do the problems.

00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:15.520
All right, we'll keep going.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.570
We have five.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.570
And you move over here.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.955
So, a SN number of 5.

00:12:20.955 --> 00:12:23.350
We have AX5.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.470
And here is our shape.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.720
So, this is trigonal
bipyramidal.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.590
So, if you think about the
shape of your trigonal planar,

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.950
you see along here, we
have our trigonal planar.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.250
So, we have our trigonal shape,
but we also now have an atom

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.030
above and an atom below.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.830
And that forms a kind
of a pyramid on top

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.840
and a pyramid on the bottom.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.160
So, it's trigonal bipyramidal.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.050
And there are two
sets of angles now.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.037
What are the angles
in the equatorial?

00:12:59.037 --> 00:12:59.537
120.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.630
I love when people yell
things out, it's awesome.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.060
Angle from the axial
to the equatorial?

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.560
90.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.940
Awesome.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.410
All right.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:19.670
And one more basic shape group,
and that's this one here.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:24.850
We have six atoms bonded
to the central atom, AX6.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.110
And we have this shape.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.270
So, now I'm holding
it, two axial atoms.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.850
Two atoms coming out
towards you, two going back.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.330
Octahedral geometry.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.210
And what are all
the angles here?

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.620
90, awesome.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.517
All right.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.000
So, let's look at some examples.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.880
Hopefully, everyone got the
90 and can write it down.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.550
If not, I'm sure someone will
yell it out again for you.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.060
All right, so let's
look at some examples.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.760
We were talking about
CO2, and you calculated

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.820
the formal charge on it for me.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.070
So, we have AX2.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.780
SN number of 2.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.830
This is linear and
our angle is 180.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:13.570
And now we can explain
why this is non-polar.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.790
We learned before that
we had polar bonds

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.720
where we had difference
of electronegativity

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.660
between the carbon
and the oxygen,

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.090
which would make a polar bonds.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.310
You have two polar bonds, so why
is this not a polar molecule?

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.240
And it's not a polar molecule
because this oxygen is pulling

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.550
this way, this one's
pulling that way,

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.470
and that makes it non-planar
because there's no net dipole.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.141
So, shape is important for this.

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:36.890
All right, let's look
at the next example.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.950
We've seen a lot of
these examples before.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.090
We're talking about
Lewis structure.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.202
What was boron an example of?

00:14:47.298 --> 00:14:48.670
Incomplete octet.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.570
That's right.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:54.090
So, here's an example, it
has three things bound to it.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:58.560
And it has the shape
of trigonal planar.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.670
And the middle atom
is incomplete octet.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.910
But it's OK.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.540
Boron and which other one are
OK being incomplete octets?

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.900
Aluminum, right.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.074
So, the angles are 120 here.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.950
Now, we move on.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.040
We have this molecule CH4.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.880
Can someone tell
me what this is?

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.600
Methane.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.400
So, we have AX4, SN number of 4.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.630
And we have our tetrahedral
shape and our angles of?

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.040
109.5.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.180
Right.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.290
So, methane we should
all care about.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.460
Greenhouse gas, but
also some people

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.550
believe will be the salivation
to our biofuels and energy

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.070
problem.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.050
We will see if
that's true or not.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.940
OK, another example over here.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.950
So we have phosphorus in the
middle and five chlorines.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:56.990
So, what is this an example of,
in terms of Lewis structures?

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:03.310
Yep, so this is trigonal
bipyramidal or bipyramidal.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.900
I think both are
right, I don't know.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.390
And so we have our
120 and our 90.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.800
And this was an example
we had in Lewis structures

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.960
or something very similar
of an expanded octet.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.250
So, we have more.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.710
We have five bonds
around the phosphorus

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.840
and that's OK because it's
N equals three or greater.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.200
So, we have an example
again of an expanded octet.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.300
And if we keep going, we'll
have another expanded octet.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.190
So, here we have AX6.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.630
So, we have six bonds
around the sulfur.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.470
Sulfur is OK with that.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.160
And what is the geometry here?

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.720
Octahedral angles?

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.496
90.

00:16:43.496 --> 00:16:46.860
Yep, all right, so we
have several examples here

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:53.290
of things with expanded octets
and also deficient octets.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.800
All right, so this is
pretty straightforward.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.620
People get a lot
of points on exams,

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.370
except when they come up
with all sorts of weird kind

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.880
of shapes that don't exist.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.819
But most of the time you can
learn this and it's great.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:09.050
With lone pairs it's a little
more complicated, but also

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.319
much more fun.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.960
All right, so let's talk
now about what happens

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.070
when we have lone pairs.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:25.190
So, electrons in bonds are
hanging out in their bond

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.210
and they're not really doing
much, but being in their bond.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.810
So, they have less spatial
distribution than loan pairs.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:39.360
Meaning that, electrons in
bonds take up less space.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.490
And electrons in lone
pairs, they can be anywhere.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.420
They're not restricted
to their bond,

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.450
so they take up more
space and therefore,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.710
cause more repulsion.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.870
So, the whole idea
of when you're

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.140
talking about VSEPR
with lone pairs

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.130
is that you're thinking about
electron pair repulsion.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.970
And if you have a
lone pair, that's

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.900
going to give you more
repulsion than bonded electrons

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.730
because lone pair electrons
can take up more space.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.210
So, it's a very simple
idea, but it actually

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.630
works to explain a lot of
stuff and again, the geometry

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.580
re-arranges to minimize
that repulsion.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.470
So, when we're talking
about repulsive forces then,

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:28.260
we go from the most repulsion,
lone pair, lone pair.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.830
That's like two messy roommates
living together, that's

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.150
very repulsive situation.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.750
Lone pair, bonding pair.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.890
And then bonding pair, bonding
pair is the least repulsive.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.860
To neat roommates that
usually works out quite well.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.050
So, if we keep this
in mind, we can now

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:49.640
predict shapes of molecules
based on this repulsion.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.710
So, we can rationalize
shapes based on VSEPR theory.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:02.940
So, now we can think about
AX4E has a seesaw shape.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.230
Which of these two
shapes is seesaw?

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:12.170
So, we have one case--
I'll make this one-- where

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:17.100
we have the lone pair
in an axial position.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.910
And we have another case
where we have the lone pair

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.140
in an equatorial position.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:28.530
So, when you have it
in the axial position,

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:34.380
here, you have three bonding
pairs of bonding electrons

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:34.930
pretty close.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.120
They're 90 degrees
away from each other.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.830
So, there are three sets
of bonding electrons

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.620
that will be repelled
pretty strongly.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.260
Now, clicker question.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.780
Think about what's
going to be true here.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.250
How many things with
an equatorial lone pair

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.772
will be repelled strongly?

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.908
Very repulsive,
those lone pairs.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.720
OK.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.150
So, that was the answer
we're going for two.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.660
Because there are two sets
of bonding electrons here

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.400
that are 90 degrees away.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.570
There are two that are 120,
but 120 is bigger than 90.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.640
So, there are two that
are close whereas,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:40.190
with this geometry there three
sets of bonding electrons

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.960
that are 90 degrees away.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.520
So, it turns out that
the equatorial lone pair

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.820
is more favorable.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.430
It has a little bit more
room in the equatorial area

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.190
to spread out.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.980
And so, this is the
shape that we find.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.040
We never see this
shape, does not exist.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.050
We'll just take that
away, it doesn't exist.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.560
And this is called seesaw.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.170
And let me demonstrate to
you why that is the case.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.415
May I'll do it this way.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.170
So, how many of you had
seesaws in a playground?

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.580
Quite a number.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.390
Seesaws are not
considered that safe.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.460
You know, the heavy
kid sits on it

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.090
and keeps you up in the
air for days or whatever,

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.360
until your mom comes and
gets you from the playground.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.560
Or gets off suddenly,
and the seesaw flips,

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.510
and you go flying in the air.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:42.440
But studies show actually, that
dangerous playground equipment

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.460
builds neural networks and is
good for cognitive development.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.520
So, I think we could do
a survey here and see

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.800
if there's a correlation
between how many of you

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.010
played with seesaws
when you were a kid.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.370
And whether you ended up
as an MIT student or not.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.760
That could be interesting,
but now none of you

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.530
will ever forget that this
shape is seesaw, right?

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.000
You will remember this forever?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.500
OK.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.310
All right.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:13.900
So, this idea also
is responsible

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.940
for a T-shaped molecule.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.450
So, we'll add another one.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:21.920
And I think this
is a little harder

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.990
to rationalize why it wouldn't
go in a different place,

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.770
but it does.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:27.130
This is how it goes.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.070
Both the lone pairs are
an equatorial positions,

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.820
and we get something that
looks like a T. So, if you have

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:43.430
AX3E2 SN 5 number, it's
a T-shaped molecule.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:48.430
We can also think about our
core octahedral geometry.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.670
And if you have two
lone pairs, so here's

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.370
our octahedral with
six bonding atoms.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.720
And if you have two lone
pairs and four bonding atoms.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.660
If you have AX4E2,
it has this shape.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.880
The lone pairs go
on opposite sides.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.090
And now they have their
repelling the bonding electrons

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.600
here, but they're far away from
each other, which is favorable.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.040
And this is called
square planar.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.680
So, it's square and it's planar.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.170
Square planar.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.390
OK, the two lone
pairs are far apart

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.740
on the opposite
sides of the bond.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.400
So, in addition to predicting
these shapes, which

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.460
work pretty well, we can also
think about the geometries.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.230
And when you get lone
pairs, you find deviations

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.550
from your standard geometries.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.900
So, let's look at some examples.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.780
So, with molecules with a
lone pairs, such as NH3,

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.840
the angles tend to be smaller.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.960
So, we saw methane
before, it was 109.5.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.200
You yelled that
nicely out for me.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.780
These are both SN 4.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.110
This is AX4.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:05.880
This is AX3E, but it's
still an SN 4 system.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.120
So, it looks like this, we
have-- here we have methane,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.740
here we have NH3.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.350
And now, we want to think about
which would be more repulsive,

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.970
the bonded electrons
or the lone pair

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.320
electrons in terms of
the geometries around.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:26.080
So, if we have hydrogen carbon
hydrogen angle of 109.5 here,

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.270
then here with
nitrogen we're thinking

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.840
about hydrogen
nitrogen hydrogen.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:37.080
And this lone pair is pushing
on those bonded electrons,

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.790
and it's taken up
a lot of space.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.620
This is the messy roommate.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.720
The messy roommate
has a lot of stuff

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.190
that's spreading out
all over your room.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.110
And so instead of having
109.5 amount of space,

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:54.700
you now have 106.7 amount
of space in your room.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.110
Because it's just-- the
messy roommates just

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.310
spreading out all
over the place,

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:05.000
pushing down on those bonds
and the bond's contract.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.500
All right.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.910
Now, let's go back to
trends in the periodic table

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.820
for a minute.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.460
We learned that
atomic size increases

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.270
as we go down the periodic
table because what increases?

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.240
N. Principal quantum number
N increases, so atomic size

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.480
increases as we go down.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.510
Think of this as a messy
roommate having more stuff.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:39.160
So, the lone pairs now
occupy a larger volume.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.730
Still messy, but now messy
with a lot more stuff.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:48.010
And this stuff
impedes in your space.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:53.030
So, the angles tend to be even
smaller between the bonded

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.590
atoms.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:59.690
So, we had NH3 before at 106.7.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.180
But nitrogen is up here.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.430
Phosphorus is below it, so
it has a bigger atomic size

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.640
and it has lone pairs that
occupy larger volumes.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:16.790
So, this is what happens.
[EXPLOSION SOUND EFFECT]

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.070
Some of you may have
experienced that.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.250
That is a messy roommate
with a lot of stuff.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.420
Now, if you have a
roommate that's very neat,

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.280
they're putting their
clothes in drawers.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.440
When the clothes are in drawers,
just like electrons and bonds,

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.270
they don't really go anyplace.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.980
But when the messy roommate
does not put their clothes--

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.450
when they're lone
pair clothes-- then

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.917
they go and this
is what happens.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.690
OK, so we can predict now by
looking at periodic trends,

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:48.180
and thinking about how much
room those lone pair electrons

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.030
are taking up, we can think
about and predict the angle

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.550
between the bonded atoms.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.560
All right.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:01.766
So, this is pretty cool,
but can it save the world?

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.620
What do you think, can
VSEPR save the world?

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.610
Do something important?

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:16.085
Of course it can, it's
part of chemistry.

00:27:16.085 --> 00:27:19.500
So let's think about a pressing
problem in the world right now

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.580
and how VSEPR can address it.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.380
And if you listen to NPR or
open a newspaper these days,

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.900
you're hearing about a lot
of car bombs, explosions,

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.090
things are not good
in the Middle East.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.690
We're hearing about
all sorts of-- I

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.000
heard on the news about
bombs going off at a school

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.920
and then when parents
rushed toward the school

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.350
more bombs went off.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:44.310
I mean just really
horrible stories.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:48.560
And even when the conflict
is over, a lot of times

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.040
those improvised
explosives are still there.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.300
They still exist
in the countries.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.630
And it's estimated by the
UN, by the United Nations,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:03.000
that landmines kill 15,000 to
20,000 people, mostly children,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.920
women, elderly who are
out in the farm fields

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.600
trying to grow food
for their family

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.220
and they step on
something and blow up.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.410
So, how do you find
these explosive devices?

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.570
How do you find
explosive devices

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:21.010
that are actively being
used now in dangerous parts

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:21.700
of the world?

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.210
And how do you find the
explosive devices left

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.110
behind when the war is over?

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.080
So, if you are
Stephanie, you use

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.640
VSEPR That's what you do
to find those explosives.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.750
So, in her own words now
I'm going to tell you--

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:42.990
or she's going to tell you, why
VSEPR what she calls V-S-E-P-R,

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.335
because she can say that better
than I can, to find explosives.

00:28:47.335 --> 00:28:49.210
STEPHANIE SYDLIK: My
name is Stephanie Sydlik

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.900
and I am a graduate student
in Tim Swager's research

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.400
group at MIT.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.760
The research that were perhaps
the most well-known for

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.077
is for sensing explosives,
such as TNT. [EXPLOSION SOUND

00:29:00.077 --> 00:29:05.810
EFFECT] New, bigger, better
explosives have been developed.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.680
And two of these
are RDX and PETN.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.530
And these kind of have more
bang for your buck, if you will.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.760
Unfortunately, they have an even
lower vapor pressure than TNT.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.610
Which means there's
even less molecules

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:24.300
of the explosive in the air
and it makes them even harder

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.410
to detect.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.040
The dogs that they
would send out

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.570
are actually sensing
cyclohexanone and acetone,

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.620
which are molecules
that are used

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.080
in the purification of
these two explosives.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.520
Both cyclohexanone and acetone
have a carbonyl in them.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.350
And this carbonyl
then can interact

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.180
with a group known as the urea.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.640
We have two nitrogens
connected to a carbon that

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.320
has a double bond to
an oxygen between them.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.840
And these nitrogens
have hydrogens on it,

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.440
that can hydrogen bond with that
acetone or the cyclohexanone

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.690
that we're looking for.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.890
What happens is that the
lone pair from the carbonyl

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.260
reaches out and grabs those
hydrogens and pulls them away

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.650
from the nitrogens.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.580
And this makes the
nitrogen hydrogen bond

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.260
more lone pair-like.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.370
As it becomes more
lone pair-like,

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:24.930
we see more repulsion between
the lone pair-like bond

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.480
of electrons and the
neighboring bonds.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.650
And by the V-S-E-P-R theory,
we know that this is going

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:33.800
to cause the bond angle
to become larger between

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.530
the nitrogen hydrogen bond
and the accompanying bonds

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:41.030
and smaller between the other
bonds around the nitrogen.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.720
And this causes large scale
changes in the polymer.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.270
So, we can see differences
in the way in the large scale

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.930
the polymer interacts with
light as fluorescents,

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.260
so it will start to glow.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.810
Or, a refractive index change,
which is also a different way

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.960
the polymer
interacts with light.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.560
We have instruments that
can very easily measure

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.590
both fluorescents
and refractive index.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.990
And with these
very easy signals,

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:08.850
we now know that our
acetone or cyclohexanone

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.150
and therefore, the
explosive is there.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.620
For soldiers, this
is a really big deal.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.770
In Iraq and Afghanistan,
there are minefields

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:22.590
and improvised explosive
devices almost everywhere.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.170
And the soldiers
over there really

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.730
have to watch where they step.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.760
So, if we can come up
with a handheld device,

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.570
and we have in the
past come up with some.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.180
And I'm hoping that my
technology might in the future

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.600
also go towards these
types of devices

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.990
that will be attached
to a robot and sent out

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:43.530
to sniff out the area before
the soldiers go there.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.190
You can really save a lot of
the soldiers lives as well.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:49.680
It's very cool to do the
hands on work in the chemistry

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.860
laboratory, and then know that
what you've done at your bench

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.620
will then one day be
actually used by someone

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.560
and potentially save their life.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.610
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:06.000
So, back to VSEPR
and lone pairs.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.770
Let's look at some
examples and think

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:10.260
about the shapes we've
seen some of these already,

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.170
but let's look at some more.

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:19.100
So, now we can have
AX2E, SN number of 3.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.600
So, two bonded
atoms one lone pair.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:27.870
This has bent geometry,
but again think

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.780
about this lone pair.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.530
Now, we're going to
talk about the angles.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.810
And we're talking about
angles in this class,

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.560
we're talking about the angles
between the bonded atoms.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.682
So, the angle from
the lone pair down

00:32:38.682 --> 00:32:40.890
is going to be bigger because
the lone pair is really

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.830
repulsive, but we're
going to be thinking

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.134
about the angle between
the atoms you see.

00:32:45.134 --> 00:32:46.550
So, when we ask
about angle, we're

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.400
asking about this angle between
one bonded atom, central atom,

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.090
and the other bonded atom.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:56.080
So, this lone pair doesn't
look that repulsive.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.800
So, I just want you to sort
of think more about this.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.950
So keep this in mind.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.440
This is really more what a
messy roommate is all about.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:13.360
So, if this is your lone pair
pressing down on those bonds,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.660
what do you expect the
angle is going to be?

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.960
What's the angle in
the normal case first?

00:33:23.542 --> 00:33:24.940
[BALLOON POP]

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:25.705
So, we have 120.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.500
And now think--
and actually it's

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.166
a clicker question, think about
what the answer is going to be.

00:33:32.166 --> 00:33:33.290
We talked about the normal.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.730
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.960
All right, yes, less than 120.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.720
So, you don't know
exactly, you can't

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.180
say "Oh, that's going to
be 118.5 or something."

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.660
But you can say less than 120.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.890
That's how you would express it.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.980
And I'll just remind
myself to say,

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.449
if you like these model
kits and want your own,

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:13.630
some toothpicks and
gum drops can create

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:15.469
some awesome VSEPR model kits.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:16.969
And we'll try to
bring some of these

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:19.510
into recitation
for people who want

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:24.390
to have gum drops and
toothpicks for making models.

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:24.890
OK,

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.159
let's keep going.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:32.960
So, now we have our
tetrahedral based system

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:36.130
AX3E

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:45.480
and an SN number of 4
based on tetrahedral.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:50.460
And so here, now, we
have trigonal pyramidal.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.080
So, we have a bunch, this
is why it's confusing.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.850
It's not bi-pyramidal,
there's only one pyramid here

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.600
and it looks like a triangle.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.120
So, trigonal pyramidal.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.540
And now what are the
angles going to be?

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.180
And you can just
yell this one out.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.370
Yeah, 109.5.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:11.840
And now let's keep going.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.426
And we have another
clicker question.

00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:25.685
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:35:41.201 --> 00:35:41.700
OK.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.050
So the trick here was to
think about the parent

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:50.910
geometry of the system.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.960
And so this is the
parent geometry

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.340
is the tetrahedral system.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:59.790
And we know that because
it has a SN number of 4.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.710
And so, when you have
a SN number of 4,

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.710
then it's going to
be less than 109.5.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:08.500
And this is called
a bent geometry.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.070
So, again you can think about
it within terms of those--

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.220
if you have some whole
cans, those lone pairs

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.650
are pressing down on the
bonds and compressing them.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.190
So, it's less than 109.5.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:25.340
I just teach chemistry because
I like to buy whole cans

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.870
and have a justification for
it, is really the bottom line.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:34.240
OK, so if we keep going now,
we have our friend seesaw,

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.110
which you're never
going to forget.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:41.960
And I'll rebuild
my-- oops wrong one,

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.110
rebuild my seesaw over here.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:51.230
So, now what are
the angles here?

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.170
There's two of them.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:57.160
Think about the
equatorial angles.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.795
Yep, I'm hearing
it, less than 120

00:36:59.795 --> 00:37:02.420
and the axial would
be less than 90.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.540
So, the lone pair is
pressing down both on the 90

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.840
and on that 120.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.030
Probably more repulsive for
the 90, but all you have to do

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.250
is say less than
for both of them.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.890
So, the trick is just think
about the parent geometry.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.310
What are the angles in
the parent geometry?

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:18.740
And then, it's less than.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:28.890
And if we keep going with this,
we had our T-shaped molecule,

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.120
as well.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:35.760
So, when we added another
lone pair to our SN 5 case.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.770
And what's the angle
now going to be

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.480
with those two lone pairs?

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.950
Less than 90.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:45.330
Right.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.540
All right.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:52.170
So, there so many
possibilities for lone pairs.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:59.930
If we add yet another
lone pair to the system,

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:00.850
what's my geometry?

00:38:03.134 --> 00:38:06.790
So, this is now going
to be linear geometry.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:10.580
And what's the
angle going to be?

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.350
Yeah, it's just going to be 180.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.550
So, we don't have
a less then here

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.830
because whatever
way it would bend

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.030
it would be just moving toward
more repulsive loan pairs.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.630
So, there's no way
you can minimize

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.340
the repulsion in this case.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.736
So, it's just going to
be a linear molecule.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.310
So, now we're going to move
into our SN six category.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.930
And we're going to
talk about a shape

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.640
that we haven't
talked about yet.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.260
So, based on this what happens?

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.780
We have our parent
geometry of octahedral.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:52.180
And so this has six
bonded atoms, SN 6.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.970
But now we're going to take
off one of the bonds-- put it

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:57.510
the same as the
figure-- we're going

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:01.810
to take off one of the bonds
and put on the lone pair.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:05.420
And this is called
square pyramidal

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.100
because you have this
square here in your axial.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.900
It looks like a square.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:15.870
But when you consider you have
an atom on top coming down

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:19.980
to these four atoms on
the side, that again

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.240
looks like a pyramid.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.030
So, this is square pyramidal.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.870
And what angle do
you think you're

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:30.320
going to have here for
these bonded atoms?

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.740
Yeah, that will be less than 90.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.230
All right, so we can keep going
and we saw this one before.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:40.580
If we take off another
bonded electron

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.600
and put it in a
second lone pair.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.170
As we saw before
those lone parents

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.540
want to be a far apart from
each other as they can.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.690
So, one goes on top,
one goes on the bottom.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:52.990
And this was our
square planar geometry

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.000
because it is so
square and it's planar.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.600
Now, what do you
think the angles are?

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.310
90.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:00.120
Right.

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.670
There's no where
to escape when you

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.950
have a messy roommate on top and
a messy roommate on the bottom.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.570
If you're in a triple
between messy roommates,

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:11.010
there's just nothing you can do.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.940
And you can't minimize
the repulsion at all.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.970
You just have to live with it.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:18.750
OK, so if we keep
going again and now

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.899
we're going to add
another lone pair.

00:40:21.899 --> 00:40:23.440
And it really doesn't
matter where we

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.380
put that, it's all equivalent.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:29.640
And it comes up with the
shape, that's T-shaped again

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.860
that makes sense when you
look at the structure.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.670
And now what do you
think the angles are?

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.770
Less than 90, and you
would be correct in that.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:43.080
All right, so if we put
on yet one more lone pair

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:48.620
and take off a bonded electron
or take off one more bonded

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:49.900
atom and put on an electron.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.475
What's our geometry?

00:40:52.475 --> 00:40:54.570
All right, so we
have this structure,

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:57.860
it's linear 180 no place to go.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.840
So, we keep going far enough
to come back to linear a lot.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:07.760
Now, let's just look at a
couple more-- some real life

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.510
examples of molecules and
think about their geometries

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.280
and shapes.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.960
I have a couple more
clicker questions,

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.550
so let's start with
our friend water.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:22.170
And I had water here.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.280
So, now let's think
about what the formula

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.070
type is going to be for water.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.617
And what's our formula type?

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.140
AX Yup.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:42.090
AX2E2, two bonded atoms, two
lone pairs SN number of 4.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:45.716
And do you remember what
this geometry is called?

00:41:45.716 --> 00:41:47.300
Bent, yeah.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.870
And this explains then
what we talked about before

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.950
that this is a polar molecule.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.820
So, these are polar
bonds between the oxygen

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.900
and the hydrogen.
But in this case,

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.360
it's not a linear molecule
it's a bent molecule,

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.180
so it creates a net dipole.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.200
And so that makes
it a polar molecule.

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.000
And if water had any other shape
and was not a polar molecule,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.460
then life would be
entirely different

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.860
because water is
the solvent of life.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:19.060
So, this shape pretty
important for anything.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:22.910
Actually, they researched on
what medical doctors thought

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.260
was the most important
topic to learn

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.920
as an undergraduate
in premed education.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.824
And the number one topic that
was most important was water.

00:42:31.824 --> 00:42:33.240
There, and you
just learned about.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:37.760
It OK, so we keep
going now and you

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.790
have to answer a lot of
things about this on a clicker

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:41.290
question.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.877
All right, just 10 more seconds.

00:43:01.877 --> 00:43:03.210
You got to finish your hand out.

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.750
All right, so let's go
take a look at this one

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:32.080
and fill it in.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:38.710
So, we have our
AX4, which is a SN 5

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:42.800
system because we
have one E. And then

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.190
we have our seesaw geometry.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:49.810
All right, so let's
just fill in the rest

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:53.310
here and see who's won
the clicker competition.

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:57.820
So, for the next
system we have Br.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:02.530
And now it's expanded,
so we have AX3E2 SN 5.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.520
We've added another lone pair.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.630
And now this makes
a T-shape, but it's

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:12.040
kind of a little benty shape
because of the repulsion.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:12.960
We come down.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.280
We have AX2E5 SN 5.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.430
We've added three
more with xenon.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.570
Xenon is expanded here.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.640
We have our linear shape.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.570
We also have xenon
with four things bound.

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.510
And if we did the Lewis
structure of that,

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:33.720
we'd realize there's lone pairs
on the top and the bottom.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.800
AX4E2 SN 6.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.110
And this is our square
planar geometry.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:44.790
So, you can predict a lot about
just doing a Lewis structure

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:47.000
or thinking about
where the lone pairs.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.020
You can predict geometries.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.064
And let's see who has won today.

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:56.738
We have an upset.

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:00.768
All right, Sam.

00:45:02.958 --> 00:45:06.260
All right, see
everybody on Monday.
