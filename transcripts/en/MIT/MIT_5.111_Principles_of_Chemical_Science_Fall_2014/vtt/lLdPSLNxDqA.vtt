00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.660
PROFESSOR: So, moving
to today's handout,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.150
we're going to talk about
crystal field theory.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.570
And we're going
to talk about how

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.390
the shapes of those
orbitals can explain

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.180
the special properties
of transition metals,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.790
like color and magnetism.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.250
And really, as I said,
the transition metals

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.460
have amazing properties that
can be absolutely gorgeous.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.500
They can do incredible things.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.480
They're very, very
useful elements.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.910
I like to think of them
as the super heroes

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.650
of the periodic table.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.560
They're doing all the
really spectacular stuff.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.740
So, today, we're going
to talk about colors.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.560
And we're going to talk about
whether things are magnetic,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.200
if they're paramagnetic,
or diamagnetic.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.180
So, transition metals.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.840
I talked before about how
they're useful in biology.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.480
They're also useful in terms
of their beautiful colors.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.240
So, in the old days before
you generated floor plans

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.850
and drawings for
buildings, on a computer

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.130
you did blueprints
for something.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.360
And the blue in the blueprint
is actually a transition metal

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.010
complex.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.150
And also, currently, it's
an active area of research

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.160
to design new imaging agents
to use in MRIs, or to image

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.780
the heart, or other things.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.170
And a lot of these also involve
transition metal complexes.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.960
And the reason why they're
useful, say, in an MRI

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.510
is because they can have
magnetic properties.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.340
So, scientists see
these beautiful colors.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.700
It's kind of obvious that
the transition metals often

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.680
have these incredible colors.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.620
And they can put the
transition metals in something

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.792
with a magnet and see that
they have magnetic properties.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.000
So these things were obvious.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.789
And then chemists want to try
to understand why it's true.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.400
Why this particular metal
behaves this way, or this metal

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.110
has this particular color.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.390
And they like to try to
categorize them and come up

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.780
with theories that
help to explain what

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.580
they're observing in nature.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.740
And so, today, we're
going to talk about one

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.380
of those theories, which
is Ligand field theory.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.660
And I'm also going to
differentiate that-- or Crystal

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.970
field theory and differentiate
it from Ligand field theory.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.880
So both of these
theories, again,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.140
are an attempt to explain the
properties that we observe.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.970
And the idea behind
it is pretty simple.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.470
You have a metal ion and a
set of ligands around it.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.390
And if you compare the energy
levels of that free metal ion--

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.270
so here's a free metal
ion-- with that metal

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.380
ion in a coordination
complex-- here

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.220
is quite a pretty
coordination complex--

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.100
the energy levels are different.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.920
That's really all these
theories are getting at.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.260
That there's a change
when you bring ligands

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.710
in around a transition metal.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.650
It changes the energy
levels of those d orbitals.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.350
And if we understand how
those de-energy levels change,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.600
we can understand a lot
about the properties

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.760
of that particular metal in
that coordination environment.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.750
So energy levels are altered.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.750
So there's these two
theories: Crystal field theory

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.910
and Ligand field theory.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.840
Crystal field theory
is the more simple one.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.170
It just considers the ionic
description of the metal ligand

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.230
bond.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.067
And so we talked
about ionic bonds.

00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:46.150
And mostly you're just
kind of thinking about them

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.104
as these point charges.

00:03:48.104 --> 00:03:49.520
And you have plus,
you have minus,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.820
and they attract each other.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.627
Covalent bonding is a
bit more complicated.

00:03:54.627 --> 00:03:56.710
Start talking about
hybridization and other things

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.670
like that.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.630
So Crystal field theory
is really simple.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.200
It just considers
the ionic nature.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.730
And it does pretty well.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.230
It can explain a lot,
but not everything.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.790
Ligand field theory has
the covalent and the ionic,

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.350
so it's a more
complete description

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.030
of that metal ligand bond.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.670
But this is more of
an advanced topic.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.570
I just want you to
know that that exists.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.680
So if you take 503 here
in organic chemistry,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.660
we'll talk more about
Ligand field theory.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.570
In this class we're just going
to do Crystal field theory.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.880
But I like Crystal field
theory because I like it

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.310
when something that's
pretty simple theory

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.720
can explain a lot.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.540
I think a lot of nature
can be explained by this.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.640
So if you really
want to understand

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.610
particular properties
of a specific compound,

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.681
you probably want a
more complicated way

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.430
to think about it.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.990
But if in general
you just want to say,

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.880
why can some cobalt complexes
can be so many colors?

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.700
Crystal field theory works
really well for that.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.430
All right, so
Crystal field theory.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.730
Very simple idea behind this.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.380
It's almost
disappointing, I think.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.980
But it's OK.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.960
You can go, yeah we're
studying, you know,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.670
Crystal field theory in class.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.190
Yeah, you don't have to
tell people that it's

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.450
a really, very simple idea.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.310
So the idea is that the
ligands are negative charges.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.550
They're like this big
blob of negativity.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.570
And those ligands,
with their lone pairs,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.310
their negativeness
or negative charge--

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.970
they got those extra lone pair
electrons-- are going to be

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.780
repulsive to those d orbitals.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.330
Negative point
charges, you bring

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.380
a d orbital, And a lone pair,
and there's some repulsion.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.090
That's basically it.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.160
Negative point charge repulsion.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.930
That's all that you
have to think about

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.430
with Crystal field theory.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.000
So it sounds really impressive
to tell people you're

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.190
doing Crystal field theory.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.460
And you can neglect to
mention that it's just

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.090
a really very, very simple idea
that, sort of, negative charges

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.810
repel each other.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.395
That's really all it is.

00:05:56.395 --> 00:05:58.020
All right, so we're
going to talk first

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.240
about the octahedral case.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.820
And then we're going to get
into some other geometries

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.010
on Friday, so that's
going to be exciting.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.678
But here's our
octahedral molecule.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.580
And here we have it, here.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.140
And I can think about the metal
in the middle, M to the N plus.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.100
So this just indicates it's
any metal and to the oxidation

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.480
number.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.400
And the black balls,
here, are the ligands

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.470
and we can think of those
as negative charges.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.970
So here, we have drawn sort
of this octohedral shape

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.490
around the metal in the middle.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.500
And we can think
about these NH3 groups

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.990
as these negative point charges.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.430
So these dots here are
negative point charges.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.940
And so now if we think about
the shapes of the d orbitals

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.240
again, that we just looked at,
we can look over here and say,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.552
wow, some of those ligands
that are those negative point

00:06:55.552 --> 00:06:59.250
charges are basically
right there up

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.020
against that d orbital.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.960
Pointing directly
toward the d orbital.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.880
So that's going to
be pretty repulsive.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.690
The point charge is right
there next to the d orbital.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.580
This also has a point charge
kind of right toward it

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.130
along z.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.670
But these, the point
charges, are on axis.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.470
Octahedral, you have
your ligands along z,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.840
along x, and along y.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.260
But these sets of orbitals,
the negative point charges,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.930
aren't pointing directly
at the d orbitals.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.310
So one could think
about the fact

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.820
that these are not going to
be not as much repulsion.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.470
This is a lot of repulsion.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.770
All right, so let's go through
orbital set by orbital set

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.250
and consider how
repulsive it's going to be

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.740
compared to the other orbitals.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.110
OK, so if we look over here
at the octahedral case--

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.844
and I have both, these
drawings were on the first page

00:07:53.844 --> 00:07:54.510
of your handout.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.580
This is on the second page.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.830
But you can think about them.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.790
Here it's drawn more
where they're all

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.590
drawn kind of the same way.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.260
Here it's sort of moved a
little so you can see better.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.080
So we can keep both
of these in mind.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.320
So, again, the negative point
charges around the orbitals

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.890
here.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.320
And on these drawings, I have
these little negative signs

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.527
pointing in to give you a sense
of where those negative point

00:08:17.527 --> 00:08:19.620
charge ligands are coming.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.670
So we have our dz2 and we can
see the negative point charge

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.120
right toward this maximum
amplitude along z.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.170
So that's going to be repulsive.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:34.710
Dx2, y2, same thing, point
charges right toward these.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:41.130
So the ligands point directly
at dz2 and dx2 minus y2.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.110
So there's a large
repulsion there.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.310
And, in this particular
case, in the octahedral case,

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.660
what turns out to be true,
both of these are stabilized.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.900
And they're destabilized,
actually, by the same amount.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.170
And so that means that they
have the same energy, which

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.120
we learned before,
means that there-- you

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.000
could say they're degenerate
with respect to each other.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.120
So both of these, big repulsion.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.890
Both are destabilized by
those negative charges,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.900
by the same amount.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.950
And you have much more
repulsion, and much more

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.670
destabilization, for these
two orbitals compared

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.770
to the other set of orbitals.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.870
The ones that are
45 degrees off axis.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.660
So now, let's look
at these and look

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.150
at where the point charges are.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.214
So this is the picture
in your handout.

00:09:32.214 --> 00:09:33.630
I just kind of put
these up there,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.200
too, so you can think about
where those point charges are

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.420
for octahedral geometry.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.790
So the ligands,
again now, are not

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.050
pointing right at the orbitals.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.820
They're off axis.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.180
Because of ligands are on axis,
and the orbitals are off axis,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.470
and they're not directly
pointing toward each other.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.944
And so this is a
lot less repulsive

00:09:55.944 --> 00:09:57.360
than the other
situation where you

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.340
have the ligands
and the orbitals,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.440
both on axis, pointing
right toward each other.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.340
So now, this is why it's
important to know which

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.894
orbitals are 45 degree
off axis because we, now,

00:10:08.894 --> 00:10:10.560
can think about the
fact that there will

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.680
be less repulsion in this case.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:20.790
So, we can say then, that
the xy, xz, and yz orbitals

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:28.560
are stabilized compared to
dz2 and dx2 minus y2 orbitals.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.810
And they're also stabilized
by the same amount.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.810
So these are also degenerate.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.400
With respect to each other,
they have the same energy.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.490
All right, so we have these
now two sets of orbital types.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.460
Two orbitals that
are destabilized,

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.630
and three orbitals that are
stabilized, compared to them.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:55.160
So now let's draw what's known
as an Octahedral Crystal Field

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.160
Splitting Diagram and think
about what's happening.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.150
So, I have some over there.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.630
Ignore those for now.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.550
I'm going to draw one over here.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.080
So first, we have
energy going up.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.070
And we have a situation we
first want to think about.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.510
What would be the case, say,
if you had ligands everywhere?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.230
Not just on the axis,
not octahedral geometry,

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.710
but just everywhere.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.160
So if you had
ligands everywhere,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.440
you would have
your 5 d orbitals,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.810
all would have the same energy.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.940
Because all of them--
there's ligands everywhere--

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.740
all of them would
be experiencing

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.320
the same amount of repulsion.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.060
So this would be the case for
a Spherical Crystal Field.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:52.400
And I like to think about
this with this prop.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.006
I had this before
as an s orbital.

00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:55.380
It's convenient
for that as well.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.540
But, really, what it is, is a
Hypothetical Spherical Crystal

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.890
Field.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.320
Because these are
all little ligands.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.750
And you can see these
little ligands are

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.120
completely symmetric around.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.590
And if you feel
sort of the inside,

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:10.870
there's something in there.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.220
Well that, of course,
is a metal ion.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.830
And these ligands are
completely around.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.250
So all the d
orbitals are equally

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.340
feeling the repulsive
effects of these ligands.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.190
And so they all
have the same energy

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.840
in this hypothetical case.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.312
I was so excited when
I found this at CVS.

00:12:29.312 --> 00:12:30.770
And I went up and
I was, like, wow,

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.430
you sell hypothetical
spherical crystal fields here.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.410
And the person was not amused.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:42.470
OK, so now what happens--
because this is not the case.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.267
This doesn't exist.

00:12:43.267 --> 00:12:44.350
This is just hypothetical.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.360
It looks like it
exists, but it doesn't.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.410
This is what really exists.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.230
You have certain geometries.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.120
The ligands come
together with the metal

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.160
and form particular geometries.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.860
And we already talked about
what those geometries are.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.750
There's not a whole
lot of variation.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.580
We get the same
kinds of geometries.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.700
And octahedral is the
most common geometry

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.650
for a transition metal complex.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.250
So what's going to happen here?

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:12.860
So, the ligands will now split
the energy of the d orbitals.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.460
And three of them are
going to go down in energy.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:21.110
They're going to be stabilized
compared to the two that

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.560
go up in energy.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.360
So the three that go--
are stabilized again,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:36.195
are dxy, dyz, and dxz.

00:13:36.195 --> 00:13:38.570
If you can't read this, it
all should be in your handout.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.020
So it's OK, you don't have
to read my handwriting.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.810
And just kind of-- just
follow along in your notes.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.730
And then the ones that
have the most repulsion are

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:54.770
dx2 minus y2 and dz2 up here.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.150
All right, so two
go up and energy.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.670
There's more repulsion.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.010
Three go down in energy.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.110
And instead of writing
all of those d's

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.790
and x's and y's, they're little
abbreviations that people use.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:14.850
So they call these two
orbitals-- the eg orbitals.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.630
So those are the ones
that are destabilized.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.760
And the ones that
are stabilized are

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.510
called t2g orbitals,
which is going

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.350
to make our nomenclature
easier later on.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.180
OK, these two again.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.034
Same energy I tried to draw
a straight line between them.

00:14:32.034 --> 00:14:33.950
They're degenerate with
respect to each other.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.040
These three of the same energy,
again, degenerate with respect

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.180
to each other.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:43.400
And then the difference of
how much it's being split.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.580
This energy difference
has a special name.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.610
It's sort of this delta sub o.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.960
And this is the octahedral.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.390
And that's the o.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.730
The o is octahedral.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:10.370
Crystal field splitting
energy because it's

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.280
the energy that shows the
splitting of the crystal field.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.620
So that's at least
a good name for it.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.020
All right, now,
overall this energy

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.310
is going to be conserved.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.550
So the orbitals that go--
that are destabilized--

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.270
and two go up and three go down.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:38.420
So we can also put that the two
that go up, go up by 3/5 times

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.780
the octahedral splitting energy.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.670
And the three that go
down-- are stabilized--

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.750
go down by minus 2/5 times
the octahedral crystal

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.010
field, splitting energy.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.330
So this is why I have
it in your notes,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.413
because you can't really
read my writing too well.

00:15:54.413 --> 00:15:59.020
So two go-- are
destabilized, up by 3/5.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.910
Three, or stabilized,
down by 2/5 in energy.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:08.770
All right, so now what
controls the overall size

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.744
of this splitting energy?

00:16:10.744 --> 00:16:11.410
How do you know?

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:12.727
Is it a small splitting?

00:16:12.727 --> 00:16:14.560
Is this, you know,
should I have drawn this,

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.768
that they're just a tiny bit?

00:16:15.768 --> 00:16:18.760
Or is it, like, could it be
a really large splitting?

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.920
What determines the splitting?

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.870
Or The magnitude of
this splitting energy.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.920
So what determines that
are the nature of ligands.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.330
So some ligands are
really repulsive.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:35.740
Big splitting.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.740
Others-- eh-- you barely
notice they're there.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.000
Very little splitting.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.550
There's always some splitting.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.590
But it can be different.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.470
So the relative
ability of a ligand

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.950
to split the crystal
field gives rise

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.610
to what's known as the
Spectrochemical Series.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.760
So it's the relative
ability of common ligands

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.020
to split the energies
of these d orbitals.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.869
And this is what gives rise
to these beautiful colors.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:08.560
So all of those colors are
possible from cobalt compounds.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.150
Every single one of them.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.520
Because different ligands
will split the energy

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.460
different amounts, giving rise
to those different colors.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.750
So we have what's known
as Strong field ligands.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.810
And as that name would
suggest, Strong field ligands

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.310
are going to have
a large splitting.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.780
They're very strong.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.530
They split to a large degree.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:35.110
And we have Weak field ligands.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.090
Weak field don't cause
much of a splitting.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:43.390
It's a small delta sub o,
small octahedral crystal

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.780
field splitting energy.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.970
All right, so which
common ligands

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.780
fall into which categories?

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.750
Here is the list that we
talk about pretty much

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.540
in this class.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.630
I don't think there
are any other ones.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.970
So what I will put on
your equation sheet--

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.390
your equation
sheet for exam four

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.880
is lots of cool,
interesting things

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.310
that were not in the
other equation sheets.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.220
And I will tell you
which are weak field,

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.970
and which are strong
field, but I will not

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.816
tell you that weak field means
that it's a small splitting.

00:18:12.816 --> 00:18:14.440
That's something that
you need to know.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.960
Or that strong field means
it's a large splitting.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.360
But I will tell you that
your halides down here

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.520
are weak field ligands.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.370
Water and hydroxide are
sort of in the middle.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.410
And they can have all
sorts of different colors

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.110
when they're bound to
coordination complexes.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.640
So they're sort of intermediate.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.640
And then your strong field
ligands-- with your strongest

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.900
being cyanide.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.020
Very strong field ligand.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.890
All right, so, if your
metal has a weak field,

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.380
intermediate field, or
strong field ligand,

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.030
it can have very
different properties.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.190
Especially very
different colors.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.310
Also, it could be
paramagnetic or diamagnetic,

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.680
depending on this.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.980
So let's take a look at two
different iron complexes.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.490
We have iron with six
waters, with a plus 3

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.500
charge, and iron with
cyanide, with six cyanides

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.860
and a minus 3.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.860
So the first thing we
have to do is figure out

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.980
the oxidation number of
the iron and the d count.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.650
And that's our first
clicker question.

00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:36.410
All right, let's just
take 10 more seconds.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.110
OK.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.660
There you go.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.790
There's the right one.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.360
A little more people say that.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.100
All right.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.570
So, let's take a look at this.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.240
And you will get
used to thinking

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.210
about what the charges are
on the various ligands.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.260
So here, we know that
the overall charge

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.460
has to be the same as the
overall charge on the complex.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.180
Water is neutral.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.500
And so that means this
iron has to be plus 3.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.840
Cyanide has a minus
charge, and you

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.720
may have noticed that
in the list of ligands,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.390
that it was cn minus.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.090
That when I just showed you
the strong field ligands.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.170
So there's six minus ones.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.410
And so it's also
plus 3, to give you

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.320
an overall charge of minus 3.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.370
And as you do these
problems, and problem sets,

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.150
you'll become very
familiar with what

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.280
the charges of the
different ligands are.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.760
So overall, plus
3, 8 minus 3, is 5.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.915
Is a d5 system.

00:20:54.812 --> 00:20:56.270
So the next thing
we're going to do

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.790
is we're going to draw our
octahedral crystal field

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.680
splitting diagrams
and place electrons.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:08.720
And I already have, over here,
a starting place for those.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.160
So we're doing
here our d5 system.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.720
And we have a diagram
with a small splitting

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.340
and one with a large splitting.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.260
So with the small
splitting, is that

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.617
going to be a weak
field or a strong field?

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:26.700
That will be a weak field.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.990
And when we have
a large splitting,

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:37.120
that is a strong field

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.030
OK, so which of
our two compounds

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.860
is going to be the
weak field compound?

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.120
And which will be the strong?

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.800
Let's do strong first.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.660
Which one has a
strong field ligand?

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.220
Cyanide one.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:22:01.400
So this one is going to be
our cyanide complex because it

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.500
has the strong field.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.580
And so this one
would be the water.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.750
Water's intermediate.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.600
So you kind of have to see
what the comparison is first

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.460
before you decide.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:17.370
Oops, six bracket 3 plus.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.080
OK, so here we have water.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.450
There, we have cyanide.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.050
So a weak, or intermediate
field, versus a strong field.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:27.572
All right, now we need
to put electrons in here.

00:22:27.572 --> 00:22:28.405
So I have to decide.

00:22:28.405 --> 00:22:31.050
I have five electrons
I'm going to play with.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.600
And I could put them in here.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.600
Let's just start here.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.570
Do one, two, three.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.630
Now the question is, where
am I going to put four?

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.330
Am I going to put
four down here?

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.180
Or put it up here?

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:50.480
And so, here, it depends on, if
I put it down here on pairing--

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.926
and, you know, the seats
on the bus-- people

00:22:52.926 --> 00:22:54.300
don't really want
to sit together

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.341
if there are empty seats.

00:22:55.341 --> 00:22:58.110
Now there are empty
seats up here.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:03.020
So, the question is, is it going
to take more energy to pair?

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.030
Or more energy to
put it up here?

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.530
Now, if this is a weak
field, which it is,

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.940
then that's not
all that far away.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.940
You get on a bus and you
see a seat in the back.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.481
You'd rather sit up
front, but you're

00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:18.230
like, than you have to sit with
someone, so you go to the back.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.660
So that's what happens
with a weak field.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.240
The other energy levels
are just not that far away,

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.300
so you go up there.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.270
And if I kind of put
this up-- move it up

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.590
for just a second-- and then
I'll say, so this rule here,

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.870
and I'm going to kind
of cover this up again.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.820
But maybe I'll just
put it down here.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.920
This is in your notes.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.340
So here, the octahedral
crystal field splitting energy

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:50.588
is less than we call PE,
which is pairing energy.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.910
So, it's not that far away.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.230
Just put them singly,
to the full extent

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.590
possible, before you pair.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.550
So that's what happens
with a weak field.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.110
And we also can think
about how we're putting

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.900
in our electrons parallel.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.410
We're not putting them in all
sorts of different directions.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.037
And we're not-- if we do pair--
we're going to not pair--

00:24:18.037 --> 00:24:18.870
we're going to pair.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.390
So one's up, one's down.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.400
So all the rules that
we learned earlier

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.400
are going to apply here.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.650
So this is good, good review.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:32.734
So now, in this case, we can put
in our first three electrons.

00:24:32.734 --> 00:24:33.650
And what do you think?

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.180
Do you think I'm going to pair?

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.160
Or do you think I'm
going to go up there?

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.580
What do you think?

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.270
I'm going pair.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.300
Yeah, I'm definitely
going to pair.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.960
So I'm going to put my
other two over here.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.500
So in this case, the pair--
the octahedral crystal field

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.130
splitting energy--
it's so much fun

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.430
to say that so many
times-- is greater

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.270
than the pairing energy.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.850
And, so, in this case,
there might be empty seats.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.630
But maybe it's a long train.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.580
And there is-- you can sit
in car one with someone else,

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.050
or carry all your luggage.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.390
Why did you bring so much?

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.160
You're just going
home for Thanksgiving.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.590
All the way, 23 cars later,
to an empty seat in the back.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.460
You're just not going to do it.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.300
You don't have enough energy.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.210
You'd rather sit with
somebody up front.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.010
So how you put in
electrons depends if it's

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.600
a weak field or strong field.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.510
It depends on whether it takes
just a little bit of energy,

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.980
and it's worse to pair.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.850
Or takes a huge
amount of energy.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.630
There's a big splitting,
a really strong field.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.940
And in that case, you're
going to pair first.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.590
And you're only going to
put electrons up here when

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.810
you're completely done here.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:48.250
All right, so now we have
placed our electrons.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.380
We've talked about
pairing energy.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.980
And we've talked about the
weak and strong fields.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.560
And now we can talk
about some notation.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.370
Because there's always notation.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.270
So this is what
we've done already.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:07.450
And now we're going to do step
E, which is to our d to the n

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.400
electron configurations.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.630
Every diagram, there's different
configurations every time.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.560
So this one we do using those
little kind of cool terms

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.400
I told you about.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.160
So instead of writing, I
have one electron in dxy,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.900
one electron in dxz,
and one electron in dyz,

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:34.750
I can just say, I have three
in the t2g set of orbitals

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.800
that is a lot more convenient.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.760
So you would just say t2g3.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.420
And I have two up here.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.780
So EG2.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.310
And that's how
you would do this.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:48.310
I think this is our last
configuration for electrons

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:53.390
in a diagram that you're
going to be learning.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.510
There's a lot of them.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.130
OK, so then over
here, we would just

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.310
say we have five, all
in the lower energy

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.360
set, all in our t2g.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.740
All right, one other thing, part
F that you can be asked about.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:14.830
Which is the crystal field
stabilization energy.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:21.100
Not to be confused with the
crystal field splitting energy.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.780
They both start with an s.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.660
So I don't know why you
wouldn't be confused by that.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.440
But if you can try to remember
it, that would be awesome.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.820
It's often abbreviated, CFSE.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.420
And this is the
energy change that's

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.050
due to going from this
hypothetical spherical crystal

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.560
field, where all the d
orbitals have the same energy.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.330
And if you put your
electrons in here,

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.590
where they'd all have the same
energy, to the diff energy

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.290
difference, when you're placing
energies-- when you're placing

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.830
the electrons in lower energy
orbitals or higher energy

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:57.550
orbitals.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.750
So you're thinking about
how much more stabilized

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.370
is the system if all of the
electrons are down here.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.010
That's going to be
stabilized compared

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:07.330
to where they were here.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.610
But if a lot of
them are up here,

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.980
then there'd be less
stabilization due

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.660
to this splitting.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.250
All right, so let's look
at how we would write that.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:23.350
So we have three electrons
that are down in energy.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:27.250
And they are down in
energy by minus 2/5 times

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:31.490
the octahedral crystal
field splitting energy.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.150
And that's because the
overall energy is maintained.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.060
Three go down in energy,
so that's minus 2.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.580
Two go up in energy,
again, plus 3.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.880
And then we have two
electrons up here.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.890
So 2 times plus 3/5, again times
the octahedral crystal field

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.430
splitting energy.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.930
And so overall, our
stabilization is zero.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.240
There's no stabilization
of this system,

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.570
compared to the system here,
because three electrons are

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.030
down in energy, and two are up.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:03.730
All right, so now
you might imagine

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.820
that this is going to have
some extra stabilization.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.500
And you would be right.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.160
So we would write
this like this.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.880
We'd say there are
five electrons down.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.070
Stabilized in the
lower energy orbitals.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:20.320
So five times minus 2/5, times
the optic single crystal field

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.610
splitting energy, minus 10/5
times the octahedral crystal

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.200
field splitting energy.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.470
And sometimes you'll also
see, kind of a little truth,

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:34.570
that there's also some energy
kind of due to this pairing.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:39.910
So you might see an indication
that there's pairing energy

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.500
for two sets of electrons.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.880
So sometimes that's included.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.720
Sometimes it's not.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.880
The questions were asked
to indicate, you know,

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.130
how many of sets of
electrons ended up

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.970
being paired for
that stabilization?

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.630
All right, so we
can think about,

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.632
again, we have this
nomenclature here.

00:29:58.632 --> 00:30:00.340
And we can think about
the stabilization.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.100
So there's a big difference
between these iron compounds.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.705
One, there's no stabilization
due to the splitting.

00:30:05.705 --> 00:30:07.330
And the other one,
there's quite a bit,

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.430
because all the
electrons ended down

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.994
in the lower energy orbitals.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.780
So now it's time to try
some of these on your own.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.510
See if you got the rules down.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:24.460
And let's try some
clicker questions.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.690
Clicker question one.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.500
OK, 10 more seconds.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.810
All right, yes.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:11.150
So the trick here is to remind
yourself what weak field meant.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.730
And in this case, if
it's a weak field, that

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.790
meant that you place all
the electrons singly--

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.580
there are seven of them-- to
the fullest extent possible

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.390
before you pair.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.180
You still have to pair.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.580
But here you put more--
you filled these up

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.870
before you paired.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:29.210
And this is a
strong field diagram

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:31.040
where you put-- you
paired all of them

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.500
possible before you put
any of them up here.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.260
And to make it harder, I
made-- drew them the same.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.790
So you have to
really pay attention

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.500
to what weak field meant.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.840
But this would be the
version of the strong field.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.640
And this is just wrong.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.270
So, you wouldn't
have more electrons

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.120
up in the higher energy
orbitals for really any reason

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.250
whatsoever.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.324
OK, so let's try the next one.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.030
All right, let's just
take 10 more seconds

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:17.636
and we'll mention high spin
and we'll do this problem.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:29.830
Yeah.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.121
People did very well with that.

00:32:31.121 --> 00:32:34.910
OK, so I forgot to mention
that I ran out of room to draw.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.030
So I decided that was enough.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.940
So it's in your notes
though, for here.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:44.620
And when you have a
very small, weak field,

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:48.640
and you end up putting all
the electrons in singly,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.490
that is also known-- and
I'll move this up a little

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:57.080
bit-- as a high spin.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.730
And so you have a lot
of unpaired electrons

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.960
in this case.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:11.185
So that is the maximum
number of unpaired electrons.

00:33:14.804 --> 00:33:16.720
And it's easier to
remember because, you know,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.594
you have these spins.

00:33:17.594 --> 00:33:18.640
There's a lot of spins.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.540
There are a lot of single
spins and they're also high up.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.410
And this is a low spin case.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.810
When you have a strong field.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:32.770
Because you like to pair first
before putting them singly.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.970
So this is going to give
you the minimum number

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:41.462
of unpaired electrons.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.840
So high spin, weak field.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.380
Low spin often comes
from a strong field.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.540
So it's about whether
you have maximum number

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.400
of unpaired electrons,
which you do

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.340
with weak field, high
spin, minimum number.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.440
All right, so let's
look at this one then.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.340
So it's a high field one.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.830
So that means that you're going
to have the maximum number

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:11.659
of unpaired electrons.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.620
So this would be diagram here.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:19.420
And I can put that over here.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.050
And so then you have to
figure out how to write that.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:30.340
And so you would have three ones
down in energy, minus 2/5 times

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.030
the octahedral crystal
field splitting energy.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:40.270
And you would have one
electron, up by 3/5 times

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:44.080
the octahedral crystal
field splitting energy.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:50.710
So minus 6 plus 3 is minus 3/5
times the octahedral crystal

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.480
field splitting energy.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.350
So this problem required you
to know what high spin was,

00:34:56.350 --> 00:35:00.490
then correctly identify
the weak field diagram,

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:04.420
and then figure out the crystal
field stabilization energy.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.820
So that was actually quite good.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:12.250
And maybe you'll remember the
high spin, low spin definitions

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.630
as well.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:23.140
OK, so let's just do
one more thing and then

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:27.010
we'll-- because we've just
been talking about high spin.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:31.180
So back to our compounds, we're
going to talk about magnetism.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.910
And then we're going
to come back next time

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:34.840
and talk about color.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.240
And we have some cool demos for
color which we'll do next time.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.440
But before we leave from
this, our iron compounds,

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.470
we want to think about whether
they're paramagnetic, which is

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:45.970
attracted by a magnetic field.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:48.330
Or diamagnetic, repelled
by a magnetic field.

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.740
And we've already talked
about this in this class.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.310
So, based-- and here are
our iron diagrams again.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.200
Based on these
diagrams, would you

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.770
expect these to be
paramagnetic, or diamagnetic?

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.860
Paramedic.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.550
And that was because it
has what kind of electrons?

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.700
Paired, right.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.370
So here you just have to
remember your definition

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.860
of paramagnetic.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.760
It has unpaired electrons.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.390
Now, normally, things with a
weak field, and a high spin,

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.610
are going to be more
likely to be paramagnetic,

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.530
have unpaired electrons.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.500
Things that have a
very strong field.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.230
And so you pair first,
before you fill up.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:28.570
Minimum number-- low
spin, minimum number

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.050
of unpaired electrons are
more likely to be diamagnetic.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.240
But in this case, we didn't
have enough electrons,

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.849
so they're still
both paramagnetic.

00:36:36.849 --> 00:36:38.140
All right, so we'll stop there.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.620
We'll come back and talk
about the colors of those iron

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.700
compounds.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.850
And more colors and
cool demos on Friday.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:46.660
Don't miss Friday.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.290
Remember, Friday, double
clicker competition.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:54.820
The team that comes in second is
automatically in the playoffs.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:02.653
Are you--

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:04.990
AUDIENCE: We're at
166, but it stopped.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:07.290
PROFESSOR: OK, let's just
take 10 more a seconds

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:08.700
on the clicker question.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.812
All right, let's quiet down.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.440
I'd like to see the
85% that's good.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.140
Of course it doesn't distinguish
all that much for the clicker

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.060
competition today.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.190
So if we can quiet
down a little bit.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.710
People can just yell out.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.410
What would this have been
the correct answer to?

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.390
What should the question
have said for that

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.840
to be the correct answer?

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.290
Low spin, right.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:59.520
So low spin-- shh--
is the minimum number

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.900
of unpaired electrons.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.320
And so this is the low spin.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.900
High spin is the maximum
number of unpaired electrons.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.930
So this is the correct diagram.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.820
And C is wrong.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.570
It's not correct for
either high or low spin.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.600
Because we have
two electrons here

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.430
that would have the
same four quantum

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.710
numbers, which is not allowed.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:27.070
OK, so let's continue
on with the lecture.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:30.330
And we are talking about colors.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.370
So, we're talking--
we're talking

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.740
about the colors of
the two iron compounds

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.630
that we had described before.

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.010
And so let's continue.

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:41.460
And when we talk about colors,
we need to do a little review

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:45.210
and think about what's happening
when a substance gives off

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.370
a color.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:50.340
And so, when a substance--
whether a substance is going

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:54.750
to absorb a photon or not, to
excite an electron to a higher

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:57.180
energy level that then,
when it falls back,

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.314
will emit a beautiful light.

00:38:59.314 --> 00:39:01.230
We can talk about whether
a substance is going

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.790
to absorb a photon or not.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:06.600
And it will if the
energy of that photon

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.850
is equal to the difference
in that energy level.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.470
So we talked about this before.

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:14.700
Exam one, exam two,
somewhere around there.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.820
And so, we saw this
equation a lot.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.760
That the energy equals Planck's
constant, times the frequency

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.780
of the light.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.750
And now we can take that
same gorgeous equation

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.610
and add a little thing to it.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.320
So we can add that
that energy is

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.130
going to be equal to the
octahedral crystal field

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.240
splitting energy.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.380
And so, a substance, one
of these transition metal

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:41.010
complexes, will absorb
a photon of light

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:44.550
if the energy of that photon
is equal to this splitting

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:45.510
difference.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:49.800
And if it is, it can promote
an electron between a lower

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.630
and a higher state.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.192
So this is all the
same kind of thing

00:39:53.192 --> 00:39:55.650
that we talked about before,
but now we're just applying it

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.020
to transition metals.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.770
So, let's think about what's
happening with our iron

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.150
complex.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.270
And if we say, had
a low frequency

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.550
of light that was
absorbed, what would

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.080
be true about the wavelength?

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.420
Would it be long or short?

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.500
It would be long.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.880
And how do we know this?

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.820
We know this from the fact that
if you're talking about light,

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.650
the speed of light equals the
wavelength times the frequency.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.100
So if you have a low
frequency, then you're

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.610
going to have a long wavelength.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:32.190
So our long wavelengths,
then, are on this

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:36.600
and over here, sort of our
yellow, orange, red, with red

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.670
being our longest wavelength.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.960
So if, then, we have a high
frequency of light absorbed,

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.240
then the wavelength
would be short.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.280
So it'll be short
wavelength absorbed.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.020
And so, again, our
short wavelengths

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.820
are down here, with our shortest
being the violet wavelength.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:56.910
All right, and now, the
color that you actually see

00:40:56.910 --> 00:41:01.020
is the one that is
complimentary to the color that

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.270
is of the absorbed light.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:07.170
So we're going to think
about how big those energy

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:09.420
differences are,
whether that translates

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.720
to high frequency, low
frequency, long wavelength,

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.660
short length-- wavelength
for the absorb light.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.570
And then, the complimentary
of the absorb light

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.810
is the light that we see,
the transmitted light.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:24.180
All right, so let's think
about the iron complexes

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.040
that we talked about.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.330
And we had a high spin, or
a higher spin, iron water

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:30.920
complex.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:36.650
Water is actually kind of an
intermediate field ligand.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:41.760
And it absorbs low frequency,
or a longer wavelength of light.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.230
And so it's going to transmit
on the shorter end of things.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:48.140
Again, water sort of
an intermediate field.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:53.340
But in this case, it was less
strong than our other one,

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.410
which was cyanide,
which is very strong.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.330
And, actually, these
iron water complexes

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.311
can appear actually
a variety of colors.

00:42:00.311 --> 00:42:02.435
If they're solid, they're
more of this pale violet.

00:42:02.435 --> 00:42:05.960
So definitely a very short color
wavelength that we're seeing.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.940
But in solution, and
depending on the pH,

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.540
they can be sort of
yellowish, brownish color.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.460
But the strong field ligand,
remember the other compound

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.580
had cyanide on it.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.810
That's a very
strong field ligand.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.920
And so that's going to absorb,
then, a high frequency.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.720
So a strong field, so you
have a big energy difference.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.710
So you have a big energy, high
frequency, and therefore short

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.560
wavelength.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.100
So it will transmit on
the longer end of things.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.810
And this is actually a
bright orange red color.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.650
So you have a very
long, long wavelength

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:41.020
that you're observing here.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.860
This beautiful red orange.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.390
It's a really brilliant color.

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:47.730
Now interestingly, I mentioned
in terms of applications,

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:50.690
as some transition metal
complexes were used to color

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.630
things-- and I mentioned
the blue in blueprint--

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:57.350
and if you take this compound
and actually add iron

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.330
in a different
oxidation state to it,

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.600
and, form this complex
that has iron plus 3,

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.390
and iron plus true with
cyanide, you actually

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.160
get the blueprint blue.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.000
So the colors can be just
dramatically different

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.120
depending on what gets
added to the system.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:17.160
All right, so now let's think
about-- it's a little sad--

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.210
but things without color.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:23.230
So what coordination
complexes would be colorless?

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.910
What would be true
about the d orbitals

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:29.960
If you had a colorless thing?

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.743
Yeah, what would be true?

00:43:31.743 --> 00:43:33.774
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:33.774 --> 00:43:35.690
PROFESSOR: Yeah, they
could all be degenerate,

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:37.979
so there's no splitting at all.

00:43:37.979 --> 00:43:40.520
Which usually doesn't happen if
there are any ligands around.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.040
That's their hypothetical
spherical crystal field,

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.290
which I brought with me again.

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:45.664
Because I just
love carrying this

00:43:45.664 --> 00:43:49.250
through the infinite corridor
and have people look at me.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:52.400
But, if you do have the
ligands around, it will happen.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.830
If all of your d
orbitals are filled,

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.140
or if the energy
levels are basically

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.940
out of the visible range.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.910
So the transitions are not
in the visible range at all.

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.000
So, if they're all
filled-- so, there's

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.580
no way that you can
move an electron.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.020
Or, if you can.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.250
But it's outside
the visible region

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.690
All right, so now let's
think about some examples

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:18.710
of what transition metals
would fit into this.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:20.459
And I'll bring up
my periodic table.

00:44:20.459 --> 00:44:22.250
And we'll also bring
up a clicker question.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:36.530
All right, let's just take
10 more seconds on this.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.230
All right.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.144
So we can take a look at this.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:03.220
And with our periodic table,
we have nickel and palladium,

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.350
group 10 minus 2 is 8.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:11.020
Copper plus 2, gold
plus 2, 11 minus 2 is 9.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.560
Zinc plus 2, cadmium plus
2, twelve minus 2 is 10.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.770
And so 10 would be the
correct number for our field d

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:19.310
orbitals.

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:23.310
They can hold 10 electrons.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.920
S if we, then, go and fill this
in, examples would include:

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.830
zinc plus 2, and cadmium
plus 2, with our d10 system.

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:38.560
And in fact, zinc plus 2 is
a very common oxidation state

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.560
for zinc.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.630
Many proteins require zinc.

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.120
Many of you have zinc
in vitamin tablets.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.460
Some people take
extra zinc to make

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.690
sure you have enough
zinc plus 2 in your body.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:52.820
And a lot of times people
who are studying proteins

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.790
do not realize it's a zinc
containing protein because they

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.147
isolate the protein.

00:45:57.147 --> 00:45:58.730
And it's clear, so
they don't think it

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.370
has a transition metal in it.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:02.290
But zinc is hiding
in that protein

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.850
because it's colorless so
you don't know it's there.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:08.330
If you purify a protein with
color with other metals,

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.400
it's really obvious
that the metal is there.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.040
But zinc can be sneaky.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.810
Cadmium can also be sneaky.

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:18.110
Cadmium, for the most
part, is a poison to us.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:21.590
And they used to use it
to coat barbecue grills.

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:23.090
Which is not-- you
don't want to put

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:25.830
a poisonous substance
on a barbecue grill

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:26.710
and then heat it up.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.870
That's a really bad idea.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.270
So if you go to a
barbecue and you think,

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:35.362
wow, that grill looks like
it's, like, 70 or 80 years old,

00:46:35.362 --> 00:46:36.320
or something like that.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.460
It looks ancient.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.190
Maybe you don't want to eat
from that barbecue grill.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.790
They don't do this anymore,
but old barbecue grills

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.960
had cadmium on it.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.390
And I know someone who
actually had cadmium poisoning.

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:49.730
And it was a really pretty
terrible thing because it's

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:50.980
hard to diagnose that.

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.270
But they finally got
the right diagnosis.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:55.400
All right, so again,
colorless things,

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.610
you don't know that they're
there, but they sometimes are.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.376
All right, so what
about cobalt plus 3?

00:47:01.376 --> 00:47:02.500
You can just yell this out.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:06.910
Would this be a
colorless compound?

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:07.750
No.

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:13.550
So we have in our group 9, minus
3 would be sync -- would be 6.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:14.770
So it's not.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:17.390
Which vitamin contains cobalt?

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:19.030
And you probably all
know because we've

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:20.350
been talking about it.

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:22.030
Vitamin B-12.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:24.490
And I just thought I
would share with you

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:27.790
the colors of vitamin B-12.

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:31.720
And so this is crystals
that contain vitamin B-12.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.570
And these are their actual
colors of the crystals.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.210
So it's really fun to
work with vitamin B12.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:39.160
It's absolutely brilliant.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.030
Except that it's
also light sensitive.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:43.660
So you have to work in
the dark, under red light.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.420
So everything, then, is red
because you're under red light.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:48.910
But if you bring them out,
and you expose them to light,

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.320
they're really, really pretty.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.778
All right, so we're going to
continue on this cobalt theme.

00:47:52.778 --> 00:47:56.080
Because cobalt is one of the
most spectacular transition

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.160
metals when it comes to color.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.156
And I'm going to get you
ready for a little demo.

00:48:01.156 --> 00:48:02.530
And you're going
to help me first

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.770
figure out what colors you
should observe in this demo.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:10.640
All right, so, we're going to
have a cobalt compound that

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.940
has six waters with it.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:17.780
And you're given the octahedral
crystal field splitting energy.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.840
So now we want to
predict the color.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.790
And when we predict
the color, we're

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.740
asking about what
sort of wavelength

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.750
is going to be absorbed.

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.249
So we can think
about the wavelength

00:48:26.249 --> 00:48:27.410
that will be transmitted.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.830
So we need to think
about our equations.

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:33.250
And we can combine these just
like we did in many problems

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.110
in the earlier
part of the course.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.930
And so wavelength equals
Planck's constant times

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:38.950
the speed of light.

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.200
Now, instead of just
divided by any energy,

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.050
we're dividing by the energy
that's the octahedral crystal

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.130
field splitting energy.

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:48.010
And so we can put in
our Planck's constant

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:49.430
and our speed of light.

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:52.360
And we can put in the octahedral
crystal field splitting energy

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.560
that we were given.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.250
But we want units in meters.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:00.920
And so we need our
joules to cancel out.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.220
And in the bottom we're
given the splitting energy

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:04.220
in kilojoules.

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.220
So we need to do
some conversions.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.450
So first we need to get
rid of this kilojoules.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.540
So we're going to
convert it to joules.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.330
Then we can get
rid of our joules.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:14.440
We also have seconds.

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.420
We don't want seconds
in our wavelength.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:19.790
But that is going to cancel out
here and here, so we're good.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.550
But now our answer, we
have meters at the top,

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.550
but we have moles on the bottom.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.917
So we need to use Avogadro's
number to cancel out our moles.

00:49:27.917 --> 00:49:29.500
And if you don't do
that, you're going

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.190
to get a really weird number
for your wavelength that's

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:34.380
not going to make sense.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.796
It's going to be
off by something,

00:49:35.796 --> 00:49:38.320
like, a factor of 10 to the 23.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.410
That should remind you, you want
to use Avogadro's number here

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:43.540
to get rid of your per mole.

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:47.230
All right, so now we
have a wavelength.

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:50.470
And yes, on your equation
sheet, we will give you this.

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:52.270
We will give you
the color spectrums.

00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:54.410
You don't have to memorize this.

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:59.500
So about 500 nanometers is in
our green region over here.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.530
So the color that
should be absorbed,

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.680
given this octahedral crystal
field splitting energy,

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:07.990
is green.

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:15.740
So now, for green, what is the
complementary color of green?

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.690
Yup, so it's going
to be reddish.

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:19.780
We have our little
drawing over here.

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.940
So the predicted
color would be red.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.742
So let me just now tell
you about this demo.

00:50:25.742 --> 00:50:27.700
And we're actually going
to see some red color.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:31.400
But we're also going to see
another color which is blue.

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:37.000
So, in this demo, if you have,
start with some copper chloride

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.500
and add a lot of water.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.460
A lot, a lot of water.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.870
Hydrate it really well.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:44.290
You'll get this
octahedral system

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:46.330
that you just told me was red.

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:48.310
But if you don't
add a lot of water,

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:49.780
just a little bit
of water, you'll

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.270
only display some
of the chlorides.

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:54.560
And then you're going
to have a blue system.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.950
So if you have a
lot of water, red.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:58.840
And you're hydrated, red.

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.490
If you're more
dehydrated, you get blue.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:04.680
So we're going to now try
this out and see if it works.

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:11.190
GUEST SPEAKER: Is it on?

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.773
Yeah, it's on.

00:51:11.773 --> 00:51:12.600
Great.

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.426
OK, so that's the cobalt flower.

00:51:15.426 --> 00:51:17.800
And as Cathy said, it's-- oh,
we're going to put it under

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.850
there.

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:23.230
As Cathy said, it's
got some cobalt.

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:25.376
And it's got water ligands.

00:51:25.376 --> 00:51:26.500
And it's also got chlorine.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.034
And Eric's going to
sprinkle it with water now.

00:51:29.034 --> 00:51:30.700
PROFESSOR: So we're
going to hydrate it.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.740
GUEST SPEAKER:
Hydrate it, as you do,

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.210
when you have to water a flower.

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:40.680
And it's turned, like, it's a
pinkish, reddish color, right?

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.220
Can they see that up there?

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:42.760
Yeah.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.218
PROFESSOR: It looks
better with it.

00:51:44.218 --> 00:51:45.800
Hold it against
this, too, I think.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.675
GUEST SPEAKER: Right.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.720
So to show you that it
was, in fact, the water

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.390
that led to this
color change, we're

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:01.460
going to try to
dry out the flower.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.550
Is it working?

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:03.190
Am I on hot?

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:04.231
Yes, I am.

00:52:04.231 --> 00:52:05.230
I know it's really slow.

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:06.438
I'd just rather it go faster.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:12.930
And, well--

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.621
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:52:14.621 --> 00:52:16.620
Why don't you hold it
under the document camera?

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.520
I think you can kind
of see it happening.

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:29.610
GUEST SPEAKER: So
as-- there we go.

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:30.360
That's working.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.760
As Eric continues to
warm this thing up,

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.070
the water is evaporating.

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:39.150
And as that happens, it starts
forming that hydrous chloride

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:41.190
complex instead of up
here, hydrous complex,

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:45.420
and it's going back to emitting
blue color instead of red.

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:49.200
And hopefully we can see.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.060
Oh, there.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:50.773
It's working.

00:52:50.773 --> 00:52:52.560
Yea.

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.890
PROFESSOR: So some people
give each other roses.

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:59.100
But if your significant
other is a geek, what's

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.410
better than a flower that
changes color on hydration?

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:03.130
I don't know.

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:05.940
I think this is a
pretty good gift.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.890
Valentine's Day isn't
quite coming up,

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:08.990
but just keep it in mind.

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:14.760
All right, so we'll
leave the flower here

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:19.560
and we'll keep an eye
on it as we go along.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.460
It will change back eventually.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:24.060
It depends a lot on the weather,
but it's pretty dry right now

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.220
in this time of year.
