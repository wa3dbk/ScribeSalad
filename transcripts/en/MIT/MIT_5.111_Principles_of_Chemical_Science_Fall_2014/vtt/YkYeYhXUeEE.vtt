CATHERINE DRENNAN: So
I am Cathy Drennan.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.530
You're going to be
learning more about me

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.640
as this morning goes on.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.670
Everybody should have a handout.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.850
If you do not have
a handout, Aaron

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.410
will come around
and give you one

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.540
if you just raise your hand.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.760
There's a few in the
back that just came in.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.120
We will be giving out-- look
for TAs as you come in the room.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.180
We'll have handouts for you
every day so look for them.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.460
And if you come in late
we'll normally leave them

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.530
in the entrance way here.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.800
I know that some of you have
a long walk between classes,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.510
so the handouts
will be available.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.290
So when you come in, grab your
handout and come on into class.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.400
So now, let me tell you a little
more about these things lecture

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.380
notes that you can bring a pen
or pencil to class to write on.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.780
So this is the
summary for today.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.200
So today is really more
about announcements and what

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.410
we're going to cover, but
there are some features

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.730
of today's handouts that you
can use throughout the semester.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.410
So lecture summaries
will always have

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.340
the reading for the class
for that day's class.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.770
So when you're going back over
things and thinking about it,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.320
you can always look
at what reading

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.300
was associated with the class.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.220
They'll also always have a
reading for the next class,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.740
so you can read
ahead which is good

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.550
for the pre-lecture questions.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.550
So now I want to give you
a sense of the material.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.190
So we had this on our
list of topics today.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.210
General information.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.910
We've gone through
course material overview

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.460
and introductions to
the teaching team,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.840
but it's MIT so we need
to start with a quiz.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.004
The quizzes.

00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:13.545
Can you tell me who
these people are?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.860
So who is This

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.130
AUDIENCE: you.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.750
CATHERINE DRENNAN: It is me.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.110
This is my college
yearbook picture.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.560
So one day you will
have one of these.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.666
Who is this?

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:32.239
AUDIENCE: It's you.

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.530
CATHERINE DRENNAN: It's not me.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.310
People say that, but thank you.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.741
It is Lisa Kudrow.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.980
So who knows who Lisa Kudrow is?

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.420
Friends, yes.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.460
So Lisa Kudrow and
I were classmates.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.600
We were in the same year.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.300
So you can look at
who's next to you

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.460
and figure out
who in your row is

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.330
going to be that famous person
that one day you can say, yes,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.175
I was classmates with them.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.768
So Lisa and I were classmates.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.550
What do you think Lisa
went to college to study?

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.430
I heard the correct
answer out there.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.670
It was in fact biology.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.140
What do you think I went
to college to study?

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.310
Yes, some people have
watched my OpenCourseWare

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.100
and know these things.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.650
Yes, theater, drama,
biopsychology.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.400
That's kind of like course nine.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.540
That's what I was interested in.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.562
What do you think
Lisa majored in?

00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:47.170
AUDIENCE: Bio.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.120
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Biology?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.780
Or drama?

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.060
It was biology.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.970
What do you think I majored in?

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.800
It was chemistry.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.680
And of course, we all know
that Lisa is an actress

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.680
and I am a chemistry professor.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.920
So I like to start
every class with this

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.970
because I think it says
something very important.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.240
I did not like chemistry
in high school.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.200
I was in chorus.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.440
I would schedule every
one of my music lessons

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.510
during the chemistry class.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.660
I did everything to avoid
having to attend chemistry

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.630
in high school, and
then I went to college

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.240
and they said you have to take
chemistry if you're thinking

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.340
of a biopsychology major.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.650
And I was like, I've
taken chemistry.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.290
I'm quite convinced
chemistry is not

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.020
relevant to biology in any way.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.760
I was told I was wrong.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.100
I was sure I was right.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.030
I took chemistry and
realized that chemistry

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.430
can be very different in
different circumstances

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.020
and that everybody can
find their appreciation

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.180
for chemistry at a different
time in their lives.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.970
Some of you right now
already like chemistry,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.850
but a lot of you
probably have not

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.220
found your love
for chemistry yet.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.680
Some of you may find
that love for chemistry

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.790
during this semester.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.610
I'm hoping it'll be a
large fraction of you.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.100
Some of you may not find
your love for chemistry

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.400
until next year or senior
year at MIT or even

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.810
in graduate school or even
when you have a job later on.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.530
Sometimes when I'm traveling
around-- and as a professor

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.120
I travel the world
and give talks

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.220
and I'm chatting with
someone in an airplane

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.310
or on a bus or something and
they say, what do you do?

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.220
And then I say, oh,
I teach chemistry.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.682
And I always kind of watch
the reaction to that.

00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:40.390
And some of them are
like, uh, chemistry,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.200
and other people say,
boy, I'm an engineer now

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.420
and I have to work with
chemists all the time

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.360
and I really wish I had paid
more attention in chemistry

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.580
class because we
need to work together

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.010
and I need to understand
more what they're doing.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.150
So some people do not find
their love or their appreciation

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.330
for chemistry until they
have a career later in life.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.540
So I'm not sure when it's
going to be for all of you,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.470
but if you have
not found it yet I

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.880
am hoping to find a connection--
your connection to chemistry.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.980
What about chemistry
relates to what

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.080
you want to do in the future?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.780
And one reason that I did
not appreciate chemistry

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.220
in high school is
I didn't really

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.740
understand who chemists
were and I didn't really

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.750
understand what chemistry was.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.120
What people used chemistry for.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.750
And part of the reason I
think were these pictures

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.980
that are often shown in
intro courses for chemistry

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.990
and in your intro textbooks.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.630
That's partly why I
think $8 is a good price

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.750
to spend on these
chemistry textbooks.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.310
These are great chemists
but they're all dead,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.790
and that really gives the
message that chemistry

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.680
is not a living discipline.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.320
Chemistry was a thing
that people used to do

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.960
and it was exciting
at that time,

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.600
but then when they got
rid of their powdered wigs

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.560
they moved on to other fields.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.410
So I'm going to be showing
you some different pictures

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.730
in this class.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.920
I'm going to be showing
you these pictures.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.080
Some of the old pictures
will be there too,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.240
but every time I show
you a dead white guy

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.390
I want to show you
someone who is alive.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.950
So these are living chemists.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.140
People who are using chemistry
every day of their lives,

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.610
and I'm going to be showing
short videos of these people

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.460
telling you how
they're using chemistry

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.280
and what chemistry is
being used for today.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.850
So you'll be hearing-- and
this is a series I like call

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.830
in their own words.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.710
Another thing that I didn't
appreciate about chemistry

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.210
was in the lab course I had
a strong base and a weak acid

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.820
and we would drop,
drop, drop, drop,

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.680
drop until it turned pink.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.870
And then we could calculate
the molecular weight

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.130
of an unknown weak acid.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.470
And I ask myself, is this
like a real pressing problem?

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.610
A lot of weak acids out there
somewhere that if only we

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.670
knew the molecular weight
the problems of the world

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.375
would be solved?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.230
But it turns out that this
is kind of a good intro lab,

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.130
but it's in fact not what
chemists do every day.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.170
We will learn about
titrations because we

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.969
need to know PKA because
PKA is important,

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.760
but we don't have a
lab and we're not going

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.450
to be doing that experiment.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.480
So what is chemistry research?

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.690
Chemistry research is all
of these following things.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.942
So creating quantum dots
to be used in surgery.

00:08:34.942 --> 00:08:36.400
How do you know if
the doctor's got

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.990
the right amount of a tumor?

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.970
You don't want to
take more flesh

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.490
than you need but you don't
want to miss some of the cancer.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.060
So you want to image exactly
where that cancer is.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.090
Chemistry is designing
sensors to find explosives

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.050
in war zones.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.880
This is a really important
problem right now.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.890
Biofuels, energy,
alternative energy--

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.000
that's what chemistry is.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.800
Using basic principles
to figure out

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.410
how to design better biofuels.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.180
Or making new pharmaceuticals.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.370
We haven't really
produced new antibiotics

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.950
in a long time in this
country, and a lot

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.950
of things that we thought used
to be treatable conditions

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.380
now are no longer so
treatable because we

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.380
don't have new antibiotics
and the bugs are becoming

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.030
resistant to the old ones.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.370
This is what chemistry
research is today.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.030
This is what you're going to be
using chemical principles for.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.497
So what chemical
principles are you

00:09:26.497 --> 00:09:29.080
going to be learning that will
help you solve these real world

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.250
problems?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.890
So we need to learn
about matter and we

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.804
need to know how matter reacts.

00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:36.220
So in the first
half of the course

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.077
we're going to start
with atomic theory.

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:39.910
There is going to be a
little bit of history

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:40.900
involved in that.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.000
Talking about the discovery
of the nucleus, electrons,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.597
protons.

00:09:45.597 --> 00:09:47.680
And so we're going to have
a little bit of history

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.910
and some cool demos.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.980
We're going to move on
to the periodic table.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.870
That's the chemist toolbox.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.110
Those are the elements that
we can combine to make things,

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.660
and when we combine them to
make things they need to bond

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.430
so we're going to
talk about bonding.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.690
And they're going
to form molecules,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.190
and we need to think about the
structures of those molecules

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.100
because the structures
dictate the properties

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.050
of those molecules
of that matter.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.570
And then molecules can react.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.970
So we're going to talk
about how they react,

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.660
and whether a reaction is going
to go is about thermodynamics.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.607
Is it going to be spontaneous?

00:10:19.607 --> 00:10:22.190
But then, we also need to know
if it's faster or if it's slow.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.970
That's kinetics.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.070
So we're going to cover
both of those things.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.480
Chemical equilibrium.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.490
You can have a reaction
that goes one way

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.730
and is going in the reverse
direction at the same time.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.250
And there'll be an equilibrium
constant associated

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.785
with that reaction,
but sometimes

00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:37.910
you really want to go more
in the forward direction

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.410
to make the thing
you want to make.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.690
So you need to think about
how the reaction quotient

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.810
queue is related to the
equilibrium constant K.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.140
And if you're the Green
Lantern, equilibrium constants

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.230
are meaningless.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.990
You have the Green
Lantern ring and you

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.650
can push that equilibrium in
any direction that you want.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.740
If you're the Green Lantern,
Q is always greater than K.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.950
But if you're a
student of chemistry,

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.930
you actually can
become a super hero

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.940
by learning about those
chemical principles.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.810
And then, you can drive Q to
be greater than K as well.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.200
So I want to teach you
how to be a super hero.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.620
I also am going to teach you
about solubility and acid base

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.990
and oxidation
reduction reactions

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.690
because those are really the
fundamental types of reactions

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:25.160
that occur in biology, in
materials, and everything.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.900
And a little unit on
transition metals.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.610
That middle part of
the periodic table

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.700
where you have iron and
cobalt and copper and nickel

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.440
and all those
amazing elements that

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.560
really allow you to do the most
challenging chemical reactions.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.650
Those are especially
fun, and if you

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.640
want to have the
power of chemistry

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.020
you've got to know about
the transition metals.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.080
So without chemistry
you wouldn't be alive.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.547
Your body are a series
of chemical reactions.

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:55.880
You wouldn't be wearing the
clothes that you're wearing.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.560
Pretty much a
chemist figured out

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.550
the material that you're wearing
and or how to process it.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:06.400
And I think really importantly,
you couldn't spell MIT without.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.090
Chemistry

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.880
We have the M from
physics, the I for math,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.910
and we have the
T from chemistry.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.250
So if you want to
spell MIT you gotta

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.760
learn about the ideal gas law.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.520
And you wouldn't have the paper
that you might be currently

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.220
writing on without chemistry.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.930
So you really should
study chemistry

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.390
because the major
challenges of our time

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.060
require chemistry
knowledge to fix them.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.750
Treating human disease requires
an understanding of chemistry.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.390
Solving the energy problem
requires an understanding

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.200
of chemistry.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.840
And I believe people will come
up with alternative energy.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.700
I'm just less convinced
that they're not

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.400
going to destroy the
environment while they do it.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.350
So I really think we
need people thinking

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.720
about solving the energy problem
who care about the environment

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.690
and can use chemistry
to think about how

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.670
we can protect the environment.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.800
So why do I care
so much about this?

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.930
And that's because
yesterday morning I

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.920
walked my daughter to her
first day of first grade.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.210
She's six years old.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.210
She's starting
school, and I need

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.940
people to know chemistry
to make the world a better

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.060
place for her.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.390
So what I can do as a
mother who's a chemist

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.110
is find the smartest people
I can find, which I've done,

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.840
and then teach them
the chemical principles

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.750
they know to make the world a
better place for my daughter.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.520
So what I'm hoping
that you will do here

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.150
in my course objectives-- I
said I'd get back to these.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.720
I want you to have a working
knowledge of chemistry

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.140
that you can take
advanced courses.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.220
Starting pretty simple.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.680
That's what I want.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.630
I also want you to
know enough chemistry

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.060
so you can do a UROP
in a chemistry lab,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.250
and we'll talk more about
the undergraduate research

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.370
program throughout the course.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.940
I would like you to employ
chemistry principals

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.606
in a lab that's not a
chemistry lab in your UROP.

00:13:56.606 --> 00:13:58.730
I want you to
appreciate how chemistry

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.400
is used to solve
real world problems,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.580
to make informed decisions
about your health, about

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.610
the environment, and
energy and science policy,

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.280
and I want you to be able to
advance science and engineering

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.860
through the application
of chemistry principles

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.870
because I want you to
make the world a better

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.120
place for my daughter.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.020
And that's why I want you all
to have superior knowledge

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.500
because my daughter needs
more than adequate knowledge

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.910
to have a better world.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.260
She needs superior knowledge.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.030
So that's my goal
for all of you.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.580
To teach you these things.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.210
You don't all have
to become chemists.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.770
In fact, it's fantastic if you
take the knowledge of chemistry

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.630
and bring it to
other disciplines

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.560
because we're going to need all
the disciplines coming together

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.420
with that solid knowledge to
be able to make this world

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.500
a better place.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.850
I'll say that there are
many 5.111 superstars

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.040
in this class in the
past who came in,

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.610
like Sarah who hated chemistry
and became a chem major

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.880
and ended up getting a
PhD in chemical biology.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.430
All these folks have
gone on using chemistry,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.970
not all as chemists-- in
biological engineering,

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:10.560
full ride scholarship to
medical school, PhD in biology,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.830
running a local pharmaceutical
company as an executive,

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.800
doing biophysics out at UCSF.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.150
So all of these people
learned the chemistry

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.720
they needed to go on
and do great things,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.540
and you can put your
picture in there.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.000
So speaking of people,
we have five minutes

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.100
where I really need to introduce
you to all the teaching team.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.290
We have a huge
group of people who

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.070
are going to make
it possible for you

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.570
to obtain that superior
knowledge of chemistry

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.150
and go on here at MIT
to do great things.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.100
So I'm going to ask
them all to come down.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.990
And I think we have
a hand-held mic.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.460
And everyone can
introduce themselves.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:56.890
And let's bring that down.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.265
Actually, maybe
we'll start here.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.160
ELENA GORIN: Hi everybody.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.740
My name is Elena Gorin.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.400
I'm going to be your course
coordinator for this semester.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.630
So if you have any
issues that you

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.630
feel need to be
handled by someone

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.220
closer to Professor
Drennan I'm the one.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.410
I'll also be sending a lot
of e-mails to you guys,

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.404
so pay attention.

00:16:21.404 --> 00:16:23.320
And I'll tell you a
little bit about clickers.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.840
You'll get an e-mail from
me about clickers very soon.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.870
SAM: Hi, everyone.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.420
My name is Sam.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.250
I am the clicker TA, so I'll be
handling clickers and clicker

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.710
competitions and
stuff like that.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.550
So if you have any
clicker questions

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:42.960
you can find me before or after
class in the clicker corner

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.130
I think is what
I'm designating it.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.240
Clicker corner.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.410
So if you forget your
clicker or anything

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.930
like that-- I encourage
you not to forget them,

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.690
but if you happen
to don't panic.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.192
Just come see me and
we'll work things out.

00:16:57.192 --> 00:16:58.650
And we're supposed
to say something

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.300
that I enjoy doing outside of
chemistry in graduate school.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.179
So I ski.

00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:05.970
So if there are any
skiers in the audience,

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:06.848
we should hang out.

00:17:11.165 --> 00:17:12.040
ASHLEY: Hi, everyone.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.050
My name is Ashley.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.200
I'll be running
recitation number eight,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.240
so I look forward to
meeting as many of you

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.640
as I'll have the
opportunity to meet.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.190
One of the things that I
enjoy outside of chemistry

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.700
is Latin dance.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.360
I'm not saying I'm any good
at it, but I do try to be.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.130
YIVAN Hi, I'm Yivan.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.320
I run the microphone.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.002
Me and Ashley run
the microphone,

00:17:35.002 --> 00:17:37.920
so we'll run around, give it to
you whenever you have questions

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.760
during class.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.000
I run recitation
four and I enjoy

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.470
cycling outside of chemistry.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.070
AARON: Hi, I'm Aaron.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.990
I'm one of the two handout TAs.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.661
So before class you want to
make sure you have a handout

00:17:49.661 --> 00:17:50.910
before you get into the class.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.610
So Toe and I and probably a
few other people on some days

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.730
will be making sure
you all get handouts

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.440
before you get in class.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.000
I'll be running
recitation two, so I

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.610
will hope we'll see 25 of
you or so at 2:00 tomorrow.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:11.630
And outside of class, I
enjoy doing taekwondo.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.850
ODIN: I'm Odin.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.300
I was lucky enough to be
switched into this class just

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.640
yesterday, actually.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.077
And I enjoy hiking.

00:18:19.077 --> 00:18:20.910
I spent a lot of time
in the White Mountains

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.760
up in New Hampshire.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.550
DAN: Hi, I'm Dan.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.370
I'm in recitation seven, so
hopefully I'll see some of you

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.150
guys tomorrow.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.000
It's at 12 o'clock.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.902
And outside of
chemistry-- I guess

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.610
some of my favorite
things to do are just

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.259
play pick up games of soccer
or football with my friends.

00:18:37.259 --> 00:18:38.050
MIKE: Hi, I'm Mike.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.980
I'm the MITx coordinator
for the class,

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.190
so if you have questions
about pre-lecture questions

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.800
talk to me.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.820
I was also the graduate
chemistry teacher here

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.170
for the last couple of
years in quantum mechanics,

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.630
so I'll have office hours
on Wednesdays after class.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.870
So if you have quantum mechanics
questions come and ask me.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.960
LISA: Hi, I'm LIsa.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.846
I'm teaching the recitation
six, so if you're in six

00:19:03.846 --> 00:19:04.470
you're with me.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.400
It's going to be awesome.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.970
I enjoy traveling and running.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.010
So usually what I like
to do is every time

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.160
I go to a new place I like
to go for a run there.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.180
It's kind of weird, but.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.390
ROSE: Hi, my name is Rose.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.380
I'll be teaching
recitation number nine.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.170
Outside of chemistry
and school I

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.080
enjoy reading and being outside.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.275
I go for runs too.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.410
ERIC ALT: Hi, I'm
Eric Alt. I think

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.150
I'm teaching recitation five.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.530
And outside of chemistry
I like to run and play

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.950
soccer and other sports.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.710
FRANK: Hi, my name
is Frank and I'm not

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.670
teaching any
recitation, but I will

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.800
be the Pset TA for the course.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.550
And what I love to do outside
class was playing badminton.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:57.853
THO: Hi, I'm Tho,
like toes right here.

00:19:57.853 --> 00:19:58.353
Seriously.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.601
I'm teaching rescission number
11, and outside of chemistry

00:20:04.601 --> 00:20:06.850
I have no interest so I just
sit there and do nothing.

00:20:10.229 --> 00:20:11.270
ANTHONY: Hi, I'm Anthony.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.710
I teach recitation
section number one.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.140
Bright and early
at 10am tomorrow.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.482
Outside of chemistry I enjoyed
tennis and playing piano.

00:20:20.482 --> 00:20:23.350
ERIC: Hi, my name is Eric
and I teach recitation 10.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.800
And outside of chemistry
I like to cook.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.020
AMANDA: Hi, I'm Amanda.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.760
I don't remember my
recitation number

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.800
but I know it's at 2
o'clock in the afternoon,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.740
so maybe I'll see
some of you tomorrow.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.170
And when I'm not doing
chemistry or school

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.170
I like to ride horses.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.750
I grew up on a horse farm.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:41.550
JAY: Hi, everybody.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.720
I'm Jay.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.375
I'm doing recitation
number three.

00:20:45.375 --> 00:20:46.670
It's at 3pm tomorrow.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.930
Hopefully I'll see
some of you guys there.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.970
Me and Eric are
the two demo TAs.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:58.120
So when we have awesome demos
in class you can thank us.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.140
And outside of chemistry I like
to play tennis and table tennis

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.770
too.
