00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.250
In this case study,
we're going to see

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.890
how we can create a photo
illustration of your work.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.580
The idea here is to show
how a liquid battery works

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.700
for a final illustration.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.200
So first, create
photographic bits and pieces

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.130
and put them all together.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.060
Think of it just as if you
were drawing the pieces

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.550
and putting those
sketches together.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.810
After I met with the researchers
for a brainstorming meeting,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.390
I got all this
material from them,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.180
including a diagram
that described my idea

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.930
to create a model of how
a liquid battery works.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.960
This is the way I
imagined the shoot to go.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.510
OK first, I would take an
optical quality cuvette

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.880
and would then pour the
mercury and the water

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.550
into the cuvette and
somehow suspending

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.040
with a clamp, a strip
of metal foam, which

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.490
is an important
part of the science.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.070
And because I was imagining a
full container of this material

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.270
after making the
image, I would then

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.680
crop out the right
side-- we don't

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.260
need to see the
clamping device--

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.060
and then flip the left
side, or a small portion

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.090
of the left side,
over to the right,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.100
to then make the full
container and the final model.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.910
Now remember, this is
not a documentary image.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.120
This is a photo
illustration for, hopefully,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.650
a cover submission.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.560
That's the idea.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.390
OK, so first I start looking
at the cuvette, the vessel

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.320
into which I was going to
be inserting and pouring

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.160
all the components.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.440
I put it on a light box
and liked what I saw.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.840
The picture was going to be
simple and lit fairly well.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.539
Then I practiced
inserting the metal foam

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.820
with a clamping apparatus,
to see if it was doable.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.920
And it was, at least
with an empty container.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.080
Sort of a dry run, so to speak.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.160
So the next
photograph I took was

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.639
with the mercury and water
in the container, which

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.660
looked fine too.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.900
I then discarded
that, by the way,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.280
into the special container
the researchers provided,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.090
and sort of started
all over again

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.530
and tried for the
next steps, which

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.060
was going to be inserting
the foam at a certain level

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.860
with the water.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.380
I played a little with lighting,
by shining a tungsten lamp

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.010
onto it.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.350
It gave a warmer
feel, which I liked.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.760
Then I plopped it
further into the water,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.750
to see how that
was going to look.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.150
And again, I changed
the lighting,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.290
by adding a little lamplight
onto this material.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.040
So I was getting there.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.230
Eventually, this is the
image that I wound up with.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.760
Well, sort of wound up with.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.070
And I'll tell you, frankly,
I was a bit nervous

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.300
dealing with the mercury and
pouring it out and dealing

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.000
with that and the
water, especially

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.730
while having the important
cautionary instructions always

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.730
sitting in front of me.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.340
So again, making the pieces
photographically and then

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.710
putting them together
was the way to go.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.460
Remember, this is an
illustration using photographs,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.730
for the purpose of creating a
model of the technique of how

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.810
a liquid battery works.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.460
And this is how I did it.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.360
I'm using Photoshop
here, but you can

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.940
use other software, of course.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.370
Take a look at
the real life part

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.750
of this, where we're using
one image for the receiver

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.940
of the piece on the
right side, which is

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.829
what we had been talking about.

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.200
So I'm first going to
select the right side,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.100
copy and paste into the
image on the left side--

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.829
the container with
all the material.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.900
Move it around a little
bit, see if it has

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.160
the potential of being doable.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.320
It's not bad.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.870
I think when it's flattened,
it will look better.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.550
I think it can work, so I will
in fact flatten the image.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.220
And if you remember,
we were going

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.029
to crop out the
right side, which

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.840
is what we're going to do here,
crop, make the image as full

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.670
as we can without the
right side cropping it out.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.120
OK, that looks pretty OK.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.760
And now, as we had previously
talked about in the animation,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.590
we're going to flip
one side to another.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.110
But first, in order to do that,
I'm going to expand the canvas,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.220
to make room for the
new piece that we're

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.610
going to start working with.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.420
So I am, in fact, taking a
piece of the left side, which

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.900
is what we talked about.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.680
I'm copy and pasting,
there it is again.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.010
And we're going to flip it to
make up for the empty side.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.380
We'll just flip it horizontally.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.520
Move it around a bit, and
with a little fudging,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.560
we get a pretty nice start for
an image that we're getting to.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.180
I decided to play more about
raising it one more level.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.940
And so I went back
to what we have

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.150
seen before in another
image, where I basically

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.390
take this pretty good image,
select the background,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.390
invert the selection so that
we have, in fact, selected

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.420
the liquid battery.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.680
Copy and paste,
and you see here,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.610
we have another layer of
just the liquid battery.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.770
And went to Layer
style and went back

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.190
to our old Drop Shadow friend.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.330
And I played with making a
drop shadow, which I did like.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.810
I tend to think that
it just pushes it away.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.770
And I think it
worked quite well.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.920
Eventually, what I
did wind up doing

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.130
is playing a little bit with
putting a different background,

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.750
for example, making a gradient.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.490
That wasn't going to work.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.180
I didn't even know
what I had in mind,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.420
but I really wanted something
a little more dramatic.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.840
So going back to the
picture without the color

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.850
in the background, I'm
keeping the drop shadow.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.260
I went to Adjustments
and decided

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.650
to invert the whole picture.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.230
And yes, that's quite an unusual
image, but decided to do it

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.815
and play a little
bit with the hue,

00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:53.630
to get that blue back to the
orange that I sort of liked.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.030
It wasn't quite enough.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.010
I increased the
saturation a little bit.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.080
And there it is.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.260
This was the final image that
I showed to the researcher.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.730
And frankly, I think we
got ourselves a winner.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.870
Unfortunately, not the
cover of the journal,

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.250
which I really-- we were
hoping that would happen.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.790
But it did get the home
page of the journal,

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.940
and a couple of other home
pages of various journals.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.460
And it got a lot of attention.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.190
First of all, of course,
the science was important.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.040
But we pretty much agree
that making an image

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.110
to draw attention to
the science really

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.690
is what this image
making is about.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:45.070
I hope you enjoy this, and see
the thinking that is extensive

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.990
when you get into
something this complicated.
