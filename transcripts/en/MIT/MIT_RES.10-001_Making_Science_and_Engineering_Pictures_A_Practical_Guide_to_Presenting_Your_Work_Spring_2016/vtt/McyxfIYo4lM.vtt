00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.220
An important part of your image
making, mostly small devices,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.140
is what you use for backgrounds,
or how to view backgrounds.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.120
You know, you can make some very
interesting images even more

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.610
interesting if you
subtlety suggest

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.810
a certain kind of background
that works, that's relevant.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.210
Your selection can
really change your image.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.250
Sometimes you have
to be kind of careful

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.260
'cause the background can
overtake what you want to say

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.430
and we'll see that in a moment.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.580
So take for example
this image that I made

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.700
of an assemblage of pieces.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.020
And I took it on a surface
against a white wall, which

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.660
is what a lot of you do
and, the issue for me

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.870
is that even though you don't
think that the view sees it,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.040
the viewer does see the
horizon, where the two pieces

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.720
of material meet.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.140
You might say, 'Well,
what what's the big deal'?

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.190
Well, you should
start really getting

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.690
into the habit of trying to edit
out anything that is ambiguous

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.220
or that is not giving the viewer
a very clear view of what it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.880
is that you want them to see.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.550
So it's much better to just
keep a piece of paper handy,

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.090
and just simply fold
it up towards the back

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.430
and you'll get yourself
a very nice background

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.420
without seeing that
distracting horizontal line.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.714
I really do suggest
you you start

00:01:33.714 --> 00:01:34.880
doing these kinds of things.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.680
It's easy with
such small devices.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.060
Here's a device that was taken
just in the lab, a quick image.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.810
And once again, the researcher
knows what it is to look

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.580
for, but you cannot expect the
first-time viewer to see what

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.320
you want them to see.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.450
And so they do see all
the mess behind it.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.880
So, just take that
piece of paper

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.460
that we used before, and
just put the device on it.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.700
Lean it against
the same background

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.690
that you had before, but this
time with the paper going up;

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.850
hiding that material
in the back,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.350
you can see much a
much clearing device.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.560
Sometimes echoing what
you're looking at,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.370
it could be very helpful.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.579
I was asked to take some images
of some copper sulfate crystals

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.770
and so I found a
piece of copper -

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.810
two pieces of copper
actually - and just

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.870
suggested the presence of
copper in this material.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.030
And here, with
these plastic shapes

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.310
that were fabricated
in a lab, I just

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.930
thought it would be fun
to put it against a grid.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.980
Not a very [laughs]
clean grid ' by the way,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.940
this was taken quite
a long time ago.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.540
But what it did show was sort of
helping to define these shapes

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.380
and how those lines were changed
when these plastic pieces were

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.500
put over it.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.470
Here's an image I
took for a book trying

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.690
to talk about a drop of water,
which is very complicated.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.410
And what I did was -- remember
we're using a 105 lens focusing

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.310
on the drop so, as you
probably know by now,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.620
you can get a very narrow
depth of field when you use 105

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.610
lenses, which is what
we wanted in this case,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.730
because the
background is blurred.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.660
The next image shows
you the background.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.150
I mean, it's something I bought
quite a while ago knowing

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.440
someday I would use
it for a background

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.310
because I like the look of it.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.310
And I also knew that
with a 105 lens,

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.510
it would become a whole
different thing, as you see.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.450
Take a real hard
look at that drop

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.829
and you'll see that
the drop itself

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.530
became a lens that has
focused the background.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.230
So, it's a little playful thing
that I forgot what happened,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.110
but it did.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.650
But here's a background
that is totally out of focus

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.260
that you want to
be out of focus.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.630
Otherwise it would just
be too much of an image.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.570
On this one image of a
bacillus in a petri dish,

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.280
I just decided to
layer the petri dish

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.920
on a particular
plastic blue, and then

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.279
I put the blue over orange
and I was having kind of fun.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.400
On this one, we're showing
sketches of the CAD

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.530
that was used to
make these devices.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.100
And it's just a sketchy-like
idea, which I like very much.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.540
I still like the idea of showing
some sort of a human hand

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.610
to the fabrication of
very high technology.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.900
I think that we should use
more of these kinds of ideas

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.170
as my point of view.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.420
And here's another.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.850
It's a wafer made
into electronic device

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.610
with one background.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.870
And I took the same wafer and
put it on another background,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.720
and then again on
another background .

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.520
And changing the
angle a little bit

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.320
so you actually see a very
different color pallet.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.100
And that's what
I'm talking about.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.750
It's all related.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.950
You make one change in
one spot and then it's

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.340
going to change your composition
or your point of view,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.000
it's just ongoing,
the permutations.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.930
For this image, we wanted
to show the ability

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.720
to make these
crystals, and I decided

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.962
to use some weighing
paper against a desk

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:30.920
and it just happens that
the light is coming in

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.040
from the window and I actually
used it compositionally

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.120
and as part of the background.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.510
And here, we're seeing material
that results into a powder.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.340
And again, I'm
using weighing paper

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.290
and make it a sort of
interesting overlay of shapes

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.010
because it's a pretty
boring picture otherwise.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.770
I think it's a little
more successful.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.110
And these are things that
are not easy to photograph,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.600
as I'm sure you know.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.370
And on this, I used a
reflective quality of glass.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.170
Ah, it might not
be as successful

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.990
as I thought because
maybe you can't quite

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.170
tell where the glass begins
in the real slide with these.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.610
These are highly
hydrophobic slides,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.940
that's why you're seeing
the water bubble as it does.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.810
I don't know, it's
something to think about.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.580
And here I used, I
kind of was echoing

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.750
the shape of this material, how
it coils into these nice scoops

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.000
and I decided to
use a small table

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.580
to echo the shape of the
naturally occurring curves.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.659
Here's an example where I put
the device on stick-ems, just

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:43.810
a blue post-it
onto which on that

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.409
I put a post-it on
a black surface.

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:47.930
I think this works.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.750
I think the next one where
I used a crazy background.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.350
Look I got a card that
I though was very fun.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.810
It's fun to look at the card,
but not with the device on it.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.590
It's just way way
over the top and too

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.940
much with the background,
just really gets in the way.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.520
I needed to take a photograph
of this very small robot, flying

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.930
robot, which measures
about one centimeter long.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:19.830
And, used the box that the (the
plastic box that it arrived in)

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.380
as part of the
composition which I think

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.930
fills the background
in an interesting way.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.050
In this image, this
was a very quick image

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.310
that I just made
just to see how,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.900
what kind of depth
of field I was

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.050
gonna get with these devices.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.100
And it turns out that I sort
of like the haphazardness

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.450
of this image.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.110
The background just
was accidental.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.830
For me, it works.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.770
Maybe not for you,
but for me it does.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.700
Backgrounds should be
part of your vocabulary.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.470
There is no question
in my mind about that.
