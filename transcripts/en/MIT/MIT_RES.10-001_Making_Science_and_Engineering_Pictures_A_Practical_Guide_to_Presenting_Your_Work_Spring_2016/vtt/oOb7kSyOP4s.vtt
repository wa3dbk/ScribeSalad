00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.390
Creating images that are
more than good enough

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.610
is what this case
study is about.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.310
This happened quite a
while ago, about-- I can't

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.640
believe it's 20 years ago.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.800
In this lab, this is the image
that the researchers came up

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.860
with on their own.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:29.180
You're seeing a surface that has
etched-out hydrophobic lines.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.320
And so when you drop
water on the surface,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.260
the water stops at
these hydrophobic lines.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.070
This measures across
about 4 millimeters.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.190
So these are drops
of water that are

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.290
taking on the shape of
the hydrophobic lines.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.710
And this is how it was used in
the article that was accepted.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.670
I luckily came across
it, because this sort of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.010
started my whole career 20
years ago in science imaging.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.850
What I did with this image,
as you've seen before,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.838
is I asked them to please make
a triangle so I could start

00:01:03.838 --> 00:01:05.129
working a little bit with this.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.750
And I dropped some water on
that triangle, also etched out.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.710
Here, as you remember,
I made the picture

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.760
with direct lighting.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.500
Here I diffused the lighting.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.570
And I was playing
around a little more.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.310
Another chip was
etched out as well,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.490
and I started using fluorescing
material to drop on the chip.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.190
This gold, it's called a
self-assembled monolayer.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.600
In this image, I wanted
to show a sense of scale,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.740
so I used the
syringe with which I

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.930
dropped the water
on the surface,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.160
just to give you
a sense of scale.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.950
Finally, getting around to
submitting for a cover design,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.470
I asked the researchers,
could you please

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.530
at least give me a grid
of the etched lines

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.940
so I could then drop onto the
grid fluorescing green water

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.050
and fluorescing blue water?

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.750
And you could actually
see the etched marks

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.820
creating the hydrophobic lines.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.810
I didn't like
seeing it too much.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.300
Those lines were in the way,
so just moving the camera ever

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.079
so slightly gave
me a cleaner image.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.490
And again, I was imagining
the journal's logo at the top.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.620
What was really important
was that the editors

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.560
felt that the way I photographed
it was misinformational.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.740
That is, you're seeing two tones
of green and two tones of blue,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.620
and that was
miscommunication for them.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.020
It turns out that's
really the way it was.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.790
But in the end,
what we did decide

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.040
to do was give them
a simplified version,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.910
where I focused in tightly
onto the square drops of water,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.750
as we call them. (They're
colored water with fluorescing

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.620
dyes.) Each square is
about 4 millimeters across.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.790
And it was a simplified
image, as what we strive for.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.170
And in the end, we were lucky,
and it did get the cover.
