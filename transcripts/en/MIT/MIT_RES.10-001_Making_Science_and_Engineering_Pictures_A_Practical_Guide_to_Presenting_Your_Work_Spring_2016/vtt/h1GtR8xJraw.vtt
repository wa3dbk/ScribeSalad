00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.990
So many of us are
using camera phones

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.870
and sometimes tablets to make
some pretty terrific pictures.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.220
I made this one.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.000
I was sauteing some
colorful peppers,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.600
and when I put the
cover on, I saw

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.070
what I thought would be
a pretty beautiful image.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.760
So of course, I quickly
grabbed my phone.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.970
And that's what this
is about, isn't it--

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.610
the ability to
quickly take a picture

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.470
without a big deal using phone
cameras to quickly make images

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.420
when you see
something interesting,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.470
or in this case, something
very beautiful, in my opinion.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.150
So did my son, by
the way, who made

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.340
a whole series of photographs
of my amazing birthday party

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180
with my family at
Per Se in New York.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.330
The dishes were created
by Chef Jarrod Huth.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.170
And so these pictures
are basically

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.130
portraits of each course, all
taken with his camera phone.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.800
And by the way, I adjusted
the color later on,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.760
before uploading all of
these for this tutorial.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.360
And here when we're permitted
to take a look at the kitchen,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.360
we see a place very much like
a laboratory, showing process

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.380
and equipment and people
doing their thing.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.160
So camera phones do
have an important place

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.390
for a means of making very quick
portraits of various places

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.550
in the lab, of the
work, of the equipment.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.700
You can think about taking the
picture and then cropping it,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.980
for example, as I did here.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.320
But for the most part, the
quality of the photograph

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.520
is not what we're
encouraging in this course.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.690
If you remember,
we did a comparison

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.030
between two images of a Petri
dish, one with my phone camera

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.759
and one with a flatbed scanner
at a higher resolution.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.710
Well here, is another difference
for example of the device

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.220
that we've seen before
with the phone camera

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.400
and with my digital camera.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.730
And you'll see that the
information is just not

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.710
there in the phone camera,
because of the file size.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.820
It's just too small.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.870
But once again, I'm going
to say there is definitely

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.430
a place for these very quick
and impulsive images, which

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.880
you're seeing now for the use
of web designs, for example.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.230
I was having a really great
time walking around this lab,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.910
making a few images
which work better

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.260
with a little bit of
cropping, and in fact, were

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.160
used for the lab's website.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.840
So there is a place for
this kind of photography.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.260
But remember, the
quality is just not there

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.800
and is not good enough
for a journal article

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.700
and certainly not a cover.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.890
It might well be someday.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.070
The technology is constantly
changing with each iteration

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.530
of the phone.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.470
So yes, it's a great
idea to practice

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.590
walking around your lab,
creating these portraits.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.110
And certainly, it's
an interesting way

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.040
of getting you to see.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.350
But in the end, you've
got to use your full frame

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.270
digital camera with
the best resolution.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.650
Here's an example of where I
had absolutely no time at all

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.370
to make a picture
for what I knew was

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.579
going to be a grant submission.

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.430
So this is a pretty,
pretty fast image

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.480
that I made with my phone--
pretty awful, and part

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.550
of some equipment that was
necessary in the research.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.829
Took the image,
straightened it out,

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.070
then cropped it
like crazy, knowing

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.650
that eventually the final image
was not going to be up close.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.250
It was a figure on the
first page of a submission.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.850
So I did crop it in.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.990
It doesn't look
brilliant right now.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.460
But in the next image, I
edited out certain pieces

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.640
and created a laser light,
which was all illustrative,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.470
of course, not for real.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.340
And so this is
what I finally did.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.530
I inserted it in a figure
that we used for a page

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.540
in the summation.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.750
This is the page that we
finally wound up with,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.709
replacing this image.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.880
The idea behind this is, showing
the two next to each other,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.480
I hope you agree that the
image that I quickly made

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.720
on the right is more appealing.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.730
And it is taking up
real estate on the page.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.270
So why not make it into a
summary graphic as opposed

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.680
to putting every single thing
you could think of in a graphic

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.540
and make it unreadable.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.390
This is a way of using
very, very fast-made images

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.270
in a submission.
