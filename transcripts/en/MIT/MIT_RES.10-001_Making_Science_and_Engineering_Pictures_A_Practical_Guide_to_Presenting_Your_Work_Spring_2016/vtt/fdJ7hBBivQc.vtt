00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.080
This week we'll be
talking about probably one

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.140
of the most important aspects
of photography, which is light.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.980
As in photo-graphy
[spoken  phonetically],

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.780
writing or drawing with light.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.390
It's a very content-rich
conversation,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.810
we're going to have, and
could really, easily,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.880
take up a full six-week course.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.030
But for our purposes
here, we're going

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.180
to give you something
of an overview,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.460
showing you various
forms and characteristics

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.259
of some light sources.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.310
We can't address every
conceivable possibility.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.700
But what we can do is tweak
your curiosity, I hope,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.170
so that you pay attention, very
close attention, to what you're

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.550
seeing as you change
your own light sources,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.530
looking at the
shadows for example.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.800
How do they and they
and the highlights

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.360
change as you move
your light source?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.100
And observe exactly what's
going on when you make even

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.740
some very minimal changes.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.110
Let's start with a very simple
piece of equipment, a lightbox.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.430
It's really easy
to use when you're

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.810
working with
transparent material,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.039
just by placing
your work directly

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.380
on top of the lightbox.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.900
But you'll see
also, later, it can

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.260
be also another general
source of lighting.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.910
So let's start with a picture
of these two petri dishes

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.280
growing E. coli.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.770
So that works.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.560
In this image, we're seeing
small pieces of colored plastic

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.100
shapes, about 3 millimeters
across that are organizing,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.729
or self-assembling
at the interface

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.470
between two solutions.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.340
They're becoming a flat
assemblage at that interface.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.950
And all I did was put
the glass container

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.520
holding all the material
on the lightbox.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.070
And here, I'm making images
of sugar crystals growing

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.250
on sticks.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.400
You know, they serve
you that sometimes

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.100
when you order a cup of coffee.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.840
So here is one rendition
on a lightbox of the sugar,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.390
and what I decided to
do for the next one

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.690
to simply invert the image,
which we've seen before.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.310
Here's a picture that I
made a number of years ago,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.820
which I still like.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.360
It's a picture about light,
a metaphor about light.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.710
It was one of
those lucky efforts

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.900
when I just set up a magnifier
and the paper, [laughs]

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.130
and in about 30 seconds,
I got the picture!

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.960
(Very unusual, by the
way!) So the image

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.650
is intended to suggest a process
of etching with light when

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.300
we talked about it in
our book No Small Matter,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.530
about nanoscience.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.050
In this image of something I
assume you recognize by now,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.200
we see a different
kind of lighting

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.220
that you've seen from previous
images of the music box.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.440
I shot from above
with mostly daylight,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.390
and then I turned
on a little bit more

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.060
light from a
Tungsten lamp above.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.880
This is specific
to this situation,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.460
but you might find
it helpful in yours.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.370
Look what happens when you
just simply click and turn

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.680
a light on.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.620
From the light being off,
to the light being on,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.950
you'll see how the
image drastically

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.550
changes by just adding
an additional lamp

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.120
from above this fishing reel.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.120
Yup [laugh], that's
what it is, by the way,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.240
it is a fishing reel placed in a
translucent, green garbage can.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.470
[laughs] I thought it was fun
to see what kind of quality

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.420
I could get by shooting into
a plastic, translucent garbage

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.980
can.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.800
Very specific to say the least.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.750
Again, just by adding one
additional light -- this time,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.240
inside the vacuum chamber I'm
imaging ' we see what starts

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.450
as this kind of image,
and becomes this image.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.750
You'll see how it really
changes with the simple addition

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.360
of just one light.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.260
In this image of a
triangular-shaped water drop --

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.870
it's actually an etched area on
a surface onto which we placed

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.970
water ' you can see the
reflection of the lamp

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.350
on the water drop.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.430
We just directed a
lamp onto the water.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.380
That's considered
direct lighting.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.920
When I shine the
lamp onto a card,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.720
in this case, a gold
card, the light then

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.779
bounced back onto the
water drop and you'll

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.810
see a completely different
quality of lighting.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.110
This is called bounce lighting.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.470
The bounce gives us
diffuse lighting.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.670
Let's compare the two.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.650
Let's look at a
quick test that I

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.490
made for us to see the
difference between two

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.110
kinds of bounces.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.130
In this case, the
bounce lighting

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.370
will used as fill lighting.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.230
We'll use a white card and
then we'll fill with a mirror.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.170
The main source of light
is daylight from a window.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.750
So, here's an image of
the inside of the watch

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.090
that we've seen before,
just with daylight

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.960
on an overcast day.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.420
Here, I added a white card
on the side of the watch

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.540
for a fill.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.930
Here is a mirror reflecting
the daylight, again, as a fill,

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.070
onto the watch.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.790
Let's go back to the original
'just daylight'; then the card;

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.750
then the mirror; back
to the watch alone;

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.530
then adding a card; then
adding just the mirror.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.740
Let's zoom in to see
the subtle differences

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.270
in each of these cases.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.910
Now depending on what
your material is,

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.390
you might see much
more dramatic changes.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.040
But I encourage you to
experiment with these ideas.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.730
By the way, here's
another image I

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.689
made, this time using both the
card and the mirror as a fill.

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:44.855
Let's see them all together.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.340
Light is all about
shadows as well.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.560
And it is quite remarkable
how small changes can

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.990
change the shadow in images.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.600
How a powerful
direct light source

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.630
can produce a significant
shadow, and that shadow does,

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.550
in this image, become a very
strong compositional element.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.440
Here's where I'm using the
light on this wafer showing

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.790
the chip that sits next to it.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.740
In this particular image,
I was playing around;

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.590
I decided to just use a slant
of light -- uh, maybe, uh,

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.320
Emily Dickenson would
be happy with that.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.220
On this image, I
decided just to make

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.170
sure the light was
covering the entire wafer.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.350
I actually like the
first one better,

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.909
but it's something
to think about,

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:40.530
about using light in terms
of making compositions.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.430
In this image,
I'm using a shadow

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.350
to better communicate what
the grading on the surface

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.010
of this plastic is doing.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.340
It's diffracting the light
into different wavelengths.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.370
I produced the shadow
by placing a card

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.360
in front of the light source.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.140
See how the image
looks without the card.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.370
Shadows alone can tell a story.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.790
Here, we're trying to show
something called the Marangoni

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.810
effect; you know, when you twirl
a glass of wine we see some --

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.380
what some people
call 'tears of wine'.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.310
It's a complex phenomenon.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.830
In this image, I
tried for quite a

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.310
while to make an image
depicting the Maragoni effect.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.360
Not at all successful.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.880
Finally, thinking that
I should concentrate

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.640
on the glass, and the shadow
that is being produced,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.550
then I finally focused in
on what is the Marangoni

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.550
effect on its own, as a shadow.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.460
Now, for example, looking at
this small assemblage, which

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:50.690
is about two centimeters across,
I lit this with one light.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.870
It's a monopoint, it's somewhat
of a fiber optic source.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.010
And you could see carefully,
if you look at this image,

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.160
where does the light
source come from,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.450
and hopefully you will figure
out that if the shadow is here,

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.180
then the light source
has to be around here.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.140
In this next one, I added
a second light source

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.690
that not only lights the
device as light to it,

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.900
but it also adds another shadow.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.100
And in this next one,
the second light source

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.150
has been altered in terms of
its direction and the height

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:36.690
because the shadow that it casts
is slightly longer and even

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.299
more so in this
final image where

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.640
the light, the
second light source,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.950
is very low compared
to where it was.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.400
And you know that again
because the shadow

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.980
is considerably longer.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.710
Now, why bother
looking at all this?

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.090
It really is, once
again, learning

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.690
to see so that when you play
with your own light sources

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.910
with your own
devices, you're going

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:08.120
to pay not only great attention
to lighting of your device,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.440
but the shadows that the
lighting will be producing.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.570
It's important.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.290
It might not seem that way
at this point, but [laughs],

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.560
I promise you, it
really is important.
