00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.660
For the rest of
this video segment,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.880
I thought I would go through
a few of them with you

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.410
and we'll watch them together.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.090
So let's start with this one.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.790
It's actually a piece of
art, but I immediately

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.970
saw the technology involved with
getting those balls floating

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.580
in the air.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.070
So it's relevant
for us, I think.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.200
And I think the video
continues to engage us.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.490
I was really drawn to the color
in this particular attempt.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.100
It's quite beautiful, in that
sepia tone-- for me, anyway.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.020
So now we see a hand.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.360
That's interesting.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.780
They are making the video
a little more compelling

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.020
by inserting a fourth ball.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.750
OK, it's a good idea
that you run the video

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.490
and change it after
a few seconds.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.870
So look what's going on now.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.540
They've cut into a new video
with colored balls, which

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.060
is really quite beautiful.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.430
And so we're inserting yet
another iteration of the video

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.630
after the first.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.319
And I'm still
fascinated, and want

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.050
to look at all those balls.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.990
It's the same set up that
was in the previous video,

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.760
but this time colored.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.670
And we're at the very end
now, and there you go.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.760
I thought it'd be fun
for you to just take

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.320
a look at this particular one.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.890
The question is
whether or not this

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.210
is relevant to your
own video making.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.780
That's your call.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.710
So let's go to the next one.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.250
You're seeing a surface
inside a piece of equipment.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.110
And we see drops of water
forming on the surface.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.250
I gather the researcher first
tried to capture the phenomenon

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.430
with angles lighting this.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.039
There were too many reflections
and glare, he mentioned to me.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.340
So in the end what
you're seeing here

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.180
is interestingly a ring light.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.660
It's concentric with
the lens, and it's

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.810
lighting this surface at a
perfectly perpendicular angle.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.020
I remember that he tried a lot
and wound up with this one.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.480
And we're seeing
that these drops are

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.180
coalescing and becoming larger.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.590
And that is in fact the
point of the science.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.590
Later when he sent
it to me, I asked

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.900
if he intended to
include in the frame

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.960
the left side wall
of the apparatus.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.840
For me it looked kind
of like an accident.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.200
And in fact his
first response was

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.620
that he didn't intend
to show the wall,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.120
but after thinking
about it the edge

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.050
is very informational
to scientists

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.829
who understand
this kind of stuff,

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.410
because the edge affects
the motion of the drops.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.470
So for me, I would have
shown even more of the edge.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.120
Great deal of attempts were made
in trying to make this video.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.525
In the end, I think
it's a great job.

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:49.650
So here's something
that's considerably

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.660
different from what
we've been seeing before.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.850
We're seeing a flattened
something-or-other become

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.810
unflattened totally by himself.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.390
We can sort of guess that -
-that was a bit of a jump.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.240
You can guess that the battery
is making all this happen.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.870
It's somewhat origami-like,
wouldn't you say?

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.630
And now he's becoming
even more of a something--

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.746
I don't know what to call it.

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:19.550
It really is a robot.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.060
And so these
researchers are doing

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.910
some pretty fabulous
stuff, where

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.710
you start with a
flattened assemblage that

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.510
becomes something else.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.190
And we did speed
this up a little bit,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.110
So that's why you're
seeing some jumps.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.600
There he goes.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.760
Kind of silly, but incredibly
unique and very exciting,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.690
leaving a trail behind
him, by the way.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.460
And finally, this last batch
is a bit beyond the course,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.310
because these videos were
made with a high speed camera.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.510
But I thought I'd get you
excited about your next steps,

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.660
in case your work will benefit
from high speed photography.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.180
The point here is, as
we continue to suggest,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.000
is that the way you
approach any kind of videos

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.760
should still be
informed by what we've

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.290
been discussing for
the past few weeks

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.800
on how to make your still image.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.780
I hope you agree about that.
