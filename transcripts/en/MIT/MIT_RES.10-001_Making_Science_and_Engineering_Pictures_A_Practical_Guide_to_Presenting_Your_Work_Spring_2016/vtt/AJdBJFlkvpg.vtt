00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.960
The question of how far
we can go when we enhance,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.860
or adjust, or touch up an image
in science is a critical one.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.760
You are all familiar,
I'm sure, with

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.270
the stunningly
beautiful Hubble images

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.340
published all over the world.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.390
But most of the world is
not familiar with the fact

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.650
that the colors
we're seeing were

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.619
artificially created, decided
and implemented by humans.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.430
You can read a
conversation I had

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.820
with some of these
researchers in American

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.710
Scientist, in the
resource section,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.270
look for this thumbnail.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.760
I think you'll find the
article interesting,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.340
about the decisions the
researchers made about coloring

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.500
the detail of nebula.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.060
So in essence, the
coloring, or enhancement,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.380
was mostly done for the purpose
of communicating structure,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.610
and I would say also for
helping bring attention

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.400
to these amazing images.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.190
Now remember, these
pictures of the universe,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.200
are representations, that
is re- presentations,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.330
they are photographs
of that universe,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.230
they are not the universe.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.350
All the photographs
in this course,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.130
and the ones you are
making and will make,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.920
re- present various structures
and phenomena, in order

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.980
to communicate research.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.570
You, the image maker,
has to make decisions

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.550
in order to make these re-
presentations, as I do.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.120
Should I make an
image of this or that,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.400
shall I compose it
this way or that?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.900
When shall I set up my camera,
in the winter or in the summer?

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.130
At five minutes of the
phenomena, or three days later?

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.830
What tool shall I use,
should I use a scanner

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.630
or a stereo microscope?

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.900
What lighting set
up should I use?

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.900
What background is best?

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.270
So, in a way, the whole
process of photography

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.130
requires us to make decisions
about making adjustments,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.680
for the purpose
of communication.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.410
The question we
must ask ourselves

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.880
is, do any of these choices
misrepresent reality.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.170
So that process of selecting
colors in the Eagle Nebula

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.310
is similar to my process when
I colored this image, which

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.750
was originally grayscale.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.490
I made the image with electrons
on a scanning electron

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.870
microscope, an SEM.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.100
We needed electrons
to see the nanowires,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.550
they were too small
to use photons,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.490
as we do in photography.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.310
Once again, the purpose
here is to show more clearly

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.320
the structure.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.400
The difference
between my adjustment

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.180
and the astronomers'
adjustment is

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.410
that the color choices of the
researchers in the article

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.980
were informed by
chemical characteristics

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.100
of the various
areas of the image.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.550
My choices in this particular
case was purely aesthetic.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.010
But first and foremost
with any work in science,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.920
whenever we color any
SEM or other image,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.400
we must always indicate
what we have done, period.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.120
Somewhere near the image,
not on another page,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.180
we have to dig deeply to
see what's going on here,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.680
somewhere near the
image we must say,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.079
"this image was color enhanced."

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.190
The subject of enhancement
is not discussed enough

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.290
in your training.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.160
Many of you just assume that
certain adjustments can be made

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.740
in software on your pictures.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.900
That is not the case.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.570
I can't possibly go through
every example of adjustments

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.130
at this point, but
I'd like to encourage

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.720
you to start thinking about it,
from the very beginning when

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.965
capturing your
work, when you start

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:15.220
a particular investigation,
which you will be submitting

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.750
for a publication,
when you start

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.050
documenting the work as
evidence of your research.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.100
Just as Important, I'm
encouraging you to have this

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.230
kind of conversation
with your colleagues,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.740
to create a mindset in your
lab of do's and dont's.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.400
We just don't talk
about it enough.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.820
So let's even start
with these videos you've

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.700
been watching for our course.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.170
I mentioned to you
in the welcome video

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.710
that I digitally cleaned
some of the images

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.180
that you're looking at.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.110
The reason I gave you for
getting rid of the specks,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.370
was so that you would
not be distracted

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.230
by imperfections in the various
samples that I photographed.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.130
Well, that was a decision I
made for this particular purpose

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.310
for this course, to
teach you about process.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.390
And most important is the
fact that I informed you

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.040
of my adjustment.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.320
However, if you are submitting
an image for a published

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.290
figure to a journal, well
that's a whole different story.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.000
I was privileged to have a long
conversation with a few editors

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.230
and the art director at Nature.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.910
We discussed a number of
examples you'll be seeing here.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.500
We talked about what is
permitted and what is not.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.140
First, we concluded that
the rules for cover images

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.409
are different from
images in figures.

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.409
Nature regards cover submissions
more as illustration, or "art,"

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.090
and in that case,
one is permitted

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.380
to clean some specks and
distracting material,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.820
and to add color for example,
if the image is initially

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.650
in black and white.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.630
Here's a picture
I made, starting

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.300
with the unadjusted image
of the yeast colony,

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.470
and here I digitally
deleted the Petri dish,

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.760
because I wanted the viewer
to see the stunning morphology

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.660
of the colony.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.800
The data in the image is the
morphology of the colony.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.380
I'm not adjusting
that data, I am simply

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.570
removing the part of the
image that in my opinion

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.780
is unnecessary or distracting,
although not everybody agrees

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.640
with me.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.760
Science did permit that
adjustment for the cover,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.940
and once again I
described the adjustment

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.130
in the cover captions.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.140
Here, I made this image
of a device on film,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.840
so because the lighting of
the lab created a green cast,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.080
it's how the film
read the scene.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.350
My adjustment of
the color was trying

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.120
to get the image to
what my eyes saw,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.930
and in my opinion is acceptable.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.980
And this one taken under
a stereo microscope,

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.159
we see an artifact of
the process, a reflection

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.630
of the lens on the wafer.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.670
So here I remove the reflection,
again always indicating

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.500
what I've done.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.920
In this one, which you've
seen before, I first

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.490
use the stereo microscope,
but because with this tool

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.250
I didn't have control over
the direction of the light,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.330
we're seeing all
sorts of distractions.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.050
In the second image, which I
made with a camera and a lens,

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.780
the image is cleaner.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.220
I did not digitally
clean the specks ,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.970
it just looked better with this
equipment and this lighting.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.480
Or let's take this
device one step further,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.120
where I made this detail
with a microscope.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.900
Using a technique
in microscopy called

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.540
Nomarski Differential
Contrast, which

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.770
emphasizes surface
structure, based

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.010
on the index of refraction.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.790
That's why you're
seeing all these colors.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.250
So all of these decisions
address which tool shall

00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:01.940
I use, basically adjusting my
point of view, which translates

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.200
into adjusting the final image.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.560
This one is a more
complicated question,

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.830
which the editors and
I discussed at length.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.710
In effect, we started
having a conversation

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.560
about what is reality, which is
a subject I promise we're not

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.520
going to pursue here,
but in essence this

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.890
is a question that
should be somewhere

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.830
in the back of your thinking.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:31.100
After all, you are making
re- presentations of reality,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.260
aren't you?

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.820
So here's the
image, which I hope

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.530
gets you to think a little bit.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.510
These are rods, measuring about
two to three centimeters long,

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.950
all of which have absorbed
fluorescing material.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.070
This is the image I captured
on film under UV light,

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:53.680
however my eye saw this
image with orange rods.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.060
It turns out the film did not
capture the orange wavelength,

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.620
so I digitally adjusted
those rods that

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.250
were supposed to appear orange.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.660
That adjustment was not
acceptable to the editors

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.890
it turns out.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:13.290
In my opinion, the adjusted
image was closer to reality

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.610
than the unadjusted image.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.390
What do you think?

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.330
And take this one, here
is the original image

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.980
of these amazing
Proteus colonies

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.910
growing in a Petri dish.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.350
As it happens, the agar is
cracking in a few places.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.990
I made the image for the book
On The Surface of Things,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.410
the point was to show
how the colonies grow.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.960
And I didn't want to
detract the reader

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.790
from the point of the image, so
I digitally deleted the cracks.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.680
Now the Nature editors
all agree this would never

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.640
be accepted for a figure
in their journal, which

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.050
makes sense.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:57.250
But what about a book for the
public, what do you think?

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.190
Here's an image from another
of my articles in American

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.250
Scientist.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.800
Look for the thumbnail
again under the resources.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.450
I very mistakenly deleted
a small speck in the middle

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.020
of the glowing circle here.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.720
I did so after asking the
researcher if I could do so,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.620
and he very politely
said it was fine,

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.210
but years later when
we discuss the article,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.330
I realize that that
deletion was very improper.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.540
It turns out that
that small speck

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.700
had an important effect on the
final outcome of the image.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.170
I guess at the time he
was trying to be easy,

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.760
and the article was not part
of a journal submission.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.770
But now, and we both agree,
the mistake was clearly mine.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.050
I had no right to
adjust that image,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.120
even after asking
for permission.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.680
Here's that
adjustment, by the way,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.250
you saw before, reverting
a grayscale image,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.770
and the editors did
accept that at Nature.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.560
Now how about this one?

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.890
It's true that these
are microscopic images,

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.372
and beyond the
realm of the course,

00:11:01.372 --> 00:11:02.830
but I thought it
would be important

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.770
for you to think about it.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.110
The researchers supplied me with
two of their original images.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.110
The colored areas
gave highly detailed

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.140
morphological information
about the cell,

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.120
as specific quantum
dots attached

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.250
to specific structures.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.620
When the dots are
excited with UV light

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.640
they fluoresce, and so
we see where they attach.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.590
In standard views of
fluorescently labeled material,

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.430
the colored areas are set
against a black background.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.010
I thought it would
be interesting

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.500
and maybe more
communicative to see

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.160
the information differently,
as long as I maintain

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.330
the integrity of the science.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.360
So I inverted the two
images in Photoshop

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.350
to give a white background.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.380
But because it was important
to keep the original colors

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.420
of the structures themselves,
I changed the colors back

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.680
to the red and green.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.940
I then layered
both of the images

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.800
over a third image taken with
standard microscopy, again

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.950
supplied by the laboratory.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.560
The three layered results
shows the same information

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.760
as the original separate
images, with the addition

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.430
of a sense of the whole.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.410
I'm showing you where
the structures are,

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:26.840
I'm not quantifying the amount
of quantum dots present.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.210
Another form of adjustment,
changing histograms,

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.280
can also be part of
our conversation.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.420
Here's an old gel run
created a while ago,

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.750
when the runs were
still captured on film.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.130
The point I want to make
here, it's still relevant.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.690
So here I am zooming
into a portion,

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:52.150
after I change the
histogram for the whole run.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.380
Now that's important, I
didn't take a portion.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.280
In this one, I adjusted
the contrast even more,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.330
and on this one even more,
to better see the bands.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.080
Now what do you think about
this, is this permitted?

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.360
The editors at
Nature were initially

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.740
comfortable with
the enhancements,

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.040
since the adjustment
was universally

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.570
made to the entire image.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.370
And later in the
conversation, they

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.340
emphasize the
requirement to indicate

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.380
how that image was enhanced.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.040
OK, so what about this one?

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.610
The tank you're
looking at was used

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.420
to study sediment rates of sand.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.630
And it was too large to
photograph in one image,

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.680
and so I made the
couple of images

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.170
and superimposed them
for a journal article.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.590
You'll notice I stitch
the two images together,

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.670
showing the fact that
there are two images,

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.140
you're seeing the overlays.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:56.500
I did the same for this image,
this time microscopic, again

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.770
since it wasn't possible to show
the whole device in one image.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.640
And here again, I decided
to include the boundaries

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.360
to each image, letting
the viewer know

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.570
the full image is a collage.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:14.100
And for this one, the
researcher made single SEMs

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.860
and used Microsoft software
to stitch the pieces together

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.840
for the article.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.250
Here we cleaned it a
bit, what do you think?

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.280
Once again, I want
to say there are so

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.410
many possibilities
in this conversation,

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:35.900
but it's critical that you keep
all of these questions in mind

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.000
when you talk to each
other, and certainly

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.370
when you start thinking about
communicating your work.
