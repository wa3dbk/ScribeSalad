[FELICE FRANKEL]
Christine Daniloff

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.180
is the art director
of the MIT homepage.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.970
She's the person
responsible for getting up

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.890
these amazing images of
what's going on on the campus.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.629
And do quite a turnaround
time, by the way.

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.240
It's amazing how she does it.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.020
We're going to pick up in
the middle of a conversation

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.700
that I had with her.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.130
I value her opinion
on so many things,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.390
and I also value her friendship.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.800
Here we go.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.509
[FF] So they send
you stuff that they

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:54.970
think would work as an
image for the homepage.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.450
[CHRISTINE DANILOFF]
Yes, they do, though -

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.560
[FF] I'm laughing because I
already know what you get!

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.029
[laughing]

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.570
[CD] They do.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.950
They often like images
from the research.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.670
And one example
I'm thinking about

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.770
was in one of the
labs at MIT, they

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.210
work on technology for
photographs-- imaging

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.460
technology.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.200
And so it was this
very cool thing

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.260
where basically if
you took a photo, say,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.590
with your smartphone
and it was blurry

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.620
and it was askew and all this,
the chip they were working on

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.270
actually corrected all of that.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.440
All the information had
been gathered in the photo,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.310
but it would automatically
correct this photo so that it

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.170
was almost like frame quality.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.710
You could get this
really great photo.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.110
[FF] So the algorithm-- they've
created an algorithm that

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.990
corrects for that.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.740
[CD] Exactly.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.020
So when I asked, are
there any images,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.729
what they sent me was
an image of the chip.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.530
OK, cool, and I think that's
valuable with the story.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.140
Like here's the chip.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.610
But the image I put together
was-- I started to think, OK,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.480
we're MIT, and I know
that the local audience,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.805
and I think the broad
audience too, loves "the dome"

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:13.430
and all this...

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.080
But I thought,
really what people

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.540
are going to get from
this, is that if you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.000
have this image on a cell
phone and it's blurry

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.040
and it's not really
crisp, and then

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.970
you see this image-- the
same image-- clear, crisp,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.559
framed on the wall.

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:30.100
[FF] Perfect.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.484
[CD] That sort of gets the,
this is what it means to--

00:02:33.484 --> 00:02:34.650
[FF] You're telling a story.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.050
[CD] This is what
it means to my life.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.216
When somebody looks at this
and is sort of like, OK,

00:02:38.216 --> 00:02:40.670
technology, but why
does this matter to me?

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.350
Well, this is why
it matters to you.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.990
And so that, I guess, is one
of the key questions I always

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.530
think about answering
in the image

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.590
is why it matters in our lives.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.280
It's important work
that's being done,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.260
but it's sometimes so
theoretical and so out there,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.260
you don't even understand that
this algorithm will someday

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.640
might make it possible
for me to have

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.300
a robot that does my laundry.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.847
That, people can get behind.

00:03:11.847 --> 00:03:13.430
[FF] That's actually
very interesting.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.420
So it's, "who is the audience?"

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.980
And that's something that
we talk about in the course

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.579
as well.

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.140
That says it.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.200
[CD] I agree.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.880
[FF] So let me just ask
you some technical things.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.300
Let's say a researcher
does have an image that

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.210
is relevant to the science
and it is compelling enough.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.290
Does it have to be a certain
file size, for example?

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.950
[CD] It does.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.300
A high resolution is important
because low res images

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.340
are small images.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.350
Even though I
primarily am designing

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.340
for digital display, which
is low resolution, to work

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.420
the image in high res
just creates a crisper,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.670
sharper, more-beautiful image.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.390
Plus, we're also able to use
that image on the new site

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.990
and offer it to press where,
when press picks up this stuff,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.550
sometimes it's print.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.900
It's often the Times
or Financial Times

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.900
or it's a magazine
and they want images

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.470
and they have to have
high res for print.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.670
So high res is always best.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.130
Keep your image as large as
you can when you send it out.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.870
[FF] And you, as
the art director,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.000
can zoom in and create
your own framing.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.930
[CD] Absolutely.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.730
You can crop things a certain
way to make something.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.170
[FF] So does it matter if it's
JPEG or TIF or do you care?

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.130
[CD] It doesn't.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.390
High res JPEGs are just fine.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.124
[FF] I think so.

00:04:36.124 --> 00:04:37.290
[CD] And I guess it depends.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.120
Sometimes in my own
work or something,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.980
a TIF is a high res file.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.610
High res JPEGs-- if
it's just a flat image,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.510
you're not working
with layers or anything

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.420
like that, a high res
JPEG is just fine.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.130
[FF] So do you have some
examples of some images

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.080
that you've got that
didn't quite cut it?

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.120
[CD] Yes, I do.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.220
[FF] I bet you do.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.950
[CD] We get images-- I think
that overall my take is

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.870
that the scientists
and researchers,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.580
they really want great
images for their stuff.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.460
And I've had discussions with
many of them where we laugh.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.170
It's like they're the scientists
and we're the image people,

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.180
and I want to make
sure that whatever

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.870
I do for them is accurate.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.920
But we've had jokes sometimes,
well, you stick to the science,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.795
I'll stick to the images.

00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:31.600
[FF] Our hope with the
course, as I know you know,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.170
is to raise the standards
of the researchers work

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.390
and to get them to pay
more attention to how

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.060
they create their photographs--
if it's photograph-able,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.560
of course.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.120
We're talking about material
that's photograph-able.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.180
[CD] Absolutely.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.040
Here is one example.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.240
These were images
about carbon nanotubes

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.510
that can catch cancer cells.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.530
So the images that
we got were sort

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.130
of the SEM of the nanotubes and
the proportions of the device.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.980
But these are great
with the story

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.476
so people have a greater
understanding of what

00:06:08.476 --> 00:06:09.600
they were doing in the lab.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.030
But for something
that's supposed

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.630
to grab people's
attention and make

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.770
them understand what this will
do, it doesn't really work.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.100
So I basically did
just that, and I

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.410
used photographs that came
from Center for Disease Control

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.900
images that were available
and able to be used.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.040
But trying to think about how
do you get this across, and make

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.610
it visually compelling so
that people want to click

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.360
in and read about this?

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.810
[FF] So did you make this
nanotube as an illustration?

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:44.690
[CD] This, yes.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.430
The nanotube is
actually an illustration

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.850
of a carbon nanotube.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.200
And it's basically just carbon
structure in a tube form.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.770
And sometimes, it's
an interpretation

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.130
of what's going on
in this research.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.140
It's not promising anything
that they're not working toward,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.620
but we make it clear that
this is a photo illustration.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.350
This is not
something that came--

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.070
[FF] It's not a
documentary image.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.180
[CD] No, it's a
photo illustration

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.560
of just what this
research is talking about.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.900
[FF] So there is an
issue about scale

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.620
here-- that the nanotubes
are much, much smaller

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.160
than the red blood cells.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.570
Are they red blood
cells or cancer cells?

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.510
[CD] No, the nanotube
is around a cancer cell,

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.110
and then there are red blood
cells because the whole idea is

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.690
that these nanotubes, I believe,
are catching these cells

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.220
in the bloodstream.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.250
[FF] OK, so the relative
size of those things

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.760
in your illustration is
actually not correct,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.010
and we've talked
about this before --

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:55.580
about how far can we go when we
make a depiction of something.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.180
But for example,
many years ago-- you

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.120
might be too young
for this-- but they

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.350
used to show atoms and
molecular configurations,

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.530
and the atoms would show
the reflection of a window

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.370
to suggest some sort of
three-dimensionality.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.260
Now, there's no way in
the world that an atom

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.560
can reflect a window because
an atom is a little bit smaller

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.750
than a window. [laughing]
Yeah, that's the way they

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.060
used to show that stuff.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.330
So that's just a
depiction, but in a way,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.150
there is an issue here
of showing something

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.130
that's actually not possible.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.159
But you feel that
that's really OK?

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.169
[CD] Well, I think that
you need to make sure

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.570
that you're clear that this
is a photo illustration

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.760
or an illustration-- that
it's not actual imagery

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.450
from the research.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.410
Like this wasn't
captured in the body.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.190
And I guess part of
what I think about

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.340
is when you say that-- I'm
thinking in my head, well,

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.599
I guess I could've made
those blood cells huge,

00:08:58.599 --> 00:09:00.640
where you wouldn't even
see the whole blood cell.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.600
Just an arc of the red cell.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.280
But the other thing
is that people

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.480
have to be able to see
it on the homepage.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.010
So everything has to be
blown up so they can actually

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.700
see, what is this showing?

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.350
Sometimes you think if
you made everything,

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.210
it wouldn't read at
all at that size.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.744
[FF] So the researchers
did not raise this issue?

00:09:24.744 --> 00:09:25.660
[CD] No, and I think -

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.201
[FF] So it didn't
bother them at all.

00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:30.020
[CD] Because it was clear
that it was an illustration.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:35.140
And that's oftentimes
what we're tasked with --

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:41.490
is illustrating something
that we're trying to show

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.640
the components at work here.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.690
But we don't have anything
in front of us to go by.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.790
It's just sort of
showing that it's just

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.500
our interpretation
of what is going

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.530
to happen when these carbon
nanotubes can capture cancer

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.190
cells.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:05.350
[FF] So for example,
when I color an SEM,

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:11.200
I always indicate somewhere
that I've colored the SEM.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:18.190
Do you think that we as
journalists of science--

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.750
whatever we're going to
call ourselves today--

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.940
do you think that we
have a responsibility

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:32.670
to indicate, for example-- would
you have indicated this is not

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.390
scale or something like that?

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.370
Do you feel an obligation?

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.200
[CD] I think that science
illustration, absolutely.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.430
But when I think
about what I do,

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.440
sometimes I think it's heavier
on the illustration side.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.520
I wouldn't tell
anyone that this is

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.340
part of a scientific document.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.150
Like I sometimes think it's like
art work to go with your story.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:11:02.140
And I think that we do
have to be not falsely,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.480
or give the suggestion--
knowingly give the suggestion--

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.700
this image is an accurate
image or a realistic depiction

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.220
of what's going on.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.450
I think that is our
responsibility not to falsely

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.020
represent these images as
something that they're not.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:25.100
But for a lot of these, I
look at them more as art

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.550
to accompany a story.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.330
And I say "art"
because it's sort

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.620
of just my interpretation
of what's happening,

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.140
not accurate depictions.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.307
[FF] It's not a documentary.

00:11:37.307 --> 00:11:37.806
[CD] No.

00:11:37.806 --> 00:11:39.320
And the other
thing about that, I

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.960
think to do things
accurately, as you said,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.280
I have to crank these out.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.820
I think sometimes about the
research I would have to do.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.590
Like if someone
said to me can you

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.560
do a medical illustration for
me or a scientific illustration

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.090
accurately, that
takes much longer.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.440
I think accuracy, at that
point, becomes critical

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.880
because this is supposed
to be an accurate

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.790
representation of exactly what
happens in a person's body when

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:10.140
this is happening or in this
chamber when my experiment is

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.250
going on.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.740
That's a whole other thing.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.540
I think if I were doing that,
I think I'd need more time.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.960
[FF] Absolutely.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.760
It's an ongoing conversation
that we have on campus.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:35.140
How much are we permitted to
editorialize the depiction,

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.060
in a way.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.790
[CD] No, I agree.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.527
I think being honest
about what it is.

00:12:38.527 --> 00:12:39.610
That's what I always feel.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.120
I always try to be
honest about what it is

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.868
and then it gives you a little
bit of freedom to editorialize.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.120
I think you really
depict the science

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.040
in a lot of these devices.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:00.070
And I sort of am illustrating
what they could do

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.168
or how they might work.

00:13:03.168 --> 00:13:04.080
[FF] Yes.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.465
I'd love to see another
example of how something was--

00:13:07.465 --> 00:13:10.450
[CD] Another example is
turning on a key enzyme

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.775
that blocks tumor formation.

00:13:11.775 --> 00:13:17.210
And so I asked for an
image, and they sent me

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.700
a rendering of the enzyme.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.160
And again, I know what will
work on the home page, what's

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.220
going to be compelling
in that format.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.850
MIT home page has
elements on it,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.560
and you have to
work with an image

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.200
that there's a
central image area

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.980
and there's navigation areas
that sit on top of the images.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.700
So you're sort of
working with images

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.500
that will allow for all of that
to happen around it, but still

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.300
come through.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.680
The image still pops
from all of this.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:56.870
And so, I sort of know looking
at a rendering of an enzyme,

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.150
it doesn't grab you
on the homepage.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.860
It just doesn't.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.220
So this was about
blocking tumor formation.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:10.510
And so for the homepage,
it's an image of tumor cells

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.530
that was absolutely beautiful.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:14.815
You just want to look at that.

00:14:14.815 --> 00:14:17.700
The detail is stunning
and that sort of thing.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.300
[FF] So this is a scanning
electron micrograph

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.230
that's been colored?

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.470
[CD] Yes.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.920
So we use micro-graphs
a lot from research.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.750
Sometimes they're
absolutely gorgeous.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.650
They are gorgeous.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.300
I love them.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.820
But if we have them
straight from the research,

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.760
if we color them or
add color to them,

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.460
we always try to state
that just so people are

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.440
aware of what's going on there.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.020
And I think on the MIT homepage
and covers of these things,

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.910
your cover image
has to be visually--

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.980
it has to really pack a punch.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.150
So sometimes the color,
things like that,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.990
can really make a
difference, I've found.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:02.710
[FF] So when a decision
is made, who else is

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:07.770
involved with deciding whether
it gets on the homepage or not?

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.860
[CD] Typically what
will happen is myself

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.770
and the director
of news sit down

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.760
and we go over
the stories, which

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.570
he's read all the stories.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.370
He knows what is-- several
things come into play.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.750
Variety-- we try to
have stories from across

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.440
the different schools at MIT.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.370
So they're not all
biology or they're not

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.930
all computer science.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.850
We try to keep a good mix of
stories coming out that are

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.530
going to be on the homepage.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.775
If a story is really
incredible research

00:15:35.775 --> 00:15:38.370
or for some reason very
important-- oftentimes,

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.710
the big journals, that
kind of helps you.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.910
Like, well, if it's in
Science or Nature or some

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.570
of these really
big journals, you

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.950
know it's a significant story.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.840
And the artwork.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.850
Those two.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.750
It's the artwork and the
significance of the research.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:16:01.310
Because if we can't illustrate
it well or photograph,

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.150
it's not going to
work on the homepage.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.170
On the home page--
you know, I know--

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.200
there's very little
text about the image.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.800
It has to really-- there's
a short head, and a subhead,

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.330
and an image.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:21.717
And if you can't make that image
really grab people's attention

00:16:21.717 --> 00:16:24.770
and be something
to look at, then it

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.270
doesn't get on the homepage.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.210
[FF] Simple as that.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.085
[CD] It's as simple as
that because it really

00:16:29.085 --> 00:16:29.950
is a visual page.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.575
[FF] You have enough lead time?

00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:33.950
Let's say you know an article--
an important article-- is

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.510
coming out and you also
know that they don't

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.610
have a visual to go with it.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.620
Do you have enough lead time
to come up with something?

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.330
[CD] I do.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.850
I've become comfortable in
the schedule that we have,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.870
and the schedule in our
office with the news

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.180
director and myself,
we work well together.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.960
I think he understands
that I need time.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.800
And I will often say, sometimes
as a visual person you just

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.620
need-- and some of this stuff
is so, like I said, theoretical.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.250
I will read whatever I
have about the research.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:12.420
Sometimes it's just the writer's
paragraph pitch for the story.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.240
And then I think about it.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.440
I've got a week to work on this.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.500
I know it's not coming
up till next week.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.869
Sometimes it's just a day.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.739
But these big ones--

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:23.530
[FF] You have time.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.240
[CD] Yeah, it's like I need
some time-- like some hours--

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:33.180
to just think about massive
entanglement-- something

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.250
like that that you don't really
have a lot of visuals to go on.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.036
This is something that is--

00:17:39.036 --> 00:17:40.160
[FF] It's all mathematical.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.319
[CD] It is.

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:44.810
And so how do you show
this in a way that's

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.170
beautiful and accurate?

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.840
And how do you make this
an important enough image

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.060
to put on the homepage?

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.080
[FF] I think this is
something that we're

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.680
trying to encourage our
students to think about,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.570
to not only talk to your
colleagues or the experts

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.440
in your field, but to think
about ways to communicate

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.370
to the public.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:16.100
And we're not training our
researchers to do that,

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.560
and I think that that's
one of the things

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.820
that we are discussing
in this course.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.550
How do you come up with a
compelling image of your work

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.780
that is not only very
much about information,

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.100
but it's about wanting to
pay attention to the picture.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.670
It's actually not easy.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.120
[CD] No, I think it's a really
particular way of thinking.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.430
And I think the
researchers are great.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.350
They always, as I said,
will supply images,

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:49.630
and they always are
excited about-- some

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.260
of them very much
want to talk to you

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.500
about their ideas for
this and some of them

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.780
are very excited about it.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.730
But some of them, you can
see they're scientists.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.630
They do this incredible
work in the labs,

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.040
and they think about
communicating to their peers.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.310
And the thing is, people
that can read the papers--

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:12.370
like the papers
that are submitted--

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.240
I often feel like it's such
a small percentage in a way

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.530
because some of this stuff, I
look at it and I'm just like,

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.854
wow - I don't --

00:19:19.854 --> 00:19:21.770
[FF] I have no idea what
in the world this is.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.603
[CD] Yes, I don't know
what's going on here,

00:19:23.603 --> 00:19:25.820
and I know these equations
are really significant.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.440
And I know in talking
about their work

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.010
and in proving what
they've discovered here

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.330
or the advances they've made,
that's absolutely necessary.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.230
But to someone who
has a real interest,

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:42.010
say, in material science
but they're not a material

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:46.380
scientist, it's going to be
very hard to break that down

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.190
on their own.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.430
So that's what we try to do.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:54.210
I think the writers in our
office are great at that.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.880
And you sometimes
grab people that

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.400
have no real--
like I wouldn't say

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.850
that I'm particularly
interested in materials science,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.690
but that was such an
interesting image.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.320
And safe bridges.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.120
Whatever.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.424
I read that story and,
wow, isn't that great.

00:20:10.424 --> 00:20:11.840
[FF] It somehow
was related to me.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.060
Somehow.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.290
[CD] Right, and image
caught my attention.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.730
[FF] Yeah, I think
this whole notion

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.870
of training the next
generation of researchers

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:29.420
to start talking to the public
is not incidental any longer.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.050
And frankly, we
have the obligation

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.690
to talk to the public.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.752
And as you and I talk about all
the time, it's through images.

00:20:37.752 --> 00:20:38.460
[CD] Right, true.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.350
[FF] That's one
very exciting way

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.900
to get somebody to at least ask
questions about your research.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.440
So this is not
tangential anymore.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.920
This should be part
of the research,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.030
I think, from the
very beginning,

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.880
and you're doing an
amazing job doing this.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.000
It still blows my mind
thinking about how

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.570
you can crank out these
stunning, stunning homepages.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.840
It's just very exciting.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.640
Do you have other people
that you work with?

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.290
Do you hire photographers
or video people sometimes?

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:13.810
[CD] We do.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:14.600
I do hire.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.710
Photographers are mostly what
I hire to get photographs

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.450
sometimes of the
researchers, sometimes

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.680
if there's a compelling set up
in the lab, which there are.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.570
Or devices-- tiny
devices-- or something

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:34.650
that really you need a quality
photograph of to better

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:35.380
understand.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.960
We absolutely hire
photographers all the time.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.300
[FF] So there is a place for
photography in this world.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.390
And what I've also noticed
very recently-- maybe

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.010
over the past few
months-- is that you

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:55.040
try to make moving images--
some sort of animation

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.910
piece to the still.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.050
Am I right about that?

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:58.550
[CD] Yes.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.210
[FF] So how do you
go about doing that?

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.470
[CD] I can think of a couple.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.580
For example, when I mentioned
the massive entanglement,

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:12.500
that was totally illustrative,
but as the researcher explained

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.560
how the photon moved through
this mass of atoms that

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.390
were all entangled
and he described

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:24.040
the trajectory of the photon and
how it actually moved through.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.500
So I replicated that
in this illustration

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.830
of what this sort of looks like
or what it could look like.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:38.170
So he knew how the photon
actually went through this.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.270
So I had that to work with
and I illustrated that.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.365
And then in animating,
what I try to do

00:22:43.365 --> 00:22:47.030
is sometimes I will use
various programs to animate.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:50.450
And lately, my favorite
thing is working

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.250
in Photoshop making GIFs
in their video timeline

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.410
because they show
on every device.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:56.930
So people can see
them on phones,

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.220
people can see them or
things like Flash-- you know,

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.320
if you're on an
iOS device, you're

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:08.660
looking at the still image
that I put behind it for you.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:13.250
Or sometimes-- someone sent
me a beautiful micrograph

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.910
of a microfluidic
device, and cells

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.950
moved through this device.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:25.160
So I had this beautiful
scan of this device

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:33.200
and the channel was very clear
how the cell moved through this

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.040
in the research-- what
they were able to do.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.810
And so I just animated.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.630
And basically it was
just a small sphere

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.900
but representing
the cell, and this

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.134
is how the cells are
moving through this device.

00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:47.550
[FF] So you overlay
the animation?

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.192
[CD] Yes.

00:23:49.192 --> 00:23:51.510
I overlay the animation
right on the image.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:55.820
[FF] And do you think in
terms of how much time

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.071
the animation can last?

00:23:58.071 --> 00:23:58.570
[CD] I do.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.440
First, I think several things.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.290
Sometimes I've had looping
animations on the homepage,

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:13.370
and I've found that it's more
of a local audience here at MIT,

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.660
but people leave the
homepage up all day

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.890
long because they will say
could there be an option

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.170
to stop the animation.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.455
I have this up all day
and it keeps sort of-- I

00:24:25.455 --> 00:24:28.150
keep thinking something's
happening over

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.070
here because I'm catching
the movement. [laughing]

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.940
So I've taken that into account.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.550
If you're animating
something, I sort of feel

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:43.160
like if it's a subtle
animation-- I remember one

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.180
I did with a series
of photographs

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.450
actually for the
Collier Memorial.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:54.070
And I could have done it
various ways in Photoshop,

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.050
but I did it with a series
of images and smooth fades

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:58.550
to make the candle flicker.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.400
[FF] I remember that.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.895
[CD] And I let that go all day.

00:25:02.895 --> 00:25:05.340
[FF] Oh, it was so right.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.760
It was just right.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.470
[CD] Right, it just brings
that little bit of life

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:14.130
and thoughtful point of focus.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:15.470
So things like that.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.460
And that was all done
with photographs.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.460
So the length of the animation.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.440
If they're subtle, I am more
likely to just let them run--

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.157
loop them-- because I don't
think that they're distracting

00:25:27.157 --> 00:25:27.990
in a way that some -

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.590
I get it.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:33.340
If you're shooting particles
through a tube all day long,

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.260
I can get how somebody
sitting at their desk

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.010
could just be like, enough.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.880
So I keep that in mind and try
to make it realistic enough

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.680
or make it a good viewing
experience, first--

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.750
so the timing is right
and it's sort of lending

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.200
something to the image.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.000
Sometimes it's
really showing you

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.560
exactly how this device works.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.470
Sometimes it's just
like with the photon

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.865
how this thing would have moved
through this mass of atoms.

00:26:01.865 --> 00:26:06.510
So make sure it's offering
something more than a still

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.300
image maybe couldn't.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:15.430
And then also, I think
about the length of it.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.634
I want it to start fast enough
that somebody doesn't click

00:26:18.634 --> 00:26:20.800
right off not realizing
that there's movement that's

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.030
going to happen.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.960
But also, give them
just whether it's

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.030
a second, or a half a
second, or two seconds

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:33.770
to sort of catch
it when it starts,

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.270
but not have it last too long.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.790
Because that's the other thing.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:41.490
[FF] So it might be interesting
for us to hear if you could

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.210
take us through...

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.360
A starting point,
and then where do

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.410
you go from there to the
next, to the next step,

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.977
and what the final
animation or image becomes.

00:26:52.977 --> 00:26:54.435
Can you take us
through an example?

00:26:54.435 --> 00:26:54.935
[CD] Sure.

00:26:54.935 --> 00:26:57.320
And I'll go back, again,
to this entanglement,

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.110
probably because I just
finished this one, actually.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:04.600
So every step of it is
very fresh in my mind.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.570
So as I mentioned, a
big story coming out

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.900
about the largest
number of atoms

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:14.010
that have ever been entangled at
one time with a single photon.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.080
So that was the story.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.760
And I knew we were going
to spotlight it because I

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.040
believe it's in Science.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.196
It's coming out in Science.

00:27:22.196 --> 00:27:24.460
It's a major thing.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.830
So entanglement, you know?

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.540
So I went over to the right.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.660
I said, this is sort
of what I'm thinking.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.940
I said, I get entanglement.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:41.540
It's two particles,
not joined together.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.370
I'm thinking separated.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.740
I'm thinking the
spotlight image area.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.319
Particles representing
atoms on one side,

00:27:50.319 --> 00:27:52.610
particles representing the
other atoms on another side.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:56.490
And I had first thought about
multi-colored particles.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.860
And blue will connect
with blue, and green,

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.610
and I'll animate a
ghostly line that

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:03.720
maybe shoots back and
forth between these just

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.720
showing that they're connected.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.336
How does that sound?

00:28:07.336 --> 00:28:10.930
And she said that it
wasn't really that.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:15.350
It was like pairs of particles
entangled like that all

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:20.250
together, but that it was
a large bunch of atoms all

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:21.920
entangled together.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.970
So it wasn't pairs.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:27.819
It was maybe-- and to me, there
wasn't a particular number

00:28:27.819 --> 00:28:28.610
I had to represent.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.980
Just a large group
of atoms, and they

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.430
were all entangled together.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.170
So those two rows or
two separate areas

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.170
of particles in my mind came
together as one big mass.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.100
Great.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.730
So I started drawing that.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.430
I put a background in.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:50.620
And I do look online to see how
are other people representing

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.310
entanglement?

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.610
What exists out there for this?

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.490
What do people see when
they think entanglement?

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:01.440
And you go on Google Images,
and it's all over the map.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.410
So I thought, well, I think
all of these particles

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:10.750
together with some sort
of lines just representing

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.260
that they are
connected somehow--

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.660
a line that connects them all
together-- was not a bad way

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.240
to go here.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:24.030
And so I have a graphics
person that works with me,

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.340
and I told him what I
think we should do here.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.720
And I said, if you want
to think about that

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.760
and start working on
something like that.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:41.320
So he did an image and he had
an oscillating wave of a photon

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.217
come in and shoot up.

00:29:42.217 --> 00:29:44.300
Because that was another
big part of this research

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.640
is that they're entangled
with a single photon.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:53.984
He showed me the image, and
he had spoken with the writer.

00:29:53.984 --> 00:29:55.525
And he sent it off
to the researcher,

00:29:55.525 --> 00:29:58.130
and the researcher came
back and said, you know,

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.450
I think that the emphasis
should be more on the atoms.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.850
The photon is quite
large in here,

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:06.800
and it's really the
focus of the image.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.530
And so he thought that
the atoms should really

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:12.290
be more the focus of the image.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.782
So he talked to me about
this, and I said, well, look.

00:30:15.782 --> 00:30:17.490
Let me show you what
I've been working on

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.406
for this because it's
going to be a spotlight,

00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:24.871
and I do the homepages most
of the time-- probably 99%

00:30:24.871 --> 00:30:25.370
of the time.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:30.450
And I said, let me show you what
I'm thinking for the homepage.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.810
And I showed him what
I'd drawn so far,

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.100
and I was thinking
of this line--

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.950
just this crazy, jumbled
line in the background,

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:40.410
but ghosted out.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.260
It's sort of the
suggestion of connection

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.760
with these particles.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:49.140
And so he asked if he could have
my Photoshop file to work with,

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.110
and I said, sure.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.670
Why don't you work
with this and let

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.460
me see what you come up with.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.880
So he basically did that--
took these particles

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.861
and did the line and all
this-- and showed it to me

00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:00.860
and it was looking good.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.460
And he sent it to the
researcher and the researcher

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.293
said he thought it was
probability that best

00:31:04.293 --> 00:31:07.070
rendering of massive
entanglement he'd ever seen,

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.730
which is awesome.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:14.680
If an MIT researcher--
like "wooo!"

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.780
So I had really thought
about animation for this one

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.520
because an image that
just has a lot of spheres

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.410
with a ghosted line,
it's cool looking,

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.270
but movement could mean a lot.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:29.930
And so he said, do
you think-- and I

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.824
think at some
point animation was

00:31:31.824 --> 00:31:32.990
mentioned to the researcher.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:39.810
And he talked about showing this
photon come in and then go off

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.180
at a right angle.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.140
The line that it
came in on is the way

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.320
that it moved in this research.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.260
And so I thought, well, great.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.490
That will be the
animation part about this.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:55.950
Rather than me making
this ghosted line

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:59.920
like a bright thing shoot
around in these lines,

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:03.550
but to actually trace the
path that the photon took.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:07.320
And so that's what it ended
up being was an animation.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.060
I brought some of the
atoms up closer so

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.730
that there was different
scale and a different focus

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.544
in the atoms or a focal
point-- like this atom is

00:32:16.544 --> 00:32:18.710
bigger than the other and
blurry in the background--

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:24.550
and then put the photon
through the mass of atoms.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.780
[FF] And you used Photoshop?

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.660
[CD] I used Photoshop
for the entire thing.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.570
[FF] Not Illustrator?

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.035
[CD] No, not Illustrator.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.190
It was a simple
enough illustration

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.810
where you're
basically just working

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:41.780
with textures and
spheres with gradients.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.000
And it was Photoshop.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.350
And honestly, Photoshop I
work in more than Illustrator.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:50.040
I do so much in Photoshop.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.320
[FF] My experience
is that when I

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.870
have to make an image in
order to explain the science,

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:03.380
the process of making the image
clarifies the science for me.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.500
[CD] Definitely.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.670
Somebody said to me once,
when they asked what I did,

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.750
and I said I illustrate
the MIT homepage,

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.440
they said, you must be a
mile wide and an inch deep.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.900
And it's sort of like
you start to learn

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.252
what the best batteries are
being made of these days.

00:33:21.252 --> 00:33:22.990
[FF] A little bit
about tons of stuff.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.040
[CD] A lot of stuff.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.105
But I agree with you,
it really does help me

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:29.136
to understand the science more.

00:33:29.136 --> 00:33:29.802
[FF] Absolutely.

00:33:29.802 --> 00:33:35.320
And that's why we are hopefully
encouraging researchers

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.630
to think about
presenting your science.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:44.270
Because the very nature of
thinking about the presentation

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:48.090
clarifies what you are
trying to communicate.

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:51.792
It's a very, very important
part of their education.

00:33:51.792 --> 00:33:53.500
[CD] And people will
say-- sometimes I do

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.520
have people that
come up and say,

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.186
I remember that story
because I remember

00:33:56.186 --> 00:33:58.430
there was an image that showed.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:03.710
And so I feel that
gets it across.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.740
People will remember a
story because of the image

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:07.530
that ran with it.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.550
And they'll remember the
words, but they remember it

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:14.610
because the image
sparks the memory.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.590
And that's pretty cool.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.929
[FF] Thank you, Christine.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:22.020
This is what this
course is all about.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.360
It's been just great.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.389
Thank you.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.889
What a joy.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.960
I'm so lucky to have
a pal on campus who

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.840
feels the same way as I
do and who, by the way,

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.938
does pretty unbelievable work.

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:34.730
[CD] Oh, thank you.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:35.688
[FF] Thanks for coming.

00:34:35.688 --> 00:34:36.918
[CD] Thank you.
