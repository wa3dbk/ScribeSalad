FELICE FRANKEL: Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.750
I'm Felice Frankel.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.720
I'm a science photographer
and instructor here at MIT.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.330
I've been working
with researchers

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.600
for more than 20 years
finding exciting ways

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.300
to photograph some
pretty amazing research

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.330
and to visually communicate
that research for journal

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.890
articles, presentations, and
other sorts of communication.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.200
Now, before we
start our course, I

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.990
thought it would be helpful
to go over a few things.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.200
First, just a little
bit about what

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.090
we're trying to accomplish.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.820
We'd like to introduce
you to a new way

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.600
to think about images of
your research, a new approach

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.090
in photographing
science and engineering.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.460
Whether you're in
research or just someone

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.410
interested in
photographs, you will

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.470
find these approaches
relevant to your own everyday

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.340
photography, if you're
photographing small objects

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.880
or desktop setups or
even those quick images

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.660
you make of your favorite
dishes that you post online.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.760
It's really about
making pictures

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.100
that are more than good enough.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.290
Most of the photographs
in the course

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.530
will be on the macro
level-- closeup photography,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.060
for items measuring somewhere
between 1 to 10 centimeters.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.850
We're not going to be
discussing microscopic imaging,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.160
although the principles
you'll be learning here

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.110
will still be relevant.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.530
Now, what do I mean
by new approaches?

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.530
It's about taking a
step back and trying

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.070
to see your material
for the first time,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.650
thinking about how
best to show what

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.380
it is to someone
else, to communicate

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.310
with images, to bring
clarity to your photographs

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.150
and an understanding of how to
communicate what is probably

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.300
some pretty beautiful
and interesting stuff.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.340
And in the process, you learn
to see your material in new ways

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.650
and perhaps think
about it differently.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.310
And this is what I would
really personally love

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.370
to make happen--
to eventually look

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.190
at the world in a
completely different way.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.330
I'd like to encourage you to
fully participate in the course

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.450
by doing the
photographic assignments.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.730
As you know, we all
learn so much more

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.620
when we try it ourselves.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.980
So we've kept the assignments
straightforward and reasonable

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.870
to accomplish in a
limited time span.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.430
And finally, I want to
encourage you to relax.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.700
In many ways, making
pictures is about playing

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.500
and experimenting.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.200
It doesn't have to be
perfect every time.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.160
And in fact, I often learn
the most from my mistakes.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.730
So just have fun
and enjoy yourself.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.000
We look forward to
learning with you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.120
and to introduce you to new
approaches in seeing your work.
