00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950
And finally, to end this
piece of the tutorial,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.710
I'd like to encourage you
to use your imagination.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.545
Think of lighting that's not
necessarily in the textbooks.

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.000
LOOK AT THIS FOR
EXAMPLE: It's a device

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.870
that you'll be
seeing a great deal

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.920
of in our virtual
tool of lighting,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.590
which you'll get to later.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.400
I did not place it
on the lightbox;

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.189
I used the lightbox
as a light source

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.950
as you see in this image.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.480
Because of its
transparency and --

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.220
its actually quite beautiful
just as something itself --

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.120
I put it on my flatbed scanner.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.200
But, this is not
a scanned image.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.590
I'm actually using the light
from the flatbed scanner,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.670
as you can see in this image.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.800
Sometimes it could
work if you get light

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.370
from the side in this case.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.070
And another idea that perhaps
you haven't thought about

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.750
is to use a small
L-E-D flashlight

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.980
if you want to image a very
small area of your device.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.210
Here we're just
photographing the spiral,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.560
which measures about 2 and
a half centimeters across.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.190
All I did was shined and L-E-D
flashlight onto that area.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.770
Around the area, we
get lighting fall-off,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.900
so we decided to only image this
particular piece in the device.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.180
This is the image I started
making from a material called

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.410
Ferrofluid.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.570
And what you're
seeing, actually,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.400
is a close shot
of this material.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.280
It is oil that has suspended
in it iron filings.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.160
I put it in a glass slide.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.000
Under the glass slide
is a yellow post-it,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.789
and under the yellow post-it
are 7 circular magnets.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.880
And you're seeing the
small iron particles

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.979
respond to the magnets.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.070
It's basically too tight a
shot to see anything of value.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.380
In this image, I
pulled away a bit,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.620
and I see a little a little
more of what's going on,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.940
but basically the
window panes become

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.600
maybe too much of a distraction
and it's not quite right.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.840
And so I decided,
seeing how reflective

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.480
the whole image could be, to
put a green card above it.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.260
So now we're seeing a little
bit of green reflecting off

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.210
of the material.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.760
It is just purely an
aesthetic decision;

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.750
it's not clarifying anything.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.650
But I'm starting to
think that I might

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.990
have an interesting image here.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.440
And, eventually, I did wind
up with this final image:

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.870
With the window pane; with
the green card reflecting;

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.310
and, if you really
look carefully,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.770
you see the mistake
of a bad photographer,

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.190
because you see me.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.910
Although, it's fun to
play with the children

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.070
and asking them
to "Find Felice."

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.300
But this is an image
that got a lot of notice

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.880
when I made it a while ago.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.130
And I was using my
imagination in terms

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.090
of trying to find a-a
way of using light

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.780
in perhaps a different way.
