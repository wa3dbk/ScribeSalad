00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.130
So let's look a
little more closely

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.450
at aperture settings,
which in fact is

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.210
a discussion on, really,
what we call depth of field.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.740
Depth of field is
about what is in focus

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.800
and what is not in
focus in your picture.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.630
Your aperture
setting on your lens

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.030
sets the size of your aperture.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.010
Or maybe it's easier to
think of it as a hole.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.450
The size of that hole determines
how much of your image

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.020
is in focus.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.140
When you set your lens
to the largest aperture

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.840
that your lens offers, we say
that your lens is wide open.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.230
And in that wide
open setting is what

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.490
you see in your view finder.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.390
If you want to see what is in
focus through your viewfinder,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.180
that is, if you set your
aperture, let's say, at F/32,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.410
you'll have to press
the 'Preview' button

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.360
to see what will be in focus.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.020
By pressing the 'Preview',
the aperture will close down

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.820
to your chosen F-Stop, and
you'll see a darkened image

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.120
in your viewfinder.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.940
It's another reason
why I use the software.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.440
Remember, in the
software's Live View,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.390
we see the image with the chosen
aperture on the screen much

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.450
easier than seeing
a darkened image

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.000
and trying to figure
out what's in focus.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.900
There's no need to
press a 'Preview'

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.810
button when you use software.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.510
So in our situation, two
eight is the largest aperture

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.090
in this particular 105 lens.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.979
We call it F-stop
2.8 , or F / 2.8 .

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.390
Notice that the number is
actually written as F over 2.8

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.150
.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.240
When we set the diaphragm
to those numbers written

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.020
on the lens, the numbers
in fact represent fractions

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.300
and for that reason
F over two eight

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.009
is larger in terms of size of
the aperture than, let's say,

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.680
F over 4.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.780
And F4 is larger than
five six, and so on.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.840
This can be a little
confusing, but if you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.560
think in terms of fractions,
it will make more sense.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.680
So these are the settings
we'll look at in this exercise.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.440
You'll see more potential
settings on your lens.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.070
But for our purposes
here, these should

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.040
be enough to make the
point about focus changes.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.680
We'll stay with these five.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.730
Okay now here is the image I
made of our music box at F/4.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.370
Take a hard look at what is
in focus and what is not.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.140
Not very much in the foreground
and background, and so we

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.220
say this image has a
narrow depth of field.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.610
Not a whole lot is in focus.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.810
Now at 5.6, here
is the image again.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.790
Let's compare the two.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.190
We're seeing very
slight changes in focus.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.030
That's what we're looking for.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.810
Take a hard look
what's in focus.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.910
And now we'll go to F/8.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.970
And comparing F/8 to five
six, little by little,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.760
more of the image is
coming into focus.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.150
You should stop the video and
give the two a careful look.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.070
Notice the turning mechanism
a tad more in focus in F8

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.890
and a tad more as well in the
screws and everything else

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.079
in that object plane.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.190
We'll go to the
next F-stop, F/11

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.820
and we'll compare to
the previous image, F/8.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.510
And again, you should stop the
video to make the comparison.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.720
And just to move
things along a bit,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.820
we'll just go right to F/32.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.620
Look at how small
the aperture is.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.420
And look at how so
much more of the image

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.710
is in focus compared
to the previous.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.060
Now to drive home the
point even further,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.410
let's compare F/32 with F/4.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.570
So you really see a
significant change.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.300
That's what these
observations are about.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.430
We're seeing how focus
or depth of field

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.060
changes more and more, get's
into focus, as we close down,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.540
or stop down the aperture
to the smaller fraction

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.300
settings on your lens.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.470
But remember, as we
close the aperture

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.320
to smaller settings
like F/32, we also

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.930
decrease the amount of light
we let into the camera.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.500
We're not getting
the right exposure

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.210
until we compensate by
increasing the amount of time

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.100
the shutter is open.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.610
For example, when I change from
one second [clicking sound]

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.570
to two seconds
[clicking sound], I'm

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.130
keeping the shutter open
twice as long, allowing

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.040
more light into the camera.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.470
The longer the shutter
is open, the longer

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.220
we permit the light
to enter the camera

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.650
and to be read by the
sensor, compensating

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.450
for the small aperture setting.
