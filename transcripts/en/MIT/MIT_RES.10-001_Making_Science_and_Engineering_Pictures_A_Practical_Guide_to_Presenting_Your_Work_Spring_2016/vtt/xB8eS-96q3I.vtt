00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.310
In this case study, we
go back to the question

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.600
we continue asking: "what
do you want me to see?"

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.810
So sometimes when I'm asked
to help out with an image,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.900
I have no idea what's
in store for me.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.820
For example, the
first time I walked

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.850
through this particular lab, I
had no clue what to look for.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.160
The researchers
suggested starting

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.170
with this set-up showing
part of their system, which

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.320
developed a more efficient
way of capturing and storing

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.710
energy.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.220
For me, that set-up
just didn't convey

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.640
the excitement of the science.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.090
But then as I turned
towards the chamber,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.720
I saw where the solar
thermophotovoltaic device,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.600
or STPV device, was
doing its thing.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.550
The chamber was covered
with aluminum foil,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.730
as many chambers are
in labs, I've noticed.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.480
But I was able to focus my eye
on the window of the chamber.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.100
It looked really
beautiful to me.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.360
My initial image
was a mess at first,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.890
a little too much going on.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.810
So I decided to
simplify the idea,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.480
as we continue talking about.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.950
I deleted all that foil
and just concentrated

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.320
on the circular window
showing the device.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.000
I then digitally
added a background

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.940
for a potential submission.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.840
When I returned to the
lab a few days later,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.170
with a different
device in the chamber,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.070
I decided to add some
color by reflecting

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.190
an orange cloth I saw
hiding in the corner

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.150
somewhere in front of the
glass, and this time focusing

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.630
in on just the device
in the chamber.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.710
I moved the camera closer,
shooting at around f/32.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.930
Notice how the depth
of field is narrow

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.950
since I'm quite
close to the window.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.590
I imagined what I was going
to do with the cropped,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.680
focused section.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.960
First, I overlaid it on an
image of the vacuum chamber

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.310
from before, as I shot before.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.240
Then I decided to
try something else.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.550
Using the single image
of the device again,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.080
I digitally stretched
part of the image

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.560
to make it more
vertical and then

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.420
overlaid the original
image on the vertical image

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.420
so that the device became
proportionately right.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.010
Happily, got the MIT
homepage highlight.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.390
So that was nice.
