[FELICE FRANKEL] We're lucky
to have my friend, Brian Hayes,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.460
with us today.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.240
Brian is a writer-- a very
wonderful writer, in fact,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.970
but he also takes
photographs and he

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.450
is very good at explaining what
exactly is going on technically

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.210
when you make images.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.150
And I thought it
would be interesting

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.800
for he and myself to just take a
little more closer look at what

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.380
happens.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.770
So I brought Brian
into the studio

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.920
to have a conversation
with me and this is what

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.530
you'll be listening to now.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.571
[BRIAN HAYES] Hi, Felice.

00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:57.980
It's great to be here with you.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.420
[FF] Maybe the place
to start is discussing

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.360
pixels and the sensor that's
inside the camera that

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.560
records the image.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.890
[BH] We know that the
sensor is an array

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.370
of little square
pixels and we know

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.110
that the picture that comes out
of the camera in the end when

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.535
look at on the
screen or whatever,

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:23.140
that that also is an array
of little square pixels.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.380
And you can't help
yourself just imagining

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.870
that there's a simple
one-to-one mapping, that each

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.990
of those little
squares in the sensor

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.920
corresponds to one of the
squares in the picture.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.210
And it isn't so.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.000
It just isn't so and
it never will be.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270
There's a computer
graphics person

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.020
named Alvy Ray Smith
who wrote the most

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.630
petulant academic paper
that I've ever seen.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.539
The title is "A Pixel
is Not a Little Square,

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.670
A Pixel is Not a
Little Square, A Pixel

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.340
is Not a Little Square."

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.610
[FF] I think we understand
what he's trying to say.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.390
Right.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.350
[BH] He's quite firm about this.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.720
And of course, he also has
to admit later on the paper

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.490
that a pixel is a little square.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.150
[FF] OK.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.420
[BH] Pixels are what
happened to photography

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.190
when it became digitized,
but they're not strictly

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.930
an invention.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.219
They existed on film, we
just weren't aware of them

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.840
in quite the same way.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.440
And if you translate this
discussion back 50 years,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.770
the question was
then a matter of not

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.145
how many pixels do you
want, but how fine grained

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:44.450
do you want your film?

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.560
[FF] You bet.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.660
[BH] And the effect
on the finished image

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.780
was very similar.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.550
If you chose a film with
large grains of silver,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.050
you got very fast exposures,
tended to get high contrast,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.790
but you also got a lot of
noise and random fluctuations,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.350
especially in dark areas
of the photograph where

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.320
it looked mottled.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.460
Now we have a much more
regular geometric structure

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.480
with, in spite of what
Alvy Ray Smith says,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.640
little squares, pixels.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.440
And we care about
counting those pixels,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.290
how many millions of
them form an image.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.530
But the question of how much
information is in the image,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.030
how closely can you look
at it before you begin

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.780
to see the structure
of the image

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.260
rather than the subject
of the image, those issues

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.950
have been there from
the very beginning.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.660
[FF] So, for example,
just comparing it

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.960
to film, although
most of our students

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.870
possibly don't even know
what the word means,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.500
they have seen a
little example of how

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.510
we see the difference between
setting the ISO number at 200

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.760
as compared to 6,400.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.460
That they will have
seen that there

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.720
is a lot of grain and noise,
or appears to be grainy--

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.750
that's the word, although
that might not be accurate.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.490
[BH] I don't think that
the difference is worth

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.160
bothering with.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.660
[FF] Yeah.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.459
[BH] It is grainy.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.880
It's noisy.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.890
I think that the clearest way
to follow what's happening there

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.150
and why that noise
happens and why

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.780
ISO matters is to think about
the basic physics of what

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.140
you're doing when you
make a photograph.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.630
What you're doing is counting
photons, the quanta of light.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.150
So you expose a piece of film or
the sensor in a digital camera

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.030
to the varying
brightness in a scene.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.510
It's focused on the plane of the
film or the plane of the sensor

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.860
and what you're doing is in each
small area, the square pixels

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.630
on the sensor or the
chemical film grains,

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.380
in each small area you're
counting how many photons

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.000
strike that spot
within the brief moment

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.030
that the shutter is open.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.520
And there's a
statistical issue here.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.680
When a photon hits
the silicon sensor,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.320
it's supposed to
not lose an electron

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.550
and it's actually the electrons
that you wind up counting.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.850
When it hits the
film, it's supposed

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.015
to catalyze a chemical
reaction that produces

00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:32.480
a visible grain of silver.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.159
Both of those things
are somewhat unreliable.

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.280
It's-- in part, this goes back
to the deep physics of quantum

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.592
mechanics, that some of these
things are probabilistic

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:47.100
and you can't, even if you try,
determine exactly what's going

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.430
to happen.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.640
But for a lot of reasons,
when, say, 1,000 photons hit

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.340
the film or the sensor, you
may register some other number

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.590
other than the exact 1,000.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.610
You might count 900,
you might actually

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.850
count more than
there were photons

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.810
because some electrons
are just spontaneously--

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.644
[FF] Yeah.

00:06:10.644 --> 00:06:12.810
[BH] And sometimes the
chemical reaction in the film

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.880
happens even without light.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.130
And there is a simple rule
of thumb, a mathematical rule

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.430
for explaining why it's so much
better to have a lot of photons

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.200
than just a few.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.810
The error that you
get in counting

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.800
turns out to be
roughly the square root

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.610
of the number of photons.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.380
And so if you have 10,000
photons that you're

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.159
trying to count, well,
the square root of 10,000

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:43.820
is 100 and that's
about 1% error.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.770
If you get 9,900 instead
of 10,000 you're 1% off.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.050
And when you translate that
into an amount of light

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.959
or the gray level
on an image, 1%

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.500
is probably something
you're not even

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.970
going to be able to notice.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.460
On the other hand, if
there were only 100 photons

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.520
that you were counting, the
square root of 100 is 10

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.080
and so you can have an
error of 10% and something--

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.100
some pixel might be
10% brighter or darker

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.890
than it's supposed to be
and you will notice this.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.000
And in fact, it looks
like snow on the image.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.990
It looks like
random fluctuations

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.530
darker and lighter.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.790
And that's true whether you're
looking at a digital image

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.130
or a film image.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.460
So you want to capture as
many photons as you can

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.650
and that's a complicated
function of how

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.610
long the shutter is open, how
wide the aperture of the lens

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.830
has been set, and how long
or how sensitive the film is

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.490
to light or how
sensitive the sensor is.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.270
And the ISO dial is what
determines that sensitivity.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.530
In the case of film,
there was no dial.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.650
You went to the store
and bought a film

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.365
with an ISO rating of
whatever you chose.

00:08:01.365 --> 00:08:04.370
With a digital camera you
can adjust it was you wish.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.100
[FF] Almost.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.950
On my camera I cannot get--
I used to use Kodachrome 25.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.540
[BH] I was an Ektar 25.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.380
[FF] You're Ektar.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.180
OK.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.470
And I can't go down
to 25 on my camera.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.590
[BH] That's true.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.790
I would say, however, that
the whole strange historical

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.050
accident that we have digital
cameras with a setting that's

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.190
labeled ISO is a
little bit deceptive.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:35.690
Setting something to ISO
26,000 on a digital camera

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.530
doesn't match, in any
obvious direct way, what

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.909
the setting would be on a film.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:46.250
And so it's with a
good digital camera,

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:53.140
the noise level that you get
out of it at a low ISO setting

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.700
is the equal of anything
that you could have

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.289
gotten on your Kodachrome 25.

00:08:58.289 --> 00:09:00.760
[FF] So in the
course, we talk about

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.390
that because we have
control over everything

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.390
we make in this
particular course,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.810
because it's in a
controlled situation,

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.320
we are suggesting to set
the ISO at the lowest number

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.330
so that we do not pick
up a lot of noise.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.720
[BH] Other things being
equal, that's surely the--

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.890
[FF] Let's try to keep
it simple for-- yeah.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.360
[BH] Well, yeah.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.471
[FF] So that's how we're
taking pictures in our course.

00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:28.970
[BH] Yes.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.710
If you're taking
pictures of something

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.610
that holds still for you--

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.120
[FF] Yes.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.020
[BH] --and especially if
you have a tripod so that

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.620
the camera also holds still--

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.270
[FF] This is the only way we're
taking pictures in this course.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.686
[BH] There would be no reason
not to use the lowest ISO --

00:09:43.686 --> 00:09:46.010
[FF] And we can add more
light if we need to.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:46.660
[BH] Yes.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.701
[FF] So we have control.

00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:48.200
[BH] Yeah.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.370
[FF] This is very specific
kind of photography.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.960
[BH] And you have a
luxurious situation.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.490
[FF] Indeed.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.190
[BH] There are occasions
when it's appropriate,

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.650
I think, to use a
higher ISO setting.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.110
But what you
described, that kind

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.000
of photography, of
course-- why not?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.190
[FF] Why not?

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.560
So shall we talk about exactly
what happens to that pixel?

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.170
[BH] Sure.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.680
I think the complexity of
it is the kind of complexity

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.700
that you don't really need
to understand in detail.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.830
You certainly don't need it in
order to make good pictures.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.500
There have been generations
of brilliant photographers

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.620
who knew nothing about
the technology of cameras

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.570
and certainly about
the chemistry of film.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.170
However, I think
it's something that

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.440
is useful to have in
the back of your head.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.600
And it may change your attitude
toward the images that come out

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.210
of the camera and
how you think of them

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.110
and what you dare to do to them.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.020
There's a natural
tendency, since we

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.240
know that inside
the camera there's

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.040
this postage stamp sized slab of
silicon that is the sensor that

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.950
receives the light, the
lens focuses an image

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.760
onto that sensor.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.950
And we know that's made up of
these little squares called

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.660
pixels in a rectangular
array like seats in a theater

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.670
or something, you have rows
and columns full of them.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.130
And the picture that
comes out of the camera

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.900
is also a rectangular array
of colored squares in rows

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.850
and columns, and so it's just
natural to imagine that there

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.460
is a simple one-to-one
correspondence

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.180
between the pixels on the sensor
and the pixels on the image.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.380
And if only it were that simple.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.640
In fact, if you think
about it a little more,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.580
you realize that it
can't work quite that way

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.670
because the square
pixels on the sensor.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.950
I've learned recently
that the professionals who

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.710
make these things,
they call them

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:55.590
sensels on the sensor and
pixels in the picture.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.200
But each of the picture
elements on the sensor

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.430
has to respond to any light
that it receives of any color.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.450
And in order to take
a color photograph,

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.810
you need to have separate
signals for at least

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.680
three color channels.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.600
Each sensor element,
then, is actually

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.470
made up of four sensor
elements, each of which

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.420
has a color filter
pasted on top of it

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.630
like the kind of
celluloid filters

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.030
that you would use
over a spotlight

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.160
or something to
change the lighting,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.400
except of course,
they're very small.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.290
These are arranged
in a pattern so

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.983
that each group of
four sensor elements

00:12:36.983 --> 00:12:41.660
has two green and a
red and a blue filter.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.840
So right there if you have,
say, 1,000 or a million pixels

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.580
in the finished
image-- 1,000 by 1,000,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.990
say-- you actually have
2,000 by 2,000 on the sensor.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.560
There are four million elements
rather than just one million.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.240
So we're already at
that point not having

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.890
a one-to-one correspondence
between the sensor

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.780
and the picture.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.520
And in fact, it's not
even close to that.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.730
There is no simple ratio.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.490
There are more sensor elements
on the sensor than there

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:20.530
are in the finished picture
and no pixel in the image

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.880
actually corresponds to
any one sensor element.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.870
There's an algorithm that
runs on the little computer

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.770
inside the camera that looks at
a whole neighborhood of sensor

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.580
elements, and by
averaging and filtering

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.700
the outputs of a large
number of elements

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.450
it assigns a particular color
to each pixel in the finished

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:42.950
image.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:47.160
[FF] So that each manufacturer
probably has their own formula.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.442
[BH] Very much so.

00:13:48.442 --> 00:13:49.983
And they don't tell
us what they are.

00:13:49.983 --> 00:13:50.790
[FF] Of course not.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:55.730
Is it fair to talk about, in
this conversation about pixels,

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.530
is this a place
where we could talk

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:01.070
about the difference
between RAW, TIFF and JPEG?

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.150
[BH] Sure.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.100
[FF] It would be good to have
an idea about the differences.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:06.710
[BH] Sure.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:11.500
So each camera has
a choice of outputs.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.090
Typically, you can get either
RAW or JPEG from most cameras.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.970
And the RAW format is not the
same from company to company,

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.010
I guess.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.370
But they're all, apart from
details of file formats

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.940
and things like that,
they're all very similar.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.960
It's a collection
of numbers that

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.390
represent color values
in a very direct way.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.500
If you looked at the
numbers and assigned colors

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.590
to each possible number, and
you took a bunch of crayons

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.190
and a big piece of graph
paper with squares on it,

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.680
you could actually
reconstruct the whole image

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.680
by painting the
appropriate color

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.670
in each square based
on just looking

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.620
at the numbers in the RAW file.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.340
You wouldn't really
want to do this,

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.910
but it's there in principle.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.900
Among the other common
formats, the TIFF

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.570
is actually very much the same.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.570
It has the same
information in it,

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.780
it's just been rewritten in
a different order, basically.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.080
[FF] Good.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.590
I have conversations with
other photographers who are--

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.920
they cannot believe that
I don't take RAW images.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.970
[BH] Well, there's more to that.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.390
If you take a RAW image and
you upload it to a computer

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:34.830
in that form and you use the
appropriate piece of software,

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.120
then, to convert
it to a TIFF, you

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.120
should have the same set
of numbers in the new file

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.810
as you did when it came out
of the camera as a raw file.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.800
On the other hand,
if you take a JPEG

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.000
and then convert that
to a TIFF, the numbers

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.560
will not match up one for one.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.020
And the reason for that is
that the JPEG format doesn't,

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.250
in fact, store this big
array of rows and columns

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.090
of color values.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:09.960
Instead, it takes blocks
of pixels and analyzes

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.580
the set of colors found
within each block and then

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.050
in order to store the-- well,
not the same information,

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.700
but substantially the same
information-- in a smaller

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.170
amount of data, it
encodes the information

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.450
into a different form.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.520
You might, for example, look
at the whole block of pixels--

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.280
I think they're
eight by eight is

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.430
the standard way of doing this.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.370
You take those 64 pixels,
an eight by eight square,

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:42.270
and you ask, what's the average
color in that whole block?

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.430
And so that's a
first approximation

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.120
of how you might
represent the image.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.662
And then you ask, so,
what's the average color

00:16:49.662 --> 00:16:51.620
on the right half, and
what's the average color

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.650
on the left half, and on the
top half and the bottom half?

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.660
And you store that
information also.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.400
And there's a little more to it
than this, but not much more,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.360
actually.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.079
What you wind up with
is a way of representing

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:11.140
the information that is more
compact, but it's not exact.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.627
And when you then reconvert
it to, say, a TIFF file,

00:17:15.627 --> 00:17:17.210
you're going to wind
up with something

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.970
that's a little bit different.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.089
And certainly, the
purists among us

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.900
would argue that
there is damage done

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.619
when you go to a compressed
file format like JPEG.

00:17:30.619 --> 00:17:33.079
Unquestionably, there
are changes made.

00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:37.500
That is, you have altered the
information that is stored.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.220
And the argument is that
these days, with ample disk

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.359
space and essentially
the ability

00:17:44.359 --> 00:17:48.230
to keep every image you
take in its full form,

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.790
why risk losing anything?

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.890
That's a good argument, and
I think that, for example,

00:17:54.890 --> 00:18:00.180
if you have the ability to keep
both a RAW version and a JPEG

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.960
that that's probably
a good idea.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.990
It leaves your options open.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.150
You can always go back
to the original form

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.880
and work with it if it turns
out that a particular JPEG isn't

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.710
looking the way you want to.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.970
However, I have to
say that this is

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.060
based purely on personal
experience and not

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.740
scientific investigation.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.710
I've found many cameras
whose JPEG processor

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.920
does a better job of
sharpening and color

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.080
correcting the image
than I can do myself.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.600
[FF] I'm so happy you
said that because I have,

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.280
anecdotally, made comparisons
between my images,

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.330
either TIFF or JPEG, enlarged
them like crazy on the screen,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.960
and I don't see the differences.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.790
[BH] Yes.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.620
Yes.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.220
Cameras are very
good, I'm afraid.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.053
[FF] They are, yeah.

00:18:50.053 --> 00:18:52.390
And it's a lot of
smart people who've

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.050
worked very hard to
make it come out well.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.690
Not to say that you
can never beat them,

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.600
but you've got to work
pretty hard to do better.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.690
And it's also worth
keeping in mind,

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.780
if only as a way of keeping your
sanity in a world where lots

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.800
of people want to
tell you what to do,

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.700
it's worth keeping in
mind that a "RAW' file,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.990
in spite of its name, is
not "raw"-- it's "cooked."

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.350
The camera has already
done a lot of processing

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.450
and it has to.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.780
What would truly be
a "raw" file-- that

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:28.610
is the output of
the sensor directly

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.210
without any processing
at all-- it would hardly

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.800
look like a photograph.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.890
The dynamic range
would be all wrong,

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.940
the colors would be
wildly incorrect.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.810
The camera doesn't see
the way our eye sees

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:48.340
and it needs to be fixed
before we even recognize it

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.220
as a photographic image.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.280
This was also true
in the age of film.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.320
If you look at, say,
a color negative,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.360
a piece of color
negative film that's

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.940
been processed but not
printed, the entire image

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.260
has got a rosy salmon
colored tone to it

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.670
that's wildly far from
the correct color.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.910
And that needs to be corrected.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.060
In the old days, this
happened chemically.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.780
It was the film that
you were printing

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.220
to from the color negative
was designed explicitly

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.460
to correct for that distortion.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.130
And in fact, if
you use that film

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:29.040
to print from a negative that
didn't have the orange cast

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.670
to it, you would get something
that was terribly wrong

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.130
in the other direction.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.410
It's just never been
the case that there

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.140
was a "raw" format
that was truly

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.760
some kind of pristine
representation of nature.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.440
It's all "cooked" formats.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:54.100
And given that, it's sort of
liberating to know that there's

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.240
already a whole
lot of processing

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.690
going on before the picture
ever comes out of the camera.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.260
And so maybe you shouldn't
be too afraid of turning

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.640
a dial or two.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.580
The conception of a
camera as some sort

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:12.850
of objective recording
device that captures reality

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.100
without distortion
has never been true.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.170
And even at a very
fundamental level,

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.290
when you look at the
physics and technology

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.331
of how the machine works.

00:21:24.331 --> 00:21:24.830
[FF] OK.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:29.510
So we talk very
briefly about trying

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.760
to get some really wonderful
images for cover submissions,

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.970
and we do talk about the
submission should be 300 dots

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.910
per inch because that's what the
art directors usually ask for.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:47.020
And if it's a full bleed
cover, it's 8 and 1/2 by 11,

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.070
but sometimes your
images is not that size

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.760
so we briefly touch on
putting it into software

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.600
and increasing the file size.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.950
There's a lot that goes on
when you click that button,

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:00.800
I'm assuming.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.370
What do you think
about all that?

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.710
[BH] Increasing the file
size is really very easy.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.630
As I say, you can
just press a button.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.730
Increasing the resolution
of the image is not so easy.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:18.560
In some precise sense, you're
not adding any information

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.220
to an image when
you simply increase

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.710
the resolution in
Photoshop, say, by making it

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.790
into a larger file.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.680
If you look at it in the
simplest terms, if you were at,

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.140
say 150 dots per inch,
you could take each pixel

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.950
and divide it into
four smaller pixels.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.230
Each square becomes
four tinier squares.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.650
Each of those four
squares is identical.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.460
And you then have a file
that's four times as large

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:52.770
in terms of megabytes and
has twice the resolution

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.670
and it's now 300 dots per inch.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:59.030
If you look at the metadata
in Photoshop or something,

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.400
that's what it will tell you.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.791
But it has no more information
than the original one.

00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:04.290
[FF] OK.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:09.900
But what we have touched
on with the flatbed scanner

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.560
is when we tell the
scanner to scan at,

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.860
let's say, 72 DPI and
then we tell it later

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:26.370
to scan at 300 DPI, are we not
capturing more information when

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.820
we scan the image?

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.930
[BH] Absolutely.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.160
Yes, you are.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.330
You are dealing there
with a physical process

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:38.360
that-- again, if we look at
it in the simplest terms,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.150
and this isn't terribly
realistic-- but

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.450
the sensor in the
scanner, when you

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:49.670
scan at reduced resolution,
at, say, 150 dots per inch,

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:54.960
it's going to use two sensor
elements together as if they

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.890
were one and simply record
half as much information.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.412
Then when you set the scanner
for 300 dots per inch,

00:24:03.412 --> 00:24:08.500
it reads each of those pairs of
sensors as two separate sensors

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.280
and records twice
as much information,

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.290
or really four times as much
because it's in two dimensions.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:16.760
The scanner is moving
across the surface,

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.310
it's not just one line.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.600
When you do this in
software, however, you

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.540
have no way of going back
to the original object

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.220
that you were scanning
or photographing

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.230
and recording more
information about it.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:35.450
All you have is what's
in the original file.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.740
Now, this seems very gloomy.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.950
It seems as if you have no
hope of actually increasing

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:43.820
the resolution of an image.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.260
Once you've made it, if you
can't go back to the original

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.550
and recreate it from
life, then you'll

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.020
never have more dots
per inch than what

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.300
you captured to begin with.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.480
It's not quite that bad.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.350
The statement that you can never
put more information into it

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.460
than was there to
begin with, it's

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.840
true in some mathematical
sense in that

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:13.240
if you have, say, an image
of totally random dots

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.960
that are scattered
across the surface

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.190
and you try to increase
the resolution in order

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.340
to get more dots per inch,
it's not going to work.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:28.250
All you'll do is make the dots
you have a little bit fuzzier.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.430
But we don't generally
take pictures

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.980
of random arrays of dots.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.860
We take pictures of objects
that have macroscopic form, that

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.750
have sharp edges,
they have areas

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.070
of one color and
another color, they

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.720
have smooth gradients of color.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.640
And all of that is structure
at a much higher level

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.770
than individual pixels.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.560
And it is possible,
if you're clever

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.390
or if your software
is clever, to find

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.730
ways to boost the
resolution of an image

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:06.640
that if the image cooperates,
if it's a picture of something

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.880
that has reasonable
structure to it, which

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.546
could be anything from a
human face, to a plant,

00:26:14.546 --> 00:26:16.640
to a technological artifact.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.580
Because reasonably large areas
of color or smooth gradients

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.280
or sharp edges and that
these are the things

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.800
that you're interested in, it
actually comes out pretty well.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.130
I've done it myself.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.410
[FF] Me, too.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:36.120
[BH] And in most cases,
the result is successful.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.760
There is a quasi
ethical question

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.670
here of do you disclose
to the art director

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.980
you're sending this
to that, in fact,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:50.580
this was a 150 dot per inch
file that you have manipulated--

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.920
there's that terrible word-- in
order to boost the resolution?

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.110
I'm not an ethicist.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.130
I leave that to other
people to decide.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.720
It's not alteration of
the content, in my view.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.370
It's not like you're air
brushing out something that

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.510
wasn't supposed to be there.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:11.126
But obviously, it
is a deliberate act

00:27:11.126 --> 00:27:13.920
to make the picture look better.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.000
I would also say that
another problem here

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
is that the art director who
insists that the file has

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.040
to be 300 DPI is being rather
foolishly rigid about this.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.630
There are images that you can
print on a magazine cover that

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.000
are 150 DPI that work out fine.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.900
But changing the world
in that direction

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.920
is much harder than
fixing the photograph.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.290
[FF] Especially when the
art director basically

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:44.120
has to first talk to the
editor, who generally knows

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.710
nothing about image making.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:51.630
[BH] As a former editor, I
will let you have your say.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.635
[FF] Thank you.

00:27:53.635 --> 00:27:55.550
But no, I would say
for cover submissions

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.390
where we're talking
about we're bringing

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:03.210
the notion of aesthetics
and communication,

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.670
creating a finer image.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.780
[BH] I entirely agree.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.190
There are various
standards that get applied.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:18.750
Journalism has one set of rules
that's really quite harsh.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.350
Photojournalists working
for a newspaper or an agency

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.690
like Magnum, they
suffer severe penalties

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:29.150
if they're caught making
changes to images.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.810
[FF] Like moving Egyptian tombs.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:33.737
[BH] Yeah, right.

00:28:33.737 --> 00:28:34.820
[FF] Do you remember that?

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.300
[BH] I certainly do.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.770
[FF] This was a long time ago.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.900
[BH] In that case, if
I remember correctly,

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:44.410
it wasn't the photographer,
it was the art director

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:45.220
who "improved."

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:50.910
[FF] They moved the pyramids
so that the typeface

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:55.630
could be dropped more properly
as a full cover design.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:57.310
That was a long time ago.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:00.100
It's dating us,
Brian, I'm afraid.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.840
But those questions still arise.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.110
[BH] Of course they do, yes.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.830
And it's easier to do
it in the photograph

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.890
than it is to move
the pyramid itself.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.320
[FF] As of today, yes, I
would have to say that.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.380
So we are going to be
discussing this in week five,

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.950
how far can we go?

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.974
[BH] It's a fascinating issue
with a very long history.

00:29:20.974 --> 00:29:21.474
[FF] Yeah.

00:29:21.474 --> 00:29:22.300
Oh, yeah.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:27.740
[BH] And it is-- I think it's
something that individuals,

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.740
they need to make their
own ethical choices,

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.870
but obviously if you're
working in a social setting

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.570
where there are other
people making the rules,

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.590
you also need to
be aware of that.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.550
[FF] There's a whole
issue as we talk

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:47.420
about the whole notion of
manipulation and how far

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.680
can one go.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.570
And certainly in
science imaging,

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.990
there are very
serious restrictions,

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.720
and there should be.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.390
It isn't all about the
data, but the question

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.610
is defining what the data is.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:05.600
The fact that you're making
an image with a tool,

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.640
you're already
changing the data.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.440
We have to remember, and
we'll go back to this later,

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:15.900
but making a picture is
making a representation.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.360
It is not the thing, it
is a re- presentation

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.960
and there is some sort of
decision-making involved.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.470
The thing that I'm trying
to emphasize in the course

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:33.970
is that we have to create
a literacy, in a way,

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.920
of what makes for
a good picture.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.820
And you and I might disagree
on that, and we have, I think.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.150
And I hope that students
come to their own decisions

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:50.450
about what is better than
that or less than that

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.900
and what is good.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.670
But I think we have
to start somewhere,

00:30:55.670 --> 00:31:02.370
and the "somewhere" for us
is to create an image that

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:09.450
well communicates what it is
that this device or Petri dish

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.850
or thing that we're
photographing-- what picture

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.140
can best communicate
the structure?

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.650
We're generally
interested in structure.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.770
And if we are talking
about process,

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:26.060
for example, as we do when
we make photo illustrations,

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.050
we have examples later
on that the students will

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:33.930
see how I've used bits
and pieces of photographs,

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.780
put it all together
for an illustration.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:41.270
So it's not a documentary image
and there's a place for that

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.410
in science.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:46.880
But in the end, it's about
getting the finest quality

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.900
to communicate the science.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.420
That is what we're doing
here in this course.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:57.960
And by the way, we will
be discussing using

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.130
tablets and mobile devices.

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:05.140
Very tangentially, but
there's a place for that.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.070
Absolutely.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:10.140
When you really, really need to
take a picture quickly and send

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.830
it to your colleague to show
them that you have evidence

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.090
of what you've produced.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.370
But as far as making the
finest quality image,

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.840
we still are going
to-- at this point--

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.230
stick to the camera
and the 105 lens.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.760
That's what we're sticking to.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.650
[BH] I wouldn't try
to argue otherwise.

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:32.000
I think the way
people will think

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.740
of photography and
of pictures in years

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.230
to come may be rather
different from our view.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:44.960
It's certainly changed within
my lifetime, when photographs

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.310
were physical objects
that you put in scrapbooks

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.420
or filed away.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.120
We don't think of them
in those terms anymore.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.520
And I think they may
change their nature again

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.660
because they are so ubiquitous.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.110
But that doesn't
really have much to do

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.420
with the kinds of
photography that

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.240
are involved in, say,
scientific documentation

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.210
or scientific illustration.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:17.750
In art photography, you never
know what's going to happen.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.830
And there are lots
of artists, I think,

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.040
who are now working with
cell phones and such,

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:30.030
and even with the plastic
lens Lomo cameras and things

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:35.170
that deliberately distort
the view of the world.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.040
So I think there's
lots of latitude

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.480
for different
approaches to this.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.830
But for serious documentary
work or for trying

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:50.710
to create the most vivid
image that you possibly can

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.750
of something that
holds still for you

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:56.180
while you point the
camera at it, clearly

00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:00.850
you're going to use the best
tool that you can come up with.

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.150
Even mediocre ones
today, I think,

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:07.350
are considerably better than the
best ones of a few decades ago.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.100
They're probably going
to get better still.
