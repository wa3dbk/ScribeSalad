00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.860
And as far as tablets
are concerned,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.300
yes, you could make some
OK images of your work

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.280
very quickly like we did
here, use the music box,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.360
which you've seen before.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.170
This one was made
with the tablet.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.000
But always keep in mind
that the file size is not

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.640
even close to what we get
with a full size camera.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.900
And it's certainly not as
convenient as a camera phone,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.330
in my opinion.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.970
But I thought I'd show you
something I was playing around

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.680
with a while ago.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.780
And here's an image I made
of an area of a device.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.510
And we could actually
see 30-micron structures.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.970
I made the images with a tablet.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.720
It's considerably cropped
from the full image.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.830
Now here's the setup.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.540
I put the tablet's camera
on "selfie" mode, that is,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.310
using the front camera.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.530
The idea is that you can see
exactly what the camera is

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.460
seeing and so that you
could make adjustments

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.460
to the set up in real time.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.180
Here's the jeweler's lens
that I placed over the camera

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.420
in the tablet.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.220
And here's the set up
from another angle.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.289
Let's zoom in so that
you see how it looks.

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.840
So basically, I am making
a microscopic image

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.740
with this setup.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.860
You can adjust the distance
of the lens from the device

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.860
by using different wooden
blocks, for example.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.810
There are number of
companies selling supposedly

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.310
microscopic lenses, which you
attach to your phone or tablet,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.000
but I'm not convinced
the quality of the optics

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.410
is what we want.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.590
Here we see some very
fine detail, because

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.350
of the quality of the lens.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.370
But unfortunately, the file
size as we said is pretty low,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.630
but that is improving rapidly.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.380
So this could be a
quick way of sharing

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.539
your work with your colleagues
through emails for example.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.060
It's just something
to think about.
