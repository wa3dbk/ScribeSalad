00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.370
Here's another case study.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.620
I simply put two pieces
of paper overlapping.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.000
These papers are used for
particular medical analysis.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.810
So I captured it, once again,
at a very high resolution,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.280
so that as we zoom
into the image,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.720
we can actually see the
fibers in the paper.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.720
Here's an image where I
added background color.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.930
Now, I'm not changing
the important information

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.659
in the image-- the structure.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.290
The structure is the data.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.300
I'm just adding an
additional component

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.900
to allow the viewer to
see the material better.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.380
We'll be looking at adding
backgrounds in the how to do it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.120
section.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.770
I want to spend a few
minutes on backgrounds.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.140
I am a bit of a
background collector.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.320
And, frankly, I think
you should be one, too.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.030
Really, it helps a lot
to imagine your images,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.290
even while you're not
even working on it.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.129
Whenever some interesting
envelope or card

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
arrives in my mailbox, I
keep it, believe it or not,

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.660
thinking that it might
help with an image one day.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.910
Or platters.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.660
Or wired thingies.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.770
Anything that might be
appropriate for a background

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.030
for small devices.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.620
And besides, it's
fun to think about.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.620
So let's take a look
at one particular idea.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.190
Take this simple graph paper,
which I tried as a background

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.530
for this device.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.970
Looks OK.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.530
Here I tried some bubble
wrap, of all things.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.060
Definitely over the top,
and doesn't work quite well.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.110
There should be some sort of
intelligent visual connection

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.280
between your device
and your background,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.759
and bubble wrap
doesn't quite cut it.

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.360
In the end I finally landed
on using simple green paper

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.710
with this device.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.940
And because the
image was captured

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.740
with the scanner sitting
at a high resolution--

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.610
it was about a 400-meg file--
I was able to zoom in, crop,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.560
and finalize the image.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.640
I think that both the
simple colored background

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.410
and the composition works.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.250
Here we see three
microfluidic devices,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.360
which I initially lined
up in a pretty boring way,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.660
as you see here.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.450
And once again, I'm always
playing with composition,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.220
so what I did was I used
two of them instead.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.720
Just the two of
them really visually

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.630
say what you need to say.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.850
We don't need three.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.100
You might think about
that in your own work.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.020
So I captured it at a
very high resolution,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.480
putting the devices
on an angle--

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.940
a much more interesting
composition.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.360
And because of the
high resolution,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.200
I was able to zoom in
and crop the image.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.860
Now, watch what happens when
I enhance the image using

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.320
a sharpening tool.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.960
We'll talk about sharpening
images in the how to do it

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.810
section.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.120
This is an important technique.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.930
The sharpening filter is
not changing your data.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.800
If your data is about
form and structure,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.170
it's permitting you
and your viewers

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.490
to see the image clearly.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.800
But whenever any of
these filters are used,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.170
it's imperative
to always indicate

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.000
the process in the caption.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.620
Something that I
encourage you to consider.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.130
Because I captured this
at such a high resolution,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.680
we can zoom in and see
30-micron structure.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.030
Here is again.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.680
First, the original image.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.590
And here it is sharpened, where
you can really see the detail.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.710
It's pretty neat.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.440
So this is our first week,
imaging with a flatbed scanner.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.380
Think about it.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.700
It's not an expensive
piece of equipment,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.700
and if used properly, you can
achieve high-quality images

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.290
without spending an
inordinate amount of time.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.560
In the next weeks, we'll
talk about cameras,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.080
lenses, lighting, approaches
to imaging science

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.250
and engineering.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.730
We'll also discuss
how to graphically use

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.020
these images for figures
and potential cover designs.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.510
So lots more ahead, and
I look forward to it.
