00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.940
In this case study, we're going
to go into maybe excruciating

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.950
detail showing you how
I really am not always

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.590
sure about which point of
view I'm going to be taking.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.990
With these microneedles I
just placed them on my table,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.300
just to take a look
at it to kind of get

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.330
a sense of what they look like.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.120
I even went further and put
them on top of the Petri dish,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.130
which they came in, just
to sort of study it.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.810
I actually don't mind this
image as a final image.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.056
I was surprised.

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:37.430
But as you've seen
before, you've

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.640
seen the microneedles placed
on the flatbed scanner, which

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.910
does produce a really
wonderful image.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.290
I then decided to
also then go back

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.730
and refine the arrangement.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.360
There are two colors
that the researchers

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.340
decided to distinguish between,
showing pink and clear.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.920
Just looking at the
depth of field...

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.600
Here I'm starting to
compose for a cover shot.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.200
In this image, I did the same
thing thinking about a cover,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.620
but just using one color.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.620
I thought that the
pink was distracting.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.530
In this next image, I just
refined the color a bit,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.140
which we could do in software.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.760
In this image, I'm still
looking at a point of view.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.310
Look carefully as I slightly
change the positioning

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.490
of the disk in the lower left.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.660
Watch as I go back to
what I previously had,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.720
and just very ever
so slightly change it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.890
so that it doesn't
become redundant

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.009
with the other arrangements.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.270
These are very,
very minute changes,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.950
But this is sort of what
you have to go through.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.860
In the end, the
interesting thing

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.840
was that the researcher
sent me a very wonderful

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.780
microscopic picture
of these microneedles,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.780
and he really wanted
to try to get a cover.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.346
And although this course is
about a camera and a lens,

00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:17.720
I thought it would
be interesting

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.079
for you to see the possibility
of creating a potential cover

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.020
submission from a
horizontal picture.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.780
I really do encourage
you to consider

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.760
doing these kinds of things.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.050
We're not changing
the microneedles.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.380
We're just changing the
background of the microneedles.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.480
And so from this initial shot,
we in fact did get the cover.
