00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.960
OK.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.070
We're going to get a little
bit more detail about how

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.500
to sharpen images.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.010
Here's microfluidic
devices that we saw before

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.230
in the flatbed scanner section.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.380
I cropped a larger
picture, and as we zoom in,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.390
we're actually seeing
some Newton rings, which

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.480
we're not loving, but let's
pretend that they're not there.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.550
You know that we're going to get
Newton rings when you put glass

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.370
on top of glass,
or-- this is PDMS,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.090
which is also going to
give us some Newton rings.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.420
So let's just take an area,
maybe around here, just

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.330
to pay attention.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.950
I'm going to zoom
in a little more.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.990
Your eye should focus around
here and around the numbers,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.920
and maybe over here.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.520
To see what happens when we
sharpen, we go to the Filter,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.310
we go down to Sharpen,
and use Unsharp Mask.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.920
There are all kinds of
things, but for our purposes,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.160
Unsharp Mask is the way to go.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.710
And it was already set
at 128 once before.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.440
Let's go down to almost
very little sharpening,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.150
almost kind of the
original image.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.630
And watch as I increase
the amount of sharpening.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.520
You're seeing more and
more getting sharp.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.280
But, unfortunately, what also
happens is you get a lot of,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.930
the dirt is sharpening as well.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.560
And we'll discuss that in
a moment, a little bit.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.050
But we're going to go at
length about cleaning images.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.430
For example, if I accepted this
with 228, which is considerably

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.630
sharper than before-- let
me undo it with Command-Z.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.160
That was without sharpening.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.290
That's with sharpening.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.560
I hope you're seeing.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.560
Look over here now.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.780
Without sharpening.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.930
With sharpening.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.669
So we're getting some
real clarity here,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.630
which I think is
what we want to show.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.710
But, as I said, we are
also getting some junk,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.730
which, if I decided
to get rid of,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.940
let's say with
the Healing Brush.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.390
Little bit here.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.730
Get rid of this.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.320
Get rid of this.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.760
This is making
the image cleaner.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.840
And the question is, am
I permitted to do this?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.510
And we're going to have a very
important deeper discussion

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.810
about how much we can, in fact,
enhance scientific images.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.350
For the time being,
let's leave it at this.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.310
And we're going
to save the image

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.060
and clearly indicate
this has been sharpened.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.380
And that's it.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.140
There you go.
