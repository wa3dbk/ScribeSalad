00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.240
OK.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.870
Let's talk a little bit
about backgrounds again,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.550
but this time we'll see
how you can digitally

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.810
change the background.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.080
Now, if you remember
from previous tutorials,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.800
we discussed collecting
interesting backgrounds

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.070
to use while making the
images, whether you're

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.300
working with the flatbed
scanner or a camera.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.380
But sometimes we're
in a bit of a rush,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.270
as I was while making this
initial image of these two

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.920
paper devices.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.870
At the time, I didn't think
about enhancing the image

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.480
by including an
interesting background,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.720
maybe to pop out the
devices visually.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.480
So after I made the image
on the flatbed scanner,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.770
this is what we got.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.670
And as we zoom in,
we see a problem.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.180
A bit of a mess with all
sorts of stuff all over it.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.400
That's the price I pay
for being in a hurry

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.980
and not cleaning
the glass that day.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.800
Hint, hint.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.830
So because of the
presence of all

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.370
of this extraneous
material, we can't simply

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.840
select the background with,
let's say, the Magic Wand,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.590
and fill in that selected
area with the color.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.539
The algorithm for
that selection tool

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.520
will not select the dirty spots.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.250
And the Paint Bucket
won't do it either.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.100
You see here that the Paint
Bucket filling the background

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.370
will not fill in the
dirty bits either.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.410
So that's not going to work.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.520
Let's undo that
with Command-Z. What

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.200
I'm going to wind up doing, if I
want to change this background,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.020
is to do it in a different way.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.990
Let me show you how.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.990
We're going to try.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.780
OK.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.660
I'll use the Polygonal Lasso.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.960
And I'll enlarge this
again and move it over.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.788
Watch how I select
what is initially

00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:12.370
going to be selecting
just the two devices.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.290
This will take a bit,
so we can speed up

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.660
the video a little
bit, not to bore

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.920
you too much-- although a little
boredom is good for the soul.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.940
OK.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.590
I'm getting there.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.620
Almost there.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.350
OK.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.620
Here we go.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.220
So what's going on is that I
selected, in fact, actually

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.860
a couple of things.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.210
If you really think about it,
yes, I selected the devices,

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.620
but if you go to the
inverse of the selection,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.470
that means it will invert
the selection to everything

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.760
other than the devices, which
means the full background.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.680
Now that I'm completely
selecting the full background,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.800
I'm going to fill
it with the color

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.380
that I previously selected.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.710
It's shown as the
foreground color at 100%.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.840
And here we go.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.610
And the background is filled.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.070
Now I want to show you
a little extra which I

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.540
think is worth thinking about.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.110
I'm going to once again
go to the selection menu

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.710
and invert the
selection once again, so

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.920
that we are, in fact, back
to selecting the devices.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.440
I'm going to open up the
Layers window because I'm

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.390
going to show you that we're
working just, at this point,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.050
with one layer.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.020
OK.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.760
Here we go.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.530
Here's the Layers window.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.890
So remember, I first
selected this, inverted

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.740
the selection, which
selected the background,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.040
and inverted it back again
to select the devices,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.300
so we are back to
selecting the devices.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.320
I'm now going to make a
layer of these devices

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.790
by copying it-- that's
Command-C-- which has just

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.460
copied the selected
devices, and then Command-B,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.260
which has pasted
what I just copied,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.440
creating basically another
layer of just the devices.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.959
You can't see that
because the copy

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.240
layer is identical
to the devices

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.660
in the original
background image.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.730
Now what I'm going to do
is something I think is fun

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.990
and I think helpful
to the image.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.850
I'm going to go to
Layers, then Layer Style.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.400
Now remember, we're
talking about what

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.630
is labeled here as Layer One.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.040
I'm going to create a
drop shadow, which I like.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.770
You can play around with
the various qualities,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.340
like angle of the
shadow, distance

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.300
of the shadow, the
spread, the size,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.740
but watch as I change these
particular characteristics.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.440
What you're seeing
here is a drop shadow.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.190
OK.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.130
I'm going to say OK.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.470
I'm going to zoom
in a little bit

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.500
to show you what
we've done-- created

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.650
the shadow in that layer only.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.430
I'm going to make this new
layer invisible to show

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.420
you the difference.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.880
Here is how the background,
the original image,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.960
looks on its own, and here
it is with the drop shadow.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.930
So for me this looks
a little bit more

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.820
like the initial image with
its own shadows on the flatbed.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.970
One more thing.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.030
I'm going to convert the image
into a more horizontal image.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.400
Sometimes you want
to add more space,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.470
either making it more
vertical or horizontal,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.770
to fit it for a certain format.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.510
So the color with which we
want to extend the image

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.000
is this color.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.180
That needs to be in
the background box

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.090
when we increase canvas size.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.840
OK.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.910
I'm going to go to the image.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.110
Canvas Size.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.640
And here, I think
this might work.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.680
And if it doesn't, we
can add a little more

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.750
to change the width,
making the image longer.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.610
Let's just go, let's make it 15.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.470
So the algorithm will divide
the additional five inches

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.690
on both sides of the
image, keeping in mind

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.650
that the original
image is placed

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.870
in the center of that process.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.659
And here is the revamped image.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.380
It gives us a little
more space on both sides.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.120
So the last thing
I'm going to show you

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.680
is just a little
bit of labeling.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.900
So I'd like to insert
a label indicating

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.820
that this area from here
to there is a centimeter.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.409
But before we do that,
we still have two layers.

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:57.380
So let's flatten the
image, so there, we're

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.270
only working with one layer.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.180
As you see, there's only
one in the window now.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.690
I'm going to take our
line, trying it in white.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.590
You can try in black or
whatever color you want.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.120
OK, that's not bad.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.440
Let me undo this.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.400
That's Command-Z. I want the
lines to be a little closer

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.630
to the area that I'm
connecting it to.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.850
There's one.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.070
There's another.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.890
It's OK.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.940
We're going to add some
text, which I think I'm also

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.650
going to make in white.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.680
And I'm going to label
it, let's say 1cm.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.950
And then-- that's too small.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.460
Let's see, it's 18
using your style.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:52.330
Let's go to 24 points
and see how that looks.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.725
Almost there.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.040
I'll go back to move
it a little bit.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.890
That should do it.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.820
Yeah.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.180
I like it.
