00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.400
We have to talk about
composition of your images

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.420
but it's very
difficult to separate

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.840
the idea of composition and
point of view, background.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.000
And even lighting,
they all go together.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.080
When you adjust your light
-- you'll see later --

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.490
you're going to get a different
kind of shadow and that shadow

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.230
becomes part of the composition.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.530
So, we've attempted to separate
them into three categories,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.770
but really they are
very closely connected

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.610
and it's something
to keep in mind.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.610
So let's start with these
leaves, these autumn

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.070
leaves that I put on a light
box, which you will see more

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.780
of when we talk about light.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.520
In fact the light box itself
is an important compositional

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.770
element in this
image because it's

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.910
giving us a very strong negative
space between the leaves.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.300
And, it could be an
interesting thing

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.050
to play around with, using
the background as part

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.390
of your composition.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.240
Something to think about.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.630
Taking a look at these
crystals, which I just randomly

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.340
placed on a background just to
show the ability of creating

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.600
these crystals.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.460
Uh, this is, you
know, an okay image.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.110
Um, by the way, notice how
the shadows of these crystals

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.479
become part of the composition.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.470
What I finally decided to
do was, simplify the image

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.800
and just selected four
crystals and made a more close,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.090
close-up shot of them.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.670
They're both fine and and
that's one of these issues about

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.360
what's better.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.600
I mean, we could
split hairs and --

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.151
I really don't think there's
any...we could argue either

00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:52.650
way.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.330
That's the fun part about this.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.210
Once again, there are no
rules to any of these things.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.800
One of my gut ideas, which has
no data associated with it is I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.440
think it's more interesting
to show two of something

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.370
rather than show one.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.400
And I suppose that I could
speak to some psychologist

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.810
and discuss whether we
really do perceive it more.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.390
I don't know, I just,
it's just the way I do it.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.680
And I'm suggesting that if
you like what I do, then maybe

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.980
you'll wanna do it, too.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.079
I did take these two
devices (by the way,

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.200
it does show that you
can do more than one,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.790
you can create more than one)
and I photographed it this way.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.850
I photographed it in my
studio with a skylight above.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.930
And notice there is a little
problem with depth of field.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.380
The one above is not really
as sharp as it should be.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.140
And so I stopped down, which
you know, that what that means,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.130
so that the aperture
became smaller

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.990
and I gave myself
more depth of field.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.950
That is I got more in focus.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.130
And what [laughing]
happened was,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.670
I got so much in focus
that I could actually

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.380
see the detail of the skylight
with the clouds showing

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.030
through.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.950
This is tangential to the
point, but it's all connected

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.640
and you have to really pay
attention and learn to see

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.230
what it is you're getting at.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.810
Eventually, I would up, I
thought that this next image

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.360
was the best.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.310
Again, using two and
not necessarily showing

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.040
exactly the edge
of each, I think

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.320
it's an interesting idea to not
completely finish the image.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.875
Let the viewer finish it in more
of a participatory involvement,

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:43.375
perhaps.

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:46.620
ONCE AGAIN THIS
IDEA OF TWOS: Here

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.000
are two balls that
have so small a pattern

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.680
that we're seeing
light refracting.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.740
And here are two
silicon chips that

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.460
have material embedded on it.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.530
Again, I decided
to do it in twos.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.510
Here's another two
duet, two petri dishes

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.440
of E. Coli growing.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.950
By the way, notice the
composition: It's not

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.970
exactly equal, equally divided.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.700
I have one a little
more than the other.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.660
For our book, No
Small Matter, we

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.010
wanted to talk
about self-assembly.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.310
Actually these are two acrylic
dishes with acrylic balls

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.560
that literally
line themselves up

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.200
and I did it in twos as well.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.420
You know, again, it's an idea
that I'm comfortable with.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.940
It's actually easier to compose
when you have two things.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.390
At least it is for me.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.640
You might give it a shot.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.900
You might think of using
the process of composing

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.890
your picture as means of telling
a story, a visual story of what

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.860
your devices are about.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.500
What you're seeing here,
you're seeing basically three

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.320
components of an image.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.090
You're seeing the underside
of a wafer on your upper left,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.580
the green upper left.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.210
And that wafer has
fabricated on it small chips.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.880
So the fuchsia color is what
the wafer looks like as a whole.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.230
And then we we have
the individual chips

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.710
on top of the larger wafer.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.030
So you'll see the
individual ones as well.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.830
So trying to sort of say
this is a fabrication

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.390
of these particular
chips that deliver drugs.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.020
That's why we wanted to show
the underside of the wafer.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.330
By the way, all this needs
to be discussed in a caption.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.200
None of this works
without text, but uh this

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.270
is an attempt to visually
describe what this is.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.520
In this next one,
these are fibers

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.900
that are constructed
so that they have

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.270
different optical qualities.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.860
And the attempt was, I tried to
weave them in sort of a [laugh]

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.930
fabric because that's
what they were thinking

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.060
of making it work with.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.680
They were imagining these
fibers literally being

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.740
woven into clothing.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.590
I don't know if
it ever happened,

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.700
but this is a
number of years ago.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.290
Once again telling, suggesting
the use of material.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.880
In this next one I was
just playing around with,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.250
this was trying to show glass
when it's treated properly.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.480
You see on the upper
right and the lower right

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.060
when glass is treated in
a certain way it shatters

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.659
properly and safety wise whereas
the other one in the more

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.240
triangular area, it's just
not the way that we wanted.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.120
It is a little too artsy
probably or many of you,

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.150
but again, I was
just playing and I

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.610
do want you, as I
continue saying,

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.960
to play with this stuff.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.180
The next one it
was about corn that

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.630
was treated in a
particular way and I

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:09.700
decided to use the containers,
the plastic material that it

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.520
came in as a suggestion of
how these are delivered.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.530
And finally, just some devices
that evolved over time.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.350
These are various iterations
of a particular idea

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.900
and we see how they
changed, how they

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.050
evolved, telling a
sort of chronology

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.659
of these particular devices.

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:37.070
This is an example of really
stretching our imagination.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.940
It's of the watch that we've
seen before on my computer

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.830
screen as well, which
I have focused in on

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.960
and we're seeing a
detail of the watch.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.710
Using the computer screen
as another light source

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.880
but a compositional one as well.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.730
So here I'm selecting the image
of the watch on the screen.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.060
I don't like the colors here.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.840
That's what we're
doing here, we're

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.950
basically going to be
matching the colors.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.780
So I selected the watch
then inverted, selected

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.910
the real watch, as
opposed to the screen,

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.920
and now we have an image
that is balanced, color-wise.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.710
Just imagine, perhaps, another
kind of image on your screen

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.860
with your device.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.540
Maybe to expand the explanation
of how your image works.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.039
Something you might
want to think of,

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.669
using your own imagination.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.669
So this is just a
hint [laugh] of what

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.620
you could do with composition.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.860
And, as I said before,
it's very difficult

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.960
to separate this
idea of composition

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.460
with point of view
and backgrounds,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.330
which you'll see
in very shortly.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.580
So, you know, it's
all connected and I

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.680
could have very easily put some
of these in other categories,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.320
but thought it would be
fun to just try for myself,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.090
by the way, in separating
them, but they are truly

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.330
very much connected.
