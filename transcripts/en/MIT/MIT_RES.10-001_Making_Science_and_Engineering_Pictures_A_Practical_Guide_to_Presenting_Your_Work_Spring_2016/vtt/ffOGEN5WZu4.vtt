00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.580
In this case study, we're
going to quickly look

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.240
at how an image
of your apparatus

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.430
could become an interesting
photograph to submit

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.240
for a cover or used as a figure.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.120
Here, we're
suggesting a process.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.040
Now, because I couldn't
photograph the experiment

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.930
as it was going on, because
it was a closed system,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.830
I made an initial image of the
apparatus used in the research.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.140
These wires are
heated to vaporize

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.190
polymer material, which is
then deposited onto chips,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.940
as you see here.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.260
I first thought it would make
a nice image for a cover,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.010
leaving room for
the journal's logo.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.870
As it turned out, that image
was used for the MIT News page.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.450
I then decided to add another
piece of their apparatus

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.410
to fill the whole image.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.070
In the end, we did submit
this one for the cover,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.550
but it didn't get it.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.350
What we did get was something
called the frontispiece

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.690
in the journal.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.480
And surprisingly, they
preferred this inverted image,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.740
which I made just for fun,
rather than the original.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.680
Frankly, I personally
preferred the first one,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.650
but you just never
know people's taste.
