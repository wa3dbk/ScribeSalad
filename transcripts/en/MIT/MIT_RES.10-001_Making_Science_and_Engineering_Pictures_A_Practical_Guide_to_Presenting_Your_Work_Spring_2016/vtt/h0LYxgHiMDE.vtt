00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.610
Here's a case study
of five devices.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.400
Once again, I
really encourage you

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.680
to see who the researchers
are in the visual index

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.100
at the end of this material.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.160
This is pretty wonderful stuff.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.530
So we have five devices,
three on the right

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.910
and two on the left.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.500
Notice the composition-- not
boringly lined up in a row.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.420
So this image was taken in
let's call it the default mode,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.910
as most of the others.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.520
So to remind you, this
is with reflected light

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.860
coming from below the glass.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.630
The light bounces off
the device and is read

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.610
by the sensor below, again.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.550
Pretty standard setting
on your flatbed scanner,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.180
as if you were
scanning a document.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.450
Now look what
happens when we use

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.360
transmitted light, that
is, light from above,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.900
where the information is
still captured from beneath.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.700
You'll see that the left two
are just rectangles of black.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.520
And that's because, of
course, that the light

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.970
is prevented from
being transmitted

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.670
through the solid silicon chip.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.590
No light is reaching the sensor.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.750
Whereas the others on the
right are showing some detail,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.170
since they are
somewhat transparent.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.310
Remember, the sensor
is beneath the glass.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.500
So as we zoom in, the
slides on the right

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.810
show some pretty
interesting detail--

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.230
detail that we would not
see with reflected light.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.442
You might want to
pause the video here

00:01:26.442 --> 00:01:27.400
to see the differences.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.770
The luxury here is
having the ability

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.280
to transmit light
through your sample.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.820
My flatbed scanner has a
light source in the cover.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.950
I set my scanner in the
transmitted light mode,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.160
as if we were scanning film
or other transparent material.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.100
But you should play around
with your own setups.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.130
For example, here I just opened
the cover of the scanner.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.870
This sitting in
the scanner is set

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.160
to scan with reflected light.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.630
This is one of those examples
when experimenting can give us

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.320
an unusual result-- something
new and possibly useful.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.820
OK.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.320
Let's take a look at
biological growth in a Petri

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.120
dish for another case study.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.110
This is showing E. coli
growing under four conditions.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.540
I put the Petri
dish on the scanner,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.890
and once again use the
default reflected light.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.160
Capture it at a pretty high
resolution, around 400 megs

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.300
for the whole image.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.590
Looks good.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.010
But as we zoom in, we're
getting some dust and dirt

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.820
on the surface of
the Petri dish.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.720
I'm not happy about that.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.500
So I decided to try
transmitted light,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.450
as we just saw before in
our previous case study.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.680
My scanner, remember, has a
light source in its cover,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.850
giving me transmitted
light, that

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.700
is a light coming from above.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.180
Using this transmitted
light approach

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.560
make sense for bacterial
and biological growth

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.780
in Petri dishes.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.620
If you don't have a scanner
that has the light in its cover,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.150
then you might have some
luck with reflected light.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.090
But I wanted to make a
particular point here.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.160
Here, I'm using a mobile phone
camera, making a picture that

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.470
is pretty OK, just
quickly showing what's

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.960
going on here in the
Petri dish, but compared

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.290
to this high-resolution scanned
image using transmitted light,

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.170
and it's a whole
different world.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.220
I'm overlapping
here the phone image

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.590
over the transmitted
scanned image

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.370
so that you can see the
important point here.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.550
The phone image is
considerably smaller

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.400
in terms of its file size,
so that when we zoom in

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.070
closely on the computer screen
with each of these images

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.480
we see pretty significant
differences in resolution.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.030
In this scanned image
of about 400 megs,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.010
you can see remarkable detail
as we move into the image.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.870
But the phone image,
well, let's just

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.960
say is not totally remarkable.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.470
So it depends on what you'll
be using these images for.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.900
I really do want
to encourage you

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.660
to get the very best image you
can from the very beginning.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.350
It's the difference between
spending one minute on an image

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.769
and six minutes, let's say.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.980
My hope is that you see that
spending the additional five

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.190
minutes is pretty
much worth the time.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.180
Don't you think?
