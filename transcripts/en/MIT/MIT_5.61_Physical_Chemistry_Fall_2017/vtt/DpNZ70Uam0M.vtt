00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:25.250
PROFESSOR: I'm
really sick today.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.620
And I hope I can make
it through this lecture

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.570
without disgracing myself.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.330
But this is a favorite
topic of mine, too,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.440
so maybe it will be OK.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.020
So we're going to talk
about the helium atom, which

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.580
is really an amazing
thing because hydrogen--

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.610
it was possible to
solve it exactly.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.780
All sorts of fantastic
things happened.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.763
And it seemed like just a small
step from hydrogen to helium.

00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:01.910
And nobody can take that step.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.489
It's entirely approximate.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.930
And you can do better and
better on the approximations,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.280
but we'd like to have some
physical sense of what's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.980
going on, and what are
the important terms,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.000
and can we steal
things from hydrogen?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.980
The answer is, yeah, we can.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.150
And that was what last
lecture was mostly about.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:35.240
The energies for hydrogen
are minus z squared hc times

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.750
the Rydberg over n squared.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:48.570
And we have the ionization
energy from the nth level.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.710
And so this actually
is the way we

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.190
make a link to this concept
of electronegativity

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.620
because the dominant
thing in electronegativity

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.910
is the ionization energy.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.980
And this is the
ionization energy.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.700
And when you put them
together and solve for n,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.630
you get this arrangement hc
z squared times the Rydberg

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.740
over the ionization
energy, square root.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.460
That's n, or the effective
principle quantum number.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.850
And then we have all
of these formulas that

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.410
can be derived from
hydrogenic wave functions,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.740
both for diagonal
expectation values

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.960
or off diagonal matrix elements.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.940
They're all closed form.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.160
And this is wonderful
because it then

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.750
enables you to use the formulas
that are obtained exactly

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.920
for hydrogenic wave functions.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.170
And so if we know the dependence
of an electronic property on n

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.140
and l--

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.260
well, n is experimentally
determined--

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.740
distance real ionization.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.210
l is determined from
angular momentum.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.980
Then we can determine the
expected scaling of everything

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.800
on the quantum numbers.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.620
And even if that's
wrong, it tells you

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.390
the qualitative effects when you
get to more complicated systems

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.800
in one electron atoms.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.510
And this is really what
I meant by structure,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.350
where everything is related
to basically one observation.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.920
There is one other thing
that I didn't stress.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.480
And it's another concept from
5.112., and that's shielding.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.390
So suppose we have
a sodium atom.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.800
Most of the electrons
are in a compact core.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.730
The outer electron
sees a charge of 1,

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.580
even though the charge on
the nucleus is larger than 1.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.400
And if you ask, well, suppose
we look at this in a region,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.230
and we have an
electron inside of it,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.209
the charge that
that electron sees

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.160
is the amount of electrons
inside the sphere defined

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.570
by this radius.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.320
And so the z, we can
call it the z effective,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.720
is a function of r.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.300
And you have a different
function every o.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.105
And so it's a way of
putting in more insight.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.660
And I've made a lot of
mileage in my career

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.760
on these sorts of
scaling arguments.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.130
OK, so helium-- the
notes are beautiful.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.980
They're written by Troy.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.780
And they're very long.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.830
And they're very
correct and incisive.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.700
And even if I weren't sick, I
couldn't cover all those notes.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.590
So I'm going to make a rather
express trip through the notes.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.050
And the critical thing
is we have two electrons.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.270
And so we can't simply
solve the problem

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.750
by using hydrogenic functions,
although we would like to.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.020
And the crucial
thing that is missing

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.580
is if we could ignore the
interactions between the two

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.120
electrons, which
are enormous, then

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.980
we would be using
hydrogenic functions,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.590
and everything would be fine.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.090
So we can't.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.050
And we use what's called
the independent electron

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.390
approximation, where we're
still using hydrogenic orbitals

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.990
and energies, but
we're using those

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.400
to include the first
order perturbation

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.160
correction to the energies.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.000
So there's a term, the
interelectron repulsion

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.360
that leads to this
extra correction energy.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.560
And that's most
of the difference.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.280
But then, we have
identical particles.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.980
And when we have
identical particles,

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.500
the permutation of
those two particles

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.560
has to commute with
the Hamiltonian

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.820
because the Hamiltonian
only knows that we're

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.270
dealing with all the electrons.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.840
It doesn't put names on
the individual electrons.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.090
And so there's a
permutation symmetry

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.930
that has to be imposed.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.680
And this is very subtle because
the permutation symmetry has

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.670
nothing to do with
the energy, but it has

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.110
to do with the energy states.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.480
And so we'll explore that.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.180
Now, since we're
going to be dealing

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.330
with more than one electron,
there's a lot of symbols

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.550
that we're going to
be carrying around.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.122
And so there's a
useful thing called

00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:08.900
the atomic units, which sets
most of the physical constants

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.160
to 1.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.310
And that means all of the rubble
that you have to carry around

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.780
goes away.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.620
And it's not a big
deal because if you

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:26.510
use all of the things in your
calculation in atomic units,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.730
namely value 1 or something
like 1, then at the end,

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.370
you're going to get the
energy in atomic units.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.720
And we know what that is
in conventional units.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.400
So it's a risky thing
because you don't really

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.180
know what you're doing.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.410
But at the end, you
can probably convert

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.680
your number, which is a pure
number, into an actual energy.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.390
OK, so let me start
with the good news.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.990
Well, maybe I should
leave this exposed.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.400
The good news is we have
two particles for helium--

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:16.340
vector r, momentum, momentum
p vector for particle 1,

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.300
vector, momentum.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.370
OK, so these are the actors.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.580
And when do we have to
worry about commutation

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.750
or non-commutation?

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:35.090
Well, the answer
is the coordinates

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.500
associated with
different particles,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.799
they contribute to the energy.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.860
But there is no
problem of commutation.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.580
The momenta don't also commute.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.140
The coordinate for
particle 1 and the momentum

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.700
for particle 2, they commute.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:03.950
The only things that doesn't
commute is r1x, p1x--

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.100
those kinds of things.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.530
They're commutators
ih bar, and that

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.610
means there's some problems.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.770
So most of the variables
are commuting variables,

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.850
but some are not.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.260
And you have to deal with that.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:21.760
OK.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.880
We know that if we
have, as, for example,

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.310
in a three-dimensional
harmonic oscillator,

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.550
if we have a Hamiltonian
that doesn't commute--

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.180
if we can divide the
system up into parts, then

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.630
the Hamiltonian for each part
commutes with the Hamiltonian

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.300
for the other part,
which is part of this.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.790
Then, you can write
the Hamiltonian

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.300
as a sum of individual
system Hamiltonians

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.580
that commute with each other,
the energies as the sum,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.817
and the wave functions
as the product.

00:09:55.817 --> 00:09:56.650
And so we like that.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.770
And we'd like to be able to
build a picture for helium that

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.090
is like that.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.770
And so if we write the
Hamiltonian for helium,

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:13.660
we have p squared for particle
1 over to me with p squared--

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.720
I don't know.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.820
Le me see.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.590
Let me organize better.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:33.620
Minus zb squared over
4 pi epsilon 0 r1.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:43.100
And then we have another term
like this for particle 2.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.489
And we can call
this Hamiltonian 1.

00:10:47.489 --> 00:10:50.210
I don't want to do that.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.910
Hamiltonian 1, and
this Hamiltonian 2.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.670
And these are hydrogen
atom Hamiltonians.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.030
And we know
everything about them.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.030
So it's a fantastic
way to build up

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:08.960
a basis set consisting of
energy, zero-order energies

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.810
and zero-order wave
functions, with which

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.240
we can calculate anything.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.270
And so then we have
this one other term,

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:27.390
which plus e squared
over 4 pi epsilon 0

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:32.070
over 1 minus r minus r2 vectors.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.620
That's the bad news.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:45.790
This says we have a
Hamiltonian, where

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:50.260
we can't use the eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:57.430
of the hydrogenic things unless
we do-- so we can say, well,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:02.350
these give the first-order
energies for whatever state

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.235
we want.

00:12:05.235 --> 00:12:10.710
But we can calculate matrix
elements of this term

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:15.020
in the basis set
associated with hydrogen.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.420
And that's fine.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.250
That's a perfectly
good way to calculate

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.990
the first-order
correction to the energy.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.855
But what about this?

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.440
When we do perturbation
theory and calculate

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.050
the second-order
corrections to the energy,

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.105
what is that usually?

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.350
Maybe I didn't ask the
question clearly enough.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:50.110
What do you have to do to get
these second-order energies

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.360
in an infinite
dimension problem?

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.120
I just gave it away.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.260
Somebody has to have the
courage to say something here.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:13.514
Remember, we have a sum of n not
equal to n from 0 to infinity.

00:13:13.514 --> 00:13:14.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:15.880
PROFESSOR: That's it.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.280
OK, I encouraged you.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:24.100
So the way we could use this
basis set in a perturbation

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.340
theory format is to
calculate an infinite number

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.100
of off-diagonal matrix
elements of the hydrogenic wave

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.410
functions.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.630
And that could yield
results, but it's not

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.070
the way it's done usually.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.740
There's a variational
calculation

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.080
that you use to get the
better wave functions.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.050
But we're not going
to do that here.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.240
We're going to go
as far as we can

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.370
without actually addressing
what's wrong if we stop here.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:07.270
OK, so this guy is h1,
the source of all trouble.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.330
And how we deal with it
is there are three steps.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.710
One is ignore it.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:19.200
The other is use our
hydrogenic functions

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:26.150
to calculate matrix elements
of this and get an h1, an e1.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.730
And the third step would
be to get the exact answer

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.310
by doing an infinitely
difficult calculation, OK?

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.530
All right.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:44.810
So this is going to be a
notational voyage, which

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.240
is horrible.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.990
Because we have many particles,
and particles have coordinates

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:55.440
and spins, we're going to
have an explosion of stuff,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.970
even if we get rid of
the extraneous units.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.040
But let's get rid of
the extraneous units.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.240
And so atomic units--

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.330
we can choose any internally
consistent set of units

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.430
we want.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:17.750
And in atomic units, we say that
the mass of the electron is 1.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.300
The charge of the electron is 1.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.960
The h bar is 1.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.560
4 pi epsilon 0 is 1.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.520
That's good.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.560
A lot of stuff just going away.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.630
OK, and the energy in
atomic units is not 1.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:43.180
The energy in atomic
units is minus 2 times

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.860
the energy of the
hydrogenic 1s orbital.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:53.440
And that comes out to
be 27.21 electron volts,

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.780
in more convenient units.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.890
So you calculate a number, and
then you multiply it by this

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.270
to get the real energy.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:10.500
OK, and the unit
of length is a0,

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.070
which is the radius of the
n equals 1 hydrogenic Bohr

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.970
orbital, or Bohr orbit.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:23.580
And that's 0.529 angstroms,
with a lot more digits if you

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.880
need them, OK?

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:33.490
And the speed of light
is 137 in atomic units.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.380
So everything that
you're going to need

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:42.560
is either 1 or something
that is related to--

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.590
OK, so you can do this,
and I don't like it

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:51.141
because it's so easy
in a big calculation

00:16:51.141 --> 00:16:53.730
to get your units screwed up.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.730
But it's certainly
great for lecturing

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.005
and perhaps for writing
computer programs.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:13.480
OK, so let's start with a
non-interacting electron

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.380
approximation.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:23.359
And in the notes, it's
represented by these letters.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.520
I don't know
whether that this is

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:31.940
Troy notation or widely-adopted
in quantum chemical circles.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.670
But it's easier to
write this than that.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:39.520
And that just means we're
going to ignore this.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.890
We just forget about it.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.790
Now, we know that's stupid
because the electrons have

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.230
charge of 1.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.000
And they repel each other.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.465
And the nucleus has charge
of 2, in the case of helium.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:04.450
And so we know that this
term is rather similar to h0.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.960
And we can't expect to get very
far completely ignoring it.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.157
But we can do it, and
we can do a calculation,

00:18:10.157 --> 00:18:11.740
and we can find out
how well it works.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:22.470
So first of all, it's
clear in the notes.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.600
I'm just going to
skip to the answer.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:31.160
So the energy for helium
in the 1s 1s orbital

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.070
or 1s 1s configuration--

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.890
when we're going to use this
word configuration, what

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:45.060
that means is the list of
orbitals that are occupied.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.330
Now, we're listing
principal quantum number

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.420
and orbital angular momentum.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.750
There is more stuff
which doesn't get listed,

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.960
and that leads to very
interesting stuff.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.710
But if we have a list of
the orbitals are occupied.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.740
That's called the
electronic configuration.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.340
And I'm an electronic
spectroscopist,

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.320
so you can be sure this is
something I care a lot about.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:25.330
So we can calculate this
in the hydrogenic basis.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.670
And what you end up getting is--

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:28.210
where is it?

00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:46.610
I'm sorry.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.560
This is the experimental value.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.350
The calculated value is--

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.380
see, I'm trying to
improve on my notes.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:59.960
And in my present state,
I make a lot of mistakes.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:05.970
So that is 108.8 electron volts.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:12.530
So this is the energy of the 1s
1s state below the ionization

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.660
limit.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.980
So that's what we predict.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.640
Except this is not
the ionization limit.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.774
This is helium 2+
plus 2 electrons.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.640
Because we use the energy
to ionize both hydrogen

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.950
atoms, and so this is 108.8.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.780
Now, you can measure
this experimentally.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:50.050
You can do helium to
helium plus an electron,

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:57.440
and then helium plus going to
helium 2+ plus an electron.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:04.160
And the observed value
is what I wrote before.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:11.620
Observed is equal to minus
79.0 electrons volts.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.080
Well, you might say,
well, that's pretty good.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.930
It's the same
order of magnitude.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.510
It's not even off
by a factor of 2.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.590
But almost everybody in
this room is a chemist.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:28.630
And this difference between
the calculated value

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:34.330
and the observed value
is 30 electron volts.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:38.590
A chemical bond is
typically 5 electron volts.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.910
So this is totally
ridiculous for chemistry.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.810
We can't use it.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.760
We don't even want
to think about it

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.430
because it's an
order of magnitude

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.720
away from what we need.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.870
We improve on it by
including e1 of n,

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:08.791
which is related to h1, which
is that simple-looking thing

00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:09.290
over there.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.990
So the interelectron
repulsions can be dealt with,

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:21.450
not exactly, but by calculating
diagonal matrix elements

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:27.570
of the interelectron repulsion.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:34.310
And that's what the independent
electron approximation is.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.170
So that's all there is.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:40.760
But now we bring in something
that we hadn't expected

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.590
would be a problem.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.530
So we have this
mystical, or mythical,

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.040
or whatever operator--

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:04.410
p12 operating on some
function of r1 and r2.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.730
And what it does is it
permutes the electrons.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.800
We know that if
something is operating

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.290
on the names of
the electrons, it

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.100
has to commute with
the Hamiltonian.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.310
So that means that
this operator has

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:33.120
to have eigenvalues if these
states are eigenfunctions

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.780
of the Hamiltonian.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.330
And there are two
possible eigenvalues

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:46.940
because we know p12 squared
on psi is equal to plus psi.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.820
So the only way you
can do that is having

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.880
the eigenvalue of the
permutation operator

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.390
be either plus 1 or minus 1.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:59.360
And this is a
fundamental symmetry.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.710
And I can't possibly tell
you where it comes from

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.150
or what I'm about to write
on the board comes from.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:25.620
But so all half integer
spins correspond

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:36.434
to antisymmetry or belong
to the eigenvalue minus 1.

00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:37.600
And they're called fermions.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.340
And integer spins are
symmetric with permutations.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:58.760
And so integer or symmetric,
and they're bosons.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.380
So we have to write
wave functions which

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.300
are wave functions of
the electrons, which

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.270
are antisymmetric with
respect to the permutation

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.280
of every pair of electrons.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.040
So helium, we only
have two electrons.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.670
It's not so bad.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.840
But when you think
about something

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.510
like carbon monoxide,
which I always think about,

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.640
or some other
molecule where there's

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.460
more than two electrons,
there's a God awful number

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.410
of permutations.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.740
And you have to build them
all into the wave function.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.510
And the normal feeling
when you hear that is,

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:43.590
oh, no, I can't possibly
imagine how to do that.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:47.180
And if I could, there would be
a ridiculous number of integrals

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.770
that I would have to evaluate.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.850
And it's true.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.890
There are a ridiculous
number of integrals.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:58.280
But there is a simple
algebra that enables you

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.440
how to deal with them.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:05.310
And it involves using what is
called Slater determinantal

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.140
wave functions.

00:26:08.639 --> 00:26:09.680
And I'll talk about that.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.430
Slater was an MIT professor.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.120
He wrote a lot of books.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.250
But the thing-- integer.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.820
Oh, they'res sort of a t.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.050
But the most
important thing he did

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.020
was to develop
this way of dealing

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:30.740
with an antisymmetric
electronic wave functions.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.640
So the next thing we
have to do is discover

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.910
how do we build symmetric wave
functions for the simplest

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.150
possible case where
there's two electrons?

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.120
And already, we discover
some surprising consequences

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.311
for this.

00:26:45.311 --> 00:26:46.810
And so I'm going
to go through this,

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.430
but I'm going to
skip a lot of steps

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.579
because it's so clearly
written in the notes

00:26:50.579 --> 00:26:52.120
and because we don't
really have time

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.360
to deal with 15 pages
of single-spaced notes.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:02.567
And I'm not sufficiently at my
best to get through maybe 12.

00:27:02.567 --> 00:27:03.900
And you don't want that, anyway.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:10.909
OK, so let us see
what happens here.

00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:11.950
And so let's get to work.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:25.510
Suppose we have an electronic
state 1s alpha spin.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.110
We know alpha is
ms equals plus 1/2.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.390
And beta is ms equals minus 1/2.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.580
So this is the
spatial coordinate.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.120
This is the spin coordinate.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:55.507
And, OK, so here is a simple
product of two wave functions.

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:56.590
And we know what they are.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:18.720
And so if we apply p12 to this,
we get psi 1s alpha r2 sigma

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:28.070
2 1s beta r1 sigma 1.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.500
We don't even know what
this is relative to that.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:43.210
So symbolically, these are
two unrelated quantities.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.550
So weird, but they
are eigenfunctions

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:50.070
of the zero-order Hamiltonian.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:53.010
So we can take a linear
combination of eigenfunctions

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.810
that belong to the
same eigenvalue,

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.250
and it's still the same energy.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.960
So we do that.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:10.630
And so what we can do is write
a combination of this function

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.690
and that function.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:20.450
And if we do that, so now
we can have psi 1s 2s.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:24.050
And what we get is 1 over
the square root over 2

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:25.780
for normalization.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:41.542
And we have psi 1s alpha r1
sigma 1 minus psi 1s beta

00:29:41.542 --> 00:29:45.010
r1 r2 sigma 2.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.520
And this, in fact,
is anti-asymmetric.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.870
If you apply the permutation
operator to this,

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:57.250
it is an antisymmetric function.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.510
So this does the job.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:11.490
Now, since the Hamiltonian
doesn't depend on spin,

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:15.000
the energy of this state
and the energy of that state

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.710
are the same.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:16.920
They are hydrogenic.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.540
And so using this wave
function rather than

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.820
the individual
non-symmetrized functions

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.200
doesn't change the energies.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.016
So are we wasting our time?

00:30:29.016 --> 00:30:32.780
AUDIENCE: I think you
didn't [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.635
This should be the product
of 1s alpha 1s beta.

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:37.510
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.759
AUDIENCE: So the [INAUDIBLE]
must be [FINGER SNAPPING]

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:40.860
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes, yes.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.316
AUDIENCE: Minus the other one.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:52.370
PROFESSOR: I just want
to see what I wrote here.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:56.910
So yeah, what I wrote is wrong.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:02.490
1s alpha, and we'll
just put 1 in here.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:24.516
1s beta 2 minus 1s
alpha 2 1s beta 1.

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:26.140
OK, this is what I
should have written.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.570
And this is, in
fact, antisymmetric.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.600
Thank you.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.170
I wrote what's in my
notes, which is wrong.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.790
And I didn't realize I had done
that because I knew the answer.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.420
All right.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:50.950
OK, so we can use
this kind of function.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.920
It's legal because
it's an eigenfunction

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.640
of the permutation operator
with negative symmetry, which

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.740
we're told that's what we
have to use for electrons.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.170
I can't tell you
where it comes from,

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.180
although it came from Pauli.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.890
And the exclusion
principle really

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.330
is this, rather than
what you have memorized.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.400
Its consequence is
that you can only

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.200
put one electron in an orbital.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.080
But this is the exclusion
principle, and it is Pauli.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.570
OK, so now we know what to do.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:31.200
And we can calculate
the matrix elements.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:39.120
psi 1s alpha go in 1s beta.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.890
This is the antisymmetrized
product of two electrons.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.820
Matrix element 1
for Hamiltonian 1

00:32:47.820 --> 00:33:02.697
plus 1 over r1 minus r2
psi 1s alpha 1s beta.

00:33:02.697 --> 00:33:05.030
Though this is a perfectly
legitimate thing to calculate

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:09.880
and we know how to do it, or
McQuarrie knows how to do it.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.500
And you don't
really need to worry

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.830
about doing these
integrals because this

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.280
is at such a low-level
approximation,

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.100
it does nothing for
you except teach you

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.010
how to approach these problems.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.350
But we can still
do these integrals.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.600
And it's useful.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.970
And so what do you get?

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:33.370
Well, you get minus
4y because these

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:37.390
are hydrogenic with
a nucleus of plus 2.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:43.270
And in the atomic
units, the energy

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:51.990
of a hydrogen atom charge
of 1 is 1/2, not 1.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:58.000
And these go as z squared, so
we get 4 over 2 plus 4 over 2.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.290
So we get this minus
4 or you get minus--

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.280
yes.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.780
And then we get something else.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.770
And that's this integral
that we don't like,

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:21.460
which is integral of 1s
alpha 1s beta squared

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:27.790
over r1 minus r2 dr1 dr2.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.960
So we can do this integral,
or Mr. McQuarrie and many

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:41.810
of his predecessors can do that
integral, and you get a result.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:50.330
And this integral turns
out to be 5z over 8.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:35:02.720
And converting that into
units, and that's 5/4 au.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.560
And that's-- why is that?

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:12.460
That doesn't seem right.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:20.350
Anyway, it's 34 electron volts
or minus 34 electron-- plus.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.700
Plus 34 electron volts--

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.040
so the interelectronic repulsion
for hydrogenic orbitals

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.810
on the same nucleus
is 34 electron volts.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.160
It's a big number.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:39.010
And so we can correct our the
calculated versus observed

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:39.590
energy.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:40.765
And instead of having--

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:47.795
well, the experimental
value is 79.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:36:00.550
And now, the calculated value
is minus 74.8 electron volts.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:03.720
So this is marginally
relevant to chemistry

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.930
because the error is about
the typical bond energy.

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.980
And so we can do
stuff with this.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.200
We know that it's
not accurate enough

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.790
to do anything quantitative.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:19.650
But you can use it for
qualitative arguments.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.230
And we can do much
better than this

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:28.830
using what's going to be called
the variational principle,

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:29.520
which is coming.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:39.520
OK, so now, we're going to be
dealing with a problem that has

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:45.880
lots of symbols and equations.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:57.350
And it's best to start using
notation called stick diagrams

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.950
because it's completely
transparent what they mean.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.770
And so it's a shortcut for
writing the correct equations.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:14.560
So we have for the ground
state of hydrogen--

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.070
I'm sorry.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:28.840
We want to talk about excited
states because 1s with 1s

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.190
doesn't have enough complexity
to attract our attention.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:40.420
And when we deal with
excited states, 1s and 2s,

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:44.290
we discover something
important that's new.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.760
And it's the last
thing we really

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.300
need in order to understand
electronic structure

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.940
or how the electronic states
that arise from a configuration

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.040
are distinguished.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:05.990
And so we have for the
1s 2s configuration,

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:10.150
there are four ways of writing
this in stick diagrams.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:20.390
So we have 1s 2s, and we can
have spins up, alpha alpha.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:26.170
And we can have 2s 1s.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:30.020
We can have spins up and down.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:35.960
2s 1s, and spins down and up.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.840
And 2s 1s spins down.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.810
So it's much easier
to write these things

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:47.470
because they have an equation
to associate with them,

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:51.820
and you can play
with these symbols.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:39:00.300
So the first thing you
notice is this symbol

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:06.470
can be written as an
antisymmetrized product.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.180
And so this symbol--

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.930
we just take the alpha alpha.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.960
And so let me just write it out.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:31.270
1 over square root of 2 times
1s r1 2s r2 minus psi 1s r2

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:35.810
psi 2s r1.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:40.190
And then times a
spin part, alpha--

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:42.770
and we can just
abbreviate the 1--

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:43.640
and alpha.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:50.350
OK, so we have factored
the wave function

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.430
to a spatial part
and a spin part.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.090
Now, I'll make an
outrageous statement.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:59.400
Doesn't matter how
many electrons.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.860
You'll always be
able to factor it

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.980
into a spatial part
and a spin part.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:11.410
Now, what is necessary
is always this function

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.740
has to be antisymmetric.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.670
And in this case,
it's the spatial part

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:18.720
that's antisymmetric and the
spin part that's symmetric.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.095
Now, when we try to do
these two stick diagrams.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.290
we cannot write a correct
equation for this guy.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.630
We have to do both of them.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.940
We have to combine the two.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.820
And that will give us a
separated spin part and spatial

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.260
part.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.180
And it's antisymmetric.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:48.170
You can't make in an asymmetric
function of this just switching

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.565
the coordinates.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.770
And what you find
when you do this

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:59.660
is going to be that
we get functions

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:04.370
which look like alpha beta
plus or minus beta alpha.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:11.750
OK, so spin 1 alpha spin
2 beta plus or minus

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:14.200
spin 1 beta spin 2 alpha.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:29.040
And it turns out that there are
three spin functions that we

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.800
get, which are symmetric.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.920
And all three of
these are associated

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.860
with this antisymmetric
spatial function.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.547
They have the same energy.

00:41:40.547 --> 00:41:42.880
And since they're three of
them, we call them a triplet.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:50.020
And since we're
talking about spins,

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.080
this triplet corresponds
to s equals 1.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.680
You use s equals 1 and creation
and annihilation operators

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.420
or raising and
lowering operators

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:04.245
to show that these are, in fact,
the three eigenstates of s sub

00:42:04.245 --> 00:42:04.745
z.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.460
So we call it a triplet
because they're three of them.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:14.140
And it also corresponds
to s equals 1.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:19.570
And there's one, alpha
beta minus beta alpha,

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:22.680
which is antisymmetric
and is associated

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:27.430
with a different spatial
function, which is symmetric.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:29.830
And it has to have
a different energy

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:33.640
because the Hamiltonian operates
on the spatial part and not

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.930
on the spin part.

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:37.690
So antisymmetry has
forced you to have

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:41.020
two different spatial
wave functions,

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.090
and that guarantees
that these guys

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.640
will have different energies.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:51.070
And since there's only one of
them, we call it a singlet,

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.690
and it corresponds
to s equals 0.

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.420
So now, we want to know,
which is higher in energy,

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.180
the singlet or the triplet?

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.050
And how much higher?

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.380
And so, again, we take
the wave functions

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.900
that are correct as far as
permutation is concerned,

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.100
but only approximate as far
as using hydrogenic functions,

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:17.166
and we evaluate the relevant
terms in the Hamiltonian.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.980
OK, so we can forget
about the spin parts now.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.740
We know we're going to have
two different spatial wave

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.250
functions.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.776
And we're going to want
to calculate-- yes?

00:43:30.776 --> 00:43:32.650
AUDIENCE: For the top
state, [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:35.737
both spins [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:35.737 --> 00:43:36.820
PROFESSOR: That should be?

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.160
AUDIENCE: Would that
also be s equals 0?

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.160
PROFESSOR: I can't hear.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.030
I understand the last word.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:46.070
AUDIENCE: With the statement,
both spin be also s equals 0?

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.060
PROFESSOR: No.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.170
Both spins up.

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.620
The vector sum of
1/2 and 1/2 is 1.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.155
And so the total spin
is going to be 1.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.940
And so we have 3--

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.060
I mean, if we're
applying s minus--

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.290
suppose we start with--

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:11.100
AUDIENCE: I meant that the top
spin [INAUDIBLE] both spins.

00:44:15.382 --> 00:44:16.090
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.800
I can't hear properly.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.216
AUDIENCE: The topmost state
with both spins on it?

00:44:23.216 --> 00:44:23.840
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.270
AUDIENCE: Would that have
s equals 0 or s equals 1?

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.630
PROFESSOR: It has s equals 1.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.600
OK.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.920
And now, I don't want to go
into the angular momentum matrix

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.420
element.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.100
That would be the last
thing in this lecture.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:44.590
So yes, the projection
quantum numbers

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:48.640
are not uniquely associated
with the total spin.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.680
But if you have alpha alpha, you
can show that it's s equals 1.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:56.250
And alpha beta plus
beta alpha is 1.

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.600
And beta beta is 1.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.740
But alpha beta minus
beta alpha is spin 0.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.740
You can do that using creation
and annihilation operators.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:08.860
It's clear, OK?

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.470
So you have to take
it on faith until you

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.520
prove what I've just said.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.510
And it takes about two minutes.

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:22.240
OK, so we can evaluate
the integrals.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:27.330
And something very
beautiful occurs.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:30.830
And it's done very, very
clearly in the notes.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.710
And it would take me more time
than we have left to do it,

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.450
and I didn't plan
on doing it anyway.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:40.880
So we get the energies for the
singlet and triplet states,

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:47.720
which are E 1s plus E 2s.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.730
Now, remember, these are
for a 1s orbital on helium,

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.230
so it's going to be
four times the energy

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:00.710
of the 1s orbital on hydrogen.
But we know what they are.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:08.390
Plus what we call J 1s2s
plus or minus K 1s2s.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.910
So this is clear.

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.130
And the integral
associated with this

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:18.810
is taking the square
of the wave function.

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.740
And basically, we're
evaluating the interaction

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:31.070
between an electron 1 in the
1s orbital and electron 2

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:32.130
in the 2s orbital.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:34.220
So that's a perfectly
doable thing.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.610
It's a classical quantity.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.660
We have two charged
distributions,

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.640
and we're calculating
the energy interaction

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.480
between two electrons in these
two charged distributions.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.670
So this is called
the Coulomb integral.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:53.440
And that is an entirely
classical quantity.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.550
And this is called
the exchange integral.

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.520
And the reason we call it
an exchange integral is,

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.260
basically, we're
switching the electrons

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.300
between the two orbitals.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.050
And this is something which is
entirely quantum mechanical.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.890
It comes about because of
the permutation symmetry

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.650
that's required for fermions.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:19.560
And so this is the surprise.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:23.250
And it also depends
on whether you

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.740
have a symmetric,
or an antisymmetric,

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.960
or a single, or a triplet.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.760
And so you end up
getting an energy level

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.880
diagram for the state of
a configuration, which

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.970
looks like this.

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:37.570
So we start out with E 0 1s2s.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:44.700
And then we allow the charged
distributions to interact.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.980
And the electrons are
going to repel each other.

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.030
It's a positive energy.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:58.870
And so this is E 0 plus J. And
then, we include the exchange

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:00.970
interaction.

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:03.520
And so this is
the difference 2K.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:13.880
And this is E0 plus J plus K.
And this is E0 plus J minus K.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.840
And this is the triplet state.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.750
And this is a singlet.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:28.810
And for helium, we
call the singlet state

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:35.550
singlet s because total
angular momentum is 0.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:39.570
And spin, it has 0.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:42.180
And the triplet we
call a triplet s.

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:49.300
Now, if we did 1s 2p, we would
get singlet and triplet p

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:49.800
states.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.420
But the important
thing is, how big is K?

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.810
And remember, K is
an approximation.

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:04.100
It's a real quantity, but
for hydrogenic orbitals,

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.420
it's going to be incorrect.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:22.820
And so 2K 12 is
2.4 electron volts.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.770
And that's a perfectly
doable calculation

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.900
because you're dealing
with simple functions.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.400
And you can do this integral.

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.710
And you can actually
do it in closed form.

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:32.960
But it's 2.4 electron volts.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:45.110
And experiment, it's 0.8.

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:48.630
And this tells you
something really important.

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:52.320
The repulsion between
two electrons,

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.440
when you have the
correct wave function,

00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:01.350
is less than it would be if
you're using the wrong wave

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.120
functions.

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:08.900
And basically, whenever you do
anything using the wrong wave

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:11.570
functions, your energy
levels are too large

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.480
or the energy differences
are too large.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.990
And in this case, the electrons.

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:19.490
And when you solve the
exact Schrodinger equation,

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:24.220
the electrons know about how to
absorb it to avoid each other.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.200
It's called correlation energy.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.960
And this is what makes all the
calculations hard because there

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.830
is no closed form analytic
expression for the correlation

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:34.670
energy.

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:40.280
And the way you optimize
the correlation energy

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.850
is throwing a huge basis
set at the problem.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.610
And this is why it takes a long.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.450
And you never know that you've
converged until you fill

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:52.990
in another million functions.

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:55.150
OK, but so there
are several lessons.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:51:01.510
And that is we have something
that's completely classical,

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.970
and we understand what it is.

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:06.100
And then, we have
this extra thing

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.905
that is a consequence of
the permutation symmetry.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:15.660
And so this extra thing
we calculated too big.

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:19.320
But it says that
if we have states

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.540
that belong to the same
electronic configuration--

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:26.670
in other words, if we specify
the orbitals that are occupied,

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:29.160
there's going to be more
than one electronic state.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:35.090
And so configurations split
into many different electronic

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:35.900
states.

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.840
And we know the machinery
that enables us to calculate

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.090
their relative energies.

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:44.620
And some of it is
simple Coulomb's law.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.930
And some of it is
something that's

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:51.210
caused by the required
permutation symmetry.

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:52.290
So I'm over time.

00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:55.590
But I can't believe
that I got to this point

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:59.250
because I delivered everything
that was really important.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:02.520
When we have more than two
electrons, everything I've said

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.340
is true, it's just
more complicated.

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:09.690
And we have to evaluate
matrix elements

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:13.650
between determinantal
wave functions, which

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:16.620
looks like, if you
have n electrons,

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.580
there's n factorial
terms in a determinate.

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:23.290
And we have n factor l
squared matrix elements.

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.540
And you don't want to do that.

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.820
But there turns out to
be a simple algebra that

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:31.740
makes it all pop out, almost
with the same level of effort

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:32.940
as this.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.190
And so we'll talk about
many electron atoms,

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:36.660
and then we'll go
on to molecules

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.600
after the many
electron atoms lecture.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.150
OK.
