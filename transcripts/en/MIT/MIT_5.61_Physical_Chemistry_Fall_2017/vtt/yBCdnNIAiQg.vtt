00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.310
ROBERT FIELD: Now if you
looked at today's notes,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.930
you'll notice that they're
very long and very complicated.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.170
And that's not intended
to be intimidating.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.030
It's just to show you the
power of perturbation theory.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.360
So we have talked about
the two-level problem.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.130
The two-level problem is
one that's exactly solved.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.790
It's one of our favorite
exactly solved problems,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.920
although it doesn't seem to
have any physical relevance.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.520
It's just a nice
numerical exercise.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.300
So we can take a two
by two Hamiltonian

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.220
and exactly diagonalize it.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.489
And that's done
using a unitary--

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.800
or actually, in the
case that we looked at,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
orthogonal-- transformation.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.340
And so it's a rotation
in state space.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.820
And the rotation angle
is an explicit function

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.160
of the parameters
in the Hamiltonian.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.830
Now all good things
come to an end.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.020
We cannot do this for anything
more than a two-level problem.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.020
But we can take the formalism
for the two-level problem

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.020
and say, oh, well,
we can describe

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.290
a transformation that
diagonalizes the end level

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.440
problem.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.010
And it has the same
property of being unitary.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.090
But the good thing about it
is it's solved by a computer.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.030
You tell a computer
what the operator is,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.260
and it will diagonalize it.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.510
And not only will
it diagonalize it,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.330
but it will give
you the eigenvalues

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.300
and the eigenvectors.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.640
It gets those eigenvectors by
applying the same two level

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.960
unitary transformation
many, many times.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.760
So if you have a
six-level problem

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.130
or a hundred-level
problem, the computer

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.530
just cranks and cranks
on each two by two

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.000
and does transformations.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.920
And it keeps doing that
until the off diagonal matrix

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.660
element is small--

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.000
remaining off diagonal
matrix element--

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.580
is small compared
to the difference

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.110
in energy between the
eigenvalues it connects.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.550
And so you tell it, I want
this convergence criterion

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.070
to be a part in a hundred
or a part in a million.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.080
And it just does
this and does this.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.620
And eventually, it gives
you the transformation

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.775
and the eigenvalues.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.290
So that means that it doesn't
matter how big the problem is.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.590
You just have to have a
computer that's patient or fast.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.640
And it will crank
out the results.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.640
Now you need to know how to use
the t matrices, or the t dagger

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.770
matrix, because these things
enable you to solve basically

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.130
any problem in time
independent quantum mechanics

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.070
and a lot of problems in time
dependent quantum mechanics.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.110
So there is another
way, and that's

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.950
going to solve an
n-level problem.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.580
And that's the subject of this
lecture and the next lecture.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.830
It's called non-degenerate
perturbation theory.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.320
Now our goal-- well, let's ask.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.710
I'm a spectroscopist.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.984
What do spectroscopists do?

00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:13.224
Now, there's a silly,
stupid answer to that.

00:04:13.224 --> 00:04:14.890
I want something a
little more profound.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.929
Yes?

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:21.160
AUDIENCE: Find energy levels?

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.620
ROBERT FIELD: Yeah,
we record spectra.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.460
We get energy levels.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.470
And we get intensities.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.600
We get all sorts of things.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.450
We could also be working in
the time domain, and we could

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.420
we could be looking at some
kind of quantum beating

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.300
system or some decaying system.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.330
We make these measurements.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.620
But this is not why we do it.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.335
Remember, yes--

00:04:47.335 --> 00:04:49.210
AUDIENCE: All spectra
have buried information

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.030
about the physical
parameters of the system.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.500
ROBERT FIELD: Exactly, exactly--

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.810
that's what's kept me
going for my entire career.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.820
I use the word encoded
rather than buried.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.010
But I like that.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.010
I might start using
buried as well.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.610
Yes, we're not allowed to
look inside of small things.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.260
We're not allowed to
determine the wave

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.280
function by any experiment.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.080
But we are able to observe the
energy levels and properties

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.120
of the Hamiltonian.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.180
And we can regard
the Hamiltonian

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.410
as a fit model, a model where
there are adjustable parameters

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.240
which are the structural
parameters, like the force

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.120
constants and the reduced
masses and whatever

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.210
we need to describe
everything in this problem.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.550
And today's lecture
is mostly going

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.860
to be on the interactions
between normal modes

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.550
of a polyatomic molecule.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.130
Now you might ask, why am I
doing this rather than talking

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:07.351
about just an ordinary,
anharmonic oscillator.

00:06:07.351 --> 00:06:09.850
And the reason is, I'm going
to do that in the next lecture.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.460
And it's in your problem sets.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.380
You're going to do that.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.750
So I'm going to show a little
higher order of information.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.480
So we go from what
we can observe

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.460
to a representation
of it, which we

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.610
call the effective
Hamiltonian, where

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.250
in this effective Hamiltonian
we have determined

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.980
the values of all of
the important structural

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.100
parameters.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.270
And from that, we can calculate
everything, everything

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.390
that we could possibly
observe, including

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.740
things we didn't observe.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.540
So it's really powerful.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.240
It's a way of taking the
totality of observations

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.710
that you're going
to make and saying,

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.090
yes, I have looked
inside this molecule.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.870
And I've determined everything
that I'm allowed to determine.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.100
And I can calculate
the wave function.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.590
The wave function is an
experimentally determined wave

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.260
function, but only indirect.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.390
This is amazingly powerful.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:21.490
And basically, everybody
who deals with spectra

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.860
is doing this whether
they know it or not.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.390
And so I want to be able
to give you the tools

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:35.120
to be able to take any arbitrary
spectrum and extract from it

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.860
the crucial information.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.590
In the last lecture,
we talked a little bit

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:54.430
about matrix mechanics, and
that involved linear algebra.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.040
And you have a wonderful
handout on linear algebra, which

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.400
will give you more
than enough to be

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.100
able to do any quantum
mechanical problem we're going

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.264
to be facing in this class.

00:08:16.264 --> 00:08:17.180
And there is notation.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.680
And the notation is
unfamiliar, and you

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.630
have to learn how to use it.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.850
And so we have for example--

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:34.232
the analogy to the Schrodinger
equation in matrix language--

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:44.155
where we have the Hamiltonian,
an eigenvector, an eigenvalue,

00:08:44.155 --> 00:08:45.760
and this eigenvector.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.760
So it's an eigenvalue
or eigenvector equation.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.040
And this is the form of
the Schrodinger equation

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.860
and we can pretend that it is
the real Schrodinger equation.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.420
And we can use the
standard approaches,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.810
but it's useful to work
in matrix notation.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.120
So we can solve for
the energy levels,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:14.440
and we can solve for basically
all of the eigenvectors.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.890
And our friend is this
unitary transformation where

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.960
t dagger is equal to t inverse.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:30.730
And t times t inverse is
equal to this thing 1111100,

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.455
or the unit matrix.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.560
I thought I saw a hand up.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.880
That was just-- that
was not serious.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:50.540
And so these unitary
transformations

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.750
have this special
convenient property.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:59.150
And we use these
t daggers and ts

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.930
to diagonalize the Hamiltonian.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.090
Now this is just a
little bit of review.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:10.100
So how did we derive the thing
that we are going to solve?

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.950
Well, we took this
equation and we inserted 1

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.490
between the Hamiltonian
and the vector.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.640
And then this is 1.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.380
So we don't need to
put it over here.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.610
And then we left
multiply by t dagger,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.530
and we put parentheses
around things.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:56.020
So this is now what we
were calling h tilde.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.160
And this is c tilde.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.640
And this is now an
equation that says, OK, we

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.950
can transform the Hamiltonian
into diagonal form--

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.060
E1, En, zeros.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.800
And when we have this
in diagonal form,

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:33.540
we can say, well, this equation
is just E1, 100 et cetera.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.980
So for any eigenvalue,
we have an eigenvector.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.740
Now what we'd really
like to know is, well,

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.240
how do we get these eigenvectors
from the unitary transformation

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.475
that diagonalizes H. We don't
calculate this unitary-- yes?

00:11:56.475 --> 00:11:59.700
AUDIENCE: Is that i or--?

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.160
ROBERT FIELD: This is a 1,
this is a 1, this is a 1.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.810
AUDIENCE: I mean in your c
tilde, third from the top.

00:12:09.114 --> 00:12:10.155
ROBERT FIELD: That's a j.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.260
This is a particular
eigenvalue, and this

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.730
is the eigenvector in that.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.370
Now it's easy for me
to get screwed up,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:30.830
and it's easy for you to wonder,
what the hell am I doing,

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.330
until you've done it.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.760
And then it's
completely transparent.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.530
It's really quite simple.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.750
But it's just this
extra notation.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.200
And so it's possible to show--
and I don't want to do it.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.500
I did it last time.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.980
You can show-- and
this is important--

00:12:51.980 --> 00:13:04.280
that this transformation
t dagger c equals c.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.930
Do I want?-- above, above.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:13.810
This is telling you that
the columns of t dagger

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.610
are the eigenvectors.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:20.170
They are linear combination
of the basis vectors

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.970
that correspond to
each eigenvector.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.610
And you can look at this in
more detail in the notes.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.090
Now this is great
because mostly you

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.090
want to know what
the eigenvectors are

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.030
for a particular eigenvalue.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.650
But sometimes, when
you're doing dynamics,

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.030
you prepare, not an
eigenvector, but you

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:52.400
prepare a t equals
0, a basis state.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.950
This is the most
common, doable problem,

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.070
and it's also something that
one does in experiments.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:04.020
You can set up a problem so
that, with a short pulse,

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.020
you prepare the system at
t equals 0 in something

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.320
that's not an eigenstate.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.570
And usually it's a basis state--

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:16.970
it's one of the eigenvalues
of an exactly solved problem.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.550
But your problems are
not exactly solved ones,

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.460
but your experiment
selects that.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.860
And this, not being
an eigenstate,

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.740
needs to be expressed
as a linear combination

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.140
of eigenstates so
that you can actually

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:37.450
calculate this,
which will describe

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.720
how the system is behaving.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.050
And I like asking exam
problems like this

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.790
because it's easy to
get hopelessly involved

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:55.750
in ordinary algebra rather
than just using linear algebra.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:03.750
So if this is the transformation
to the eigenbasis,

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:09.640
then the columns of t are
the transformation back

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.180
to the 0 order bases.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.005
And the columns of t are
the rows of t dagger.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.350
Now why should you care?

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.290
Because you don't know how to
calculate the elements of the t

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:30.260
matrices yet, but that's what
perturbation theory is for.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.360
With perturbation
theory, it doesn't

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:38.540
matter that the computer could
solve for the t and t dagger

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.970
matrices.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.860
But there's no insight.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.000
You just get the numbers.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.270
I like to say that
spectroscopy is not

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.770
about creating archival tables
of observed transitions and

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.720
observed transition intensities.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.000
It's about understanding
how things work.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.770
And so depending on whether
you're doing a time domain

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.280
experiment or frequency
domain experiment,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.060
you're going to want to use
either the columns of t dagger

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.740
or the rows of t dagger.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.780
Now at some point
in your life, you

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.990
have to be exposed to
non-degenerate perturbation

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.440
theory because it
is really powerful.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.640
But it's also incredibly ugly.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.860
So we have a whole
bunch of problems--

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.970
I'll go over here--

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.070
that are related to
the particle in a box

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:47.150
or the particle in an infinite
box or the harmonic oscillator.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.220
And so one of the
things that you might do

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.340
is round off the corners
because physical systems don't

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.110
have discontinuities.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.880
Well, that's going to be a very
modest change to the energy

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.089
levels and wave functions.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:11.970
Another thing you might
do is have a barrier,

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.030
and you could put
the barrier anywhere.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.900
What does the barrier
or an extra well do?

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.285
Or you could do
something like this.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.030
So the particle-in-a-box is a
whole family of problems that

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.780
you could solve using
perturbation theory by saying,

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.310
OK, the extra stuff
is the perturbation.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.660
And we have to work
out the matrix elements

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.850
of the Hamiltonian
that correspond

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.360
to these extra things
and then figure out

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.960
what to do to get the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.690
Now, for the
harmonic oscillator--

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.780
again, you could put a
barrier in the middle

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.020
or you could make it an
asymmetric like almost

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.730
all molecular potentials are,
where this is dissociation

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.420
and this is two closed cells
colliding with each other

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.740
and doing very hard repulsion.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.930
And so that is harmonic
near the bottom,

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.180
but it's not harmonic elsewhere.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.990
And so how do you
represent this?

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:18.610
And the Morse oscillator
is a cheap way

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.610
of generating something
with this shape

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.220
and then doing the perturbation
theory to understand

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.900
how the nonharmonic
aspect of the Morse

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.550
can affect the energy levels.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.200
Or how did the energy levels
determine, say, the association

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.670
energy of this molecule?

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.840
How is that dissociation energy
encoded in the energy level

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.340
pattern?

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:55.050
Now for polyatomic molecules,
if you have n atoms,

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.540
there are 3n minus 6
vibrational normal modes.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.750
Well, how do I know that?

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.590
n atoms, there's 3n
degrees of freedom.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:10.420
There's 3 translations
and 3 rotations.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.570
And so that leaves 3n minus 6.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.250
And all of that is vibrations.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:20.770
So we have many normal modes,
and it's not too surprising

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.470
that, if you stretch
one normal mode,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.770
it'll affect the
frequency of another.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.260
And we'd like to know that.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.480
And so perturbation
theory is really

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.820
valuable for
polyatomic molecules.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.560
And that's the bulk
of the examples

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.880
that I worked in the non-lecture
notes for this lecture.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.745
But there's also dynamics.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:54.540
So you prepare some
initial state of t equals 0

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.080
and you want to know
how it's evolving.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.030
But often that initial state
is an eigenstate of one

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.100
of the exactly solved problems.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.990
And you want to be
able to re-express

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:12.360
that in terms of the
eigenstates of the real problem.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.880
And so you want to know C J--

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.450
I'm sorry.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:32.280
You want to know
J, CJ eigenstates.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.110
So once you have
this, then you know

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.110
how to write the
time dependent wave

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.750
function because you are
dealing with eigenstates

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.639
and they have eigenenergies.

00:20:42.639 --> 00:20:44.180
And so you just
write this thing out.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.580
It's just mechanical and boring.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.390
It's also true that
molecules rotate.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.110
And when they rotate,
there's centrifugal force

00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:01.220
and their internuclear
distances change.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.460
And we can then
calculate how that

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.950
will affect the rotational
energy levels using

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:07.870
perturbation theory.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.610
And then there's
the origin of life.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.700
Gases are not
supportive of life.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.580
You need two particles to
come together and start

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.620
to condense into a liquid.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.150
That's the beginning.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.630
Perturbation theory explains
the long range interactions

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:36.430
by which all gas phase particles
attract each other weakly.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.170
So that's important too.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.140
And so you'll be able
to do all of this stuff.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.310
So here we have non-degenerate
perturbation theory.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:59.490
And it is a mind numbing,
formal derivation.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.385
So we start out with
this rotary equation.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.330
And we say, well, let us
expand the Hamiltonian.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.590
And let's put a
little thing here.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.500
This is our friend.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.660
This is an exactly
solved problem.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:37.080
This is what's new, and this
is what's new and small.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.180
And we could
probably neglect it.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.060
And we do the same thing
to the energy levels.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.160
So these are the energy levels
for the exactly solved problem.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.620
And these are the
energy levels--

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.120
the first order
corrected energy levels.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.710
And these are the second
order corrected energy levels.

00:23:12.002 --> 00:23:13.960
And we do the same thing
for the wave function.

00:23:36.962 --> 00:23:39.420
Now we write the Schrodinger
equation with these three term

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.390
expressions.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:44.010
Now I'm also going
to say, we're never

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.620
going to consider
this one either.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.030
So life is simpler without
them, but in the notes,

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.170
I included them all.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:58.170
And so what we do is now
we write the full equation

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.770
and we sort it into sub
equations corresponding

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:05.250
to powers of lambda.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.850
So the lambda to the 0
equation is really easy.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:19.760
It's just H0 psi 0
is equal to E0 psi 0.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.980
We could put n's on this.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.620
And this is the
exactly solved problem.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.550
It says, yeah, you
build your foundation

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.550
from the lambda to
0 equation, and it's

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:34.990
just what you know already.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:44.240
And what you're going to do is
now use the psi n 0 and en 0

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.470
to do everything else.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.180
The lambda to the one equa--

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.960
well, you might ask,
well, what is lambda.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.030
It's just a mathematical trick.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.490
It has no significance
whatsoever.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.510
It's a smallness
parameter, but it's also

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.360
something where you can
say, these equations

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.800
will be true for
any value of lambda.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.250
And so it's just a way of
separating the equations

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.440
into things that have
a structure that you

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.690
can manipulate.

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.960
People have waxed eloquent
about the meaning of lambda,

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.790
and it really doesn't
have any meaning.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:31.110
So the lambda to the
1 equation-- well,

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:36.360
we collect terms on the left
hand side that have 1 lambda

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.690
and on the right hand side.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.020
And so the lambda
to the 1 equation

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:55.840
is going to be, say, H0
psi 1 is equal to E0 psi 1.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.012
I'm sorry.

00:26:03.012 --> 00:26:04.220
There's more to it than that.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.620
There's four terms.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.910
We're just collecting
the terms that

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:37.930
have 1 lambda on the left-hand
side and right-hand side.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.480
And we've got this equation.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.560
What are we going to do with it?

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.730
Well, one thing we can do with
it is multiply on the left.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.260
Let's just put
some indices here.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:57.740
So we have n, n, n.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:05.360
We're going to multiply on the
left and integrate by psi n 0.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.970
So we're going to
get a bunch of terms.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:41.370
So we will have psi n 0 H 0 psi
n 1 plus psi n 0 H 1 psi n 0.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.990
We have integral, integral.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:51.610
And on the left hand side,
we have E n 0 integral psi n

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:55.930
0 psi n 1.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:28:07.660
And we have E 1 psi n 0 psi n 0.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.600
Well, this is kind
of an ugly term.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.420
It's a psi 0 and a psi 1.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:27.610
But we know that H, when
operating on psi 0, gives E 0.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:44.230
So we're going to get E n 0
integral psi n 0 psi n 1--

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.160
same two over here.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.890
Cancel them.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:57.970
And so we get a simple equation
that is just H1 n n is equal to

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.310
E1 n.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:05.340
So we've gotten now
the diagonal matrix

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.680
element of the
perturbation term is

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.230
equal to the first-order
correction to the energy.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.330
And we can continue.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.930
The algebra isn't beautiful, but
we end up getting the following

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:20.681
equations.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:42.430
We have E n 1 is H 1 nm.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:30:00.030
We have psi n 1 is m not
equal to n psi m 0 H nm.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.420
So what did I do here?

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.060
I said, the wave function--

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.400
we have completeness.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.790
So if we want the first order
corrections to the nth wave

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:31.340
function, we can write this as
a linear combination of the zero

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.350
order wave functions.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.900
And when we do that, we
end up with this formula.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.980
This is the mixing coefficient,
and these are the state-- now

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.436
why do I exclude n?

00:30:42.436 --> 00:30:43.560
Because we already have it.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.110
And then we get the
second-order correction

00:30:53.110 --> 00:31:03.710
to the energy, which is m
not equal to n h n m 1 H m n

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:06.665
1 over En 0.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:11.130
That's it.

00:31:13.689 --> 00:31:14.480
That's all we need.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.010
Now it does say non-degenerate
perturbation theory.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.300
And so it's subject
to the requirement

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:34.250
that H1 n m over E n minus E m.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:46.730
So if the energy
denominator is near 0,

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.110
we know we're in trouble.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:56.120
But for the vast majority
of energy levels,

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.160
this term is much less than 1.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.620
And so that means we can deal
with all of the interactions

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.700
among the non-degenerate
levels in one fell swoop.

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:19.000
Now this is an infinite sum,
and this is an infinite sum.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.910
So we don't like infinities.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.810
But we can say, all right,
here's the Hamiltonian.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.980
It's an infinite Hamiltonian.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.280
And we're interested in
this little corner of it.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.940
And so all of the interactions
among these states with all

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.610
of the infinite
others get subsumed

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.800
into this infinite sum.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.730
It's a small number.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.790
And then we're just interested
in this little subspace

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:57.070
of the energy levels that we're
sampling in our experiment.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.950
So the molecule more
or less tells you

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.280
how to focus on the
part that you care about

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.380
and to get rid of the stuff that
is of no trouble whatsoever.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.242
And it just contaminates the
wave functions a little bit.

00:33:11.242 --> 00:33:13.450
And if you wanted to know
what that contamination is,

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:14.408
you could deal with it.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:23.160
So this is the tool that you
can use to solve, basically,

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:29.790
any problem involving
molecules with a potential

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:34.050
like a harmonic
oscillator at the bottom.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.120
But it's usable
for all problems,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.450
but there's a different
basis set rather than

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.460
the harmonic
oscillator basis set.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.150
So this is your handy dandy key.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.910
And you don't need a
computer, although when

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.950
you see the horrible
complexity that

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.850
will result when you start
dealing with these sums,

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.460
you will say, well, I do
want to use a computer.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.480
But now it's up to me
to organize the program

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.380
so that you can ask
the computer to do

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.340
what you need in a sensible way
and you still get good answers.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:15.850
So in the notes, I'm dealing
with a two-mode molecule.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.030
There are no two-mode molecules.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.190
There's one-mode
molecules, and there

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:27.139
might be three or four
or six or whatever.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:33.739
But the complexity is the
interaction between two modes.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.540
And so we're going
to talk about that.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:53.110
So we have for a
two-mode molecule--

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.199
the Hamiltonian will
consist of Hamiltonian

00:34:56.199 --> 00:35:00.820
for mode 1,
Hamiltonian for mode 2,

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.460
and the Hamiltonian
for modes 1 and 2,

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.960
interacting with each other.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.320
Well, we know these.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.130
These are just ordinary
harmonic oscillator.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.610
And we've got to do
some work on this.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.030
And that's where
perturbation theory comes in.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:21.050
So H12-- and we know,
if this weren't here,

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.660
we know that the
energy levels are

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.930
that some of the energy
levels for the two

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.200
independent oscillators
and the wave functions

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.820
are the products.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:36.260
So even though the energy levels
have two quantum numbers, V1

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:40.520
and V2, and the wave functions
have two quantum numbers,

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.850
V1 and V2, if it
were only this, we'd

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.520
have completely
solved that problem.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.490
But because of this,
there's something else.

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:54.830
So these then turn out
to be the zero order

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.740
states that you use to evaluate
all the integrals here.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:07.100
And we have these and A
and A dagger operators,

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.270
which are enabling us to--

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:17.050
we have the operator
for coordinate

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.300
x is proportional
to A plus A dagger.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:25.160
And this has a selection rule,
delta V of plus and minus 1.

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.170
So we like these
things because we

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.390
don't have to do any integrals.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:35.330
They're all done for you.

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:42.200
And so we're then going to
use these sorts of things

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:48.050
to deal with the most important
terms beyond harmonic.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.910
And so there's a cubic
and there is a quartic.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:37:01.290
And although you
haven't really explored

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:08.220
this, what happens when you
make dimensionless coordinates?

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.100
You factor out something.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.060
And if you have
cubic terms, they're

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.690
100 times smaller
than quadratic terms.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:20.270
And the quartic terms
are 100 times smaller

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.490
than the cubic terms.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.020
And so you don't need
to go much further.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.010
So the cubic terms for
the two oscillators

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:49.340
would be 1/2 K 122 Q1 Q2 squared
plus 1/2 K 112 Q 1 squared Q2.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:53.360
And you could have Q1
cubed, but we already

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.030
deal with that in the
single-mode problem.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.590
So we won't worry about that.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:01.220
So these are the couplings
between modes 1 and 2

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.560
that are cubic.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:13.680
And then we have 1/4 k 112
Q 1 squared Q 2 squared.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:20.040
There's also a Q1 Q2 cubed,
and those terms usually

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.050
are not important
because they mostly

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.590
are dealt with under here.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:25.950
So anyway, these
are the parameters,

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:30.750
and these are the things
that you need in order

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.640
to understand what
this molecule is

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.980
going to do when it's excited.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.680
Now when I was a
graduate student,

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.890
there was a great deal of
excitement about doing what's

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.520
called mode-specific chemistry.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:50.430
Ordinary compounds cost on
the order of $1 a kilogram.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:54.620
But if you could do
mode specific chemistry,

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.290
you could make
things that aren't

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:59.150
makeable by ordinary,
organic chemistry.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.910
And the organic
chemists would love this

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:09.650
because it's a load of garbage
because these guys make

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.150
the modes talk to each other.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:15.770
And so even if you
could excite a pure

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:19.190
overtone or combinational
level, the energy

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.620
moves around the molecule.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:24.100
And that's called
intermolecular, vibrational

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.240
redistribution.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.510
And those there are
processes that you

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.930
could talk about the
primary paths for the energy

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:35.990
to flow and the rates.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:39.530
And that was a major area of
research for the last 30 years.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:41.090
And most people are tired of it.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:47.300
But it started out being IVR,
yeah, anything can happen.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.160
It's statistic or whatever.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.970
But no, only specific
things can happen,

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:57.380
and they're controlled by
these specific coupling terms.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.990
And you could calculate them.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:03.310
Now there's an
interesting other thing.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:09.890
I told you that the first-order
correction to the energy

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:17.000
is equal to a diagonal matrix
element of the correction term

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.345
to the Hamiltonian.

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.820
All of the second-order
terms involve

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.250
squares of matrix elements.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:31.080
The second-order terms
you don't know the signs.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:37.360
If there is a first-order
correction, you get the sine.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.550
And sometimes you
know you want to know:

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:43.780
is the perturbation like that
or the perturbation like that?

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.950
Is there a barrier
or an extra well?

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.754
And this enables
you to know that

00:40:52.754 --> 00:40:54.420
in second-order
perturbation theory when

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.003
you have to square
the matrix element,

00:40:56.003 --> 00:40:59.470
all that information
is concealed.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:03.180
Well, anyway-- so there is
a huge amount of algebra

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:07.400
that's involved in
using these equations.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:14.030
And I don't really want to
go through that algebra.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.650
You can read my notes.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:19.460
I think the chances of you
reading those notes are small.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:24.020
But if I don't lecture on them,
it would be slightly greater.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:28.430
It's a complete treatment
of a two-mode problem

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:31.700
with all of the possible
and harmonic terms

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.500
cubic and quartic.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.950
And everything worked out.

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:38.040
Now the trick is,
you could easily say,

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.070
well, the algebra
is just so horrible.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:40.910
Why would I bother?

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.250
But what you do is
you take these terms

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:57.980
and you sort according
to selection rule.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:09.860
So for example, here we
have a selection rule delta

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:17.680
V1 is plus or minus 1 and delta
V2 is plus or minus 2 and 0.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:24.160
And so there are then six
possible selection rules

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.360
associated with
these sorts of terms.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.840
And what you want to
do is do the algebra

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.720
that combines all this
horrible stuff according

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.400
to selection rule that leads to
simplification of the formulas.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.050
And then once you've
got everything

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:39.820
sorted according
to selection rule,

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.410
then you can calculate
what happens.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:48.210
I can't promise that
I will never give you

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:50.940
a two-mode problem
on an exam, but I

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:54.280
can promise I will give
you a one-mode problem.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.374
And so you want
to really know how

00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:58.540
to do these sorts of things.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.800
So non-degenerate
perturbation theory

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:19.230
works when the energy
denominator is large compared

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.790
to the coupling matrix element.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:28.010
And accidents occur
when you have, say,

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:33.110
a situation where omega
1 is approximately

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:36.420
equal to 2 omega 2.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.390
Now this isn't
just blowing smoke.

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:44.850
This happens an
amazing number of times

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:49.860
because stretches are
higher frequency than bends.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.380
And it's very common
for the bending modes

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:56.070
to be roughly half or
one third the frequency

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:57.736
of a stretching mode.

00:43:57.736 --> 00:43:58.860
And so you get a resonance.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.280
So this is special
because now it's

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:09.140
violating the
fundamental approximation

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.170
of non-degenerate
perturbation theory.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.080
But it's a two-level
interaction.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.930
And so you can say, I know
how to do a two-level problem.

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:19.490
I can solve that.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:24.260
And these resonances have names.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:28.724
There is a Fermi and there
is a Darling-Dennison.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:39.350
The Fermi resonance was
discovered and understood

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:40.490
by Fermi.

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:41.955
And it has to do with CO2.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:54.110
Omega 1 in CO2 is
approximately twice omega 2.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:59.600
The symmetric stretch and the
bend are in Fermi resonance.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.940
So what happens then?

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:12.575
Suppose we have a level
that involves V1, V2, V3.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:23.520
And nearby there is a level
V1 minus 1 V2 plus 2 V3.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:28.100
And because of the
energy denominators,

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.710
these two guys are
nearly degenerate.

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:34.730
So what happens is
one gets shifted up,

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.910
one gets shifted
down a little bit.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:43.975
And they're out of the
expectation of smooth behavior.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:53.230
And it might also be that this
state is what we call bright

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:56.310
and this is called dark.

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.670
This state might be connected
by an allowed transition

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.905
from a lower--

00:46:01.905 --> 00:46:06.300
an initial state
and this might not.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:11.500
So the levels repel
because they're interacting

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.050
and they're out of position.

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.390
And this guy is
supposed to be bright.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:18.210
We're supposed to see a
transition in the spectrum.

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.880
And this one-- well, it should
have been somewhere else.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.400
But we shouldn't see
it because it's dark.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.690
It's forbidden.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:28.290
But because of the interaction
between these two levels,

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:31.050
the eigenstates have
mixed character.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.740
And you get both level
shifts and extra lines.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:39.210
This is called a
spectroscopic perturbation.

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.570
This is the core
of everything I've

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.210
done for the last 45 years--

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.850
spectroscopic perturbations.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:52.770
And so you can learn about
some of these coupling terms

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:56.340
because, instead of
hiding in the forest

00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:02.460
of these small corrections,
you get a big effect.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.200
And it's easy to
observe and it's

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:09.390
easy to determine each coupling
term from these resonances.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:14.500
And the last thing
I want to talk

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.440
about today is a little
bit of philosophy.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:23.150
This is why, among
spectroscopists

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:27.140
or physical chemists,
there are two communities--

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:31.245
communities that like small
molecules and communities

00:47:31.245 --> 00:47:36.990
that like big molecules, because
they're really different.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.960
For the small
molecule community,

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.380
you have this
accidental resonance

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.120
and you get this sort of thing.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:53.800
For big molecules,
you have a resonance

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.690
with a dense manifold of levels.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.020
All of these levels
share, say, the character

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:02.880
of the dark state.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.750
And so they can all
interact with this guy.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:12.990
And so in this case, you
get the main transition

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.670
in an extra line.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:18.789
In this case, if you
have low resolution,

00:48:18.789 --> 00:48:19.830
you get a broadened line.

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:24.390
And if you have high
enough resolution,

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:27.710
you see that there is a whole
bunch of eigenstates under it.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.000
And if it's a large
enough molecule,

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.850
you couldn't
resolve them anyway.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:43.430
And so some people are
always dealing with fast IVR,

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:47.600
fast dephasing of
the bright transition

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.680
into a dark manifold.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.150
And other people
are always looking

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:53.890
at these sorts of things.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:55.840
Now I like these
because they really

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.590
give you a lot of information.

00:48:57.590 --> 00:49:01.440
Now you can get the
information you want from this

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.630
because the width of
this thing is related

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:09.770
to the number of dark states and
their average coupling matrix

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:10.860
element.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.300
That's called
Fermi's golden rule.

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.060
We'll talk about that later.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.030
So I think there's
a pretty good place

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:22.930
to stop because what I
try to do is to show you,

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:26.910
yes, it can be
really complicated.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.880
But it's something
that you can do,

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.290
and you can project out
the coupling constants

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:36.500
that you want in order to
determine the stuff that

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.510
is relevant to your experiment.

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:42.920
But then there is this dichotomy
between small molecules

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.900
where the vibrational
density of states

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:48.890
is always smaller until you
get to really high energy.

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:52.650
And bigger molecules--
now they're not very big.

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:57.422
Benzene is plenty big
for this sort of thing.

00:49:57.422 --> 00:49:58.750
And there is the question.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.450
For example, in
some big molecules,

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:05.770
when you excite an electronic
transition from the ground

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:07.520
state to some excited state--

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.420
so here's S0, S1.

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:15.730
Sometimes you can't see
any fluorescence from S1

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:23.100
because the dephasing is so
fast that there's nothing.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.920
And so it says,
well, tough luck.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.810
You can't do
spectroscopy in emission.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:31.830
But you can still see
the absorption spectrum

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:34.920
because then your signal
is the removal of photons

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.980
from your beam as
opposed to fluorescence.

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:41.430
So there's a huge amount of
photochemistry and interesting

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:47.370
stuff connected with a
large density of states.

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:49.950
And again, when I was
a graduate student,

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:57.450
there was a huge controversy
about non-radiative transitions

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:00.360
in medium sized molecules.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:07.270
And there was one
community that says,

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:12.050
the collisions which transfer
population between levels

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:17.060
are so fast that, in order
to turn off this broadening,

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:20.360
you had to go to
really low pressure

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.850
because then there
wouldn't be collisions.

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:24.860
And the answer,
whenever somebody

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.854
failed to see sharp
spectra, was, well,

00:51:27.854 --> 00:51:29.270
you're not at low
enough pressure.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:36.140
But this has nothing
to do with collisions.

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.990
And that got resolved
by two gentlemen

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:41.880
called Bixon and Jortner.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:46.820
Those are two names that any
educated physical chemist

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:50.150
will know to say, oh,
that's the Bixon-Jortner.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:52.110
And they're still alive.

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:54.010
They're still doing
beautiful stuff.

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:56.510
But anyway, that's all
I want to say today.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:02.030
I will do details on one
mode and Morse oscillator

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.440
in other sorts of
things next time.
