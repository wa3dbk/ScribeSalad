00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.420
BOB FIELD: I'm Bob Field.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.880
This is my 44th year
at MIT, and I've

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.540
taught this course
roughly half the time,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.120
so it is my favorite course.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.490
And I'm a
spectroscopist, and that

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.950
means that I use
quantum mechanics

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.660
almost like breathing.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.450
And I'm going to try to convey
some of the beauty and utility

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.390
of quantum mechanics.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.670
This is not a typical
undergraduate quantum mechanics

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.720
class.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.380
It's not about history.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.960
It's not about philosophy.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.980
It's about use-- use
for understanding

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.130
complicated stuff,
use for insight.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.280
And so a lot of
the material is not

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.860
in the assigned text,
which is a very good book,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.110
but it's mostly a safety net.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.950
The printed notes, all of which
are posted except for a few

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.220
lectures that I'm
still working on--

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.590
and that is the text.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.940
Everything in the notes,
you're responsible for.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.740
There are sections of the
notes which I call non-lecture.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.470
That's explanation of what's
in the lecture or a little bit

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.250
going beyond it.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.260
You're responsible for that.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.470
If I don't finish all the
material in the notes,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.650
you're responsible for the
material I didn't finish.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.570
You can ask me
questions about it.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.280
You can ask your TAs
questions about it.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.390
But there's a
supplementary text,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.140
which is a book
that I wrote which

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.910
is intended to take
undergraduates like you

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.289
to the frontier of
research in spectroscopy.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.010
This is the book that I used to
use to teach graduate quantum

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.690
mechanics.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.510
So I've written a lot of
stuff which is already

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.610
available on the
web, but I just want

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.860
to make sure that you know
the structure of the course.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.880
There are going to be nine
problem sets, always in weeks

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.130
there is not an exam--

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.170
when there is not an exam.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.610
And the problem sets
are worth 100 points.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.380
There will be three
50-minute exams, to which you

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.840
will be allotted 90 minutes.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.370
And they'll be evening exams
and on Thursday nights.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.150
OK, there will be a final
during final exam period.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.910
And so the points for
the course add up to 600.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.650
For each exam, you will be
entitled to bring one 8 1/2

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.110
by 11 page that you've prepared
with as dense or as coarse

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.580
writing as you want--

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.050
a different one page, only
one page, for each exam

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.790
and for the final.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.620
One page-- the exam--

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.330
one page for the exam.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.440
One page for the final.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.440
Not four pages
for the final, not

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.870
two pages for the
second exam, et cetera--

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.370
one page.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.690
I believe that writing these
pages of notes or pages

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.440
of things you should
remember provide structure

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.180
that you actually learn
by preparing this,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.180
and so I stick to this.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.060
My job here is to
force you to suspend

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:02.180
what you expect about the
way matter and light behave.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.960
You expect things based
on your experience

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.680
with macroscopic objects,
and you're very smart.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.720
You're here at MIT
because you are

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.250
able to integrate
those expectations

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.040
and to express them in
mathematical analysis

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.750
of your observations.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.300
So you're pretty good at that.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.730
But quantum mechanics
forces you to step away

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.280
from what you think you
understand perfectly

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.470
because it doesn't apply
in microscopic systems.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:49.600
And so I'm going to destroy your
expectations about how things

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.150
work at the beginning,
and by the end,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.520
I will give them back
to you in the form

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.070
of things called wave packets.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.680
Wave packets are quantum
mechanical particle-like

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.930
objects.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.050
They obey the rules, and they do
a lot of the things you expect.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.420
But initially, you
have to suspend

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.520
that belief in particles.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:21.920
OK, so I'm going to start by
throwing a piece of chalk.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.570
I have to throw it at my TAs.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.720
So here is a piece of
chalk, and the chalk

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.410
followed a trajectory.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.180
If you're a major
league outfielder,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.340
you look at the initial
part of a trajectory,

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.390
and you can pretty much figure
out where you have to go.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.320
This sort of thing would
be the subject of 801,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.450
but the outfielders
don't know physics.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.310
They just have
instincts, and they

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.850
know that if they look at the
beginning of a trajectory,

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.030
they can predict where it
will end and when it will end,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.200
and this is really important.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.980
That's the macroscopic view.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.500
We talk about trajectories.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.610
In quantum mechanics,
there are no trajectories.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.880
We have possibly an
observation of what

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.830
was the initial condition and
what was the detection event,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.580
but we can't describe
what's going on

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.920
by observing, point by point,
the position and momentum.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.960
We're only allowed to do what
we call click-click experiments.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.720
We start something in some
kind of a well-prepared state,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.780
and then we detect what
has happened at the end.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.050
We might do something to
the system in between,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.020
but we cannot observe everything
as the system evolves.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.210
And here, I will
attempt to a little bit

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.810
justify that you need to
suspend what you believe.

00:07:08.609 --> 00:07:09.650
I threw a piece of chalk.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.710
It could have been a baseball.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.920
And suppose now I
said, let's decrease

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.370
the mass of the thrower, the
catcher, and the object by 100.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.000
You pretty much know
exactly what will happen.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.830
Now let's decrease
it by a factor of 10

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:33.290
to the 20, which is like going
from a baseball to an electron.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.760
You think you might know, but
I guarantee you don't know.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.020
And you're going
to be surprised,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.760
and it's because in
the microscopic world,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.750
observation modifies
the state of the system,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.130
and any sort of interaction
of the evolving system

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:58.500
is going to affect
what you observe.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:05.070
And so we have to create a
formal structure, which is

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.420
a kind of measurement theory.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.400
What measurements are
we allowed to make,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.160
and what do they tell us?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.090
Because you cannot observe
the time dependence.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:20.100
You can calculate what the
time dependence is if you know

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:25.890
enough, but you cannot observe
the thing evolving except

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:26.650
by destroying it.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:37.530
OK, so quantum
mechanics is beautiful

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.400
because it describes
the microscopic world,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.140
and it doesn't tell
you you're wrong

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.940
about the macroscopic world.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.170
It matches everything the
macroscopic world does.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.570
OK, some of the key ideas
of quantum mechanics--

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:17.190
so you do a series of
identical experiments.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:26.850
You don't get the same
result. It's probabilistic,

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.170
and that should bother
you because if you

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.640
do an experiment
carefully, you're

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.680
trained to think that
you do it carefully,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.750
you'll get the same result.
But quantum mechanics says,

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:38.740
tough luck.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.093
You can't do an
experiment that carefully.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:53.430
There's also this
wave-particle duality.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.790
You know what particles
are and what the properties

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.260
of particles are.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.910
You learn that in 8.01.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.500
You know what waves are, and
you probably also learned

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.350
that in 8.01 or 8.02.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.040
But you know instinctively
that particles and waves

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.960
behave differently.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.510
But in quantum
mechanics, everything

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.510
is both particle-like
and wave-like,

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.440
and this is also something
that should bother you.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:34.246
And the third thing is
energy quantization.

00:10:45.654 --> 00:10:48.372
Now, I said I'm
a spectroscopist,

00:10:48.372 --> 00:10:51.720
so I live and die by
these spectra, which

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.380
consist of transitions
between energy levels.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.840
And these transitions
between energy levels

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.270
encode everything
we want to know

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.010
about the mechanics
of an object--

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.140
its structure, what it does.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:11.230
And so quantum mechanics
is an elaborate encoder

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.170
of information, and
it's usually encoded

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.746
in the form of these
quantized energy levels.

00:11:17.746 --> 00:11:19.120
And so you're
going to want to be

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.760
able to calculate how the energy
levels or the spectrum that you

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.300
would observe for an object
is related to the thing that

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.560
describes what it can do.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.000
And that's the Hamiltonian,
and the Hamiltonian we'll

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.860
look at in many useful ways.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.530
Now, I just want to
warn you that there

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.590
are two ways of
presenting quantum

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.250
mechanics-- the Schrodinger
picture, which is differential

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.900
equations and wave
functions, and the Heisenberg

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.830
picture, which is
matrix mechanics, where

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:00.330
we have matrices and
we have eigenvectors.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:06.180
And I am an advocate.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:12.260
I'm passionate about the matrix
picture because what it does

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.740
is presents everything in
a way that you can then

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.240
organize your insights, whereas
the Schrodinger picture mostly

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.750
involves solving one
complicated differential

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:28.280
equation after another, and the
focus is on the mathematics,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.280
and it's much harder
to see the big picture.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.790
Now, that means you need to know
a little bit of linear algebra.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.640
Now, most of you haven't taken
a course in linear algebra,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.240
but that doesn't matter because
the amount of linear algebra

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.680
you need to know for quantum
mechanics is extremely small,

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.250
and I will probably present
all of it in lectures.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:55.790
But you will definitely
have the TAs as a resource,

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.500
and it's possible that they
will give some formal lectures

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.380
on linear algebra
or some handouts,

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.240
but it's not complicated.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.370
It's beautiful.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:18.400
OK, so light.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.420
Light is electromagnetic
radiation.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.680
You've heard that.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.390
And it is both wave-like
and particle-like.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.370
Now, the particle-like aspect
of light is going to bother you,

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.520
but it's very easy to
show that it's necessary.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:49.250
OK, so first of all, what are
some wave characteristics?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:59.194
If you have a wave, what
kind of measurements

00:13:59.194 --> 00:14:00.360
are you going to make on it?

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:06.970
OK, Sasha.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.160
AUDIENCE: Intensity
at a point in space.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.610
BOB FIELD: There can be
intensity at a point in space,

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.130
but there could also be
particles that are impinging

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.780
on that point, so you need
something a little bit more

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.330
that is definitely
wave-like, and you have--

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.120
yes?

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.845
AUDIENCE: It has a frequency and
a wavelength and an amplitude.

00:14:25.845 --> 00:14:26.470
BOB FIELD: Yes.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.590
I'm angling for
something more, but it

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.080
does have a frequency
and a wavelength,

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:43.730
and wavelengths are
how you understand

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.630
interference effects.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:57.520
And when you put light through
a lens, there's refraction.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.330
When you put light
on a grating, there's

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.180
diffraction-- or
through a pinhole.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.420
And there's the
two-slit experiment,

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:12.690
where you send light on an
object which has two slits,

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.020
and you can't tell which
slit the light went through.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.870
This is a very beautiful
thing which I will talk about

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.570
in a coming lecture--

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.720
in fact, lecture number three.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:31.500
So the key properties of waves
are refraction, diffraction,

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.190
two-slit experiment.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.160
And behind that is
interference effects.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:50.810
So we can have just a comic
book picture or a cartoon.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:55.730
So here is a wave, and
here is another wave.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:16:01.370
And this other wave has exactly
the same frequency and phase.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.860
And if we add these
two guys together,

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.610
we get something
that looks like that.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:14.150
And in fact, the addition
is a little bit nonlinear.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.280
So we have constructive
interference,

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:26.610
or we can have destructive
interference and anything

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.810
in between.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.950
If we add these two guys,
what you get is nothing.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:36.090
So here, you get an intensified
wave-- constructive.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.640
And here, we get cancellation.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.910
Now, it's a little
bit stressful to think

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.400
that if particles have
wave characteristics,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.072
they can annihilate
each other, so you'll

00:16:50.072 --> 00:16:51.280
have to be prepared for that.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:17:00.580
So quantum mechanics exploits
constructive and destructive

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.240
interference.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.560
That's at the core, and you
have to get used to that,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.599
and you have to get used to
seeing particles do that.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:21.500
OK, so waves have a
frequency and a velocity

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.940
and a wavelength.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.835
And now here, what is nu?

00:17:27.835 --> 00:17:29.330
Nu is c over lambda.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.560
If someone on the
telephone or on Skype

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.200
constantly asks
you "what is new,"

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.880
you can put an end
to that behavior

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.720
by saying c over lambda.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.010
And if you do it often
enough, it'll stop.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.080
It may be that the
question will be rephrased,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:56.030
but it's useful to remember
this as a repellent and also

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.462
as a crucial
organizing principle.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.590
OK, waves are
electromagnetic, and so that

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:11.520
means we have transverse
electromagnetic waves.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.080
And so here is one
part of the wave,

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.380
and here is another
part of the wave.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:27.330
And this is the electric
part of the wave.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:33.540
And so we have zero,
and here is E0.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:41.710
And this is the magnetic part
of the wave, zero and B0.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:46.410
And this is in the xz plane.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.710
This is the z direction.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.510
This is the z direction.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.940
And this is the yz plane.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.550
Now, this corresponds to
a wave which is linearly

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.030
polarized along the x-axis.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:04.400
And so this is-- it's kind
of hard to draw a transverse

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.980
electromagnetic wave, but
there's an electric part

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.210
and a magnetic part.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.855
And for the most part,
I forget about this.

00:19:11.855 --> 00:19:15.150
The magnetic resonance-- this is
the only thing you care about,

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:20.590
but they're both part of light.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.730
And OK.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:30.690
So we have these waves, and
now, the intensity of the light

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:38.070
is proportional to
the E0 squared--

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.430
the electric field squared.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:48.020
And it's also measured in
watts per square centimeter.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.340
And this is in--

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.120
so this is in volts
per centimeter squared.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.610
Now, I'm an old fashioned guy.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.690
I use centimeters
instead of meters.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:03.110
You'll just have to forgive me
for that, not using MKS units.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.230
But the important thing
is that the intensity

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.140
is related to the square
of an electric field.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:18.060
So suppose we have light
impinging on a hunk of metal.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.420
So a metal is something
where the electrons are

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:30.850
free to move around, and so we
like a metal because of that.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.820
We could ask, well, what
happens if we put light

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:39.190
on salt or on some
organic molecule?

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.540
And in some sense, there is
going to be a relationship,

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:51.020
but the easy thing is if we put
a beam of light onto a metal

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.740
and it's pushing the
electrons around.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.040
That's what an
electric field does.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.810
It moves the electrons.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:02.090
And so you would
expect classically

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.700
that at high enough
intensity, you're

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.760
going to start ripping
electrons out of the metal,

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.610
and that would be wrong.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.350
And this is the
photoelectric effect.

00:21:17.271 --> 00:21:18.270
This is what we observe.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:26.490
0-- the current divided by
the charge of the electron.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.400
So that's the number of
electrons per second,

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.930
and this is the intensity.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:37.460
And if we have
infrared radiation,

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:42.820
nothing happens, no
matter how strong it is.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.360
If we have
ultraviolet radiation,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.120
we have something happening.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.320
As the intensity of
the light increases,

00:21:53.320 --> 00:22:00.610
the number of electrons per
second ejected from the metal

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.050
increases linearly.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.120
So why is that?

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.230
We expect that it would be
intensity that determines it,

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:12.580
but it's the color of the
light that determines.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:18.740
We can also do something
like this, where we again

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.060
ask, what is the current divided
by the charge of the electron

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.370
versus frequency?

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.720
And again, we have 0 here.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.330
And what we see is nothing
up until some critical point,

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.010
and then this is--

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:37.700
so this is some special
frequency, which

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.710
is different for every metal.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.650
And then, all of a sudden,
we start getting electrons.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:54.630
And this increases linearly,
or at least for a while

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:56.790
increases linearly
with the frequency.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.250
So there's something about
the frequency of light

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.080
that rips out the electrons.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.060
It has to be above
a certain minimum,

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:12.150
and then the electrons
increase with the frequency,

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.180
but in a little bit more
complicated way than linearly.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.450
And so I have something in the
notes which is not quite right,

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.241
but this onset is important.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:28.360
So these observations
suggest that the electron

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:37.270
is bound to the metal by some
energy which we call the work

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:41.760
function, and it's called phi.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:47.770
And so this is the energy that
it takes to rip an electron out

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.390
of a metal.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.160
And so it's called
the work function,

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.800
and work functions
for metals range

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.420
from a little over
1 electron volt

00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:00.480
to around 5 electron volts.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.870
I'm going to use those units.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.170
Well, you can forget that.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:08.260
But all metals are within
a relatively narrow range

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:16.650
of work functions, and this
is somehow related to nu 0.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.740
So this is an energy,
and this is a frequency.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:26.400
And so we expect that there is
some relationship between nu

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.080
0 and this energy, and there is
some proportionality concept,

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.650
which I can call
anything I want,

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.060
but I'm going to call
it h because it's going

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.010
to become Planck's constant.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.860
That's the
proportionality concept.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:46.900
And so the onset of
ejection of electrons

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.630
is when the
frequency of light is

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.310
greater than the work function.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.635
As I said, every metal has
a different work function.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:11.390
OK, so this is
looking like somehow,

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:20.760
the light does not act in an
additive way on the metal.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.160
It acts in a
singular way somehow.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.640
There are particles of light
that have definite energy.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.400
This is what it
looks like, and we're

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.370
going to call those
particles of light photons.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.510
And so now we're
trying to think of,

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:44.280
all right, electromagnetic
radiation comes as particles.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.650
What are the properties
of particles?

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:59.120
Well, particles-- well, I'm
getting ahead of myself,

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.210
but as long as I
said this, particles

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:07.870
have kinetic energy
and momentum.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.970
Kinetic energy is
a scalar quantity.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.250
Momentum is a vector quantity.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:18.150
And right now,
what we want to do

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:22.770
is measure the kinetic energy of
the electrons that are produced

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.280
by the annihilation of photons.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.910
OK, and so we can imagine
an apparatus like this.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.630
Here is our metal, and
here is the light impinging

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:34.740
on the metal.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.730
And we have grids.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:48.335
We have a ground, and we have
another grid and a detector.

00:26:52.356 --> 00:27:05.230
So we have ground voltage is 0.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.930
Here we have a
voltage less than 0.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.310
Electrons don't like that.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:16.100
But these two grids are
at the same potential.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.890
So the electrons don't
know which way to go.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:25.570
And then there's another
grid where we have

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:29.680
the potential is V plus V stop.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.940
And so what happens is if the
electron is ejected with enough

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.810
kinetic energy to
go uphill and cross

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:46.730
through this potential,
this grid, then

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:51.860
it will make it to the
detector and we'll count it.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.600
So this is just a
crude apparatus.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.650
If you were going to
do this experiment,

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.510
you would probably
design it better.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.720
But the idea is
what we want to do

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.520
is to measure what is
the voltage that we

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.135
apply that causes the electrons
to stop reaching the detector.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.400
And that's the way we
measure the kinetic energy

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.410
of the electrons.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.980
When all of the electrons
stop hitting the detector,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.160
we know the voltage,
the stopping voltage.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.222
And we can now plot
the stopping voltage.

00:28:32.222 --> 00:28:33.120
V stop.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:48.090
Versus frequency.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.160
And here is nu 0.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.770
And what we see is this.

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:59.010
We see that below nu 0, there
are no electrons ejected.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:03.990
Once we're above nu 0,
electrons start being ejected.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.800
And they have a kinetic energy,
which is measured by V stop.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.370
And it increases
linearly with frequency.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:16.570
Now, when we do this
experiment on different metals,

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.450
the slope is constant, the same.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.650
It's universal.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:28.450
So the kinetic energy
of the ejected electrons

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.505
is equal to some constant.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.730
It goes as minus nu 0.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.790
And this is the same
constant that we saw before.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.590
And this is Planck's constant.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:48.010
And now what we've seen is
that these particles of light

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.040
have definite energy.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.050
They have definite
kinetic energy.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:58.300
And we can stop and they
transfer that energy.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.910
And so we can draw an
energy level diagram.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:14.360
So here's 0 and here.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.190
So this is energy.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.550
And this is minus
the work function.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:25.650
And so we have a photon,
which has this energy.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:30.930
And we have the kinetic
energy of the electrons.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:44.120
And this is h nu minus h nu 0.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.010
OK.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.360
This story is complete.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.450
The photoelectron effect
is the easiest thing

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:55.540
to understand at the beginning
of quantum mechanics.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.030
And it says that light
comes in particles,

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.800
which we call photons.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.610
And the energy of
a photon is h nu.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:08.270
h is a fundamental constant.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.800
And we know what nu is.

00:31:13.341 --> 00:31:13.840
OK.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.090
I'm going to talk about
Compton scattering.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:26.620
But Compton scattering
is a little bit harder

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.250
to understand than the
photoelectron effect.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.950
And I'm going to put
equations on the board which

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.120
I'm not going to derive.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.280
They're easily derived.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.910
But this is just to
complete the picture

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:45.850
of the particle-like
characteristic of Planck.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:58.950
So for Compton scattering,
we have a beam of x-rays.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.010
X-ray is a form of light.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.500
It's a very high
energy form of light.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.405
We have a block of paraffin.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:20.520
And what we observe is there
are electrons kicked out.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:30.248
And there is x-ray scattered.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.540
So the experiment is we're
looking for the particle

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.950
characteristics.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:42.770
Particles have kinetic energy
and they have vector momentum.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:48.770
And you have been trained
painfully and completely

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:52.160
in conservation of
energy and momentum,

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.210
because it enables you to solve
all sorts of useful problems.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:02.800
So suppose the x-ray
comes in, hits the block.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.900
And so we have the
incident momentum

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.464
and the x-ray is backscattered.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:22.890
And the scattering angle
theta is measured this way.

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:29.210
So the difference in
momentum for this scattering

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:35.760
is large for backscattering
and much less for forward

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.748
scattering.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:43.865
Now, this momentum has to be
transferred to the electron.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:52.150
And so we can draw
conservation diagrams.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:55.220
Or for this case,
the backscattering.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.470
We have pn.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:05.000
We have the
electron, p electron.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:14.679
And we have the
momentum of the x-ray.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:21.500
OK, so this diagram
determines the momentum

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.620
transferred to the electron.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:33.400
And if the x-ray photon
transfers energy to the--

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.639
it transfers momentum
to the electron,

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:39.040
it also transfers energy.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.929
So what we're going
to see-- and I'm just

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:45.159
going to wave my hands, because
the mathematical analysis

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:49.239
is something you can do, but
I don't want to go through it.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:53.239
I just want to show the
structure of the argument.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:58.940
What you measure
is the wavelength

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:10.980
of the x-ray out minus the
wavelength of the x-ray in.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:16.190
And so if the x-ray
has transferred energy

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:20.420
to the electron, it has
less energy when it leaves,

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.200
and it has longer wavelength.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:27.350
So this is measurable, the
change in the wavelength

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:30.840
of the x-ray, and
that's going to be--

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.615
so we'll call that delta lambda.

00:35:33.615 --> 00:35:35.740
And that's going to be a
function of the scattering

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:36.239
angle.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:44.450
So Compton scattering basically
says, OK, light is a particle.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.050
Particles have kinetic
energy and momentum.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.270
Conservation of
energy and momentum

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:56.690
predicts a difference, a
redshift of the photon,

00:35:56.690 --> 00:36:00.190
which depends on the
scattering angle.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.410
The rest is all 8.01.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.980
You can do that.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.740
OK.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:17.250
And so what you end up finding
is that if the scattering is 0,

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:20.050
then delta lambda is 0.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:22.300
There is no momentum.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.390
The photon just goes through.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.480
If the scattering is
pi, in other words,

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.850
it's perfectly
backscattered, then

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:32.550
delta lambda you
can calculate is

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:39.450
2h over the mass of the electron
times the speed of light.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.780
Now, this quantity,
h over the mass

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:46.260
of the electron times
the speed of light,

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.150
has dimensions of length.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:55.600
And it's 0.02 or 3 angstroms.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:07.340
And this is called the Compton
wavelength of the electron.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.000
Because the photon is
scattering an electron.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.250
The change in wavelength of the
photon is determined by this.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:21.110
This is the momentum transfer.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.270
This gives you the
momentum transferred.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.510
And so this is a
universal constant.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:30.590
It says electrons
have, when they're

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:35.570
scattered out of any
material, have this behavior.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.930
Again, universal and strange.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:42.410
The actual experiment,
since what you actually

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.230
want to measure is the
change in lambda over lambda.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:52.680
The change in lambda doesn't
depend on lambda but this does.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.290
And so what you
want to do is make

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.540
the observable thing large.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.360
And so you go to
a short wavelength

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.320
to make this a large fractional
change that's easily measured.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.750
OK.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.280
The equations are derived
in the lecture notes

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.290
and better in texts.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:14.830
And what I want to do
now is just tell you

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:15.580
where we're going.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:23.860
We've talked about the wave
and particle nature of photons,

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.840
of light.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.820
And the particle
nature is a surprise,

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:34.900
but it's perfectly
understandable and observable.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.940
The next thing we want
to do is determine

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.390
the wave nature of things
that we call particles.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:49.200
And so we're going to do other
kinds of simple scattering

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:55.410
experiments where we discover
that the electron-- so we

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:56.100
have some solid.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:06.030
And we have UV light or x-rays.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.190
And we go through this solid.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:12.620
And it's mostly transparent.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.655
It's mostly free space.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:21.900
And so this light is
interacting with the electrons.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.830
And maybe with the
other stuff that

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.770
is involved in
matter, the nuclei.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:32.540
But the important thing
is that the electrons

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:37.080
that get scattered are in
a kind of a diffuse state.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.700
This is mostly nothing.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:44.110
This material doesn't
scatter x-rays.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.550
It's mostly transparent.

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:55.700
And so an explanation for that
is the Rutherford planetary

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.940
model, where we have a
nucleus with a charge

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.470
and electrons
orbiting that nucleus.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.300
And that's all very nice.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:10.120
It's a way of saying,
well, OK, the electrons

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:14.870
are forced to choose
distances from the nucleus.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:18.259
And there's mostly empty space.

00:40:18.259 --> 00:40:20.300
But then you look more
closely, and the electrons

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.230
are doing this.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.005
They're oscillating
in space, and they're

00:40:23.005 --> 00:40:24.005
going to radiate energy.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:28.980
And this radiation
of energy will

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:31.020
cause the electrons to
spiral in and combine

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.771
with the charge in the middle.

00:40:32.771 --> 00:40:33.645
And that's a problem.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:43.590
And so we have an explanation
for why matter is mostly

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.000
empty space and a conundrum.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.940
The electron should
recombine with the nucleus.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:58.180
So how can matter be
relatively non-compressible?

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:02.630
And the best explanation
is this planetary idea.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.695
But then we have this
thing we have to explain.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.220
Now, there's two
hypotheses for this, which

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.230
are really just ad hoc things.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:22.480
One is the Bohr model where it
says, in order for the electron

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.970
to obey some laws of physics
as it orbits the nucleus,

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.390
it conserves angular momentum.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:39.150
Well, if it were rotating
combined with the nucleus,

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.110
it wouldn't do that.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.320
And so that's sort of OK.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:49.500
And then there's de Broglie,
who was a very smart person.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.290
And he said that in
order for the electron

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:56.010
not to annihilate itself as
it goes around the orbit,

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.900
it has to have an integer
number of half wavelengths

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.560
along that trajectory.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.710
Then it won't annihilate itself.

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:06.690
And that is much better
than Bohr's hypothesis.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.970
But both of these
hypotheses lead

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:12.240
to line spectra
hydrogen where you

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.010
can build a really simple
model and you can predict

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.720
to eight decimal places
all the absorption

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.930
transitions of hydrogen atom.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:26.020
So a very simple model
leads to an incredibly

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.550
powerful and mysterious result.

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:33.650
There is another experiment that
I will talk about next lecture.

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.790
And that is suppose we
have a thin sheet of metal.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:45.030
We have photons,
x-rays, or UV photons,

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.455
impinging on this metal.

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:53.490
There's diffraction
because there

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:58.230
is regular distances
between the atoms

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.470
in the particle in the foil.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:04.860
And so what we measure
is diffraction rings

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:12.780
for the electron
and for the photon.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:19.500
And the diffraction
rings are identical when

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.400
you choose the wavelength
of the particle

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.830
to be equal to the
wavelength of the photon.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.520
And so this is another way of
showing wave particle duality.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.710
We can show that
they have wavelengths

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.410
and we can calculate
to make them the same.

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.450
So this is all very exciting.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:42.950
And this is about as much
philosophy and history

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:46.170
as you're going to get from me.

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:49.840
Once we understand that there
is something that we have to do,

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.570
which is called
quantum mechanics,

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:54.330
we're going to start
solving problems and then

00:43:54.330 --> 00:44:02.750
being able to understand
incredibly complicated effects

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.320
beyond the simple problems.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:11.770
And that should be exciting, but
it should also be a little bit

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:15.700
disturbing, because I will use
a technique called perturbation

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:20.320
theory, which for some
reason all of the textbooks

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:25.780
for a course at this level
either ignore or treat

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.000
in the most superficial way.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.800
But perturbation theory is
a way of taking problems

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.750
that we understand
and can solve exactly.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:41.690
And exactly means an infinite
number of states, all of which

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:45.110
are given to us by
solving one equation.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:49.490
And we can then use them
to understand problems

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.800
we can't solve exactly.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.680
And there'll be several ways
in which I deal with that.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:59.510
OK, so it's time to stop.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:04.730
And I hope you're excited about
what lies ahead, because it

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:09.030
is strange and wonderful.

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:13.530
And it says we can
look inside a molecule.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:14.940
We can make measurements.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:19.030
We can understand what this
molecule is going to do.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:22.760
But we have to develop
our new way of doing that.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.850
OK, thank you.
