00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.810
ROBERT FIELD: When
I was really young,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.350
I used to go to a
television repair store

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.780
as often as possible to take
home one of the dead chassis.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.820
And then I would take it apart.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.770
And I don't know what
I was looking for,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.670
but that was sort of
the empirical stuff.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.610
I had no idea how a
television worked,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.250
but I was really
curious about maybe

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.490
I could find it if
I just did stuff.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.420
And what we've
been talking about

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.730
are ways in which we not
just generate numbers, like

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.630
parts of the television
chassis, but insight.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.000
And there are we've talked
about three ways so far.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.060
And one is Huckel theory,
where Huckel theory is just

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.130
a bunch of simple rules
and simple ideas for how

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.080
do you represent a large
family of related molecules.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.730
And the Huckel theory
is incredibly simple,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.990
but it enables you to
make really sophisticated

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.570
conclusions about
how things work

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.970
and what are the
important factors.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.670
And so it's
basically a procedure

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.180
for distilling insight
from random observations.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.870
Or maybe not random
observations,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.100
but observations
of many properties

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.280
of many related molecules.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.675
Then you've seen LCAOMO.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.550
Based on the small variations
all treatment of H2 plus,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.280
we got the idea of orbitals
and what makes a bond.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.940
And then with the idea
that we can describe

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.720
the size of atomic
orbitals by the energy

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.840
below the ionization
limit, we can

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.430
make similar quantitative
predictions based

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.370
on this minimal basis set.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.700
So we draw molecular
orbital diagrams.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.100
And these molecular
orbital diagrams

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:53.980
are especially valuable for
isoelectronic and homologous

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.180
comparisons.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:06.740
So isoelectronic would be,
let's say, nitrogen, CO, BF.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.220
Molecules with the same
number of electrons.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.414
And homologous would be
something like CO, SIO, GEO,

00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:25.900
and so on.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.210
And with the concept of
orbital size being related

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.150
to the ionization
energy of the atoms,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.660
we can make a lot of
very useful comparisons.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.980
And so we develop insight.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.530
Now LCAOMO is a
variation of method,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.130
and it can be a very
large variation of method.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.720
And it could become of an issue.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.380
But it's usually
not atomic orbitals.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.110
It's just Gaussian
orbitals or something,

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.390
which is computationally
convenient.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:09.620
And so it can be a procedure to
rationalize experience and make

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.350
predictions as you go from
the same number of electrons

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.399
but increasing
polarizability, polarity.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.510
And these-- this is where
you develop chemical insight.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.927
And it's really exciting.

00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:26.510
And it's what was
missing when I would

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.760
take these chassis
from the repair shop

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.980
and chop them up into pieces.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.250
And oh yeah, there's a magnet
in there and things like that.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.540
It's much deeper.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.260
And now perturbation theory
is a kind of a different thing

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.090
altogether.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.480
Perturbation theory says
we do an experiment.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.720
We measure something,
and we turn it

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.730
into something we really wanted.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.090
The Rolling Stones
are telling us

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.740
that if you want to know how
a particular property depends

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.190
on internuclear distance,
and you can't directly

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.580
measure the property as a
function of internuclear

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.800
distance, well maybe
you can measure it

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.420
as a function of vibrational
and rotational quantum numbers.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.570
And that's what
perturbation theory does.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.260
It tells you how to get from
what you observe to what

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.370
you really want to know.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:34.010
And it can be horrible in terms
of the algebraic exercises you

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.120
have to go through in order
to get what you really want

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.110
or from what you--

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.610
yes.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.580
And today's lecture is going to
be an example of not the worst

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.710
thing you could ever do
with perturbation theory,

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.760
but pretty close to the worst.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.730
OK, but all three of the
first things are related,

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.320
are associated with
getting insight

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:11.310
from either a crude calculation
refined against observations

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.790
or just the observations and
reducing those observations

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.550
to something really neat
about how things work.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.215
Then the next two lectures will
be given by Professor Van Van

00:06:24.215 --> 00:06:25.690
Voorhis and it's--

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.360
they will be on ab initio
theory, where basically you

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.010
don't assume anything.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.870
You don't do anything except
solve for the exact energy

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.780
levels and wave functions.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.700
Now this is not possible.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.260
Directly you can do this by
making approximations, doing

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.240
an enormous variational
calculation.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:00.830
Now many people think, well why
bother with approximate methods

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.190
when you can get the truth?

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:11.950
And the answer is the truth is
no more valuable than the parts

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.550
of a disabled television.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.030
It's-- they're stuff.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.340
But there's no insight there.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.290
And quantum chemists who
do these calculations

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.810
are not just generating numbers.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.710
They're trying to
explain how things work.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.050
And it's the same business, it's
just the tools are different.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.990
The goals are not just getting--

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.190
in spectroscopy we can measure
things to 10 or 11 digits.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.990
And nobody cares.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.080
I mean, how many digits?

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.670
It's a little bit challenging
to remember telephone numbers.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:59.180
And having big tables of
10-digit numbers, so what?

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.130
But what do the
numbers tell you?

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.800
And this quest--
the same question

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.620
is asked by good
quantum chemists

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.650
by doing a series
of calculations

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.610
where they turn on
and off certain terms

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.990
in the Hamiltonian.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.940
So it's the same thing.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:23.120
I'm an experimentalist, but many
people who are experimentalists

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.510
think I'm a theorist
because I do weird stuff.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.590
But I'm not a theorist.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.610
Troy is a theorist.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:34.309
And he does weird stuff too,
but he's not an experimentalist.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.549
And we're both after insight.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:41.140
And OK, so let's just--

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.510
I guess I'll just launch
it through the perturbation

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.010
theory.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:51.960
OK.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.150
But you do want to understand
the difference in how

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.810
these different methods, these
approximate methods, work,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.510
and what they're good for, OK?

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:16.700
So the goal of
perturbation theory

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:28.370
is to go from
molecular constants

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.570
to structural constants,
or structural parameters.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.360
Molecular constants are
like rotational constant,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.500
vibrational constant, stuff that
you get by fitting the energy

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.600
levels you observe to a dumb
empirical expression, a power

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.870
series in quantum numbers.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.850
Now there's lots of dumb
empirical expressions

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.190
you could use, and some
are better than others.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.180
And perturbation theory
will often tell you

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.070
what is the right way to do it.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.160
So you go from
molecular constants

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.710
to things in the potential.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.790
So this is the displacement
from equilibrium,

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.650
and we would like
to know something

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.900
about how a molecule works.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.270
And there also might be other
constants, like spin orbit,

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.920
and hyperfine, dipole moment.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.480
And so let's just say
we have some observable,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:39.390
and it is also a
function of coordinate.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.490
And we'd like to know
what that function is.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:49.770
But what we are able to do
is measure energy levels

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.930
as a function of
quantum numbers.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.800
And so the information
that we really want,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.840
the potential or
the internuclear

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.860
distance dependence of some
electronic property, that's

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.610
all gotten from
what we can observe

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.690
via perturbation theory.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.960
It's a very powerful tool.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.570
And it's not pretty,
but it always works.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.050
And it's a good
basis for insight.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:31.460
So perturbation
theory is a fit model.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.700
The other methods, one doesn't
generally do a least-squares

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.530
fit to the--

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.520
of the adjustable
parameters in Huckel theory

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.750
to determine the
properties of a molecule.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.780
One just says, OK,
I'm going to try these

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.460
because I think that attaching
an electro-negative atom

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:07.640
to a carbon atom is going to do
something that I can predict.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.360
And maybe it's going to tell
me some surprises about how

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.210
its influence is not
just where it's attached,

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.250
but other places
in the molecule.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.160
You know this from your
first organic courses.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.230
You know all sorts
of tricks to be

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:25.520
able to predict reactivity
and things that are related.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.710
But Huckel theory
is not a fit model.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.480
LCAOMO theory is
not a fit model.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.130
These are experience-based.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.280
And you integrate
all sorts of stuff

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.440
that you learn from
comparing molecules.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.520
And the comparing
of molecules is

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:51.220
what makes up for the deteriable
lists of the approximations.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.830
And your job is to
hone your insight.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:59.080
And so you have nothing to
protect you except the truth.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.730
You can observe
molecules, but you

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:06.630
can't be guided to something
which is true, because there

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.530
is no calculation.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.350
There's nothing exact and
there's nothing complete.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.640
But in quantum chemistry you can
get really close to the truth.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.142
But you don't know
anything about why.

00:13:19.142 --> 00:13:20.600
And so you're doing
the same thing,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.400
but from the opposite ends.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.460
OK, but perturbation
theory is special

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.360
because you take a
huge amount of highly

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.380
accurate experimental data of
various types and you fit it.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.140
And so I want to
talk about this.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.650
So you have the Hamiltonian.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.720
It's a matrix,
and it's expressed

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.640
in terms of parameters.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.380
Let's just use
notation p, p of i.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.270
A set of parameters.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.030
So this is not a quantum
chemical, Hamiltonian.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.510
It's a thing where we say there
are certain degrees of freedom,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:07.160
and each one is controlled
by a number of parameters.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.150
And we have the energy levels.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.370
And so what you do
is you say let's

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.070
choose a set of
these parameters,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:26.480
and calculate the energy
levels, and compare them

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.070
to the observed energy levels.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.970
And it's not-- the first try,
it's not going to be good.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.960
And then you say, OK, now I've
got to do a least-squares fit.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.680
I have to vary the parameters
in this matrix Hamiltonian

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.310
to match the energy
levels and maybe

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.710
to match other things that you
can observe in the experiment.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.250
But it's a complicated
least-squares fit,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.850
because you have a matrix, and
you want to diagonalize it.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.760
How are the parameters
related to the eigenvalues

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.370
and eigenvectors?

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.590
You don't know.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.840
But when you're close, then you
can start fitting these things.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.670
Then you can say, yeah, I know.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.720
And then once you've done
that, you have not just

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.870
the energy levels, but you
have the wave functions.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.930
Now again, you don't know
that there is something

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.750
missing in your Hamiltonian.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.700
But you know that
from the data you

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.674
input you can match
all the energy levels.

00:15:33.674 --> 00:15:35.340
But you didn't put
it in all the levels.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.890
You put in just the
ones that you measured.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.390
But you are arrogant.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:45.200
And you think, well, maybe
I measured more than I--

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.490
I determined more
than I measured,

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.300
that I can extend the
measurements to other things.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.970
And I told you at the beginning
of the course you cannot

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.500
observe the wave function.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.260
But if you do this, if you do
a least-squares fit and match

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.640
the energy levels, you have a
pretty darn good representation

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.980
of the wave function.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.770
And you can use that to
calculate other stuff,

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:11.745
especially dynamics.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.200
Remember dynamics, at
least if the Hamiltonian is

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.410
independent of time,
the dynamics is going

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:26.660
to be a function of x and t.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:32.100
But you start with the
initial preparation.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.800
If you know that, then you,
because you know the energy

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:43.300
levels, you can calculate
the full x of t for all time.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.820
So that's pretty powerful.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.860
If you fitted enough stuff,
if your Hamiltonian has

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.620
the important things
in it, then you

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.050
are basically able to
do anything you want,

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.530
whether it's static or dynamic.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.460
And if the Hamiltonian is time
dependent, you can do that too,

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.930
I just haven't
showed you how yet.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.650
OK, so I really like
perturbation theory,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:17.089
because it directly that deals
with whatever data you have.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:21.130
And out from that,
you get this thing

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.720
which tells you everything,
unless there's something

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.560
that you didn't sample, that you
didn't know you didn't sample.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.070
And then you discover that
your data and the predictions

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.660
are not in agreement.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.930
And then that's when you--

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.940
you don't go home and
say, oh, I screwed up.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.040
I got to go take a nap.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.500
I don't-- you go home and
you say, let's celebrate,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.800
because I discovered something
that was really missing.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.730
And that's what we want to do.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:54.150
OK, so I have to mess
around in the mud here.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.790
Because the perturbation
theory you've

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.880
done so far has
been, perhaps, ugly,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.820
but it's been kind of
simple because it's

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.580
basically vibration.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.200
And now we've got
vibration and rotation.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.320
And we have to combine
the two, and we

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.250
have to see whether there's
something special that we

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.900
can get from the combination.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.880
And you bet there is.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.170
OK, so we're going
to look at the energy

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:27.180
levels of a non-rigid,
non-harmonic, or anharmonic

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.260
oscillator.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.260
And we're going to find
out how we generate

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.550
from an expression of
the potential energy

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.980
surface or potential
energy curve,

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.460
because what I'm going to be
talking about is diatomics.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.700
But it all extends
to polyatomics.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:50.520
And we're going to
calculate the relationships

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.980
between what you observed
and what you want to know.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:59.010
So for a diatonic molecule,
we have a dumb representation

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:03.090
of the quantum numbers.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.820
And we can write it.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:09.030
And I'm just really
a stubborn person

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:16.280
about spectroscopic notation,
so I include this Hc convert

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.790
wave number unit, the reciprocal
centimeter units to energy.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.220
But you'll never catch
me doing it in real life.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.210
But that leads to all
sorts of algebraic errors

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.760
that I don't know I'm
making because I'm

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.460
so unused to doing this.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:37.670
OK, so we have an expression for
the vibrational energy levels.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.770
And I can't apolo--

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.060
I can't explain why
we use four letters

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.350
to represent one symbol, but
that's the traditional thing.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.130
And for polyatomic
molecules, which

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.500
came after diatomic
molecules, we

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.270
start using only two letters.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.990
Instead of omega
XE, we just use XE.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.910
But since I'm a diatomician, I'm
going to do this sort of thing.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.780
And that's v plus 1/2 squared.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:14.560
And then the next term is
omega YE v plus a 1/2 cubed.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:24.630
OK, and so then that's
the vibrational part.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.730
And then we have
the rotational part.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:31.170
The equilibrium internuclear
distant rotational constant

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.880
minus alpha e times v plus 1/2.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.370
Times JJ plus 1.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.340
And then minus DE, the
centrifugal distortion

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:57.410
constant, times JJ plus
1 quantity squared.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.750
And we can have
more constants here.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.520
We can have additional
constants there.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.920
But basically we
have constants, which

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.850
are known by multiplying
a particular combination

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:13.900
of vibrational and rotational
constants, quantum numbers.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.630
And so these are the
things we can determine,

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.640
or sometimes we
determine some of these

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.640
and we want to get a
prediction of the others

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.436
because they're outside
of our observation.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:38.210
And the potential is going to
be dependent on the displacement

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:42.540
from equilibrium and
the rotational constant.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.050
And so there will be
terms in the potential,

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:57.690
like 1/2 KQ squared plus
1/6 AQ cubed, et cetera.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.400
So we have another
dumb power series.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.880
And fortunately, we
know that as we go up

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.640
in the displace-- in this
displacement coordinate,

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.700
the coefficients get
to be really small.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.210
And so we don't need to have
a lot of these parameters.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:22.420
But we should have at least two,
the harmonic and the cubic one.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:27.670
And we know for molecules
the cubic parameter gives you

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:32.450
a potential curve,
which resembles reality.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.960
It's hard wall here,
soft wall there.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.790
Molecules break.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:42.380
Now this has the unfortunate
property of doing that.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.880
And so it's got
death built into it.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.320
But it doesn't really
matter, because you basically

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.190
are looking at increasingly
wide regions of the potential.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.410
And the fact that it
does something terrible

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.960
in your simple representation
is almost irrelevant.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.380
But you have to
be aware that you

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.400
can tunnel through barriers.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.470
And when you start being able
to tunnel through barriers,

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.480
and it depends on how close you
are to the top of the barrier

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.230
and how wide it is, then
you start seeing effects.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:18.970
And then this term is
going to give nonsense.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.000
But there is a
domain of goodness

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.190
where you don't have
to worry about that.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.100
So we have this,
and then we have

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.330
the rotational constant
kind of contributing

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:43.270
to the effect of potential,
which is HCV of R JJ plus 1.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.010
Now here I've got--

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.560
here I have coordinates.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.810
Here I have quantum numbers.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.205
How can I do that?

00:23:51.205 --> 00:23:58.960
It's because central force
problems can be represented

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.880
in a universal form.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.150
And so we can just integrate
over the angular part

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.790
of the problem.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.400
And so now we have a
mixed representation.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:17.200
But this guy is still a function
of R or Q. And so this v of R

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.090
is an operator.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.740
It's not just a constant.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.521
Some people call it the
rotational constant operator.

00:24:24.521 --> 00:24:25.145
Kind of stupid.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.500
And so our job is
now to figure out

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:38.330
how to get from this
parameter rise potential

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:39.270
to the energy levels.

00:24:42.309 --> 00:24:44.100
Of course, we start
with the energy levels.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.410
And we're going to want to
determine the parameters

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.480
in the potential.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.450
But you've got to
have that connection.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:25:00.220
So this rotational operator has
some constants in front of it.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.870
And this is in wave
number of units,

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.000
because I'm a spectroscopist.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.070
And we have the vibrational
frequency, 1 over 2 pi C. K

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.620
over mu square root.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.970
Also in wave number of units.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:31.520
Now the first problem
is we don't like R,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.370
because harmonic
oscillators are expressed

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.620
in terms of displacement
from equilibrium.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:43.841
And so we know that Q
is equal to R minus RE,

00:25:43.841 --> 00:25:49.790
or R is equal to Q plus RE.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.990
So we want to replace
this operator R by this,

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.250
an operator plus a constant.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:02.800
So 1 over R squared
can be expressed as 1

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.930
over RE squared, the equivalent
internucleus, plus 1 over Q

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:09.690
over RE.

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:15.650
Plus [INAUDIBLE] squared.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.680
So this is the power
series expansion,

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.662
but we only keep the
first term generally.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.540
And so now we're
ready to go to work.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.830
And we can say we have
B as a function of Q

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:39.670
is equal to B of E, the
equilibrium value 1 minus 2Q

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:47.940
or RE plus 3Q squared
over RE squared.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.490
And there's more terms,
but this is enough.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.566
You bet it's enough.

00:26:53.566 --> 00:26:54.940
By the time this
lecture is over,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.250
you're going to want not
ever to see this stuff again.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.140
OK, so we have now
a representation

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.720
of the rotational
operator in terms

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.390
of a constant term, a linear
term, and a squared term in Q.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:13.880
And we know how to do matrix
elements of Qs, right?

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.660
So we know we're in business.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.880
And we have the potential as
another power series in Qs.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.770
So everything is going
to come together.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:28.050
It's just going to be will the
migraine wipe out your ability

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.900
to pay any attention to
this after we're done.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.810
OK, so I don't want
to cover that up yet.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:42.390
So we know that this
displacement operator

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:47.430
can be replaced by the creation
and annihilation operators.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:56.820
And so we have 4 pi C,
mu omega E square root.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.190
A plus A dagger are friends.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:03.140
These guys, we hardly
need to take a deep breath

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.710
to know what to do with those.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:14.730
And so we're going to want
to express all of the--

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.930
all of the actors here,
these guys and those guys,

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:24.660
in terms of expressions in
the creation and annihilation

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.350
operators.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.040
So for the rotational
constant expansion,

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:34.370
we're going to need
something like 2Q over RE.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.870
And that, after a
little bit of algebra,

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:48.300
is 4BE over omega E square
root times A plus A dagger.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:54.250
And we need 3Q squared
over RE squared.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:29:05.030
And that's going to be 3BE
over omega E, A plus A dagger

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.640
squared.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.450
So all of the terms
can be expressed,

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:15.500
can be reduced to constants
that we care about,

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.340
or that are easily measured,
and these powers of As

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.500
and a daggers.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.340
Now this is-- you have
notes, printed notes.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.200
And I'm following
them pretty well,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:34.480
although there are a few
typos, which I hope to correct.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:43.810
And so we do a similar
thing for the terms here.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.476
And we're only going to keep--

00:29:45.476 --> 00:29:46.850
we're only going
to look at this.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.730
We're not going to go to Q 1/4.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.540
But this is bad enough.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:56.030
OK, and this is part of
the zero order Hamiltonian.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:30:00.700
So we're going to
have another term,

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:08.960
and that's going to be
1/6 little a Q cubed.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.065
OK, so that's-- little a is
the anharmonicity parameter.

00:30:13.065 --> 00:30:13.940
And what is its sign?

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:22.560
Can we know its sign
from experiment?

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.960
You said yes.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.816
Why do you say yes?

00:30:25.816 --> 00:30:27.001
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:27.001 --> 00:30:28.000
ROBERT FIELD: I'm sorry?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.788
AUDIENCE: It's
cubed, so it's odd.

00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:32.860
So there's [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.810
ROBERT FIELD: The
only way you know

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:40.730
the sign of an off diagonal
matrix element is--

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:45.950
I'm sorry, is if there is a
diagonal element of it that

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:51.030
can be put into the E, the first
order correction to the energy.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.590
As soon as you have
to square it when

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:56.160
you do second order perturbation
theory, you've lost the sign.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.780
But here we know the sign
because of physical insight.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.840
We know that this kind of a
potential would be nonsense.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:13.045
So we know that A has a
sign and it's negative.

00:31:13.045 --> 00:31:23.180
OK, so we have a over 6
times our favorite parameter

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:30.420
here to the 3/2 power times
A plus A dagger cubed.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.270
Now this is something--

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:35.690
you do the operator
algebra before you launch

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.740
into a horrible calculation.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.220
And so we know how to
do this in principle

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:44.900
to reduce this to a
simple expression.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.080
And now we take this
part, this thing,

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.040
and we're just going to call it
capital A. Because we want it--

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.320
we don't want to
clutter up what is going

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.600
to be a terrible thing anyway.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.960
And we can always convert back
to the little a at the end

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.850
if we need to.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:11.450
OK, so now I've set the stage.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.940
I'll leave this for a while.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.420
That really is-- as you know,
I really love revision theory,

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.750
because it's the tool
that I use all the time.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:29.440
And it's a
psychological condition

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.100
that is not curable, all right?

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.440
So what do we want?

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:41.480
We want E0 as a
function of E and J.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:48.880
And that's just the J H0 VJ.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:33:00.540
And we know that HC will make
EB plus 1/2 plus HCBEJJ plus 1.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.311
OK, well this goes in
the energy denominators.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.800
And so that's good,
because we need

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:17.380
energy denominators as well
as the zero order energies.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:23.970
Right now we need to know the
bad stuff, the thing that's

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:25.920
outside of the zero
order Hamiltonian,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.170
which is everything.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:38.730
And so we have this is HC
times BE JJ plus 1 times--

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.930
I'm sorry, I have to erase this.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:54.116
Minus BE over 4BE
over a big E square

00:33:54.116 --> 00:34:03.470
root times A plus
A dagger plus 3 BE.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:18.010
3BE over omega E times A plus
A dagger quality squared.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.639
So that's the rotational part.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.840
And then we have the
vibrational power,

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.330
which we have A, A
plus A dagger cubed.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.920
OK, so now we look at
this thing and we say,

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.679
oh well, this has matrix
elements delta V equals

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.239
plus or minus 1.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:47.889
And this has delta V equals
plus or minus 2 and 0.

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:55.711
And this has delta V equals plus
and minus 3 plus and minus 1.

00:34:55.711 --> 00:34:58.660
We always want to sort things
according to the selection

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.960
rules, because we always
combine the things

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.830
with the same selection rules.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:09.040
And it's best to do
that at the beginning

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.050
rather than somehow trying
to do it at the end.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.020
Because if you have the
same selection rule,

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.190
you have cross terms.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.950
And that's really important.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:24.210
The cross terms are where a
lot of good stuff happens.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:32.970
OK, so we know E0.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.740
And we would know E1 if
there are any off the--

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:42.930
there are any diagonal matrix
elements of this operator.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.430
This should be a plus as well.

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:50.660
So this is H1.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.740
And this doesn't have
any diagonal elements.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:59.750
And this doesn't have
any diagonal elements.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.480
But this one does.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.780
And it's actually
something you encountered,

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.010
I think, on exam two.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.380
I'm not sure, but you've
certainly encountered

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.470
the diagonal element of this.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:18.880
And so if we look at A
plus A dagger squared,

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.840
we get A squared
plus A dagger squared

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:30.110
plus 2 number operator plus 1.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:33.130
And that's diagonal.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.520
So we have a diagonal
element, and that gives us E1.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:37:03.640
So E1 of E and J is HC6BE
squared over omega E times J, J

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.930
plus 1, B plus 1/2.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:16.110
OK, well that looks
pretty good, because this

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:18.240
is the coefficient of--

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.250
we have an expression
for the energy levels,

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:28.110
which includes the
E minus alpha E, B

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:35.020
plus 1/2 of times JJ plus 1.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.360
So we have a term that involves
B plus 1/2 and JJ plus 1.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.650
And it has a name.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.450
Alpha minus alpha.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:46.840
And here we have a
term which has those,

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.700
that quantum number dependents.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.810
And it has a value.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:56.660
And so it's telling
us that alpha E,

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.370
and I'll put on this
harmonic oscillator,

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:06.250
is equal to minus HC6BE
v squared over omega

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.830
E. One constant.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:26.220
Now it's also telling you
that B of E increases with V.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.970
And for a harmonic
oscillator, you

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:35.290
have an equal lobe at each
turning point, the largest

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:35.790
lobe.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:39.020
But they're equal in magnitude.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.770
So one can ask, at
the inner turning

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:48.340
point is the change in
the rotational operator,

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.120
or is it larger--

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:58.210
is this change in BE larger
relative to the equilibrium

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.760
value, or is this larger?

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.980
And the answer is we're
talking about 1 over R squared.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.830
And 1 over R squared gets really
large at small r as opposed

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:15.450
to getting smaller at large
R. And the amount of change

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.040
is much greater at small r.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:23.610
And so that causes the
effective rotational

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.280
constant to increase.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:30.610
But we know for a harmonica--
for an anharmonic oscillator,

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:34.580
we have a small lobe
here and a big lobe here.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.100
And so we expect
that there's going

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:41.870
to be a battle between the
harmonic contribution to alpha

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:44.490
and the anharmonic contribution.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:47.980
And we expect that
this is going to win.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.710
Why?

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:53.180
Because every time
anybody measures alpha,

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.570
it's a positive number.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:40:00.830
And that's why it was expressed
in the formula, which I've

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:07.220
concealed, with a negative sign,
to take into account that alpha

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.460
is always--

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.580
the contribution
is always negative,

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.584
and so alpha is always positive.

00:40:13.584 --> 00:40:14.750
Yeah, and these things are--

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.150
it's historical.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.400
But anyway, so we
have a contribution

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.380
which has the wrong sign.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.170
And we know we're going to
get another contribution

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:31.350
from the interaction between
the rotation and the vibration,

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:35.360
and that this is going
to make things right OK.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.950
And it comes from a term.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:39.450
OK.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.475
All right, there's no way
I can make this simpler.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.860
Just have to bear
with me and I will--

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:06.170
so we have delta V equals
plus and minus 1 matrix

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:16.080
elements from both the A
plus A dagger and the A

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.170
plus A dagger cubed terms.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:30.240
And we have-- we have this in
both the anharmonic expression

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.570
and in the rotational
constant operator.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.970
We know what these--

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:37.810
how these things work out.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:48.160
And so delta V equals plus
and minus 1 terms from the A

00:41:48.160 --> 00:42:00.270
plus A dagger cubed V
plus 1 and V, V minus 1.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.130
So we can work these things out.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:10.720
And this one is 3V
plus 1/2 to the 3/2.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:17.170
And this is 3V
plus V to the 3/2.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:19.440
So all of this stuff,
you want to simplify it

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.780
as you go but it.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:29.002
And these come from
the A term, the A,

00:42:29.002 --> 00:42:33.820
A plus A dagger cubed' term.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:37.390
We don't have a term that's
linear at A plus A dagger

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:41.470
from the anharmonicity,
but we do--

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:44.500
and we do have a
squared term, but that's

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.620
the harmonic correction.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.130
So we start here, with
A plus A dagger cubed.

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:54.800
And then we're going
to want to look

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.120
at the delta V equals plus
or minus 2, and delta V

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:03.290
equals plus and minus 3 terms.

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:05.340
And there's lots of algebra.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:06.580
You can do all these things.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.580
There's nothing
challenging here.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:11.600
It's just how do you keep
this stuff that you derived

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.760
that you're going
to need in a place

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.760
that you can find it again,
because the pages just

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.290
get filled with garbage.

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.790
OK.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:26.620
So the best way for me to do
this is to write the results

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:31.150
in the next-to-the-final step,
and then in the final step,

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.670
and show what goes to what.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:45.620
So the second order correction
is a function of EJ.

00:43:49.180 --> 00:44:00.070
We're going to have terms that
involve the delta V equals

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.810
plus or minus 1.

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:06.540
And we're going to get that
from the cubic correction

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:10.270
through the harmonic oscillator
and the linear correction

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:12.354
to the rotational concept.

00:44:12.354 --> 00:44:14.020
So we're going to get
an expression that

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:14.710
looks like this.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:23.170
B squared minus
2AB plus A squared.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.310
So this is a B term.

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:29.150
This is the anharmonic term.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:30.130
We have a cross term.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.540
There are going to be three
terms in this expression.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.450
OK, and so let's do that.

00:44:39.555 --> 00:44:40.430
How much time I have?

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.390
Not very much time.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:43.056
Well that's good,
because you won't have

00:44:43.056 --> 00:44:44.560
to watch much more of this.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:51.020
OK, so we have the
HcBe JJ plus 1.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.180
And this guy is
squared, because we're

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.160
doing second-order
perturbation theory.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.880
This is just the B term squared.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:08.000
And then we have
4BE be over omega E.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.380
And then we have the delta V of
1 and minus 1 matrix elements.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:25.520
V plus 1 over minus HC omega,
and V plus V over HC omega.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.980
We have the energy denominators,
two energy denominators

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:31.400
of opposite side and
similar identical magnitude.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.230
And we always do that because
then the algebra is simple.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:38.360
If we do-- we fail to do
that, you might as well just

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.610
go to a booby hatch right
away, because there's just

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:42.950
no way you're going to
retain your sanity if you

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:48.150
don't combine the terms of delta
V plus 1 and delta V minus 1.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:54.100
OK, and this is the first term.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:59.230
And there is the next term in
this sum, which is the AB term.

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:06.190
And so we have a minus
2 times HCV JJ plus 1.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.820
And it's not squared, because
it's one B and one A term.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:26.630
And so we get 4BE over
omega E square root.

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:27.700
And then the A part.

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:38.200
And we get 3B plus
1/2 to the 3/2 times

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:48.500
V plus 1/2 to the 1/2,
or minus HC omega E.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:55.220
And then the other term, which
is 3V to the 3/2, V to 1/2,

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:59.100
over HC omega E.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.010
We have to combine
these two terms.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.720
And the combination is easy.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.590
And then there is--

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.990
so this term number two.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:10.580
And number three is the
squared anharmonic term.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:14.570
So I'm going to skip it,
since I'm basically done.

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:17.070
There's just a lot
of garbage like this.

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:23.840
And at the end, we have an
expression, term by term,

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.670
which simplifies.

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:32.480
And we get the second-order
correction to the energy, VJ,

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:42.520
is equal to minus HcBe
cubed over HC omega.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.200
No, not HC.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:58.960
Just over omega E squared
times JJ plus 1 squared.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.290
Well this is nice, because we
have a term that just involves

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:08.530
J, and it's negative, that
says as a molecule rotates,

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:15.050
the molecule stretches, the
rotational constant decreases.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:17.440
This is called
centrifugal distortion.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.960
And this is a very
famous expression

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:32.440
that DE is equal to 4BE
cubed over omega squared.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.500
I left out a 4.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.150
So this is the
Kratzer relationship.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:40.930
And that turns out to be
of the most valuable ones,

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:45.590
because the
centrifugal distortion

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:50.760
constant is extremely
sensitive to contagion.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.200
If there is a perturbation,
if there is something missing,

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.280
this centrifugal
distortion constant

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.050
will have a crazy value.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.750
And if it doesn't ever--
if there's nothing wrong,

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.000
then it will say,
well, OK, I can--

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.600
if I know something
about B and omega,

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:15.720
I can determine how the
rotational energy levels get

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.960
closer together
as you go up in V.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.080
And if you have only a
pure rotation spectrum,

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.910
then you actually--

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:25.530
where you're not
sampling anything

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:28.050
having to do with
vibration, you actually

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:32.250
can determine the
vibrational constant

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.790
from the centrifugal distortion.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:38.380
And I should tell you
that spectroscopists come

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.110
in families, or they used to.

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:45.670
Pure rotation, infrared
vibration rotation,

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:48.400
electronic vibration
rotation, electronic.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.910
And so the microwavers, who
really have only rotation

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.610
to look at, are
kind of deprived.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.970
And they just
don't know anything

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:59.470
about electronic
degrees of freedom.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.530
But they know how to get
the vibrational frequency

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:07.530
from the rotational spectrum,
which is kind of nice.

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.210
Gives them something to do.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:10.930
And there's more terms.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:13.800
And we're really done,
but it's all in the notes.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:24.700
And so what we get is for the
constant OAEXE, and center

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:29.190
of distortion, and
alpha E and beta, which

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:34.290
is the vibrational distortion
of the centrifugal distortion

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:40.800
constant, we get all these
in terms of omega and B.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:47.050
So it's a nice closed
set where you get the--

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:51.780
you're able to predict how
certain constants depend

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:56.370
on the most fundamental
ones, omega E and BE.

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:57.900
That's kind of neat.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:03.310
And it's both a way of
extending your observations

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.230
and telling well, there's
something missing,

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:09.330
because these constants
aren't coming out right.

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:12.210
It's also a subject of
great consternation.

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:16.860
Because if you're a quantum
chemist, what you do

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:24.520
is you determine a lot of stuff
by derivatives at equilibrium.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.320
The derivatives, the
potential at equilibrium,

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.810
are basically telling you
the shape of the potential

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:33.500
at moderately low energy.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.940
And it also turns out to be
something with modern quantum

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.440
chemistry.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.195
You can get all these
derivatives pretty accurately.

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:45.990
The trouble is measuring
derivatives here

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:49.160
and using the energy
formulas gives you

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.050
slightly different
values from what you

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:52.590
get from perturbation theory.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.100
So what we have
is two communities

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:59.410
who are very sophisticated
using the same names

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:02.370
for different quantities.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.360
It's dangerous.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:09.790
And it's also not understood
by the two communities.

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:11.650
And so people are
struggling and struggling

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:14.850
to get agreement between
experiment and theory.

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:18.340
And it's apples and oranges,
but it's a subtle thing.

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:22.180
OK, so that's basically
all I want to say

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:23.771
about perturbation theory.

00:52:23.771 --> 00:52:26.020
I will have one more lecture
dealing with perturbation

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.020
theory, and that lecture
is on Van der Waals

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:33.200
interactions between molecules
and why we get liquids.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.750
OK.
