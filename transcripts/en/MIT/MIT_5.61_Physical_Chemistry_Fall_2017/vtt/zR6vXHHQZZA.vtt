00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.240
ROBERT FIELD: This is the first
of two lectures on spectroscopy

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.590
and dynamics.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.130
Now, I'm a spectroscopist,
and so this is

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.160
the core of what I really love.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.910
And there are a lot
of questions about,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.990
well, what are we trying to do?

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.430
And you heard two lectures
from Professor Van Voorhis,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.270
and he talked about ab
initio calculations--

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.480
electronic structure
calculations--

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.210
where you can get really
close to the exact answer.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.510
And it's really a powerful tool.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.140
And it gets you the truth.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.840
But it gets you so
much truth that you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.280
don't know what to do with it.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.150
And the same thing is
true for spectroscopy.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.150
You get a spectrum.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.450
It contains a huge
amount of information.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.640
And you can take lots
and lots of spectra.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.050
But what are we trying to do?

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.880
When I was a
graduate student, we

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.290
were doing a unique super
high resolution spectroscopy.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.970
And so we thought what
we were generating

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.630
was excellent tests for
quantitative theory.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.880
And if, in those days, I went
to a lecture by a theorist,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.420
they were saying,
we're generating stuff

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.690
to check against experiment.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.750
And it's a circle, and that's
not what we're trying to do.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.370
The theory and the experiment
are just the beginning.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.400
And you can start
from either extreme.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.070
What we want is, how
does it all work?

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.710
What is going on?

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:19.080
Can we build a picture, which
is intuitive and checkable and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.680
predictive, so that
we can say, oh, yeah.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.090
If we want to know something,
we can get to it this way.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.890
And the purpose
of this lecture is

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.860
to not provide a
textbook view of spectra,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.710
but to give you a sense of
how you can get to stuff

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.200
that challenge your intuition.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.440
What we want to do as
scientists is to be surprised.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.590
We want to do a good experiment
or do a good calculation.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.190
And we want to find that the
result is not what we expected.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.210
And we can figure out why
it's not what we expected.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.820
And that's never conveyed
in any textbooks.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.520
Now, this lecture is based on
my little book of lecture notes.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.760
And I have a number
of copies of it.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.240
And if people have a
strong wish to have a copy,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.960
you can have one.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.020
I can give it to you.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.430
And a lot of this lecture is
based on the first chapter

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.020
of this book.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.870
But many of the topics are
developed throughout the book.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.370
OK.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.650
So this is a two
lecture sequence,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.062
and the first half will cover
this stuff on this board.

00:03:52.062 --> 00:03:53.520
And it's in the
notes, so you don't

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.970
have to copy all this stuff.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.700
I just want you to
see where we're going.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.670
So I've already
talked a little bit

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.040
about experiment versus theory.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.090
They complement each other.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.410
We can use theory to
devise an experiment, which

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.200
is path breaking.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.410
Or we can use an experiment
to challenge the theorist

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.880
to calculate a
new kind of thing.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.220
And I hope that some of
these things, those ideas,

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.360
present themselves
in this lecture.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.070
And it's really important
that if there's something

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.300
that you don't
understand or don't

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.330
capture the importance of,
you should ask me a question.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.560
I really want to talk
about what it's all for.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.070
OK.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.470
So I'm going to
talk about spectra,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.830
and it will be what kinds--

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.310
rotation, vibration, electronic,
and other ramifications.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.730
And going from atom to
diatomic to polyatomic

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.690
to condensed phase.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.130
Each step along this path
leads to new complexities

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.410
and new insights.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.530
Then I'll talk about,
OK, we got a spectrum.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.550
What do we expect to
be in the spectrum?

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.060
Well, one of the
things that's important

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.160
is the transition selection
rules or transition rules.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.600
Selection rules correspond
to an operator-- eigenvalues

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.860
of an operator-- that commutes
with the exact Hamiltonian.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.560
And those correspond
to symmetries.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.740
And there are propensity
rules like, OK,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.830
which transitions are
going to be strong

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.360
and which are going to be weak?

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.960
And a beautiful example
of propensity rules

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.830
are based on the
Franck-Condon principle.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.370
And the Franck-Condon principle
is one of the first keys

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.760
you use to unlock
what's in a spectrum,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.500
or what a molecule is doing.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.350
Because it's the first
level of complexity

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.080
that is presented to
you in the spectrum.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.690
What are the vibrational bands,
and how do we assign them,

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.940
and what are they telling us?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.700
There is a very different kind
of information in an absorption

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.770
spectrum, because it's
always from the lowest

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.150
electronic state, lowest
vibrational level.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.160
And so there's a
simplicity, because

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.540
of a kind of state selection.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.100
And in emission, it's a
very different ballgame.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.390
Because in the gas
phase, the emission

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.060
is from many different levels.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.920
In the condensed
phase, it's not.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.260
Why?

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.900
OK.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.280
And then we get to dynamics.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.610
And the main thing I want
to do in these two lectures

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.250
is to whet your
appetite for dynamics.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.560
And there are many kinds
of dynamics ranging

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.310
from a simple two level
quantum beat to intramolecular

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.720
vibrational redistribution.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.940
Which you can understand
by perturbation theory

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:16.590
to the strange behavior of
electronically excited states

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.960
losing their
ability to fluoresce

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.030
not because the molecule breaks,
but because the bright state--

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.930
that's an important concept--

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.180
the bright state is something.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.100
It's not an eigenstate.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.370
It's a special state
that we understand well.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.730
It's one of the things that
we build perturbation theory

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:36.840
around.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.430
The bright state mixes into an
enormous number of dark states.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.360
And the molecule
forgets that it knows

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.630
how to fluoresce because
the different components,

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.740
different eigenstates dephase.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.000
And that is a beautiful theory.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.620
And when I was a
graduate student,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.050
this theory of
radiationless transitions--

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.620
Bixon-Jortner theory--
was just created

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.260
and many people
didn't believe it.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.680
They thought molecules,
big molecules,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.440
they're really easy to
be quenched by collision

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.900
and the loss of the
ability to fluoresce

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.270
or the absence of
fluorescence was somehow

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.340
collision related as opposed
to a physical process.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.140
So there's lots of good stuff.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.710
And some of the good stuff
is Ahmed Zewail's Nobel Prize

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.350
where he claims--

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.659
and that's why he got the
Nobel Prize, because people

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.610
believed that claim.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.470
Now, I'm not saying it's wrong.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.760
But part of getting
famous is to have

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.070
a package, which you can sell.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.730
And he sold the
daylights out of it.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:55.290
And he calls it clocking
real dynamics in real time.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.380
And it's basically wave packets.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.770
But they're wave packets
doing neat stuff.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.730
And for example,
one way a molecule

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.760
can lose the
ability to fluoresce

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.000
is because the molecule breaks.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.790
And what is the mechanism
by which a molecule breaks?

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.080
Does the bond just simply
break or is there some motion

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.200
that precedes that?

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.310
And what Zewail did
was to show what

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.830
are the motions that
lead the molecule

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:34.740
into the region of state
space where the bond breaks.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.200
And, of course, if you want
to manipulate molecules,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.060
you either want to get to
those regions or avoid them.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.268
And so there's all
sorts of insight there.

00:09:45.268 --> 00:09:47.610
OK.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.390
Now this is what I believe.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.360
That if you understand
small molecules,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.250
you will see examples
of everything

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.390
you need to know to deal with
almost any dynamical process

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.980
in chemistry.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.390
Now, this is certainly
an exaggeration,

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.490
but this has been
my motto for years.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:15.680
And so I really stress
the small molecules.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.210
And it's not that small
molecules are really hard.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.400
They're really
beautiful, and they

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.480
do enough so that you can
anticipate what you need

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.840
to deal with bigger molecules.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.630
So let's begin.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.780
OK.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.980
So what is a molecule?

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.170
As chemists, we
would never think

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.830
of a molecule as a bag
of nuclei and electrons.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.680
We wouldn't think of it
as a bag of atoms either.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.250
We believe in chemical bonds.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.160
This is an important thing.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.490
It's not a conserved quantity.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.260
Bonds can break.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.370
But we believe that bonds
tell an important story.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:23.480
And so almost all of our
pictures for complicated

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.200
phenomena are based on the--

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.420
I hesitate to use
the word sanctity--

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.990
but the importance of bonds.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.790
OK.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.160
We start-- I'm
going to erase this,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.340
because I've made
my point, and it's

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:48.520
embarrassing to keep
emphasizing my secret motto.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.460
But it is true.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:49.960
OK.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.970
We have the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:02.110
And this is very
important, because we can't

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.680
solve a three body problem.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.840
We can solve a two body problem.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.560
But we have molecules,
which are consisting

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.350
of nuclei and electrons.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.380
And this Born-Oppenheimer
approximation

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.310
enables us to separate the
nuclear part of the problem

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.560
from the electronic
part of the problem.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.730
Because these two things move
at very different velocities.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.710
And so it's a profound
simplification.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:35.250
We get potential energy curves
or potential energy surfaces.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.180
And that is the repository
of essentially everything

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.410
we want to know.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.140
If we know the
potential surface,

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.540
we can begin to do
almost anything.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.450
And certainly for
a big molecule,

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.590
it's not just a simple
curve like this.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:59.580
If you have N atoms, there's
3N minus 6 vibrational modes.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.210
And well, that sounds terrible.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:07.140
But even for this, you have
essentially an infinite number

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.580
of vibrational levels
and an infinite number

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.390
of rotational levels.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.830
And so if you have a
polyatomic molecule,

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:20.480
you have 3N minus 6
infinities of infinities.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.470
So you're not wanting
to get everything.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.960
You want to generate
enough information

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.310
to be able to calculate
anything you want.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.070
And sometimes, you
make approximations

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.176
and you're not sure that
those approximations are good.

00:13:36.176 --> 00:13:37.300
And you want them to break.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.520
You want to discover
something new.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.890
So the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation,

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.890
we go from clamped
nuclei calculation

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.560
where the-- since
the nuclei moves slow

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.600
compared to the electrons, well,
let's not let them move at all.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.930
And then we build a
perturbation theory picture

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.550
where we let them move.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.530
And we can deal with that
because we understand

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.090
vibrations and rotations.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.150
OK.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.920
So we have a potential
energy surface.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.440
And there are things
that we can anticipate

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.680
about a potential
energy surface.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.840
And LCAO-MO theory
enables you to say

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.840
a lot of important things about
the potential energy surface.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.450
So it provides a
qualitative framework.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.880
And so from molecular
orbital theory--

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.160
and this is not what Professor
Van Voorhis talked about.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.590
This is the baby stuff.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.490
And we don't expect to
get the exact answer.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.410
But we do expect to be
able to explain trends.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.800
Trends within a molecule and
between related molecules.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:04.760
So this provides a
framework for expectations.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.270
And there are things that
we get like bond order.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:23.270
And we talk about orbitals
that are bonding, non-bonding,

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.180
and antibonding.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.170
And this comes directly
out of the simple ideas.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:35.970
Recall when we had
atom with a hydrogen,

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.330
the hydrogen doesn't
make pi bonds.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:44.300
And so they're pi orbitals for
the atom A, which have nothing

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.620
to interact with.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.780
And they're usually non-bonding.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.660
So we have these
sorts of things.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:56.030
We have spN hybridization.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:05.210
And this is just telling
you if a molecule wants

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.240
to make the maximum number
of bonds, you do something.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:14.130
And if it's sp
cubed, you have four

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.490
tetrahedrally arranged bonds.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:23.370
And if it's sp cubed, sp squared
is planar with 120 degrees.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:27.540
These things tell you something
about geometric expectations.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.850
Now, molecules don't
follow the rules exactly,

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.900
but they come pretty close.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.410
And so if you have
some reason to believe

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.500
that a particular
hybridization is appropriate,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.889
then you have certain
expectations for the geometry

00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:44.180
and how that's going to
present itself in the spectrum.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.990
So bond order's related
to internuclear distance

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.270
and vibrational frequencies.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.930
Sp hybridization has
to do with geometry,

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.190
and all of these things
are really important.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.740
So we have a potential surface.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.710
And let's say this
is a boldface thing,

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.130
implying that there are 3N
minus 6 different displacement

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.149
coordinates.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:23.859
This potential encodes
the normal modes.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:27.130
What's a normal mode?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.980
Well, it's a classical
mechanical concept.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.290
And it basically
corresponds to situations

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:39.820
where all of the atoms
move at the same frequency

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.620
in each normal mode.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.200
And these normal modes each
has an expected frequency

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.890
and expected geometry.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.870
Because if it's a
polyatomic molecule,

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.870
you have not just
two things moving.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.090
They'll always be moving
at the same frequency.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.380
But you have three
or four or 100.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.630
And OK.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.200
So you learn about the shape
of the potential and the force

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.240
constants and so on.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.976
Now, we have the
rotational structure.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.060
Now, molecules are
not rigid rotors.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.590
But it's useful to think about
molecules as rigid rotors

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.310
to develop a basis set
for describing rotation.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.110
And perturbation
theory enables us

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:40.970
to describe the energy levels
of a non-rigid vibrating rotor.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.770
And it's straightforward.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.960
It may be ugly, but it tells
you how you take information

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.780
from the spectrum
and learn about, say,

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.150
the internuclear
distance dependence

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.900
of molecular constants
like a spin orbit constant.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.970
Or some hyperfine constant.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.130
Or just the rotational constant.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.890
And it's a simple thing.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:09.260
And I'm toying with the idea
of using this sort of problem

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.720
on the exam.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.120
And I'm not sure whether
I did on the second exam.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.680
But if I did, you'll have a
chance to redeem yourself.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.180
OK.

00:19:25.041 --> 00:19:25.540
OK.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:33.620
Then in the gas phase,
nothing much happens.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.710
You can have collisions, but
the time between collisions

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.800
can be controlled by what
the pressure you use.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.160
And so you can sort
of think about the gas

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.950
phase as something where
the molecules are isolated.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.725
And another way of saying
that is the expectation

00:19:51.725 --> 00:20:01.845
value of the Hamiltonian in
any state is time independent.

00:20:01.845 --> 00:20:04.950
The Hamiltonian is energy.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.650
Energy is conserved.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.350
And unless there are collisions,
energy will be conserved.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.010
And so.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.930
But in the condensed phase,
you have lot of collisions.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.210
They're very fast.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:28.190
And so one big difference
between the gas phase

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.440
and the condensed phase is
energy is not conserved.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.230
And it's not conserved
at different rates

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.660
for different kinds of motions.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.350
And you want to understand that.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.890
OK.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.764
So now let's talk about
the kinds of spectra.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.110
We have rotational spectra.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.870
And that usually is in the
micro region of the spectrum.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:05.440
And it requires that
the electric dipole

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.510
moment be not equal to zero.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.790
I'll talk about this
some more in a minute.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.720
We have vibration.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.010
And vibrational spectrum
is in the infrared.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:30.350
And the requirement
for vibration

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.240
is that the dipole moment--

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.970
which is a vector
quantity if you don't

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:38.420
have a diatomic molecule--

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:43.580
changes with displacements,
each of the normal modes.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:48.020
And so we have a
molecule like CO2.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.590
CO2 does not have a dipole
moment at equilibrium.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.340
It's a linear
molecule, symmetric.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:22:02.760
But it can do this and that
is a change in dipole moment.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.780
It can do this and that
produces a new dipole moment.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.620
Or produces a dipole moment.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.510
And it can do this,
which does not.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.120
So you have different
modes, which are infrared

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.270
active and infrared inactive.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.750
And it's related to
this dipole moment.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.700
Now notice, I put a
vector sign on it.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:29.610
It corresponds to motion,
directions in the body frame

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.140
where the dipole moment changes.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.570
When you do this,
the dipole moment

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.250
is perpendicular to the axis.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.740
When you do this,
it's along the axis.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.690
And so there is stuff--

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.760
really a lot of
stuff-- just looking

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.560
at what vibrational
modes are active.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.553
And then there's electronic.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.100
And that's mostly in
the visible and UV.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.570
But the electronic spectrum
could be in the X-ray region

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.070
even.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:00.480
But mostly, molecules
break when they get outside

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.490
of the ordinary UV region.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.050
And so there's not much there.

00:23:06.751 --> 00:23:07.250
OK.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.720
What's needed.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:14.500
Well, what's needed is the
electronic transition moment.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.450
Let's call this e1, e2.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.850
Going from two different
electronic states,

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.730
there is an electric
dipole transition moment,

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.070
which is not equal to zero.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:30.120
So H2, which has no
vibrational spectrum

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.540
and no rotational spectrum
has an electronic spectrum.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.460
Everything has an
electronic spectrum.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.870
OK.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:44.050
Now, a diatomic molecule.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.950
Here is sort of a
template for everything

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.890
a diatomic molecule can do.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.300
Now, they're cleverer than this.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.850
But this is sort
of in preparation

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:04.700
for dealing with
greater complexity.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.830
And then we can have up here.

00:24:10.051 --> 00:24:10.550
OK.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:12.980
So this is the
electronic ground state.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:17.300
And normally, if you
have a diatomic molecule,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.080
you can predict what is
the electronic ground state

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.074
and how is it going to look--

00:24:23.074 --> 00:24:24.740
how is its potential
curve going to look

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.560
relative to the excited states.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.300
That's something you
should be able to do

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.550
using LCAO-MO theory.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.580
OK.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.080
So this is the ground state.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.550
This is the repulsive state.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.970
And usually, the
ground state correlates

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:58.920
with ground state of the atoms.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.010
And so here we have
a repulsive state,

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.570
which also correlates with
the ground state of the atom.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.920
So this is an excited state, and
that correlates with an excited

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.990
state of the atoms.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:14.915
And this is AB plus an electron.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.810
So that's one way
the molecule breaks.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.140
And this dotted curve
represents Rydberg

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:30.220
states They're Rydberg
states converging

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.780
to every rotation vibration
level of this excited state.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.110
And it can be complicated.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.810
But it's beautiful,
because I know

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:42.490
the magic decoder for how do
you deal with Rydberg states.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.370
Because there's a lot
of them, but they're

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.090
closely related to each other.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.360
And we can exploit
that relationship

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.160
in guiding an experiment.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.510
And so here, now we
have a curve crossing

00:25:55.510 --> 00:26:00.180
between a repulsive
state and a bound state.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.088
And that leads to what
we call predissociation.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.630
So the vibrational
level of this state--

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:15.100
which would normally be bound
above the curve crossing--

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.420
are not bound.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.540
And that's encoded
in the spectrum too.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.930
And so for more
complicated molecules,

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.590
they're going to be these curve
crossings or surface crossings.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.110
And we want to know how
do we deal with them,

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:36.190
and what is a diatomic-like
way of dealing with them.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:43.240
And the important thing is
at that internuclear distance

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:50.030
where the curves cross, then
you could be at a level--

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.730
starting at a level
on this state--

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.890
the bound state.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.400
And it will have the same
momentum at the crossing radius

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.950
as the repulsive state.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:02.010
And that's where it goes.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.100
That's where it leaks out.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:10.350
I mean, we're normally used
to thinking about processes--

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.620
non-radiative processes,
all kinds of processes--

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.240
as an integral overall space.

00:27:18.192 --> 00:27:23.610
But because the
momenta are the same

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.990
on the two curves
at this radius,

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.090
they can go freely
from one to the other.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:31.370
The molecules can go freely
from one to the other.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:36.010
We get a tremendous
simplification.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:39.880
And this is something that is
always ignored in textbooks

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.820
and is a profound insight.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.540
Because you know exactly
where things happen and why

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.480
they happen.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.990
And so you can arrange
the information

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.940
to describe what's
going on at this point.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.110
And this is where semi-classical
theory is really valuable.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:02.280
Because not only do you know
that you have stationary phase

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:02.910
at this point.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.800
But you know what the spatial
oscillation frequency is.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.310
Because the spatial
oscillation frequency is H--

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.270
or the wavelength-- is h over p.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.320
And you know what the
momentum is at this point.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.140
And so you know
where the nodes are.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.980
How far the nodes are apart
and what the amplitude is here.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.630
And so it tells you
exactly what you

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.970
want to know in
order to describe

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.600
this non-radiative process.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.820
And my belief is that almost
all of the complex things that

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.570
molecules do happen at
a predictable region

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.490
in coordinated space.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:49.600
And you can get the information
you need to understand them,

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.700
because all of a
sudden, the molecule

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.750
is behaving in a kind
of classical way.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.735
And we're entitled to think
locally rather than globally.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.140
OK.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.210
I'm going very slowly.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.880
We may get through most of what
I planned to talk about today.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.952
I have 11 pages of
notes, and this is--

00:29:10.952 --> 00:29:12.950
I'm on page three.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:16.160
So maybe we'll take off.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.450
OK.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.700
So how do you do spectra?

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.780
Well, in the old days,
you had some light source

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:28.020
like a candle, and
you had a lens,

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.410
and you had an absorption cell.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.870
And there would be some
sort of a spectrometer here.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.660
Could be a grading.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.610
It could be a prism.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.930
It could be anything.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.600
But it's something
that says, OK, I

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.870
looked at the
selected wavelengths

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:49.620
at which the gas in
this cell removed light

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.840
from the continuum.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.780
And then you have a detector,
which in the old days

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.660
was a photographic plate.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.730
But it could be a
photo multiplier,

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:03.570
and you're looking
at the spectrum

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:08.720
by scanning the grading
or something like that.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.950
And so what you would
get is some kind

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:21.030
of a record where you have dark
regions corresponding to where

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:26.710
there has been no absorption
and, well, actually it

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:27.960
would be the other way around.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.480
There'd be bright
regions, because there'd

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.740
be no exposure of the emulsion
on the plate and dark regions

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.320
where there--

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.221
yes-- where the light hits.

00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:39.720
OK.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.450
So but we're much
cleverer than this.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.640
And we can do all sorts
of wonderful things.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.620
And again, I've been
around for a long time

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.710
and lasers were just
beginning to be used

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.960
when I was a graduate student.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.440
And I was one of the
first small molecules

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.460
spectroscopists to use lasers.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.220
But not as a graduate student.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.400
I wanted them, but we had such--

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:14.610
lasers were so terrible in the
region between 1965 and 1971

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.290
when I was a graduate student.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:20.950
And so lasers were things to be
admired, but hardly to be used.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.870
But one of the crucial
things was dye lasers.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.610
Because these guys
are monochromatic,

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:36.740
and they can be tuned and tuned
continuously over a wide region

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.350
of the spectrum.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:43.100
And so that's way better than
a candle or a light bulb.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.292
Because it's monochromatic,
and you're asking one

00:31:45.292 --> 00:31:47.000
question at a time as
you tune the laser.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:57.380
Now, lasers enable you to do
many kinds of experiments.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:09.140
You can simply tune the
laser through a series

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:17.040
of transitions, and
you get fluorescence

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.870
every time the laser tunes
through a transition.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.990
And if one laser is good,
two lasers are better.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.180
And so you can do
all sorts of things

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:36.610
like suppose this spectrum
is really complicated.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.420
And you want to be
able to simplify it.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.760
And so you can do a double
resonance experiment

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.770
where you tune this
laser to one line

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:47.700
and then you tune this laser
through a series of transition.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.594
That spectrum is
going to be simple,

00:32:49.594 --> 00:32:51.510
and it's going to be
telling you who this was.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:58.090
And there's just
no end of tricks.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:05.860
And often, instead of
detecting the fluorescence,

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.080
you tune the laser.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.370
Let's do this.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:13.930
And so starting here is some
kind of a continuum, ionization

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:15.140
continuum.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:21.670
And so you have this
photon being used twice.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.730
One here and one to take it
above the ionization limit.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:29.080
And so you have an
excitation, which you do

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.970
want to know how strong it is.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.070
And so you might monitor
the fluorescence.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.380
But you don't know who
this is, and you find out

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.640
by tuning this.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.290
But you would detect
the excitation here

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.630
by subsequent ionization.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:46.860
It's easy to collect ions.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.890
Every ion you produce,
you can detect.

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.900
Every photon you produce,
you can't detect.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.230
Because you have a solid
angle consideration and photo

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.120
multipliers are not perfect.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:01.066
And so ionization detection
is way more sensitive.

00:34:01.066 --> 00:34:02.440
So you can do that
kind of thing.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.989
You can also do--

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:16.230
this is a kind of
sequential excitation.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.989
You could imagine doing
an experiment where

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:24.460
you have an energy level
here, and you have a laser,

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.920
which is not on resonance.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.520
That's a coherent process.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:34.449
It uses the oscilltor strength
at this level to get to here.

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:39.230
And that's related to many other
kinds of current experiments.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.940
And that's neat.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.810
Now, we're recording
spectra, and we need

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:57.460
to know what the rules are.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:02.060
And so there are certain
transitions that are allowed

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.050
and certain transitions
that are forbidden.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:11.500
Now, I talked about the
transition requirements

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.930
for rotation, vibration,
and electronic.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:18.190
But let's just talk about
the electronic spectrum,

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.060
because the other
two are simple.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:29.570
The transition operator is
equal to the sum over electrons

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:35.550
of e times r sub i.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.840
It's a one electron operator.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.910
And that means if we
have wave functions which

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:53.000
are Slater determinates of
spin orbitals like 2s alpha.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:01.560
This one electron
operator can only

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:06.030
have a non-zero matrix
element if the two states

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.760
differ by one spin orbital.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.780
That's a big simplification.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:17.960
And so one can actually use
this to selectively access

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.140
different kinds of states
by designing an experiment.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.800
But the important thing is that
for electronic transitions,

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:30.180
we have the selection rule
delta so is equal to 1.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.680
Not 2.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.540
Not 0.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:42.150
And now, the operator doesn't
have any spin involved with it.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:47.060
And so that means
delta s equals 0.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.350
You did not change, you did
not go from a singlet state

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:52.780
to a triplet state.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:56.830
And the only way you can
get from a singlet state

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:59.620
to a triplet state is
if the triplet state is

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.270
perturbed by a singlet state.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:08.330
So this picture I drew where I
had a repulsive state crossing

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:11.450
through a bound state, it might
have been that one of those

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:13.010
was a triplet.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.940
And as a result, and
the other is a singlet,

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.610
and you have spin
orbit interactions,

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:23.900
and you get extra states,
extra lines appearing.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:29.750
But you get this
wonderful selection rule.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:36.075
There is also for
the electric dipole

00:37:36.075 --> 00:37:42.980
that we have plus
to minus parity.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.970
Now what's parity?

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:46.710
I don't like talking
about parity,

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:51.970
because the useful definition
leads to complexity.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:54.450
But basically,
parity corresponds

00:37:54.450 --> 00:38:03.060
to the symmetry, the inversion
symmetry in the laboratory

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.130
frame.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.960
Now, you say, well, a molecule
doesn't have any inversion

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.470
symmetry.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.180
But space is isotopic.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.510
And so you can go from a
left handed to a right handed

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.760
coordinate system.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.720
And that's what happens
when you invert space.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.740
And so you can classify
levels according

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.200
to whether they're odd
or even with respect

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.520
to space inversion.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.010
This is close to the truth.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.500
This is close to all you need
to know unless you're actually

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.190
going to do stuff with
the parity operator.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.360
But it's a useful
way of saying, OK,

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.760
I put parity labels on things.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.280
I learned how to do
that, and that's enough.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:50.290
Now, you follow selection rules
where good quantum numbers

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.940
are conserved.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.940
Or they change in a
way that you predict

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.960
based on the way you
did the experiment.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.300
A good quantum
number, I remind you,

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.940
is the eigenvalue of an
operator that commutes

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.494
with the exact Hamiltonian.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.910
There are very few rigorously
good quantum numbers.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:19.160
But if a molecule
has any symmetry,

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:23.120
group theory tells
you a bunch of things

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.580
that commute with
the Hamiltonian,

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.160
and it gives you
symmetry labels.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.470
And that's very important
in inorganic chemistry

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:34.940
where you have either molecules
with symmetry or molecules

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:40.460
with atoms with ligands in
a symmetric arrangement.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.820
And since the transition
is on the center atom

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:48.770
usually that you can classify
them using group theory as

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:50.200
allowed or forbidden.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:05.550
So if we have an
electronic transition,

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:11.690
the easiest thing to observe
is vibrational bands.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.870
If you have a relatively
low resolution spectrum,

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.150
you're going to see
vibrational bands.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:20.210
You have to work harder to
see the rotational transitions

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:25.190
in each vibrational band, but
you get an enormous amount

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:28.040
of qualitative
information just looking

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.810
at the vibrational bands.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:43.060
Because the vibrational
bands encode the difference

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:49.070
between the ground state
potential and the excited state

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:50.060
potential.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.370
Now, this is a
universal notation.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.560
Ground state is
always double prime.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.570
Upper state is
always single prime.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.480
Very strange, but
that's the way it is.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.980
And so if these
potentials are different,

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.941
the vibrational bands
encode the difference.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.740
And this comes from the
Franck-Condon principle, which

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:19.120
says nuclei move slowly,
electrons move fast.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.780
The transition is an
instantaneous process,

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.670
as far as the nuclei
are concerned.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:28.500
And so there's no change
in nuclear coordinates,

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.280
and there is no change
in nuclear momentum.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.146
This is what's in
all the textbooks,

00:41:34.146 --> 00:41:35.520
and nobody ever
talks about this,

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:43.420
because we don't really normally
know or think about momentum.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.370
But we do know what it is.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.170
We do know what the operator is.

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:51.040
And we know that
kinetic energy is

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.240
related to the momentum
squared over 2 times the mass.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.361
So what is this?

00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:00.860
This means transitions
are vertical.

00:42:03.525 --> 00:42:09.970
In other words, if we have
a pair of electronic states,

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:12.880
we draw these vertical lines.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.760
Not slanting lines.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.340
This means momentum
is conserved.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:24.110
And this, here at
this vertical point,

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.980
we have this much momentum.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:30.080
And, well, there's
the same amount here.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.660
Now usually, this just means--

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.000
the delta p is equal to 0--

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.300
means that of all the
strong transitions,

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:43.570
turning point to turning point
transitions are the strongest.

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:49.450
Because at a turning point, the
vibrational amplitude is large.

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:51.100
But there's more
to it than that,

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.730
because there are
secondary maxima

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.780
in the vibrational
transition intensities.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:00.760
These correspond to stationary
phase between the initial state

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.230
and the final state.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:05.640
And so in addition to the
strongest transitions,

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:10.980
you get other transitions that
you can explain by this delta p

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:11.610
equals 0.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:19.255
Now, you don't know
anything when you start.

00:43:19.255 --> 00:43:22.130
You know something maybe
about the ground state.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.955
And this could be a
polyatomic molecule

00:43:24.955 --> 00:43:27.490
if we're just
looking at one mode.

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:31.820
And suppose we have
an excited state where

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:36.160
the vibrational
frequency is the same.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.850
In other words, there is no
change in bonding character.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:45.950
And so what you end
up getting is just

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:49.740
the zero to zero
transition in absorption.

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:54.080
Or if you have many vibrational
levels up here, you see v to v,

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.280
delta v equals 0.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:05.170
Now, you could
have a bound state,

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:10.470
and it's usually true that the
excited state is less bound.

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:13.780
And so you would have--

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.850
the Franck-Condon active
region corresponds

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:23.820
to turning point to turning
point in the lower state.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.390
So I shouldn't draw this.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:31.580
Let's draw a
vertical transition.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.180
Well, I missed.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.950
Let me just start again.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:39.150
So we have an excited state,
and we have a ground state.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:40.920
Ground state is bound.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.640
And this is v equal 0.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.890
And so we go from here to there.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:54.540
So if the excited
state is less bound,

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.460
it's a larger inner nucleus and
smaller vibrational frequency.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:02.480
We have many vibrational
levels accessed

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.552
by the Franck-Condon principle.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:10.810
And if we have, in
the other sense,

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:14.080
we have an excited state, which
is more bound than the ground

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:23.165
state then the Franck-Condon
region is narrower.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.290
Because this wall
is nearly vertical.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:35.000
You have more transitions
when it's displaced this way.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.230
And this branch of the potential
is nearly much flatter,

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:42.560
and you have fewer
transitions here.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.420
So the vibrational pattern
tells you qualitatively from the

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.031
get go whether you're going to
a more bound or a less bound

00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:51.530
state.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:56.017
That's very useful information.

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.590
Now, you want to go further.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.860
You want to say, oh,
well, I'm observing

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.840
a bunch of vibrational
levels in the excited state.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.900
What are their quantum numbers?

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.810
Are we seeing the v
equals zero level?

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:27.130
How do we know what vibrational
level we're observing?

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:29.380
Or levels?

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.260
And we can calculate
Franck-Condon factors.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.400
But you can do many things.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.550
So I mean, if you have
a situation like this,

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:45.630
you might not get to the
lowest vibrational level.

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:47.260
But if you have a
situation like this,

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.740
you probably will get to the
lowest vibrational level.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.050
So one way to get
vibrational numbering

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:56.100
is seeing the vibrational
pattern terminate.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.500
That's a good sign
it's v equals 0.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.370
If it terminates
abruptly, it's v equal 0.

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:04.010
But if it terminates
slowly, you're not sure.

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:08.150
But there are other really
wonderful things about this.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:12.240
And you can do
isotope separation.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.940
Isotope shifts.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.740
Since the vibrational
frequency is

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:27.490
the square root of k over mu,
we can change and reduce mass.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:31.180
That changes which
vibrational bands you observe,

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.250
and it changes it in
a quantitative way,

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.510
and so you can often
use that to tell.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:43.330
Another thing you
can do is to now.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:47.480
If you have an excited state,
the vibrational wave function

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.030
is going to look like this.

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:53.020
And there's a node
here, and a node here,

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.230
and node here, node
here, node here.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:59.010
And so if we're looking at
the vibrational progression

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:02.760
observed from such a
level, the intensities

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:07.920
will have minima corresponding
to how many nodes there

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.150
are in the excited state.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:12.270
And the number of nodes is the
vibrational quantum number.

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:18.450
So there are lots
of ways of doing it.

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:21.200
And then there is
something else.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.320
If you observe at
moderately low resolution

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.700
a vibrational band in
an electronic spectrum,

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:40.250
it will have the peculiar
shape like that or like that.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.950
This is called a band head.

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.290
And it corresponds to
the fact that because

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:48.560
the rotational constants in
the upper and lower state

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.980
are different, one
of the branches--

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:58.460
you have delta J equals
plus or minus 1, 0.

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:04.340
And the delta J plus 1 is
called the R branch and minus 1

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.550
is called the P branch.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:09.160
And delta J of 0 is
called the Q branch.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.830
Now, these two guys
are such that depending

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:15.780
on the sign of the
difference in B values,

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:21.290
you get ahead on the
high frequency side

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:25.380
or ahead on the
low frequency side.

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.350
Well, actually, it's
the other way around.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:31.800
But it tells you then
the rotational constant,

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.360
which is also a signal of
how bound the state is.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:40.130
The rotational constant-- the
shading of these band heads--

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:43.430
confirms your
vibrational assignment.

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:48.000
And typically, if you have a
smaller vibrational frequency,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.120
you'll also have a smaller
rotational constant.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.240
It's not always true.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.990
And it's always interesting
when it doesn't happen.

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:59.850
And so the vibrational bands
have this asymmetric shape

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:07.480
unless the rotational constant
upstairs and downstairs

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.380
is the same.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:11.170
And then you have a branch
going this way and a branch

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:11.800
going this way.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.633
And a gap in the middle
that might be filled

00:50:13.633 --> 00:50:15.790
with some Q branch lines.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.460
And the Q branch lines
tell you, oh, yeah, that

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:26.470
was a transition where the
lambda, the projection of L

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:29.970
on the internuclear
axis changed.

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:32.600
And if it doesn't
have this Q branch,

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.270
it'll tell you this
delta lambda equals 0.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.620
All sorts of stuff.

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:42.790
And if you have no
sign of band heads,

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.040
but just this double
hump structure,

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.500
it tells you that the rotational
constant is about the same as

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.520
in the ground state.

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.160
And it tells you also that
the vibrational frequency is

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.570
expected to be about the same.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:00.940
I better stop.

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:05.120
So as soon as you go to
polyatomic molecules.

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:10.430
Instead of having just one
vibration, you have 3n minus 6.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:14.090
And so 3n minus 6 downstairs,
3n minus 6 upstairs,

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.590
that looks bad.

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:21.550
But only some of the
vibrational modes

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:24.070
correspond to a
distortion from--

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:26.010
a difference in geometry
between the ground

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:27.860
state and the excited state.

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:33.160
And so most of the
vibrational modes

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.650
correspond to
identical frequencies.

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:38.830
And what we call that
is Franck-Condon dark.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:42.520
Because the only transitions
that are allowed are delta v

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.070
equals 0 for that mode.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.710
And so only the
modes that correspond

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:53.180
to a change in structure
appear as long progressions.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.370
And so there are only a
few, and so the spectrum

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:59.240
of a polyatomic molecule
is not too much different

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.220
from a diatomic
molecule, because

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.550
of the small number of
Franck-Condon active modes.

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:09.960
But you look closer and
you see big differences.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:10.460
OK.

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:16.400
So well, we'll talk more
about this on Friday.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.340
And we might go
to three lectures

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:20.910
on this, because
this is really--

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:22.700
you know the whole
point of this course

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:27.760
is to be able to understand
how molecules talk to us.
