ROBERT FIELD: Let's get started.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:34.010
William Klemperer was my thesis
advisor, and he died yesterday.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.850
It also happens that the
subject of this lecture

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.170
is really the core of
what I got from him.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.870
He showed me how to
evaluate matrix elements

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.130
of many-electron operators,
which is the key to being able

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.530
to interpret--

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.820
not just tabulate--
electronic properties

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.710
of atoms and molecules.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.980
Our goal is to be able
to reduce the complexity

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.280
of electronic structure,
which is really complicated.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.270
The electrons interact with
each other really strongly,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.660
and there are a lot of them.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.020
And it's very hard to
separate the complexity

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.650
of the many-body
interactions into things

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.290
that we can put in our
head and interpret.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.930
And the whole goal
of this course

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.600
is to give you the
tools to interpret

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.090
complicated phenomena.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.290
We have the vibrational problem
as a way of understanding

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.040
internuclear interactions--

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.230
nuclear motions.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.770
We have electronic structure
and the hydrogen atom

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.580
as a way of understanding
what electronic structure is,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580
and to reduce it to,
basically, the things

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.456
we learn about hydrogen.

00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:03.080
When we go to molecular
orbital theory,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.330
we take what we
know about atoms,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.030
and build a minimally-complex
interpretive picture,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.300
which is sort of a
framework for understanding

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.270
complicated molecular
interactions.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.350
So one of the most important
things about understanding

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.870
electronic structure
is, how do we

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.616
deal with many-electron
wave functions?

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:34.190
And one of the terrible
problems is that the electrons

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.410
are indistinguishable.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.970
And so we have to ensure
that the wave functions are

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.310
anti-symmetric with
respect to permutation

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.150
of every pair of
electrons, not just two.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.004
In helium we just dealt with
two, and that wasn't so bad.

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:57.010
But when we deal with
n electrons, what

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.910
we are going to discover
is that in order

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.520
to anti-symmetrize
the wave function,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.630
we have to write a determinantal
wave function, a determinant

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.440
of orbitals.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.590
And when you expand
an n by n determinant,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.080
you get n factorial times.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.790
And when you calculate
matrix elements,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.090
you have n factorial
squared integrals.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.900
So you're not going to be
handling these one at a time,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.130
and looking at them lovingly.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.340
You're going to want to be
able to take these things

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.100
and extract what is
the important thing

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.320
about the electronic
structure that you're

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.150
going to need to know.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.970
And as a graduate student,
I was collecting numbers.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.020
I was collecting numbers about
spectroscopic perturbations,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.990
where non-degenerate
perturbation 3 breaks down,

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.700
and interesting things happen.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.680
But this was something
that nobody in the world

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.830
was interested in because
it was the breaking

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.990
of the usual patterns.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.400
And I was convinced that I
had collected some stuff that

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.970
told an interesting story.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.370
And I told Klemperer about
this, and he said, well,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.620
have you thought about how
to evaluate these integrals--

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.430
these numbers that you are
extracting from the spectrum,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.950
by doing some tricks with the
many-electron wave functions?

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.580
And then he showed me, on a
scrap of paper, how to do it.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.120
And I was launched.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.750
That was it.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.740
That has been the
foundation of my career

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.910
for the last 50 years.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.252
And I didn't think that
Klemperer knew that.

00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:42.960
I didn't think anybody
knew it, because I

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.090
didn't think it was knowable.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.490
But he just gave it to
me on a silver platter.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.970
And so I'm going
to try to give you

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.840
at least the rudiments of
what it is you're up against,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.120
and how you reduce
them to things

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.570
that you care about,
that you can think about.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.940
And you can understand
the hydrogen atom

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.160
in rather complete detail.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.400
Or at least you can understand
how one observable relates

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.690
to another.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.480
And so the relationship
between the effective quantum

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.080
number and the ionization
energy of a state

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.010
then provides a
hydrogen-atom-based structural

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.950
model for everything
you can observe.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:36.410
Now spectroscopists have
the unfortunate habit

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.570
of saying we're
interested in structure.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.030
Structure is static.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.070
Dynamics is magical,
and special, and hard.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.040
But if you understand
structure in a way which is not

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.880
the exact eigenstates, not
the exact wave functions,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.200
but something that the molecule
was trying to do and sort of

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.920
missed.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.920
And the dynamics is
just what happens

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.200
when this preparation
isn't in eigenstate,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.440
which would be boring.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.110
And you get dynamics,
which you can understand,

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.180
as opposed to just
saying, I'm going

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.370
to tabulate the dynamics too.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.230
You don't know anything unless
you have a reductionist picture

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.040
of what's going on.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.520
And since the hardest part
of dealing with molecules

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.370
is the fact that they
have a lot of electrons,

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.520
this is really the core of being
able to do important stuff.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.770
Now it's a horrendously
complicated problem,

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.340
and notationally awkward, too.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.500
And let me just
try to explain it.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.130
And I'm going to try to do
this without too much reliance

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.085
on my notes, because
they're terrible.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.150
We talked about helium.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.390
And helium has two electrons.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:13.090
And there's this 1 over r12
interaction between electrons,

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.530
which looks innocent enough.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.480
You can write it down.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.680
You know, it's
just a few symbols.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:26.680
And we can call it the
first order perturbation.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.380
But that's really a
lie, because it's as

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.870
big as almost everything else.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.790
And so, yeah, we can, in fact,
do a series of approximations.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.370
One is, ignore it, the
non-interacting electron

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.730
approximation.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.210
And that's basically
repackaging hydrogen,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.280
and it's not quite enough.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.650
And then we can say, OK, let's
calculate the first order

00:07:53.650 --> 00:08:01.030
energy by calculating
expectation values of h12.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.350
So that's E1.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.690
And that's almost enough to give
us a sense of what is going on.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:29.890
1 over r12, commutate with
any electron, that's not 0.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.620
1 over r12, commutated with
any orbital angular momentum--

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.039
any momentum is not 0.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:53.572
So that means that l and n
are not good quantum numbers.

00:08:53.572 --> 00:08:54.780
What's a good quantum number?

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.022
What's the definition of
a good quantum number?

00:08:58.022 --> 00:09:00.600
Come on, this is an
important question.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.182
Yes.

00:09:01.182 --> 00:09:02.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
count, and then you

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.420
put them into some
formula, and then

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.240
you can read off eigenvalues.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.810
ROBERT FIELD: That's
maybe 70% of what I want.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.160
You can put it into a formula.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.440
That means it's a
rigorously good thing.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.720
It means it commutes
with the Hamiltonian.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.710
A rigorously good quantum
number corresponds

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.990
to a eigenvalue of
an operator that

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.000
commutes with the Hamiltonian.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.050
So hydrogen, we rely on n and
l to get almost everything.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.530
But here we find that,
in addition to this

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:43.630
being that small, it destroys
the foundation of our picture.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:48.610
And so how do we
think that we can

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:57.930
make any sense of many-electron
atoms and molecules?

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:03.700
Well it turns out we can
hide most of the complexity.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:09.430
And most of the complexity
is just working out the rules

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.800
for calculating these
matrix elements.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.770
The matrix elements of
operators that we care about,

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:22.080
like transition moments, spin
orbit, Zeeman effect, things

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.520
that correspond
to how we observe

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.490
atomic and molecular structure.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.930
And so the main
obstacle to being

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.660
able to evaluate
these matrix elements

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.577
is the permutation requirement.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:52.250
And it turns out that there is
a really simple way of dealing

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.080
with the requirements
for electron permutation,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.400
and that is to write the wave
function as a determinant

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.465
of one-electron orbitals.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:13.150
Because a determinant has three
really important properties.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:19.270
One, it changes its sign when
you permute any two columns.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:24.340
Two, it changes its sign when
you permute any two rows.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.190
And three, if you have two
identical columns or rows,

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.560
it's 0.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.720
That's really fantastic.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.460
And that is the Pauli
exclusion principle-- not what

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.300
you learned in high school.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.260
What you learned is a
small consequence of that.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.510
So if we can build
anti-symmetric wave functions,

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.890
we have aufbau, we can only
put one electron in an orbital.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.810
We have all sorts of stuff, but
it's too complicated to tell

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:07.170
a student in high
school that you can't--

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.650
just the question of
indistinguishable electrons

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.350
is such a subtle thing
that you can't say,

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.010
well, they have to
be anti-symmetric.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.200
But it's easy to say, you can't
put more than one electron

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.670
in a spin orbital.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.510
But we don't talk
about spin orbitals.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.350
We say, we can't put more than
two electrons in an orbital,

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:35.580
because we're protecting you
from unnecessary knowledge.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.606
OK, well, I'm not
going to protect you.

00:12:37.606 --> 00:12:39.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:50.430
OK, so we know that
the Hamiltonian

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.400
has to commute with--

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.940
these capital letters mean,
many electrons' angular momenta.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.500
And this is the spin, this is
the projection of the spin.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.470
We know this is true because
the Hamiltonian doesn't

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.930
operate on spin.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:22.770
It's a trivial result, but
it's a very important result.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:32.980
OK, so we have to worry about
spin, and spin eigenstates,

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.930
and other things like that.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:41.005
OK, so Slater determinants.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.490
J.C. Slater was an MIT
professor in physics.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:03.480
He invented these
things in 1929.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.170
I have a reference.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.620
I don't know if I've
ever read this paper,

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:12.000
but it's probably beautiful.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.770
So basically what
Slater did is showed,

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:34.190
yeah, you can do the necessary
algebra to deal with any atom,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:38.980
and to be able to reduce an atom
to a small number of integrals

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.000
that you really care about.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.150
And there are two
ways of doing this.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.140
One is the truth, and
one is the fit model.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.860
Now the truth is really
boring, because you

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.130
lose all the insights,
and the fit model

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.670
gives you the things you have
to think about and understand.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.990
And a fit model also tells you
what are the import the actors.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.480
And maybe they're in
costume, maybe they're not,

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.520
but we can deal with them.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.420
But the truth is really
very complicated.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:26.870
And as I said many times, when
you go from hydrogen to helium,

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.360
you can't solve the
Schrodinger equation exactly.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.390
This was perhaps a
little bit of a surprise,

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.480
but I think it was only
a surprise in newspapers.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.550
I think physicists
knew immediately,

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.320
when you go for a
two-bodied problem

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.600
to a three-bodied
problem, there is no way

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.830
you can have an exact solution.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.550
And that's the truth.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:52.340
You can't solve helium or any
more-than-one-electron problem

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.250
exactly.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.660
But you can do it
really well, and it just

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.820
costs computer time.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.470
And if the computer is doing
the work, you don't really care.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.530
Because once you've told
the computer the rules,

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.940
then it's off to the races.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.380
You can go have lives or you can
go have a life, and come back,

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.910
and the computer will tell
you whether you made a mistake

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.070
and you're getting
a nonsense result,

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:26.690
or that you have
the correct result.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:32.690
So what we know is this
permutation operator,

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:40.220
operating on any two-electron
function, has to make--

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.510
OK, I'm skipping steps, and my
notes are really kind of stupid

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.620
sometimes.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.625
P 2, 1, which has to
be equal to minus.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:07.410
And now if you apply the
permutation operator twice,

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.849
you get back to the same thing.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:11.490
So there's only two
possible eigenvalues.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.960
You can have minus 1 or plus 1.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.690
And the minus 1
corresponds to fermions,

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:22.950
things that have half-integer
spin, like electrons.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.890
And the plus 1 corresponds to
things that have integer spin,

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:31.300
like photons, and
vibrons, and other things.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.810
And actually, it's harder to
construct a symmetric function

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.060
than an anti-symmetric function.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.580
But the thing is, you've
got lots of electrons,

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:49.270
and you have very few quanta
of vibrations in a single mode,

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.760
and you have very few
photons interacting

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.840
with a molecule at once.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.920
And so the boson
symmetry is less

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.130
important in most applications.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.430
And so we just have
to kill this one.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:22.300
OK, so suppose we want to talk
about something like this,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.290
the 1s, 2s configuration.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.640
A configuration is a list
of the occupied orbitals--

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.430
not the occupied
spin orbitals, which

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:36.540
is a spin associated
with an orbital.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.240
The world of spin
orbitals is where I live,

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.450
but we do that for a reason.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:52.990
And so this two-electron thing
can be expressed as a space

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.490
part--

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.510
there are various
conventions that--

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.450
times the spin part.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:34.890
And alpha 1, beta 2, and then
we have minus or plus beta 1,

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.280
alpha 2.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.910
I'm looking at my notes
because some people always

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.030
keep the electron in
the first position,

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:47.710
and some people keep always the
orbital in the first position.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.080
And it doesn't
matter, because you

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.180
can permute rows or columns.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.500
But I just want to write
what is in my notes.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.970
OK, so this thing, this
two-electron function,

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:05.780
has two anti-symmetrized
possibilities.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.530
And one is a singlet,
and one is a triplet.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:15.140
So s equals zero, s equals 1.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.850
We recognize this alpha
beta minus beta alpha

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:26.570
as the singlet spin state,
and alpha beta plus beta alpha

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.610
as the triplet spin state.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:34.610
So we have alpha beta plus
beta alpha, and alpha alpha

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:40.800
and beta beta, and we have
alpha beta minus beta alpha.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.810
So we call s = 0 a singlet,
and this a triplet,

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.280
because of the number of states.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:55.900
And this wave function has
the necessary spin symmetry

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.775
and the necessary
permutation symmetry.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:10.270
OK, so if, instead of
two electrons, we have 1,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:22.220
2 dot dot dot N, then Mr.
Slater says we do this--

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:22.720
whoops.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:46.960
OK, N, 1, and then K1,
and KN N. So that's

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.780
a determinant-- an
N by N determinant.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.220
And the rows correspond
to the electrons,

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:59.010
and the columns corresponding
to the orbitals.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:04.080
Now this, because of the
properties of the determinant,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.130
is anti-symmetric with respect
to permutation of any two

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.974
electrons or any two orbitals.

00:22:12.974 --> 00:22:14.890
But we don't really care
about the permutation

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.760
of the orbitals, because
it's really the same thing

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.140
is permuting the electrons.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:24.340
And so this N factorial is a
consequence of normalization,

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.490
because when you expand
an N by N determinant,

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:33.126
you get N factorial, additive
products of N functions.

00:22:33.126 --> 00:22:34.250
It looks horrible.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.630
And because we're
normalizing, we

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.950
need this 1 over the
square root of N factorial

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.570
in order to have
this thing come out

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.940
to be 1 when you calculate
the normalization integral.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:58.540
Now this notation is
horrible because you've

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.740
got too many symbols.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.180
And so depending on what
you're trying to convey,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.620
you reduce the symbols, and
you can reduce it simply

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:15.630
by, instead of writing psi every
time, just writing the state.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.360
Or you can-- since
you don't need psi,

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.940
you don't need the state
letter, you can just

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.110
have the state number.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.360
But the best way to do
this is simply to say--

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.350
this is just the main
diagonal of the determinant.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.090
It conveys everything you need.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:52.820
Again, if you permute any two of
these guys, any adjacent pair,

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.720
the sign changes.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.470
And it contains
everything you need,

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.910
and it doesn't require
you to look at stuff

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.650
you're not going to use.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.740
And your goal is going to
be to take these things,

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.410
and calculate matrix of them.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.680
And so you'll be dealing
with the orbitals one or two

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.240
at a time.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.880
And this is very convenient.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.170
And soon, you start to
take this for granted.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.210
And it's a very
simple thing, but it

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:27.090
isn't, because you're doing
a huge number of tricks.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.950
OK, I'm going to skip
over what's in my notes.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.490
Demonstrating that for a two
by two, that what I asserted

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.115
is correct, you can
do that very easily.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:53.780
OK, so we can count,
and we have an atom,

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.020
and we know how many
electrons it has.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.550
And so we immediately know
what our job is going to be.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.300
We're going to be having to
write some Slater determinant

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.000
of those number of electrons.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.980
And the goal is to be able
to do the algebra in a way

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.050
that maybe you can't
describe to your friends

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.010
because it's too complicated.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.330
I'm faced with the problem
of trying to explain

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.190
how to do this algebra.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:25.210
But it is something
that you can learn,

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.000
and you can ask a
computer to do it,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.850
and there are all sorts
of intuitive shortcuts

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.980
where you can look at a
problem, and you could say,

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.540
I understand.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:40.240
OK, so you're used to orbitals.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.950
And that's perfectly reasonable,
because for hydrogen, we

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:50.260
have orbitals, and
there's only one orbital,

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.510
and it could have either spin.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.920
We don't mess with that.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.215
But now we're going to
talk about spin orbitals.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.950
And that's just the
combination of the name

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.750
of the orbital with whether
the spin is up or down.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.870
And the reason for this is
it's easier to do the algebra.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:15.070
And the reason the algebra is--

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.580
it's initially harder
to do the algebra,

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.631
because there are certain
selection rules, and stuff

00:26:21.631 --> 00:26:22.130
like that.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.640
But once you know how to
do it you do the algebra.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.730
And then all of a
sudden, everything

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.640
pops out in a very useful form.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.910
So the stick diagrams
are very important.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.420
But now I'm specifying
the stick diagrams

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.790
as spin orbitals
rather than orbitals.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:53.100
Now another point, there
are rules for how--

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.360
the number of spin
orbitals is different

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.270
between the left-hand side and
the right-hand side of a matrix

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.020
element.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.540
There are rules that are
easily described-- and so

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:14.800
for every kind of
orbital, an orbital that

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:20.170
is a scalar, that doesn't
depend on quantum numbers, that

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:23.750
has a selection
rule delta SO of 0;

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:30.010
and for something like a
one-electron operator that

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:35.290
has a selection rule delta
spin orbital of 1 and 0;

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.780
and then we have our
friend 1 over rij,

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:43.320
that has a selection rule delta
spin orbital of 2, 1, and 0.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.270
And the algebra for each
is something you work out,

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.970
and then you know how to do it.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.260
And I'm going to try to
give you just a little bit

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.130
of a taste of this.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:28:02.980
So we already looked
at something like this.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.930
But we use a slightly
different notation.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.210
So I'm going to go back.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:16.720
And we have 1s alpha, 1s
beta, 2s alpha, 2s beta.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.290
And so for the ground
state of helium 1s

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.080
squared, and we would do this.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.540
And the stick
diagrams are great,

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:36.750
because it's easier to see on
a picture, who are the actors,

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.880
and have I included all of them,
or have I left something out?

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.570
And so now we're interested
in the stick diagram

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:52.020
for the 1s 2s configuration.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:58.090
And there are several kinds
of 1s/2s configurations,

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.300
depending on what the
alpha and beta are.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:05.020
So we have 1s alpha, 2s alpha.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:11.645
And we have 1s alpha, 2s beta.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:29.830
1s beta, 2s alpha, 2s
alpha, 1s beta, 2s beta.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:33.370
So there's four guys, and we can
put our arrows on these things,

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:40.010
and we know everything we
need to know about these guys.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.050
It tells us what to do.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:57.420
Well, when we do this, the
diagonal matrix elements

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:02.990
of the 1 over rij
Hamiltonian can be expressed.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.620
And we use this notation,
J tilde minus K tilde.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.980
So for every two-electron thing,
we're going to get this kind

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.730
of--

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:33.470
now these are simple integrals,
and some of them are 0.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:37.805
Because this doesn't
operate on spins.

00:30:37.805 --> 00:30:58.150
And so if you had a 1s alpha,
2s beta, 1 over rij, 1s beta,

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:09.050
2s alpha, then the 1s alpha
with the 1s beta is 0.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:14.600
The 1s alpha with the 2s
alpha is not 0, et cetera.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.500
There are all sorts of stuff.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.025
But this tilde notation
says, well, this

00:31:20.025 --> 00:31:22.430
is what we start with,
and we have to convert it

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.950
into things that really matter.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.850
So the operation of
removing the tilde

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:32.990
requires a little bit of
work, a little bit of thought.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:36.680
And that's why my
notes are crap,

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:43.370
because I can't explain it well
enough to really teach this.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:32:02.790
So when we do the
1s squared, the J 1s

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:10.240
squared tilde, is equal
to the J 1s squared,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.250
because the spins take
care of themselves.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:22.840
But k tilde 1s
squared is equal to 0.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:27.700
Because when we
do 1s squared, we

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.120
have an alpha with
an alpha for the J

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.320
term, and an alpha with
the beta for the K term.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.890
And alpha with beta is 0,
because the operator cannot

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.790
change the alpha into beta.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.150
So this tilde notation
is a convenient thing,

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.960
because you can use
any Slater determinant,

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.020
and you can express it
in terms of J's and K's.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:04.310
And the sign comes
from switching

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.410
the order of the orbitals.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.140
That's how the
determinants work.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.740
And so you're going to see
a whole bunch of stuff.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.210
But removing the tildes
is the tricky business.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:22.400
OK, now when you
get a problem where

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:34.590
you have a configuration
where a single Slater is not

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:35.668
sufficient--

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:45.230
in other words, in order to
make an eigenstate of s squared

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:51.230
or sz, you sometimes
need two or more Slaters,

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:54.260
and you have to use a particular
linear combination of them

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:59.750
to get the right
value of s and sz.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.030
And then what happens
is you're looking

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:10.179
at matrix elements of the 1 over
rij operator, between Slaters.

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:12.170
Now this is a headache.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.820
And I could talk until
I'm blue in the face,

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.679
and I cannot make it
clear how to do this.

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:24.090
Because it's just awful.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:28.420
But some things in life
are worth suffering for.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:36.929
And so anyway, in
the 1s, 2s situation,

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:42.150
when you do everything
right, you get--

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.179
this is just a general notation
for a two-electron wave

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:46.199
function--

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:52.469
1 over r12, psi 2.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:56.460
So these guys are eigenfunctions
of s squared and sz.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:05.500
And when you do that,
you get 1/2 times 2 J,

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:13.960
1s, 2s, minus or
plus 2K, 1s, 2s.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:19.840
Remember, when you have
mismatched alpha and beta,

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.920
the K's are 0.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.780
But when you have K, the 1 over
rij matrix element between two

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.620
Slaters, you can fix that.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.550
And so this is why it's so
hard to explain, because--

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:36.460
yes, I'm not even going
to apologize anymore.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.780
OK, so this is what you do.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.480
And the notes are pretty
clear about how to do them,

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.950
and what the problems are.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.170
But lecturing on it would
be a little bit hard.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.970
OK, so now what are we
going to do with it?

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:57.840
Well, we'd like qualitative
stuff and interpretive stuff.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.835
Qualitative is Hund's rules.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:19.352
Now if you looked at 100
textbooks, I think 95% of them

00:36:19.352 --> 00:36:20.560
will have Hund's rules wrong.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.860
You're never going
to make that mistake.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.200
And interpretive-- well, we want
to know the trends of things,

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.560
and we want to be
able to do something

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.831
like what you did in freshman
chemistry on shielding.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.600
Now you probably memorized some
rules about what shields what.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.410
But I'm going to give
you a little bit more

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:46.250
insight into that.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.625
So we're going to
talk about this

00:36:47.625 --> 00:36:48.980
for the rest of the lecture.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:37:01.340
OK, so you specify
a configuration.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:08.180
And this configuration might
be two electrons, two spin

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:11.645
orbitals, two orbitals
times e, or three, or 10.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:20.950
And often, when you specify
the occupied orbitals,

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:26.120
you neglect the
field ones, which

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:30.170
is nice, because you have
fewer things to worry about.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:34.750
Because field
orbitals have spin 0.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.140
And you don't have
to do anything.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.220
They're automatically
asymmetrized,

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.510
and they basically act
as a charged distribution

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:49.630
in the core that is sampled
by the electrons outside.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.870
And so you need some
sort of a set of rules

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.320
for how does that work.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.810
And that's shielding.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.720
So first, we specify
a configuration.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.470
And you also learned-- in
high school, probably--

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:10.750
how to determine the
L, S, J terms that

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:14.590
result from this configuration
by some magical crossing-out

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.170
of boxes.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.670
And if you didn't, I'm glad.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:21.870
Because it would have
just clouded your mind,

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:26.410
and caused earlier
insanity than MIT causes.

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:31.520
So anyway, so we have
orbital angular momentum.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.310
And we can add the
orbital angular

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:37.300
momenta of the electrons
following certain rules.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.650
And we have spin
angular momentum.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:46.934
And J is equal to the
vector sum of L and S.

00:38:46.934 --> 00:38:51.470
And we say we have an LS term--

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:55.910
like triplet P.
And it can have J

00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:06.860
is equal to L plus S, L plus
S minus 1, down to L minus S

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.050
absolute value.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.000
These are the possible J's.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.520
And so Hund's
rules is all about,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:18.650
of all of the states that belong
to a particular configuration,

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.840
which one is the lowest?

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.910
One-- which one, not
the second lowest.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:25.040
Which one is the lowest?

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.330
And why do we care?

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.510
Because in statistical
mechanics everything

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:33.380
is dominated by the
lowest energy state.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.340
And so if you can figure out
what is the lowest energy

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.790
state, you've basically got
as much as most people are

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.430
going to want.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:48.280
So you want to know what are L,
S, and J for the lowest energy

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.040
state of a configuration.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.830
Configurations are typically
far apart in energy.

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:58.210
So if you know what the lowest
energy configuration is,

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.210
and the lowest energy state of
it, as far as your friends--

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:03.730
the statistical
machinations, you

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.590
can tell them how to write
their partition functions.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.490
And the rest is details.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.710
And mostly, you
don't want details.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.779
If your friends tell
you they want details,

00:40:13.779 --> 00:40:15.820
well, you tell them, this
is what you have to do,

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.420
but it's no simple
three Hund's rules.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.910
OK, so Hund's rules--

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.840
you look at all of the
L, S, J states that

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.860
are possible for a
particular configuration.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:34.530
And you can use the crossing
out of ML/MS boxes if you want.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.790
And I could tell you
why you would do that.

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:41.170
But I don't want to cause
insanity at this stage, either.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.180
But I'm an expert at that.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.370
And you can also use
lowering operators

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:50.370
to generate all the states,
once you know stuff.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:57.820
OK, so once you
know all the states,

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:04.410
Hund says, which one of
these has the largest S?

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.666
which one?

00:41:05.666 --> 00:41:07.860
And that's easy to know.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:14.610
And for example, if
you had 2p squared,

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:26.730
you're going to get singlet
D, triplet P, and singlet S.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.210
And well, here's the triplet.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.440
That has the largest
S. So the triplet P

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.250
is the lowest energy state.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:43.850
Now if there were multiple
triplets, as there would be,

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:56.340
say, for 2p3d, then
you'd have to decide

00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:01.030
which of those
triplets is the lowest.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.610
And all you care about,
all you're allowed to say

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.380
is which one is the lowest.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:10.900
And it's the one
with the maximum L.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:15.610
And then the last step
is, what is the lowest

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.940
J for that LS state?

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.740
And that's kind of cute.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:25.580
Because you have the
P shell, there's--

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:46.320
for a P shell, you can have six
P orbitals to fill the shells.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:51.450
1 alpha, 1 beta, 0
alpha, 0 beta, et cetera.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.515
So the degeneracy
of a P orbital is 6.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:05.690
If you have p to N,
where N is less than 3,

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:08.630
you have a
less-than-half-filled shell.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:19.430
And then lowest is J equal
L minus S, absolute value.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:24.680
And if N is greater than 3,
you have the lowest being--

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:29.060
the highest possible value
of J is equal to L plus S--

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.310
so for L, N greater than 3.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:35.410
And now when you have
a half-filled shell,

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:48.114
the lowest state is usually
an S state with maximum spin.

00:43:48.114 --> 00:43:49.030
But it doesn't matter.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:55.000
When you have less-than or
more-than-half-filled shell,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.300
you have generally a state with
orbital angular momentum not

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.890
equal to 0.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:02.260
And you have spin orbit
splitting of that.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.160
And so you do want to
care what is the lowest J.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.580
But when N is equal
to 3, the lowest state

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.870
is usually an S state.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:12.520
It doesn't have a
spin orbit splitting,

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:20.440
and it just has one value of J,
which is whatever the spin is.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:27.190
So Hund's rules tell
you how to identify,

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:32.030
without knowing beans, what
is the lowest energy state,

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.300
and it's never wrong.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.280
Well, maybe sometimes
wrong, but that's

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.410
because of one of
my things where

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.460
you have a perturbation
between states belonging

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.980
to two configurations.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.500
But people get really
excited when they discover

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.140
a violation of Hund's rules.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.730
And it's just trivial.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:53.080
So there is this.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.190
What time is it?

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:58.390
I have a few minutes to talk
about shielding, and I will.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:02.740
OK, so we have a nucleus.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:08.460
And it has a charge of z.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.740
Bare nucleus--
there's no electrons,

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.150
so the atomic number
is the charge.

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:20.430
And then we have a
filled shell around it.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:21.840
It's spherically symmetric.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:30.570
And so if we penetrate
inside of it, what we see--

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:34.500
suppose we penetrate inside,
to this point, what we see

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:40.650
is only the plus z, minus
the number of electrons

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:42.510
inside this sphere.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:48.360
Now if you took Electricity and
Magnetism, you can prove this.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.830
If you didn't,
you can accept it.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:53.760
And so outside the
nucleus, the charge

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.970
is plus one, because
you have a neutral atom.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:01.470
And then when you penetrate
inside this region

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:06.990
of dense charge, and all of
the spins are generally paired,

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.840
this is spherical.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:16.710
So what you end up
seeing is z effective, as

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:19.000
opposed to z true.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
And let's say here here's r0--

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.460
or this is r0.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:33.610
And so beyond r0, the charge
that you see is plus 1.

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:37.830
Add 0, you see a charge of z.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:42.460
And so what ends up happening
is you get z effective,

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:47.440
which is dependent on
distance from the nucleus.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.750
And it goes from
the integer value

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:54.580
that you know, from the
atomic number, down to 1,

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.020
because you've taken
one electron away

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:02.650
from a neutral atom,
and taken it outside.

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:06.550
And now we have
this wonderful thing

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:08.695
called the centrifugal barrier.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:17.800
So if we have a state
that has a non-zero of l--

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.800
well, if we have a state
with a zero value of l,

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:24.710
it can penetrate all the way
into the core, to the nucleus.

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.380
And so that means that
the shielding is less

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.070
for s orbitals.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.270
And now if we have a non-zero
l, it can't get in so far.

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:40.330
And the larger
the l is, the less

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:43.060
it can see this extra charge.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.590
So high l's are
very well shielded.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:47.770
Low l's are not
so well shielded.

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:54.720
And the shielding goes s least
shielded, p, less, so on.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.090
Now there's some other
interesting things.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:03.200
Which, you know, I
hate to say this,

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:12.888
but comparing 5.111
or 5.112 to 3.091,

00:48:12.888 --> 00:48:16.800
there is this business of what
happens when you start to--

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:32.280
you start with potassium, and so
you put an electron in the 4s,

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.560
not in the 3d orbital.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.170
Right?

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:35.670
Why is that?

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:45.210
Well, the 4s sees the larger
charge is less shielded.

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:47.080
So it goes in.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.770
Then when you go from
potassium to calcium,

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:54.370
you put another
electron in this.

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:55.850
And that's true.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:59.190
So for calcium, you
have a 4s squared.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:03.500
And 4s 3d is a
higher-lying state.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.570
Now you take an electron--

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.670
I'm cooking my own goose.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:26.510
If you take one of
these electrons away--

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:28.760
this is not the way I
wanted it to come out--

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:36.170
you find yourself in a 3d state.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:43.450
Because 3D penetrates
a little bit under 4s.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.850
I can't explain it in a way
that's going to make sense.

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.960
I really wanted to,
because I care so much

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.970
about these simple arguments.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:01.390
But I will just be
wasting your time.

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:03.570
So the order in which
you feel orbitals

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.960
comes out, naturally, different
from the order in which you

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.180
remove electrons from orbitals.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:14.140
And the shielding arguments
are capable of explaining that.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:18.670
OK, so this is the end of atoms.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:24.790
And I've asked you to observe
some complicated algebra which

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.500
you're never going
to do, or at least

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.640
never going to do much of.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:33.740
Everything you need
to know about atoms,

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:37.580
you can tell a computer,
and it can do it.

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.885
Now molecules are
much more complicated.

00:50:41.885 --> 00:50:43.760
And that's we're going
to start on next time.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.550
We're going to start with
molecular orbital theory.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:50.510
And I'm not going to be
presenting the normal textbook

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:51.620
approach.

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.500
I'm going to present an
interpretive approach, where

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.660
you understand
why things happen,

00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:01.640
as opposed to memorize just
symmetries, and filling orders,

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.630
and so on.

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.370
OK, I'll see you on Wednesday.
