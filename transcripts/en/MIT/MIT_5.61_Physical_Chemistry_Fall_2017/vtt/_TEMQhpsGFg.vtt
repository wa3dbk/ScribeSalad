00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.050
ROBERT FIELD: Last
time, we talked

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.685
about the photoelectric effect.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.795
What was that?

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:32.275
And what were the
important points?

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.870
Yes?

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.220
AUDIENCE: It's
quantized and has energy

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.630
associated with its frequency.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.460
ROBERT FIELD: Yes.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.500
OK, so, the idea of
quantization of electromagnetic

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.810
radiation and photons.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.010
And the photon has
an energy h times nu.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.720
Nu is the frequency.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:10.070
And the evidence was mostly
from a plot of what versus what.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.820
Somebody else?

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.550
Yes?

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.910
AUDIENCE: Frequency of the
incoming photon versus--

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.390
or, that's the x-axis.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.650
So, kinetic energy
of the ejected

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.910
electron versus frequency.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.140
ROBERT FIELD: Exactly.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.210
And the slope of that plot,
which was h, is universal.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.860
It doesn't matter where
the electron came from.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.670
And this was really
an amazing thing.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.730
And then, the other
thing we talked about

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.100
was Compton scattering.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.410
And what did Compton
scattering tell us?

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:54.360
Yes.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.670
AUDIENCE: Photon
has a momentum--

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.230
ROBERT FIELD: Yes.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.270
AUDIENCE: --transfer.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.130
ROBERT FIELD: We're interested
in the particle-like character

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.039
of what we think of as waves.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.900
And we saw that the
waves were particles.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.360
And particles-- or
at least packets.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.620
And these packets had
definite momentum.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.590
And that was a
wonderful observation.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.900
So, today, this is the menu of
what I'm going to talk about.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.420
And at the end, there's
a magic word, "spectra."

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.570
And I like that
because what we're

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.840
going to be discovering today
is that the internal structure

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.220
of atoms and molecules--

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.370
we are not allowed to observe it
directly, but it's surprising.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.520
And it's encoded in something
which we can observe,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.370
which is a spectrum.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.520
And the spectrum that I
will show you at the end

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.500
is one that is--

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.470
contains essentially
no information,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.575
but acts as a template
for what we really

00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:10.950
want to know about how things
are different from hydrogen

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.560
atom.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.590
And that's the beginning of our
exploration of the structure

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.880
of atoms and molecules.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.190
It's through the spectrum and
it's how it's different from--

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.150
in subtle ways-- the spectrum
of the hydrogen atom.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:40.170
OK, so, we're going to turn our
focus today to the electron,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.240
as opposed to light.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.480
And we're going to
play the same game.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.490
We know the electron
is a particle.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.700
Does anyone want to tell
me why we know that?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.590
Is there any-- anybody
who's got a clue?

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.880
You can-- oh, good.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.520
Yes.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.231
AUDIENCE: There's an experiment
with the little oil drops,

00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:00.980
where they suspended
them and found that--

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.240
ROBERT FIELD: Yes.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.290
AUDIENCE: --charge is quantized.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.831
ROBERT FIELD: I love
that experiment.

00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:05.200
That's the Millikan experiment.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.270
One of the reasons I love it is
because Millikan and Mulliken

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.850
are two different people.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.269
So I find that it's really easy
to come up with one of them.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.560
And I remember Mulliken
is a spectroscopist

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.110
and Millikan was a
different kind of physicist.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
But they're both famous and
they both have connections

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.020
to important universities--

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.890
University of Chicago for
Millikan and Mulliken, MIT

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.390
and Caltech.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.580
So we're going to be
looking at something

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.020
that we know is a particle.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.510
And we're going to show that
it has wave characteristics.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:11.430
We want to be able to show that
the electron has a wavelength

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.400
and it follows the
same equation that we

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.730
use to describe the behavior
of electromagnetic radiation.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:28.350
So how would we control the
momentum of an electron?

00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:34.340
Yes.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.298
AUDIENCE: So you can
control the kinetic energy

00:05:36.298 --> 00:05:39.910
that it has by putting it
through a certain potential.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.610
ROBERT FIELD: OK, so, we
know we can easily measure

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.110
the momentum of a particle.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.860
That's not a big challenge.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.155
But then how would we
measure its wavelength?

00:05:55.911 --> 00:05:56.410
Yes.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.280
AUDIENCE: Some type
of diffraction?

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.900
ROBERT FIELD: Yes.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.100
We basically use some
material, which acts a ruler.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.290
We have a thin metal foil and
the distances between atoms

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.820
in the foil are constant.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.570
So that's the ruler
against which we measure

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.530
the wavelength of light.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:29.630
And we'll talk about the
Davisson-Germer experiment,

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.900
where we measure the wavelength.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.060
And then we'll talk about the
Geiger-Marsden experiment,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.070
where we say, well, atoms
have electrons in them.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.580
And what is the
structure of an atom?

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.950
Remember, we can't look inside.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.490
So we have to use some
kind of an experiment

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.550
to be able to look
inside the atom.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:04.890
Now, physicists have one
trick they often use.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.980
To find out the internal
structure of something,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.890
they shoot a
particle, or a wave,

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:16.080
at it that has a wavelength
comparable to the distances

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.330
you're hoping to measure.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:26.440
So if you have a very high
energy probe particle,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.080
it will have a very
short wavelength

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.960
and it will look sort
of like a bullet.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.830
And we know how bullets scatter
off of targets or hit targets.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.650
We also, if we
choose the wavelength

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.930
to be comparable to
the distances we're

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:47.870
expecting to measure, then
we're going to see diffraction.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.950
This is a kind of subject that
lends itself to exam questions.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.110
So let's start out by talking
about the Geiger-Marsden

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.910
experiment--

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.140
I mean, the
Davisson-Germer experiment.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:18.260
So we have a beam of X-rays
or a beam of electrons--

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.610
either one.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.585
And we have an aluminum foil.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.700
And we have-- it's
just an intense beam.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.330
We want to stop most of it
before it hits a detector.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.520
And, so, this is some
kind of a screen or--

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.590
So what we're
looking for is, when

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:59.930
the X-rays or the electrons
scatter off of this ruler,

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:09.910
we get something that appears on
the screen as pairs of circles.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.980
This is the powder
pattern because this

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.580
is a multi-crystalline object.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:33.310
But in each object, we have a
bunch of equally-spaced atoms,

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.670
where this is the
lattice constant

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:40.080
and this is the square root of
2 times the lattice constant.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.440
So each atom has
nearest neighbors

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.470
and second-nearest neighbors.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.080
So we have two rulers going on.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.260
And one ruler will
give one set of rings

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.050
and the other ruler will give
a different set of rings.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.790
And because these particles
are randomly oriented,

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.480
instead of having
spots, you have circles.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.990
And there's all sorts of
information in these powder

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.560
patterns.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.900
But basically,
they're saying, well,

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.390
we're seeing a
structure which is

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.650
related to something we know.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:19.680
How would we know the distance
between atoms in a foil?

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.891
Using macroscopic measurements?

00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:23.390
Yes.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.210
You're hot today.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.710
AUDIENCE: You have
access to density

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.130
and you have access to
the non-atomic weight.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.540
ROBERT FIELD: That's it, yes.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.310
So it's a simple matter
to know at least what is

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.660
the magnitude of the distance.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:42.104
There is an issue of what
is the crystal structure.

00:10:42.104 --> 00:10:43.520
And there are
different structures

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.500
and that will give rise
to different features

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.030
in the powder pattern.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.540
But the important
thing is we do this.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:59.420
We look at the pattern that
emerges when we shoot X-rays

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.405
at this screen.

00:11:01.405 --> 00:11:05.180
And we already know that
X-rays have wavelengths.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.240
And we know that
they have momentum.

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:19.580
We know about the
scattering of photons.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.960
And as a result,
we know that we can

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:30.410
predict exactly what the pattern
associated with the X-ray

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.790
scattering is going to be.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.440
And then we do the same
thing with electrons.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.720
And now for the electrons,
we can control the momentum.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.190
That's easy.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.560
And what we want to know
is what is the wavelength.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.710
And we have the
wavelength of the X-rays.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:05.230
And so what we do is we vary the
momentum of the electrons until

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.590
the powder pattern
for the electron--

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.200
the diffraction pattern
for the electron--

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.020
is exactly the same
as the diffraction

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.960
pattern for the X-ray.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.950
And we discover that,
for the electron,

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:30.320
we have the same result.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.400
OK, so, we have, now, photons.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.730
They have wavelengths.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:42.770
And the momentum was the
surprise for the photons.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:47.770
And we have particles, which
have wavelengths and momentum.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.870
And the wavelength was a
surprise for the particle.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.790
So it doesn't matter.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.830
Everything follows
this equation.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:05.380
And this equation was
anticipated by de Broglie who,

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.560
in his PhD thesis--

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.820
you know, he's a
person about your age--

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.980
and he wrote his thesis in 1924.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.320
And, among other
brilliant things,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.585
he said that everything should
follow this simple equation.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:29.220
And that was a brave statement.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:36.570
And it predicted
that de Broglie was

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.180
going to make a lot of brilliant
statements in his career.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.800
And this was just the first of--

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.140
and one of the nicest--

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.210
but we'll hear a little
bit more about de Broglie

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.580
by the time I'm finished
with this lecture.

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:04.580
So, we're now
worried about atoms.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.725
And we already know that atoms
have a diameter, roughly.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.870
We know that from the
density, the typical size

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.820
we like to have--

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.500
quantities that describe
macroscopic objects.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:32.060
Which are not like 10 to the
minus 20, but like 1 to 100.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:37.590
And so, the angstrom unit, which
is 10 to the minus 10 meters,

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.190
is a very useful thing
for talking about sizes

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.130
of atoms and molecules.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:54.520
So if we have an atom of
a size about one angstrom,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:01.850
we can use this
equation to say, well,

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:06.670
what would it take for an
electron to fit inside an atom?

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.280
So we specify this--

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.740
we know this, we know that--

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:20.330
and that determines what the
momentum would have to be.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.930
And these are all
simple calculations.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.880
And since I don't like doing
calculations on the board,

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.520
and I don't really
need to do this now--

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.880
you need to be able
to do them, quickly,

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.560
if I ask you on the exam.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.040
But basically, what
we end up finding out

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.620
is that the velocity
of the electron

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:54.150
would have to be 7.25 times
10 to the 6 meters per second.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.520
Which is OK, it's pretty fast.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.640
It's a few percent of
the speed of light.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.790
But that would correspond
to a kinetic energy,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:13.290
which is 2.4 times 10
to the minus 7 joules.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:17.840
Remember, I don't like
these kinds of units.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.470
But it also corresponds to--

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.820
doing a unit conversion--

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.180
149 electron volts.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.750
Electron volts are a good
unit for energy for atoms

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.650
because the ionization energy--

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.160
the energy it takes to pull
an electron off of an atom--

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:45.210
is always somewhere between
five and 15 electron volts.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.650
So you always want to calibrate
yourself, your insight,

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:52.460
in terms of numbers which
are in the small scale,

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.870
rather than having to
remember the exponent.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.870
All right, 149 electron volts.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.950
Should that bother you?

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.930
Well, it can't bother
you yet because you

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:11.130
don't know about what
the ionization energy is.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.420
But I just told you.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.579
It's between five and 15.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:19.089
This is a factor
of 10-- too big.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:22.839
So this is going
to be a problem.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.680
How is it possible
for things so small

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:32.920
to have an electron fitting in
that small size without it just

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.740
leaving because it's
just way too high energy?

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.560
And so that leads us to
ask questions about, well,

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.680
what is the internal
structure of an atom?

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.370
How can an atom somehow
accommodate this electron which

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.275
needs to somehow fit inside?

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:03.630
So that was the basis for the
Geiger-Marsden experiment.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.800
Now, the Geiger-Marsden
experiment

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:16.470
looks very similar to
the previous experiment.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.750
And here we have--

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.430
whoops-- alpha particles.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:27.820
Alpha particles are
helium-2 plus ions.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.850
And they're produced
by radioactive decay.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.880
And they have a tremendous
amount of energy.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.230
More energy than was
possible in the days

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:43.380
these experiments we're doing
to create for a particle.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:49.590
In fact, one of the
earliest experiments,

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.400
or apparatuses, capable
of producing very high

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.780
energy electrons was built
by Robert Van de Graaff, here

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.160
at MIT.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:06.330
And this was in the form
of cylindrical towers,

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.430
right near the parking garage.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.910
And it was there for the
first 10 years I was at MIT.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.750
I'm very old, but that's
still fairly recent.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:19.110
But anyway, Van de Graaff could
make high energy particles

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.880
and it was really neat.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.420
And what he could do
was dwarfed by what

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.790
can be done in electron
accelerators, now.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:34.410
But in the days when the
Geiger-Marsden experiment was

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:42.290
done, which was 1911,
there was no way of making

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.640
and controlling the
energy of an electron--

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.650
or of any particle.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.380
And here we have
some particles which

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.780
are produced by
radioactive decay, which

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.010
have tremendous energy.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.140
So they're heavy and
they have high energy.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.790
And so that means the
wavelength is very small.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.550
We want to use
these helium ions.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.902
Yes?

00:20:13.902 --> 00:20:15.886
AUDIENCE: Could you
not also control

00:20:15.886 --> 00:20:19.370
the energy of each particle as
they're passing through, right?

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.490
ROBERT FIELD: Yes.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:26.560
But you would need
a very high voltage.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.360
And though that is
something we could imagine

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.490
doing now, but in
1911, the ability

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:43.060
to do that sort of thing
with control was not there.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.150
There needed to be advances
in vacuum technology.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.570
There needed to be
advances in power supplies.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:55.560
I mean, we're talking
about very high voltages.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.890
And you wouldn't want to
do that in your laboratory,

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.382
even now with the capability.

00:21:02.382 --> 00:21:04.090
I remember when I was
a graduate student,

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.510
we had these things called
Spellman power supplies.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.090
And they could
produce 40 kilovolts.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.050
They were really scary.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.290
But that's nothing
compared to what you need.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.570
OK, so, we want bullets.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:24.200
We want to have these
helium particles interacting

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:30.015
with a thin metal foil.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:44.740
We have a whole
array of atoms here.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.220
And we have a little hole here.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.460
And what's going to
happen is this radiation

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.990
is going to hit these atoms.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.120
And there's going
to be backscatter

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.250
and forward scattering.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.520
And the crucial
experiment was to measure

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.590
the ratio of backscattering
to forward scattering.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:12.060
Now, if we have a target that
looks sort of like a smear,

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.990
then the forward and backward
scattering would be similar.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:24.250
If we have a target that looked
like a bunch of tiny points,

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.840
there would very rarely
be backscattering.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.870
All of the scattering
would be forward

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.390
because most of the
particles don't hit anything.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.130
And so what was found,
and what was the surprise,

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:45.750
is that there was very
little backscattering.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:50.470
And that implied that
the ratio of the size

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:55.800
of the target to the size of
the particle was enormous.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.110
The particles that scattered--

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:04.350
the alpha particles-- were tiny.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.240
They had a size--

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.580
something like 10 to the minus
4 times the typical dimension

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.720
of an atom.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.780
So this is jellium.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.450
And this is a perfectly
reasonable approach.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.820
That the positive and negative
charges that make up an atom

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.234
are distributed uniformly.

00:23:28.234 --> 00:23:29.150
This was the surprise.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:42.540
How do we explain,
now, if atoms that

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.880
are scattering the
alpha particles

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.325
are really small, even
compared to the one angstrom?

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.830
Well, how do they
stick together?

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:58.220
Why is matter not compressable?

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.630
So what is going on here?

00:24:05.933 --> 00:24:09.590
Now, I'm not exactly sure
of the genealogy here,

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:14.420
but Geiger and Marsden
were workers, or students,

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.150
in the Rutherford lab.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:22.780
And the old man wanted to save
face or to say, oh, here's

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:23.530
an experiment.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.430
We learned something from this.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.360
You know, this is what
we do-- this is my job.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.980
But anyway, Rutherford said,
well, maybe it's like this.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:40.000
We have a nucleus and
we have the electrons.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.210
So we have a nucleus where
all the positive charge

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.330
of the atom, and most
of the mass, resides.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.705
And we have electrons
in circular orbits.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.590
So maybe these
circular orbits explain

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:02.830
why you can't compress
atoms to something

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.940
that would be commensurate
with the size of the nuclei.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:12.490
That the electrons cause a
repulsion and the structure

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.990
is stable.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.570
So this is a pretty
reasonable hypothesis

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:18.860
until one analyzes it.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.340
So what we have is a
positive charge here,

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.410
negative charge here.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.740
And so, there is
Coulomb attraction

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.430
and there's centrifugal force,
or centripetal acceleration.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:39.840
And we have to have
these two things match.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.100
So the inward force
is minus the charge

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:49.320
on the electron squared
over 4 by epsilon 0

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.080
and 1 over r squared.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.435
And the centrifugal, it's--

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.760
OK, this is-- you know all this.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.640
You know to do this.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.520
Have known it since
high school, probably.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.240
And so, you can combine all
these things, say the inward

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.000
and outward-- the
inward force is exactly

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.980
canceling the outward force.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.300
And you can solve
for the velocity.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:38.950
And the velocity is q over
the electron squared over 4

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:43.910
by epsilon 0 mass
of the electron

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:48.260
and the radius of the
orbit, square root.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.000
This is a trivial derivation.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.760
I won't insult you by
attempting to do it and try

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.320
to increase your
understanding of the equation,

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.070
because you already
understand it.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.840
So this is the
requirement for the radius

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.060
of the circular orbit.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.000
And it has the mass--

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.180
I mean, this is the
requirement for the velocity.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.830
And this is the radius, here.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.380
So we know all that.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:19.080
There is nothing about
quantization, yet.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.430
We know that for any
radius, the electron

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.710
will have a certain velocity.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.620
And we can choose
whatever radius,

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.750
we want whatever
velocity we want.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.410
And that corresponds to
whatever energy we get.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:51.410
What we're interested in is
the frequency of the orbit.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.890
And so that will
be 1 over the time

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:57.590
it takes for the
electron to go around.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.160
And 1 over the time it takes
for electron to go around

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.520
is 2 pi r, the circumference,
divided by the velocity.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:12.055
So we have the
velocity is equal to--

00:28:12.055 --> 00:28:15.760
I mean, the frequency is
equal to 1 over 2 pi r.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.860
And we can write an
equation for this.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.110
And that's in the notes.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:26.390
In fact, there was
a typo in the notes.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.570
Which has been
corrected and read.

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.920
But I don't need to
tell you what it is.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.170
We can calculate this frequency.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.790
The reason we
calculate the frequency

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:47.920
is because we know if we have
electrons moving back and forth

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.120
at some frequency,
they're going to radiate

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.590
electromagnetic radiation
at that frequency.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.240
Well, where did that
energy come from?

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.550
It came from the
motion of the electron.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.580
So it has to give
up kinetic energy.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:10.300
Now, the energy is
the kinetic energy

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.830
plus the potential energy.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:23.590
So if it gives up energy,
some of these two things

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.700
has to decrease.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.370
And what happens
is this decreases

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.620
faster that this increases.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:42.140
And what ends up happening
is that the electron

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.370
has a death spiral.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.630
What happens will be
that the electron will

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:55.610
go in a spiral, going
faster and faster as it

00:29:55.610 --> 00:30:02.450
goes to smaller and smaller
radius, and annihilate itself.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.930
So this is garbage.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.550
This can't be true.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:12.230
It violates laws that
everybody knows are right.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:16.970
So one needs to find a
way to live with this.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.370
Now, one really doesn't
need to find a way

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.835
to live with it until
you realize what happens.

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:37.160
Because this picture, subject
to a couple of hypotheses,

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.580
predicts an infinite
number of 10-digit numbers.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.700
It's not an accident.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.070
Maybe one prediction
would be fine.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:53.500
But all of the lines in the
spectra of hydrogen atom,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.070
helium ion, lithium
doubly-charged ion, all

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:02.050
of those are predicted with
no adjustable parameters

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.760
to measurement accuracy.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.310
Now, at the time
this was being done,

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:10.790
the measurement accuracy might
have been only a part in 1,000,

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.170
or maybe a part in a million.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.940
But a part in 10 to the
10th, beyond that we're

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.700
starting to get into
fundamental physics.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.280
But this is an
astonishing thing.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:28.080
And so I have to explain what
the additional assumptions were

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.650
because we've got something
that predicts things

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.790
we have no business knowing.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:37.440
And there was no
explanation for the spectrum

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:43.920
before these experiments, or
this picture, was developed.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:50.690
So we have to first find a way,
whether it's believable or not,

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:55.250
of getting rid of the
radiative collapse.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:32:07.785
So Bohr proposed that
angular momentum, l vector r

00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:12.590
cross p is conserved.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:16.700
Well, we know that angular
momentum is conserved.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.450
But for a microscopic system,
what it means to be conserved

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:24.210
may be a little bit more subtle.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:26.920
He proposed that angular
momentum is conserved

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:31.840
and that the angular momentum,
the magnitude of the angular

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.510
momentum, had to have
a particular value.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:46.640
And that value was
integer times h bar.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:52.090
h bar is the Planck's
constant divided by 2 pi.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.940
Now, this is complete nonsense.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.464
Why should it be conserved?

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.395
Why should it be restricted
to this set of values?

00:33:08.875 --> 00:33:14.650
Well, the reason we accept
that it's restricted

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:22.130
is because it gives the energy
levels that are observed.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.270
Now, before I get to
energy level-- well, I do.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.700
OK, we have energy levels.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:36.665
We find that the energy is equal
to minus some constant over n

00:33:36.665 --> 00:33:37.165
squared.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.560
Same n as in here.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.870
This is the Rydberg constant.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:49.740
And it's something
that you can measure.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.887
It's basically a whole bunch of
fundamental constants combined.

00:33:54.887 --> 00:33:55.845
And so, it has a value.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.118
This is one of the numbers
in my permanent memory.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.280
And that's the value
of the Rydberg constant

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.670
in reciprocal centimeter units.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:24.439
And to get it into energy units
you multiply by h times c,

00:34:24.439 --> 00:34:26.480
or to get it into frequency,
you just multiply it

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.010
by the speed of light.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.080
So, anyway, this
is a number that is

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.960
known to many decimal places.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:42.790
And it is generated by this
idea that the angular momentum

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.400
has to be certain values.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.590
Conservation is
good, that's easy.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.929
This is weird.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:54.159
And it's also wrong
because we find out

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:58.510
later that the possible
values of n include 0.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:08.130
Which would completely
mess up the Bohr model.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:13.140
But, anyway, this,
then, in combination

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:18.360
with this amazing
statement that--

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:24.510
OK, we have the nth energy
and the n prime-th energy.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:32.670
And the spectrum corresponds
to the frequency, corresponds

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:41.954
to e n minus e n prime, over h.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.390
So everything we see in
the emission spectrum

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:54.660
of the hydrogen
atom, or in a gas--

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.610
which is mostly H2--

00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:00.810
there are transitions
associated with the free atoms.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:05.070
And they're always around
this simple equation,

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:08.550
based on the Rydberg equation.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:12.840
This says the spectra are
telling us about the energy

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.190
level differences.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:19.300
And it's a simple equation.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.190
And it's true.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.010
It's true at incredibly
high accuracy.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:30.000
And it tells you nothing except
the mass of the particle.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.150
Because the mass
of the particle--

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.340
for this Rydberg
equation-- we have

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.140
it expressed in terms of
the mass of the electron.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.610
But it really should be the
reduced mass of the mass

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:45.270
of the nucleus times the
mass of the electron,

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:50.250
or the mass of the nucleus
plus the mass of the electron.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.280
And this is something we know
for all two-body interactions.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.370
That was known well before
the time of these experiments.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:00.870
If you have two
things interacting,

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.420
the reduced mass is
what you want rather

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.400
than the individual masses.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.350
And so, the only information
in these one-electron spectra

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:15.130
is the mass of the nucleus.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:23.290
And there's not much difference
in this reduced mass effect.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:26.830
But it's enough to say this
is a spectrum of hydrogen,

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.180
as opposed to lithium 2 plus.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.990
OK, but we still
have a problem--

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.420
a very serious problem.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.860
Why is the angular
momentum conserved?

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.910
Why is the angular momentum
forced to have a certain value?

00:38:00.964 --> 00:38:03.130
Well, I've really finished
this lecture pretty fast.

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:18.560
Let me just get to the
end and I will go back.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:28.050
All right, so, the
problem is this electron

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.930
is assumed to be a particle
and it's assumed to be moving.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:38.100
So the equation--

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.260
Maxwell's equations--
all of the equations

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.940
about motion of
charged particles

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.410
say if it's moving
it's going to radiate,

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.346
whereas if it's oscillating,
it's going to radiate.

00:38:49.346 --> 00:38:51.220
So maybe the problem is
that it's not moving.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:39:00.940
Remember, the particles are
both particles and waves.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:10.420
So we could imagine that,
around this circular orbit,

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.850
we have standing waves--

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.450
no motion.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.860
And this led to this
Schrodinger equation,

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:28.105
which talks about the states of
the electrons that are allowed.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.610
It's basically the
classical wave equation,

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:37.070
with a couple little twists.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.530
And the thing about
waves, you remember,

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:44.590
we can have constructive and
destructive interference.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.760
We can have standing waves.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.320
So there doesn't need to be
a motion of our particle.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.890
There could be some
static description

00:39:55.890 --> 00:40:00.780
of the probability of finding
the electron everywhere

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.950
around this orbit.

00:40:05.351 --> 00:40:06.850
And that's the
Schrodinger equation.

00:40:13.657 --> 00:40:15.240
In the next lecture,
I'm going to talk

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.160
about the classical
wave equation, which

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.220
will be the warm-up for
the Schrodinger equation.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:26.710
And the Schrodinger equation
explains everything.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:29.410
People have made
some really fantastic

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:31.960
philosophical statements
about the Schrodinger.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.010
It contains everything
that we need to know.

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:39.460
The problem is we can't
solve the equation exactly.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.900
But it's true.

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.280
And it contains
everything that we'd ever

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:49.600
want to know about the
microscopic structure of atoms

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.880
and molecules.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:56.320
So we've been led by these
very simple experiments, which,

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.150
now, you could do--

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.960
really trivially.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.110
You wouldn't have to be a smart
student of a smart advisor,

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:03.520
or stupid advisor.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.160
You would be able to
do these experiments.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.100
And you could say, yeah,
this is all very weird,

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:15.300
but know now we know that
spectra are everything.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.380
And I'm a spectroscopist.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.680
I'm very proud of
this because the idea

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.250
that you can make
a few measurements

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:28.200
and say something about the
internal structure of an atom

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.910
or molecule--

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:32.520
that's a fantastic thing.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.690
And what we've seen--

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:38.310
the spectrum of
one-electron atoms--

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.410
is something which
is really simple.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:46.140
It's the template for
understanding all complexity.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:50.160
Because everything is
different from hydrogen.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.340
Hydrogen has a point
charge at the center.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.240
It's not quite a point charge,
and that's actually a subject

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.470
of even modern physics.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:05.580
And other atoms are
not a point charge

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.070
because they have electrons.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:12.290
And so there is a
concentration of charge--

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:17.970
the thing to which the electron
is attached is space filling.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:22.650
So that results in a shift
at the energy levels.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:24.900
And the shift at the
energy levels, and how

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.050
that shift depends on the
orbital angular momentum,

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:30.300
tells you something about
the shape of this charge

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.800
distribution--

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.840
the radial shape.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.280
So everything we
do in spectroscopy

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.560
is somehow referenced
to something

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:47.180
we understand perfectly, but
which is not of much interest.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.940
But it's a template for
building up our understanding

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.380
of everything.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.900
And this is a kind of
a radical statement.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:59.070
And I get to say this
because I'm up here

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:00.930
and I do this for a living.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:04.230
I mean-- not teaching,
but research.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:09.000
And I really believe
that the things

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.310
that we are enabled to observe
about the microscopic structure

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:18.860
of things are encoded
in something completely

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.320
unlike looking at it.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.450
And our job is to figure
out how to break that code.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:30.480
And that's what I've done for
the last 50 years and it's fun.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.430
OK, so, what more could
I say to amuse you

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:37.200
for five-- six minutes?

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.890
Not much, because I've skipped
a lot of really great stuff.

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.690
But go back to de Broglie.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:50.460
De Broglie had the
hypothesis that there

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.560
is an integer number
of wavelengths

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.260
around the circular orbit.

00:43:55.260 --> 00:44:00.220
And that was telling
you that it's stable

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:03.850
because if it weren't an
integer number of wavelengths,

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:07.530
the electron would
self annihilate.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:14.110
But that takes a valid
point and moves it

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:17.320
into something which
is a little bit wrong.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:22.480
Because we're not trying
to have a particle moving,

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.920
we're having a distribution
of probabilities.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:31.370
And there are still wavelengths
and nodal structures.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:36.140
And the stable solutions
do involve the particle

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.540
not self annihilating.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:45.690
And so, de Broglie
scores another triple.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.170
I mean, he didn't come up
with the Schrodinger equation.

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:53.980
So that's the home run that
says, OK, we have the material,

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.380
now to explain everything.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:02.180
The next lecture will
be just introducing

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:06.950
the mathematics of the wave
equation and the crucial ideas.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:10.190
And that will lead into the
following lecture, where we all

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.290
talk about the
Schrodinger equation.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.210
So I can stop now.

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:15.760
Thanks.
