00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.750
PROFESSOR: Today's lecture is
on intermolecular interactions.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.600
And it's really one of
these favorite topics

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.320
where I can say, well,
this is the origin of life.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.150
How do gases actually condense?

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.410
And we can build a really,
really simple theory

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.630
for how gases condense
based on what we know,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.180
based on second order
perturbation theory,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.580
based on some hand-waving stuff.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.340
And it really is
something from nothing.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.070
But it's also an example of
what we do in physical chemistry

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.220
where we explain one phenomenon
by taking something that

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.210
seems to be unrelated and
building a model around it,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.630
and explaining this
surprising thing.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.110
And that's what's
going to happen today.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.720
We'll talk more about that.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.760
OK, now last time we talked
about wavepacket dynamics.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.060
And so with wavepacket dynamics,
there is first the pluck.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.420
How do you start the system
in some superposition

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.300
of eigenstates?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.320
And then there's the evolution
of the pluck, which is usually

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.890
some kind of particle-like state
that follows Newton's laws.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.150
The center of the wavepacket
follows Newton's laws

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.100
for the position
and the momentum.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.470
But if you make a wavepacket
in a real molecule,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.570
the molecule is going to be
not a harmonic oscillator.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.590
There will be anharmonic effects
which causes the wavepacket

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.200
to de-phase, but the
center of the wavepacket

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.520
continues to move as if it
were in a simple potential.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.130
And it can de-phase, and
rephase, and all sorts

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.180
of complicated stuff.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.850
And that can be
very interesting.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.240
Now, when you take this step
from a diatonic molecule

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.210
to a polyatomic
molecule, you have

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.560
3n minus 6 oscillators
cohabiting in the same house.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.180
And they're going to interact.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.770
And so if you start
a wavepacket on one

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.890
Franck-Condon
bright mode because

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.240
of anharmonic interactions
handled by perturbation theory,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.430
between modes you start to get
this wavepacket leaking out

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.110
into other modes.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.800
And so the expectation
value is going

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.470
to exhibit an oscillating
time dependence associated

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.470
with the bright mode and
some of the dark modes

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.050
that are anharmonically
coupled to the bright mode.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.870
And it can get
pretty complicated.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.580
But you can understand
all of it because you

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.930
have perturbation theory.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.920
And so you can say, OK
this time the wavepacket--

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.090
some amplitude of the
initial wavepacket

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.460
is transferred to
a different mode.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.170
And when does that happen?

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.350
Stationary phase.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.630
It happens at a
particular geometry.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.590
And so you can be
asking, OK, when is

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.510
this excitation transferring?

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.710
How strongly?

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.040
This is a very, very
complete picture.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.860
And it's very much like
classical mechanics

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.420
because it's localized.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.820
Then we talked
about Landau-Zener.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.240
And the Landau-Zener is
basically a simple idea

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.760
that you also understand
from real life.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.920
And it has to do with how does
a wavepacket jump from one

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.310
potential surface to another?

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.453
And again, it's
stationary phase.

00:04:27.453 --> 00:04:32.390
At the internuclear distance
of the curve crossing,

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.340
the wavepacket has
to decide which

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.140
curve it's going to follow.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.620
And it depends on the
velocity of the packet

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.500
at the curve crossing and the
difference in slopes of the two

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.535
paths it has to choose between.

00:04:47.535 --> 00:04:50.400
And all of this is very simple.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.290
Now, I am trying to create
an exam problem which

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.080
is related to Landau-Zener.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.540
And this is hard.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.490
But if I succeed, then
you can expect to see it.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.550
The last thing I talked
about the last lecture

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.000
was the Zewail
pump-probe experiments.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.060
And this is a beautifully
graphical picture

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.580
of how do you create
something and then

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.000
probe what's happening.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.800
And again, I hope
that I can come up

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.170
with something pictorial for
the exam on the Zewail pump.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:39.480
OK, now before I talk about
intermolecular interactions,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.120
I want to do a little bit
of tying up loose ends.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.000
You know about non-degenerate
perturbation theory.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.100
Now there's another kind of
perturbation theory called

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.510
degenerate perturbation theory.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.240
And this is when non-degenerate
perturbation theory

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:13.930
fails because H i j
over E i 0 minus E j 0

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.200
is greater than one.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.519
Well then you've got a problem.

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:19.310
You can't use ordinary
perturbation theory.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.940
You have to diagonalize.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.840
You diagonalize it
two by two or you

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.990
diagonalize all of the little
cases where this is violated.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.350
That's called degenerative
perturbation theory.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.850
And there is a little
bit of extra recipe

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.930
for how do you put information
about remote states

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.130
into the part of the
Hamiltonian you diagonalize?

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.120
That's called a Van
Vleck transformation,

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.830
and I'm not going
to talk about it.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.930
But basically you fix things
up by diagonalizing two

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.090
by two or three by three.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.160
And then do ordinary
perturbation theory.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.704
And then there's variational.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.220
The variational
model is something

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.130
we've used mostly in a
minimum basis set for talking

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.800
about the atomic molecules.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.290
And in the variational
model, we minimize energies

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.160
by optimizing
mixing coefficients.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.220
Now, perturbation theory is
implicitly an infinite basis.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.680
Usually the infinity
doesn't matter

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.470
because the interesting
stuff comes in

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.680
from relatively
low-lying levels.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.860
And the infinite number
of very far away levels

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.520
just modifies the energy
levels a little bit,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.050
and you don't have
to worry about it.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:57.640
The variational method, you
choose your own basis set.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.800
Now, the choice of
basis set is frequently

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.720
dictated by convenience.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:09.680
And the basis set is often not
very large or not orthonormal.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.710
And so there are
problems with how

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.650
do we deal with
basis functions which

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.150
are not orthonormal, especially
not orthogonal to each other?

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.040
And there is a
transformation that you

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.860
can do to make that work out.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.890
I mean, the problem
is basically--

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:35.990
the secular equation is this
for the variational method.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:41.510
And this is the overlap matrix.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:46.550
And the overlap matrix
is not the unit matrix.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.270
We have what's called the
generalized variational

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.410
calculation.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.270
And there are methods
for handling that.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.520
And I have often introduced
those methods on a final exam.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.380
Those are just statements.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:09.320
OK, so variational
is not guaranteed

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.900
to give the exact answer.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.310
And it can't if you don't
use an infinite basis.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.909
Perturbation theory implicitly
uses this infinite basis.

00:09:20.909 --> 00:09:22.950
And you should feel
confident that you're getting

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.070
close to the right answer.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:31.015
And you can know what sort
of errors you're making.

00:09:31.015 --> 00:09:33.030
OK, yes?

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.910
AUDIENCE: When you go
to very high orders

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.930
in perturbation theory,
your convergence

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.787
is not necessarily better--

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:39.870
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.060
AUDIENCE: --on the
real solutions.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:41.550
PROFESSOR: OK, but that's--

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.133
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
when to cool it?

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.920
PROFESSOR: This is-- the
problem there is that you cannot

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.630
include correlation in
perturbation theory.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.510
And so there are
things that are outside

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:07.420
of the network of things
that I've described.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.650
And so correlation effects
where the particles

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.040
can move in some way that
they know about each other.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.000
That's very difficult to build
in via perturbation theory.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.400
But when we don't
have correlation,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.130
length perturbation
theory makes an error.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.770
And you know how
big that error is.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:35.390
OK, and then we know that we
can diagonalize the matrix

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.590
by some kind of
unitary transformation.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:48.930
And the columns of T dagger
are the eigenvectors.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:55.150
And the rows of T
are the inverse--

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:59.030
rows of T dagger or the
columns of T are the inverse.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.200
And so if you want to
make a wavepacket where

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:09.280
you have some additional
state to equal 0,

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.430
you want to express that
as a linear combination

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.440
of eigenstates.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.937
And this sort of transformation
provides that information

00:11:17.937 --> 00:11:19.020
if you know how to use it.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.910
And you can get
approximations to all

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.780
of these elements of T
dagger from non-degenerate

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.520
perturbation theory.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.100
And on the second exam
that was one of the things

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.830
you didn't do very well on.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.670
And so you can see that again.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.170
All right.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.710
OK, so now we're going to
talk about intermolecular

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.180
interactions.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.130
And up until now,
we've been talking

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.870
about isolated molecules.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.660
And you have a lot of insights
about how isolated molecules

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.600
work, or at least
what kind of stuff

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.510
you need to be able to make
predictions about isolated

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.260
molecules.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.100
And perturbation theory
is a very important tool

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.720
in building that insight.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.160
In almost every problem which is
not an exactly soluble problem,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.220
perturbation theory gives you
at least a hand-waving argument

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.640
for what's going on.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.530
Everything we did
with LCAO-MO is really

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:32.180
based on perturbation theory,
or at least the interpretations,

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.810
especially when you go from
homonuclear to heteronuclear.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:40.310
And when we talk about what
various orbitals look like

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.350
and why they look that way.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:47.380
OK, so perturbation theory can
also be used to talk about--

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.660
we have two particles,
A and B. And we

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.560
have the origin of coordinates.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.245
And so this is the
coordinate for A,

00:12:56.245 --> 00:13:00.940
and this is the
coordinate for B.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.370
And this is the
interatomic coordinate.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.390
And so we're interested
in what happens

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:14.370
as a function of this
interatomic distance.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.890
And can we use
perturbation theory

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.252
to be able to say
something about that?

00:13:20.252 --> 00:13:21.460
And the answer is you betcha.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.000
Because basically we understand
how these two molecules work.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.550
And so we have to somehow
build in some insight

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.100
into what is the
interaction between these,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.770
and then use perturbation
theory to quantify it.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.400
OK, now this is
a situation where

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:52.860
we're going to say atoms A
and B are our field shell,

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.460
or whatever you want to call it.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.730
They don't need to
make another bond.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.990
They're not going to
bond to each other.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.480
There's no covalent
bond between A and B.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.980
There is no charge on A and
B. There is no donor/acceptor.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.560
All of the things
that we can understand

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.830
by looking at
individual systems,

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.760
they are all turned off.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.670
These molecules do
have energy levels.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.940
And so if we could
find some way to talk

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:27.330
about the weak
interaction between them,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.690
well then we have the basis
for perturbation theory.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.360
Because we have weak and
we have energy levels

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.750
that we know for
the two molecules.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.410
And so if we're going to
do perturbation theory

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.360
it'll be second order
perturbation theory

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:48.990
because we are going to be
interested in how interaction

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.550
of A with B causes
excited states of B to mix

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:57.150
into B, and vice versa.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.440
And so one of the things you
know about perturbation theory,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.170
if you're talking about the
ground state of a system

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:13.034
and you do perturbation
theory, what happens?

00:15:13.034 --> 00:15:14.450
What happens to
the energy levels?

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.450
I mean, you have--

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.260
for second order
perturbation theory--

00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:25.420
I'm sorry?

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.490
AUDIENCE: Everything
gets-- things

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.290
can increase or decrease.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.290
The H term gets squared.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:35.938
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:15:35.938 --> 00:15:37.562
AUDIENCE: Some
[INAUDIBLE] information.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:41.217
But depending on whether
a level that's lower--

00:15:41.217 --> 00:15:43.550
PROFESSOR: But if we're talking
about the ground state--

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.092
AUDIENCE: If it's that ground
state it has to go down.

00:15:46.092 --> 00:15:46.800
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.620
And so that's the key.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.850
We know that if we're going to
do second order perturbation

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.370
theory and we're going
to be asking questions

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.170
about molecules in
their ground state,

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.120
they're going to be
stabilized by interaction

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.710
with other molecules.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.830
It doesn't matter,
as long as there's

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:11.340
no bonding interactions,
or very strong short range

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.550
interactions, this
sort of a problem

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:19.310
is guaranteed to give
stabilization of the ground

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.095
state of the system.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.330
And that's really a
surprise, because--

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:26.860
Yes?

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.360
AUDIENCE: You're
treating the system

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.860
as though it has like a ladder
of energies and everything

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.960
is already at its lowest?

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.920
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.390
Well, OK-- you know,
I'm not allowed

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.070
to talk about statistics.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:40.880
I can't, actually.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.870
Because we do it--

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.150
we now do some statistical
mechanics in 560.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.550
So you know a little bit.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:53.300
And you know that the molecules
like to be in the lowest energy

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:53.940
levels.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.250
And so we have these ground
state molecules in a gas.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:04.250
And we understand they're
isolated properties,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.720
or we could understand.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.670
And what happens here?

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.770
Somehow there's
interactions between them.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:18.104
And now first order
perturbation theory,

00:17:18.104 --> 00:17:19.354
you're allowed to have a sign.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:27.200
But you're allowed to have
a sign for diagonal elements

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.700
of the perturbation operator.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.600
OK, so we'll just
continue with this.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.965
So we want to talk
about Hamiltonian

00:17:42.965 --> 00:17:50.110
for the system, which is
the Hamiltonian for particle

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.900
A, the Hamiltonian
for particle B,

00:17:52.900 --> 00:18:00.770
plus some interaction
term between A and B.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:08.550
OK, now the typical interaction
between two particles

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.770
is a dipole-dipole interaction.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.560
If molecules have
dipole moments,

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.216
then we already know
something about what they

00:18:16.216 --> 00:18:17.340
want to do with each other.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.960
And from electricity
and magnetism--

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.100
we know this isn't
quantum mechanics--

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.020
we know that we can
write a general formula

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.840
for the dipole-dipole
interaction.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.890
So that's the
general formula for

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.904
the dipole-dipole interaction.

00:18:53.904 --> 00:18:55.320
And it's a little
more complicated

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.850
than you would like
because there's two terms.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.530
And this one is kind
of a puzzling term

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:03.900
because you're projecting a
dipole on the interatomic axis.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.190
And so we'd like to be
able to simplify this.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:14.160
And we can simplify
it by simply drawing

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.500
some vectors corresponding
to the dipole moment.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:23.970
And so we have the dipoles
oriented like that.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.010
Or we have the dipoles
oriented like this,

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:35.430
or like this and like that.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.780
Now, this is a reduction.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.200
You know, these are
the simplified terms

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:45.450
where these guys are
irrelevant or at least you

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.540
don't have to worry
about the projections.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:54.280
And we know that this is
an attractive interaction,

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.560
this is an attractive
interaction.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.120
This is repulsive and
this is repulsive.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.120
And we know also by
plugging into the formulas,

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:13.050
we know that the energy for this
one is minus mu-A mu-B over two

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:17.085
pi epsilon 0 R cubed.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.020
And this is minus
the same stuff,

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.870
except a four in
the denominator.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.580
So that means it's less
attractive than this one.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.990
Minus means attractive.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.110
And then we have two
terms that resemble these

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.440
except they're repulsive.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.670
So there's four terms.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:48.395
So there's two terms
that are attractive

00:20:48.395 --> 00:20:50.960
and two terms that
are repulsive.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.120
And they come in pairs, one
positive and one negative.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.020
And so you might naively
say well, you can't win.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:04.550
If the particles are randomly
distributed and randomly

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:09.570
oriented, there will be
no stabilization, even

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.200
with dipoles.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.100
But that's not true
because the molecules

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:23.840
try to find an
orientation which is

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.870
more stable than the sum of the
energies without the dipoles.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.810
And so maybe we
could draw a picture

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.230
and try to figure out,
well, how that would be.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:45.040
So does anybody want to give
me guidance to a picture

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.920
showing, let's say,
four dipoles oriented

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.800
in the corner of a square?

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.630
And what would be the
stable arrangement

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.980
for four dipoles oriented
on the corners of a square?

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:11.099
OK, right?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:22.290
So we have two
attractive interactions,

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.630
two more attractive
interactions,

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:31.630
and then there are repulsive
interactions this way.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.240
But we have nearest neighbors.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.660
And they're stronger than
the repulsive interactions.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.880
And so for one
layer, that can win.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.610
Now, we have another
layer of four dipoles.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.770
And if that layer is--

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:58.854
so we have another layer, and
there will be four of them.

00:22:58.854 --> 00:22:59.770
And what would happen?

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.270
What would be the
stable arrangement

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.440
if I have a dipole
above this one?

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.630
Is it going to be this way?

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.380
Right.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.370
And so the next layer, all
the dipoles are reversed.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.300
And so you can conceive
of an arrangement

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:23.480
where the dipoles would adopt
a more stable arrangement.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.990
And statistical mechanics, or
whatever you want to call it,

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.700
guides that.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:35.700
And so we can say, all
right, the ensemble

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.250
of dipoles interacting
with each other

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:44.070
can arrange to be
energetically stabilizing.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:50.125
And so we can reduce the
problem to just one picture,

00:23:50.125 --> 00:23:53.820
say this type or that
dipole-dipole arrangement,

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.090
and do second order
perturbation theory.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:00.830
And that will be an overestimate
of the stabilization.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.460
But it will be proportional
to the stabilization.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.780
And so we can get what
we need for a very

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.480
complicated infinite
number of particle problem.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.300
OK, another thing that
I want to ask you,

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:23.735
suppose you have two particles
and they come together.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:31.140
And so they come together
with some kinetic energy.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.980
And they can't get rid
of that kinetic energy,

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.080
so they come apart.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.130
Now, if you have
three particles,

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:44.160
if something drives them
together by mutual attraction,

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.070
then one particle can take
away the excess energy.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:51.130
You can end up leaving the
two particles together.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.690
That's how you make liquids.

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.330
So the driving force
for the attraction

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.080
between atoms or
molecules is somehow

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.740
related to what we're
going to drive here.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.580
And that is the only way
you make liquids from gases.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.300
And it's really
strange because we're

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.140
going to be talking about
energy levels and interactions

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.520
between molecules,
and somehow coming up

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:31.830
with a picture that leads
to universal attraction

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:36.000
between molecules
that are not charged,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.510
not reactive, not anything.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.110
And they will always
attract each other.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.390
And that's the first step
towards making liquids.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.070
OK, now the important
thing in all of this

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.830
is that the
interactions are small

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.070
compared to the energy levels
of the individual molecules.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.370
And so that's why we're
doing perturbation theory.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:21.920
OK, so in perturbation
theory we have an H 0.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.090
And the H 0 is--

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.010
I've got to make sure I
use consistent notation.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:33.110
Well, I already see
I have inconsistent

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.200
notation in my notes.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:41.810
But anyway, OK, so we
have the Hamiltonian

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.470
is the individual
system Hamiltonians,

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.000
the sum of the two.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.990
And the first order term is VAB.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.590
And so whenever we
can separate a system,

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:06.250
we know that the zero
order wave functions

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.980
are products of the
eigenfunctions of HA and HB.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.500
And the energy levels of 0
[INAUDIBLE] energy levels

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.340
are sum of the energy
levels for HA and HB.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:27.660
So we know that we can write
H 0 psi A alpha psi B alpha.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.880
So this guy--

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.520
HA operates on psi A and
treats this as a constant.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.400
HB operates on psi B and
treats this as a constant.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.170
And when you do that, what
you discover is that we get--

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:07.160
OK, so these are
our energy levels.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.240
And these are our
basis functions.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.725
And we are off to the races.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:21.140
So this is E 0.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.860
And this is psi
0 for the system.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:36.490
OK, now the first thing we do in
perturbation theory is we say,

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.840
let's look for the first order
correction of the energy.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.640
That's the diagonal matrix
element of the H1 term, this.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:56.660
So suppose we do have dipole
moments on both particle A

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.640
and particle B

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.260
So that's the
first order energy.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:34.180
Well, this is just the
dipole-dipole interaction.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.890
And so we can take
the reduced formula.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:46.040
We're just going to regard VAB
as mu A dot mu B over R cubed.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:30:01.110
And so the energy is minus one
over two pi epsilon 0 R cubed.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:06.002
I left out the two pi
epsilon 0 on this formula.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.490
And so skipping a
couple of steps,

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:26.650
we have mu A mu B, the
expectation value of these.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.560
So if there's a
dipole-dipole interaction,

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:36.710
there will be a first
order correction term.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:42.580
And keep in mind that
these guys can have signs.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.950
And that sign does appear in
the first order correction

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:46.670
to the energy.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.900
But that's basically these
pictures we drew here.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.530
We have a dipole
pointing this way,

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.230
we have a dipole
pointing that way.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.120
That's repulsive.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.270
And that's all-- so
there's no surprises here.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:09.680
OK, but the important
thing is that the energy--

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.220
If we have two
molecules with dipoles,

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:17.080
we get an interaction energy
that we can calculate.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.670
But the interesting
thing is going

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:22.210
to be when we have
molecules where at least one

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.070
of the molecules
doesn't have a dipole.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.330
Then we're getting
into territory

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.657
that we didn't
think we understood.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:50.000
But we're continuing
with the problem

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.100
where we do have dipoles.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.390
I just want to make sure that--

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.760
yeah, OK.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:14.280
So for the second order
correction to the lowest energy

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:21.470
level, we have the sum over m,
which is two quantum numbers.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.740
And m is not equal
to the 0-0 state.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.550
Alpha is not 0, beta is
not 0 sum over everything

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.140
except the ground state.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:47.660
And what we have is an integral
of psi m 0 star VAB psi 0 0

00:32:47.660 --> 00:33:01.940
d tau squared over
then E 0 0 minus E 0 m.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.870
Standard formula for second
order variation theory.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:07.320
This is the ground state.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.850
This is some excited state.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.079
This is negative.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.002
This is squared.

00:33:18.002 --> 00:33:18.835
And this is squared.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.604
So this overall
correction is negative.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.930
Now we can unpack
all this and we

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:38.450
can write the various terms
in more instructive form.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:44.990
And what we'll have in the
denominator will be E 0--

00:33:44.990 --> 00:34:11.760
well, E A 0 minus E A alpha
plus E B 0 E 0 E minus E B beta.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:24.719
Now we can rearrange that so we
have E 0 A plus E 0 B minus E A

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:30.400
alpha plus E B beta.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.909
So we have the ground state
energy and the known excited

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:34.780
state energies.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.179
And there is the
difference between these.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:40.330
So that part is simple.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:48.870
And the matrix element also
simplifies to the product

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.075
of the dipole moment.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.210
OK, now suppose--

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.640
I just want to
make sure that I'm

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.520
doing this in the order
it appears in the notes.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:28.400
Suppose mu A is not 0
and mu B is equal to 0.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:38.510
OK, well then all these
formulas go out the window

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.860
because nominally we
think well, this B

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.070
doesn't have a dipole moment.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:52.250
But suppose we have a particle
B in an electric field.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:56.465
The electric field
will polarize B.

00:35:56.465 --> 00:36:03.810
And if we have molecule A, which
has a dipole moment, near B,

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:07.320
it will also polarize B. And
second order perturbation

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.510
theory tells us
how to handle that.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:22.850
And so we get a
formula, a second order

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:28.220
correction to the energy B. And
we call this B comma induction.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:45.860
And that's going to be
mu A squared over four pi

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:52.340
squared epsilon 0 squared
R to the six times

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:59.220
sum beta not equal to 0 of
the squared matrix element

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:20.480
integral psi B star beta mu
B psi B 0 d tau B squared

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:27.290
over E B 0 minus E B beta.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:30.860
Now, I just told you
that the dipole moment--

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.400
the permanent dipole
moment for particle B is 0.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.260
But this is not the expectation
value of the dipole moment.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:44.610
This is an off-diagonal matrix
element of the dipole moment.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.860
This is the transition dipole.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.230
Transition between v equals 0--

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:53.100
well, between the
ground state of B

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:57.800
and some excited state, the
beta, excited state of B. Well,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.730
we can write something
like that because we

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:08.220
know for all molecules
there are transitions, which

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.240
are electric dipole allowed.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:16.290
Now they could be
between the ground state

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.020
and an electronically
excited state or the ground

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.770
state and a vibrationally
excited state.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.800
So we know something
about these:

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.930
we know the rules for
when they're not 0.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.030
And this is a perfectly
reasonable thing

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.970
because it says this is
related to the transition of--

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.640
the intensity of the
observable transition.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.620
And this should
really start to make

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:43.450
you a little bit appreciative
of perturbation theory.

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:48.020
Because we're taking something
which you can observe,

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.220
a transition
strength, and using it

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:57.850
to describe an interaction
between two molecules.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:03.400
So it's a relationship between
two apparently unrelated

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.260
phenomena.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.810
Physical chemistry
is full of that.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:08.930
You build a model.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.950
And the model is telling
you that certain things

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.150
are related.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.380
And how are they related?

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.560
Well, they're related by
one over R to the sixth.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.830
They're related by the
strength of the dipole on one,

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:23.860
the permanent dipole on
one, and some transition

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.500
intensity-derived
quantity on the other.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.290
Isn't that neat?

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:30.520
And since the dipole--

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.070
we say well, this is a
dipole-dipole interaction.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:43.990
And the mu A, the dipole on
A, is inducing a dipole on B.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.670
It's not inducing anything.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.460
It's using transition dipoles.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:52.960
But it's creating something that
looks like a permanent dipole.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.270
And you have
dipole-dipole interaction.

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:59.080
But the only difference is that
it's one over R to the sixth

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.445
because it's an induced dipole.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.500
OK, so we're using transition--

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:14.050
well, electric dipole
transition moments.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:18.786
(There used to be two erasers!)

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:38.290
So these electric dipole
transition moments

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:42.194
play the role of producing
a dipole that can

00:40:42.194 --> 00:40:43.485
interact with the other dipole.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:53.390
And so-- well, do we need this?

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.330
Well, we don't really.

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:58.030
If you had dipoles,
then the interaction

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:00.550
would be one over R cubed.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:04.000
But if one of the dipoles
is 0, then the interaction

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.360
is one over R to the sixth.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.170
And it's one over R
to the sixth times

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:13.670
the permanent dipole of one and
this thing from perturbation

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.310
theory, which is the
induced dipole of the other.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:31.270
Suppose mu A equals
0 and mu B equals 0.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.610
Will the particles
interact with each other?

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.170
Will they attract each other?

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.360
And the answer is yes.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.960
And it's going to be an
induced dipole-induced dipole

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.810
interaction.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:51.840
Which, now since most people who
write for general science have

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.390
no clue about what
quantum mechanics is,

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:57.870
they will talk about all
sorts of fanciful things--

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:01.230
you get an institute--

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:05.910
an instantaneous fluctuation
on one particle which

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.350
creates an instantaneous
fluctuation

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:11.220
on the other particle, and
bam, you've got stabilization.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:11.970
Well, yeah, maybe.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:16.070
But you know, this is a
simple perturbation theory.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:20.770
And so I don't really need to
actually write out everything.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:27.730
Because one, you do that and
you include the second order

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:33.010
perturbation expression for
particle A and particle B,

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.740
you get a term that
looks just like this.

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.900
It has one over R to the sixth.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:43.250
But it now involves
transition moments, particle A

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:44.990
and particle B--

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.710
nothing new.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.650
You don't have to
induce anything more.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:52.702
You don't get another
factor of one over R cubed.

00:42:52.702 --> 00:42:54.660
You've already got the
one over R to the sixth.

00:42:57.576 --> 00:43:07.090
So I'm going to
skip a lot of steps

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:09.250
because the notes are
really clear in there.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.630
And we don't have a
whole lot of time.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:15.430
And so I'm just going to
write down the result.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:27.900
And now the name of this term
is called dispersion, or London

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:32.220
because a fellow by the name
of London invented this.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:38.400
And the energy level formula
for this correction term

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.410
is one over four pi
squared epsilon 0 squared

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:45.990
R to the sixth.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:54.990
And then this sum of alpha
equals one beta equals one

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:56.350
to infinity.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:02.080
In other words, not alpha
equals 0, not beta equals 0.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:02.610
And then--

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.430
Sorry about that.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:38.520
So we have a numerator, which
is the squared transition

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:44.320
moment between the 0 level of
particle A and the alpha level

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:48.040
and the 0 level of B
and the beta level.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.090
We have the energy
of the ground state

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:53.170
and we have the energy
of these excited states.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:56.340
All of this stuff, you
know or at least you

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.520
can parametrize it in
terms of this strength

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.040
of our transition.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.590
And there is an explicit formula
that relates the dipole moment

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:09.180
to the intensity depending on
what kind of experiment you do.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.610
So I'm not going to
take you through that.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:15.870
But you know you can measure
the intensity, the molar

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:22.260
absorptivity, or whatever you
want that is related to this.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.510
So these are
experimentally observable.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.490
These are experimentally
observable.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:32.970
And usually this
infinite sum is dominated

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:37.630
by the lowest allowed transition
from the ground state.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:40.260
And that can be an
electronic transition

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.660
or a vibrational transition.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.270
So for our homonuclear
molecule, there

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:48.000
isn't going to be an allowed
vibrational transition.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.620
So nitrogen and oxygen cannot
talk to each other through

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.820
transition dipole--

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.870
vibrational transition dipoles
because the dipole moment

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:00.390
is not dependent on
[INAUDIBLE] but they

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.620
have electronic transitions.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.980
And so there is
this electronic-- as

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.200
opposed to a vibrational
polarizability of the two.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:15.540
And that's what gives rise to
attraction between N2 and O2,

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.290
or N2 and N2.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.500
So everything is
knowable and predictable.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.910
And even though the
perturbation's sum is infinite,

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:30.500
and even though we've made a
gross approximation and say,

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:34.270
well, we're just interested
in this sort of an interaction

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:39.730
or this sort of an
interaction, and we

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.850
know that the true
interaction will

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:47.290
be less because there will
be an average over all

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:48.670
of the random orientations.

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:51.610
But there's going to be
a lowest energy picture.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:54.310
And you can get that from
statistical mechanics.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:56.740
And so you can do the
configurational average

00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:00.220
over all possible orientations
of all of the interacting

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.120
particles.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.100
And you can calculate this.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.490
So that's beyond the
level of this course.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:10.480
But the engine of the
calculation is this formula.

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:31.040
So molecules are polarizable.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.020
They react to an
external electric field.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.660
And there are several
ways you can describe

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.600
the defined polarizability.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.600
One is to say well
the polarizability--

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.430
let's call it alpha--

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:47.700
is equal to the
second derivative

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:53.610
of the energy with respect
to the electric field.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.860
But the polarizability,
you know,

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:04.180
you also get from
perturbation theory.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.310
And so each of these
terms or the energy

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:11.110
is associated with
the interaction

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.300
of a dipole with
an electric field

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.770
is the electric field
times the dipole.

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:17.470
And so we have
electric field squared.

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:19.700
We take the second
derivative of that.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.070
And we've got back to this.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.037
So now here we come
with intuition.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.830
If I asked you to tell
me the van der Waals

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:40.910
or the dispersion interaction
between helium and helium,

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:43.872
and compare that
to xenon to xenon,

00:48:43.872 --> 00:48:45.080
would you be able to tell me?

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:49.970
So which one is stronger?

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:57.064
Which one-- which pair of
inert gases is stickier?

00:48:57.064 --> 00:48:57.880
AUDIENCE: Xenon.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.880
PROFESSOR: Xenon, right.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.650
Why?

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:04.690
Because the energy denominator
for the first excited state

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:06.880
is much lower for
xenon than for helium.

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:17.444
OK, what about large molecule
versus small molecule?

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.890
Do I need to provide a hint?

00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:31.060
3n minus six.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:37.170
The more vibrational
modes, the more transitions

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:40.230
are available for polarization.

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:43.897
And so again, now we're
talking about molecules

00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:44.730
which can be floppy.

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.620
And the floppier the molecule--

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:52.190
that means they have low
frequency vibrations--

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:55.930
you can polarize the
daylights out of them.

00:49:55.930 --> 00:50:00.510
And so large molecules are
really sticky, stickier

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.580
than inert gases.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.640
Because you have this
dispersion interaction

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.120
that brings them together.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.050
And once they're together,
then they can do magic.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:13.230
But the thing that drives the
condensation, or the formation

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:17.300
of droplets, or whatever, is
this dispersion interaction.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.190
And it's universal.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:23.790
Every pair of molecules or atoms
is going to attract each other.

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.940
And the strength is
something that you

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.430
can rate in terms
of what you know

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:32.670
about atomic and
molecular properties.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:34.560
And isn't that neat?

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.190
Because you're
saying the viscosity,

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:44.120
or whatever it is, the property
of a gas, all of those things

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:49.250
are related to the properties
of the individual atoms

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:53.161
or molecules embedded
in perturbation theory.

00:50:53.161 --> 00:50:54.910
This is why I think
perturbation theory is

00:50:54.910 --> 00:51:00.550
so wonderful, because it enables
you to relate different things.

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:02.530
And even if you're
not going to evaluate

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:04.780
the magnitudes of
the terms, you can

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.530
make comparisons which are
always going to be right.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.950
And that's kind of wonderful.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:15.970
I mean, you don't have
to use the equations.

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:19.660
Or you just know that these
particles will attract

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.960
each other and the
driving force is either

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.330
a permanent or an
induced dipole.

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:29.380
And the induced dipole
will be strong if you

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:34.060
have a strong transition
to a low-lying state,

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.700
or a lot of strong transitions
to a lot of low-lying states

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.020
as you have in big molecules.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:45.650
OK, so I'm not positive what I'm
going to talk about on Friday.

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.030
It's probably going
to be photochemistry.

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:53.510
But I may panic and
do something else.

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.500
OK, I'll see you Friday.
