00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.930
PROFESSOR: Today, since
the notes for this

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.350
didn't exist until last
night, I made copies for you.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.570
I will do a little
more revisions

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.370
on what appears on the web.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.970
But this is a really
interesting and important topic.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.620
And so I think it's
important that I give

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.530
a little bit of extra guidance.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.090
So we're going to talk
about what's in a spectrum.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.210
But in a very
special sense, we're

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.400
going to be talking about
wave packet dynamics.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.810
And how do we understand what to
expect in wave packet dynamics?

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.240
And how do we approach it?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.490
And so let's begin
talking about this.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.670
So you already know
from my lectures

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.220
earlier, if you have a time
independent Hamiltonian,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.860
how do you create a wave packet?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.480
I mean, after this
exam performance,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.886
I want some insights.

00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:36.464
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
individual eigenstates.

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:37.130
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.830
So you use a short pulse.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.660
And you create some kind
of linear combination.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.810
Usually, if you're not
making eigenstates,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.340
that's a complication.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.140
And why would you
want to do that?

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.810
And the reason you do it is
because these wave packets are

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.190
going to move.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.470
And particles move.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.880
Your instincts are
about particles moving.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.850
And there are rules for
the particles moving,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.840
which are mostly what
you have in your head.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.150
But there are some
special stuff that has

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.479
to do with quantum mechanics.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.260
And so I'd like to
build from the bottom.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.690
And so I want you to be able to
understand wave packets moving

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.400
on a diatomic surface.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.490
And then we'll make a step
into slightly more complicated

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.400
situations.

00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:44.570
If we have a diatomic, we
have a potential curve.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.500
And we have an initial state.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.070
And that initial
state in V equals

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.210
0 gives us access to a
range of vibrational levels

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.960
in the upper state.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.050
And if we have a
short pulse, we can

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.230
create some kind of a
wave packet involving

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.390
a linear combination of
these vibrational levels.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:18.000
So suppose you had a polyatomic,
3N minus 6 vibrational modes.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.110
So what would you do to go
from a diatonic molecule

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.570
to a polyatomic molecule?

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.110
Initially, you want to
do something simple that

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.830
doesn't involve anything
that's especially new.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.420
So what would you say about
dynamic diatomic polyatomic

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.200
surface where there's 3N
minus 6 as opposed to 1

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.730
vibrational modes?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:58.389
What kind of a wave packet
would you do, would you create?

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.097
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:02.097 --> 00:04:03.930
PROFESSOR: We had
Franck-Condon bright modes

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.210
and Franck-Condon dark modes.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.812
So it sounds like you're
right on the verge

00:04:08.812 --> 00:04:10.020
of saying something profound.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.070
So say it.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.464
AUDIENCE: You're just going
to have lot more coordinates.

00:04:13.464 --> 00:04:14.130
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.880
You're going to have
more coordinates.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.079
PROFESSOR: So you will
create a wave packet

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.320
on the Franck-Condon
bright modes.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.280
And if there's more than one
Franck-Condon bright mode,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.050
the wave packet will
do just like what

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.970
it would do on a
diatomic molecule,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.130
except you might have two
different frequencies.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.700
OK, well, there's
additional complications.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.920
And that is, even a
diatomic molecule,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.160
we don't have harmonic motion.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.560
So the wave packet, because
of diagonal anharmonicity,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.810
will dephase.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.060
But the center of
the wave packet

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.030
will continue to
move at the average

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.780
of the vibrational frequencies
for all these modes.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.540
You know that.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.480
And so in a polyatomic
molecule, maybe there's two,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.550
maybe there's three
Franck-Condon bright modes.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.900
And the wave packet will have
several different components

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.780
on the different
Franck-Condon bright modes.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.920
And they'll be diagonal
anharmonicities.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.780
And they will dephase and
possibly do interesting things.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.680
So now, polyatomic molecules
can do something else.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.800
Because there are, in fact,
3N minus 6 vibrational modes.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.930
And there's anharmonic
couplings between the modes.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.970
So if you created some wave
packet or set of wave packets

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.260
in a polyatomic molecule, there
will be anharmonic interactions

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.010
between modes.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.240
And what you will
have is the appearance

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.770
of wave packets in the
Franck-Condon dark modes

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.060
with their own frequencies.

00:06:12.665 --> 00:06:14.290
So this is starting
to get interesting.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.550
Because you hit this molecule.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.520
And it starts
revealing its secrets.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.295
Where you had
Franck-Condon dark modes,

00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:24.670
they're not going
to talk to you.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.970
But now, because of the
anharmonic couplings, they do.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:42.670
And then with a
diatomic molecule,

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.780
we might have an excited state.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.210
And it might be crossed
by a repulsive state

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.610
or crossed by
another bound state.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:57.070
But if you have a wave packet
operating on this bound state,

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:04.760
it's going to be crossing
through this region.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.740
What's so special about
where curves cross?

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.680
You know this, too.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.819
If you're in this state
and at this point,

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:20.985
you have this much momentum.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.870
And if you're on this curve at
that point, you have the same.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.250
So you have two rapidly
oscillating things

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.190
with the same spatial
oscillation frequency.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.070
And so there's a possibility
that the wave packet

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.040
can leak from this curve,
from the bound curve,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.120
to the repulsive curve.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.450
And there are all sorts
of things of that nature.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.640
I'm going to talk about
all of that today.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.230
And one of the
things-- the reason I

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.870
made these notes is
because I've always

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:06.760
wanted to say something
about the Landau-Zener model

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.740
for crossing between
different potential curves.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.640
And we talked a little bit
before about driving too fast

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.560
on a curvy road.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.660
Do you stay on it or
do you hit the tree?

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.760
And that's basically
this picture of--

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:31.915
you have two curves that can
cross or they could do this.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.360
This is the adiabatic
representation,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.250
which is amenable to quantum
chemical calculations.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.660
And this crossing curve is
the diabatic representation,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.880
which chemists like
because the electronic wave

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.130
functions don't change as
a function of internuclear

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.240
distance.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.700
And so the issue is, when
you have crossing curves

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.010
or avoided crossing
curves, how do you

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.480
understand what
the wave packet is

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.190
going to do with those points?

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.480
And that's the point
of this lecture.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:19.950
And there are two experiments
done by Ahmed Zewail's research

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:25.860
group which illustrate many
of the effects of wave packets

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.180
and avoided crossings.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.120
And so the question
is, how do we

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.290
observe this kind of
evolution of the wave packet?

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.970
What kind of
experiments do we do?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.070
If we're talking
about motion, we're

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.830
probably not interested
in the frequency domain.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.920
Although, you can get
a lot of information

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.230
from the frequency
domain that enables

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.510
you to understand what you
might see in the time domain.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:01.090
And one thing about frequency
domain experiments--

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.100
when you have a
molecule, which has

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:12.390
3N minus 6 vibrational
modes, like benzene has 30,

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.140
the vibrational
density of states

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.810
increases rapidly with
excitation energy.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.320
So rapidly that,
above the region

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.430
of the fundamentals, the
highest frequency fundamentals,

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:30.220
they're no longer resolvable
vibrational levels.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.950
The density of states is
on the order of a billion

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.480
per wave number.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.550
And you're going to be
asking different kinds

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.420
of experimental questions to
say, do I understand what's

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.610
going on in even a molecule as
small, from your point of view,

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.770
as benzene, big from
my point of view.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.970
OK, so we're interested
in mechanism.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.850
Why do things happen?

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.430
What makes them happen?

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.150
And how do we
construct an experiment

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.130
that reveals mechanism?

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.130
And how do we interpret
those sorts of experiments?

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.220
And the Zewail experiments
are beautiful examples

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.580
of revealing mechanism,
which is more complicated--

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.780
well, more revealing than
what you might expect.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:31.260
For example, suppose you excite
a molecule and it breaks.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Well, how did it break?

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.850
Did it just break?

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.980
Or was there some motion
preceding the breaking where

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:46.850
the molecule arranged itself
to receive this photon

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.990
and do something with it?

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.530
And it makes fragments.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.330
And what are the fragments?

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.470
What state are the fragments in?

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.620
There are all sorts
of stuff there.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.870
And that's mechanism.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.510
And it's not just the
breaking of a molecule

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.680
and getting from the width
of a spectral feature

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.150
how fast that breaking occurred.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.101
There's things that
happen in that time.

00:12:13.101 --> 00:12:13.600
OK.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.770
So we need to talk about
diabatic versus adiabatic.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:25.150
And so if you did a quantum
chemical calculation--

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:30.960
and you can.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.300
Because you still have
access to the Athena cluster.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:41.020
Or is your membership expired?

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.150
AUDIENCE: We should
always have access to it.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.950
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.640
Well, you do a calculation
using the computer programs.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.100
And they're basically
clamped nuclei.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.700
And that's just because you
want to reduce the complexity

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.350
of the calculation.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.650
It's an impossible calculation
anyway to do exactly.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.530
And if we say, let's
keep the heavy particles

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.090
from moving around,
we just solve

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.410
the electronic
Schrodinger equation,

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:20.540
well, then we get what we call
an adiabatic potential energy

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.000
surface, or one for
each electronic state.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.190
And well, if we
clamp the nuclei,

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.020
molecules don't hit
the nuclei clamp.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.820
We have to unclamp them.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:51.470
And the effect unclamping leads
to some perturbation term, H1.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:56.480
And so when we solve the clamped
nuclei Schrodinger equation,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.890
we don't have vibrations.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:01.180
We don't have rotations.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.670
And so one of the things
we don't know about

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:10.090
is partial derivatives with
respect to nuclear coordinates,

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.620
which we have the nuclear
kinetic energy, which

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.077
is the second derivative.

00:14:18.077 --> 00:14:19.660
And when you have a
second derivative,

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.466
you can apply one derivative
to the nuclear part

00:14:23.466 --> 00:14:25.090
of the wave function
and one derivative

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.740
to the electronic part.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.600
Or you can apply both.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:36.490
And so the electronic
wave function you get is--

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.520
you get a wave function,
which is an explicit function

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.810
of the electron positions
and parametrically dependent

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.990
on internuclear distances
or nuclear geometry.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.330
Well, that's there.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:56.360
And this nuclear kinetic
energy term, which is present,

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:02.100
is going to operate on these
guys and lead to trouble.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:07.950
Or maybe not, depending on what
the potential curves look like

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.120
and what the their problem is.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:16.980
But certainly, this
nuclear kinetic energy

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.674
can operate on these
functions and give something

00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:21.090
that we have to
at least consider.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.060
So this guy has secrets
embedded in it that we're

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.950
going to have to look at.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.590
And they're going
to be surprises.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.650
So let's think about diatomics.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.980
Because with diatomics,
most of the things

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.680
you're going to encounter
in polyatomic molecules

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.810
have examples that you can
understand really clearly.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:04.330
So suppose there are two
electronic states that

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.370
cross or do something.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.835
And we can have a
picture like this.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.050
So the calculation
you do will give you

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.470
these avoided crossing
potential curves.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.270
Well, why do they
avoid each other?

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:35.910
If you have two states
of the same symmetry,

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.470
they can perturb each other.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.750
The Hamiltonian is
totally symmetric.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.610
Any kind of term
in the Hamiltonian

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.770
that is totally
symmetric can cause

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.580
interactions between states
of the same symmetry.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.400
Now, many of these terms
of the same symmetry--

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.830
totally symmetric terms
in the Hamiltonian--

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.920
are excluded when
we do a calculation.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.319
Because we can.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.190
One is spin R.?

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:17.000
But there are things that could
affect the states belonging

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.930
to these two potential curves.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:24.500
And so there are going to be
interactions between states

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.300
of the same symmetry.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.460
And this is the place.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:35.210
So you have the ab
initio calculation.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.930
You get these curves.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:41.960
And you can see that
there is some coordinate

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:48.050
at which the difference between
potential curves is a minimum.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.750
Nature tips its hand.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.660
These avoided crossings
that are really important.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.540
And it tells you-- the quantum
chemical calculations tell you

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.500
two things.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.320
They tell you the
internuclear distance

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.030
at which the crossing occurs.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:18.460
And let's call this one--

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.260
let's have several
names for these curves.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.340
OK, I have to--

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:32.380
so we can call this 2, 1,
1, 2 plus plus minus minus.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.530
I have two sets of labels.

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:40.830
So let's say that
the 2 and 1 describe

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.180
the electronic character of
this state, the kind of thing

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.590
that the chemists care about.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.730
And plus and minus
as upper and lower.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.964
And that's what you get
from quantum chemistry.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:03.970
And so the quantum
chemistry gives you

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.730
the place at which
these two curves

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.920
have this minimum separation.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:19.670
And they have the plus
at RC minus V minus at RC

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.610
is equal to 2 H 12.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.710
You know from
perturbation theory

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.940
that, if you have two
levels which are degenerate

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.950
and they're interacting
by some coupling term,

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:40.800
the separation will end up
being twice the matrix element.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.500
So nature gives
you this and this

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:51.080
from which you can construct
the crossing curves,

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.270
the curves that chemists like.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.900
So even though quantum
chemistry doesn't

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.880
know about diabatic
curves, it tells you

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.260
how you could construct them.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.780
And now, there's
two limiting cases.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.660
We can have a very
weak interaction.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.050
And so the curves get
really close together.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.540
Or we can have a very
strong interaction

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.060
and get something like this.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:30.820
So these are the two limits.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:37.140
And it turns out that the way
you would handle these two

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.820
limits is experimentally
and theoretically profoundly

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.215
different.

00:20:44.215 --> 00:20:44.715
Why?

00:20:54.615 --> 00:20:58.380
This term, the nuclear
kinetic energy term,

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:02.350
does terrible things here.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.365
Because when it operates on
the electronic wave function,

00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:08.110
it says, the electronic
wave function

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:12.810
is changing rapidly
in this region.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:21.850
And so if we're going to try
to set up a Hamiltonian that

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.150
describes the energy
levels of these two states,

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.390
because of this
term, there will be

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:33.950
enormous couplings between the
vibrational levels of the two

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.790
states.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:42.340
And as a result, H0, the thing
that ignores those coupling

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:47.030
effects, will bear almost no
resemblance to the observed

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:50.770
energy level structure.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.890
To get from these
kinds of curves

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.730
to the observed energy
levels is a lot of work.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:03.070
And it's work that people
who use pre-written computer

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.640
programs are ill prepared to do.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.850
The spectrum will not
be predicted in any way

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:15.550
by this, unless you do a
huge matrix of interactions

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:20.530
between vibrational levels
of the different electronic

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.550
states.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.270
And when you have a matrix
element, which is large

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.900
compared to the
differences between levels,

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.150
you can't use
perturbation theory.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.605
You have to
diagonalize a matrix.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.660
And usually, when you
diagonalize a matrix,

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.890
the eigenvalues are
a bit of a surprise.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:47.740
Over here, the
electronic wave function

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.890
doesn't change very rapidly.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.430
And so we have no problem
of the interactions

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:57.430
among the vibrational
levels of these two states.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.140
And so the adiabatic
representation

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.370
provides a good zero order
picture of the energy levels.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.780
And there's a
little bit of stuff

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:12.120
that you can add
to improve the fit.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:18.960
So when you have what's called
a weakly avoided crossing,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.650
it tells you that the
adiabatic representation

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.011
is the wrong one.

00:23:25.011 --> 00:23:27.890
But when you have a
strongly avoided crossing,

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:28.990
well, it's the right one.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.770
Because all of the effects of
this repulsion between the two

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.130
states are included in your
zero order Hamiltonian.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.620
Whereas here, none are.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.270
And you say, well,
I could just go

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.740
cruising through this region.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.270
And I go fast through it.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:49.250
And I don't notice
the bad effects.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.100
Well, we'll see.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:51.600
OK.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:21.720
So now, if we had a diabatic
representation like this,

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.045
well, diabatic curves can cross.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.460
In fact, that's the whole point.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.900
We want them to cross.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.300
Because we'd like to keep
track of electronic character 1

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.440
and electronic character 2.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.140
And so I'm just going
to use this here.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.210
OK.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:25:00.770
But the really
annoying thing is,

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.950
when we did an
initial calculation,

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.610
we clamped the nuclei.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:09.560
We said there are certain terms
in the exact Hamiltonian we're

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.030
going to push aside
and consider later.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.760
But for the diabatic
picture, well, it's

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.970
clearly there's some term in
the electronic Hamiltonian

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.330
that we'd like to turn off.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.700
But there isn't one.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.950
It's all or nothing.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.290
There is nothing
you can identify

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.320
in the electronic
Hamiltonian that enables

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.270
the two curves to cross.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:39.240
So it's not that
it's a bad idea.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.410
It's just there is no simple
way of dealing with this.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:48.750
Now sometimes, we
have the Hamiltonian.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.590
And we have, say, the
spin orbit Hamiltonian.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.330
And this is something
we could turn off.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.720
But that's gilding the lily.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.340
I am a spin orbit aficionado.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.470
So I could deal with this.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.880
But if we don't say there
are specific, named,

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.240
small terms in the
electronic Hamiltonian,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.550
there is no way we can get
the diabatic limit directly.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.260
You have to use a trick.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:30.096
So let's draw a picture now,
which illustrates the trick.

00:26:30.096 --> 00:26:31.720
And we're almost
ready to start talking

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.930
about Zewail's experiment.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.560
So here I'm going to draw.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.460
OK.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.730
So the adiabatic curves are
the ones that don't cross.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:50.230
And The.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.015
Dash lines are the
diabatic curves.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:02.900
And we know RC and H12.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.300
Or at least we know H12 at
that internuclear distance.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.480
And it's a reasonable
thing to say, well,

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.320
let's let it not change
with internuclear distance.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.140
And let's make some
other approximation.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.100
We can say the
diabatic curves are

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.650
linear in the region
of the curve crossing.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:29.290
We can always-- especially when
the adiabatic picture is bad,

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:34.400
that curve crossing is
very, very compressed.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.320
And it's not a big
step to say, OK,

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.320
over this relatively small
range of internuclear distance

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.300
and energy, we're going to
approximate the diabatic curves

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:42.800
as linear.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:51.560
And so we know the exact
Hamiltonian, whatever it is,

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.640
be gotten from.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.570
OK.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:08.230
So here, we have what's
available from quantum

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.951
chemistry.

00:28:08.951 --> 00:28:11.200
These are the potential
curves for the upper and lower

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.180
adiabatic states.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.050
And here we have a
potential curve for state 1

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:23.010
and a potential curve
for state 2 at H12.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:33.900
And a unitary transformation
of this matrix

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.085
has to be equal that matrix.

00:28:39.546 --> 00:28:42.020
Well, we don't know these.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.930
But we're going to reduce
them to one number,

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.580
the slope at the crossing.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.670
And so we have one number
here, one number here.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.820
And all of a sudden,
we have enough

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.080
to iteratively determine the
difference between the slopes

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.810
by fitting to the observed
adiabatic potentials.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.940
And this is basically
how it's done.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:10.560
Now, people who do these
calculations for a living

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.370
have a much encrusted
picture of how they do this.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.190
But this is basically
what's going on.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.670
Because people do want
the diabatic picture.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:25.140
And a lot of insight is gained
from the diabatic picture.

00:29:32.111 --> 00:29:32.610
OK.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:37.330
So if we're going to be
approaching a spectrum where

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.810
we have energy levels or an
experiment where we learn

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:46.680
something about
the dynamics, we're

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.950
going to want to think about
this problem with two limits--

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:54.890
weakly avoided and
strongly avoided.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.620
And completely different
methods for dealing

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:02.900
with both spectroscopic
and dynamical information

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.540
are appropriate
for the two limits.

00:30:12.496 --> 00:30:13.390
OK.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:22.060
Landau-Zener-- this is
a model for saying, OK,

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:27.780
what is the probability of going
for one curve to the other?

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:32.610
And so we have a formula,
which you can derive.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:33.600
I don't recommend it.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.010
Because derivations are things
you do when you need it.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.500
And then you forget them.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.780
But I do want to give you
a sense of what's in it.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:49.450
So we're going from one
adiabatic state to another.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:57.200
And the probability is 1
minus e to the minus pi gamma.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.150
The important parameter
is gamma, right?

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:02.250
Everything in this.

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:02.750
OK.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:11.530
And so P12 is small
when gamma is--

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.660
well, we want this to be 1--

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.790
so when gamma is small.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.140
And P12 is large--

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.310
now, I just want to make
sure that I have it--

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:27.940
yeah, when gamma is large.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.460
Now, what's gamma?

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.310
Gamma is expressed--
and this is what

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:36.630
you would derive if you were
going to do this for real life.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:42.210
Because you would never accept
somebody else's speculation,

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.950
you derive it yourself.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:48.000
So V12 squared-- that's
the matrix element.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.460
That's half the gap between
the diabatic curves.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:32:02.600
And it's over H bar
velocity S1 minus S2.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:10.950
This is the difference in
slopes of the diabatic curves

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:14.400
at the crossing point.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.590
This is the velocity
of the particle going

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.950
through the crossing point.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.050
And you can, of course,
get the velocity

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.590
from the momentum
divided by the mass.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.560
And so all of this
stuff is there.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:42.700
And so gamma is
small when V is large

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.840
and when S1 is
approximately equal to S2.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.730
Well, if the slopes
are nearly equal,

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:53.500
that's a strongly
avoided crossing, right?

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.640
And V is large-- well, if
you're going through a bend

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.560
in the road and
it's too fast, well,

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.330
then you're not going to--

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.910
yes, you're not going to
be able to make the curve.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:11.080
So anyway, this is the physical
basis behind Landau-Zener.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.560
And it contains the
connections to the stuff

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.120
you have from your
picture of the potentials.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.036
And this is basically how
you organize a Zewail type

00:33:23.036 --> 00:33:24.910
experiment, which I've
got to talk about now.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:33.750
You have those notes already
on Zewail electronically.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.110
So I didn't make
copies of them for you.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:42.980
So you're going
to have to accept

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.120
what I'm doing without looking
at notes for this part,

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.620
unless you have them
already printed out.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:34:02.710
So Zewail had the 1999
Nobel Prize in chemistry.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:03.880
And it was really special.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:09.064
Because usually, these things
are divided three ways.

00:34:09.064 --> 00:34:10.230
He got the whole damn thing.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:19.300
And this was because he offered
something that we really want.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:24.219
We want to have an idea of,
what is the mechanism by which

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:27.810
dynamical processes occur?

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:31.760
In other words, we're
not just getting rate.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.080
But we're getting, what
are the nuclei doing?

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.870
And how does the
motion of the nuclei

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.930
affect the rate of the process?

00:34:42.917 --> 00:34:45.250
AUDIENCE: I think you want
S1 is very different than S2.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.159
PROFESSOR: That's quite likely.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.750
And I'm very poor with logic.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.630
Let's see.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:35:06.320
So I want you to decide
for yourself, OK?

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.660
And let me just--

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.160
OK.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:19.700
So this is an example of
a pump/probe experiment.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:31.480
So the pump pulse at t
equals 0 starts things.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:37.840
And the probe pulse at t
equals tau asks the question,

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.840
has the wave packet
gotten to what's called

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:55.050
the OCR, the optically
coupled region?

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:58.170
In other words, you
create a wave packet

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.380
and you have a probe
which can tell you

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:05.850
the time at which the wave
packet passes through where

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:09.110
you're probing it.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.380
And this is really neat.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:17.740
And it is, I think, the
essence of how Zewail created

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.520
a really simple experiment
using the crude technology that

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.710
was available at the time to ask
the kind of question he needed

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.250
to ask.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.590
Now, I didn't like
this whale experiment

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:33.980
when it first came out.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.140
Well, because I'm a frequency
domain spectroscopist.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.470
And I don't really
care about dynamics,

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:42.900
except how it's encoded in
the frequency domain spectrum.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.110
So this is completely different.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:49.250
But anyway, so now, I want
to describe the essence

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:53.330
of what he did, and why it
worked, and what it reveals.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.060
All right, and so I want
to pick a blackboard.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:13.390
So there are two
experiments that he did.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:18.370
One was dissociation of I-CN.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:22.675
And the other was
dissociation of sodium iodide.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.690
Now, one thing to
notice is we've

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:32.040
got a big heavy atom in here.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.140
So that means the vibrational
frequencies are low.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.250
That means that, with
a not too short pulse,

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:43.790
you could create a
coherent superposition.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.470
When you think
about what you would

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:48.210
need to create a
coherent superposition

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:53.090
of vibrational levels, different
by the canonical 1,000 wave

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:59.660
numbers of a vibration, you
realize that that experiment

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.670
was only doable
fairly recently when

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:08.560
you have on the order of a few
femtosecond time resolution.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.700
What Zewail did-- he had maybe
a 100 femtosecond or maybe only

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.960
a picosecond.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.580
And so he had to
have a heavy atom.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:26.860
For I-CN, the beautiful thing
about I-CN is there's CN here.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:32.860
CN is a diatomic molecule that
has a very convenient spectrum.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.260
And so we're asking
the question,

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:44.850
how does the presence of the
iodine affect the CN spectrum?

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:46.860
Because the CN is
going to give us

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.305
the signal in this experiment.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:59.880
So here is-- it's really neat.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.360
This is a triatomic molecule.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.600
But we always use one
dimensional pictures

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.720
to describe everything
that's going on.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.590
And you can do that when the
one dimensional pictures are

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.050
each applicable
in separate times

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:18.090
or at separate aspects
of the experiment.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.490
But it's another
beautiful example.

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.990
If Zewail had been attempting
to describe the full three

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.690
dimensional potential , the
pictures wouldn't have done

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.220
anything for anybody.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.770
Because you would have to work
too hard to understand what

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.421
the pictures are telling you.

00:39:33.421 --> 00:39:33.920
OK.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.780
So we now have a
repulsive curve.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.520
And we have another
repulsive curve.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:46.890
OK.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.240
So we have V equals 0.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.005
And so we're exciting
a wave packet.

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:59.510
And because we have a few
vibrational levels that

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:03.985
are accessible with the
Franck-Condon principle from V

00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:08.360
equals 0 and within
the necessary Fourier

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.670
transform of the
post duration, you

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:12.680
get a wave packet starting here.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.520
OK.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.940
So this wave packet is
going to be toodling along

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:24.890
at this energy.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:33.710
I'm sorry it's going to be
moving on this potential.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:35.280
But it has a definite energy.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.160
OK.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:45.590
And then you can probe it this
way, or this way, or this way.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:50.390
And the important thing
is that these three places

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:57.350
at which you probe correspond to
different excitation energies.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:04.880
It's saying that, as the
iodine atom is leaving--

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.370
these are transitions
between CN.

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:14.030
And in here, the iodine
atom is close to the CN.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:17.390
And it is affecting
the bonding in the CN.

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.070
Over here, it's gone.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.790
And the CN is free.

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:25.750
And what's happening is the
transition frequency changes

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.880
with time.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:35.810
And so if he has the
probe pulse here,

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:41.450
well, then when the wave
packet reaches this point,

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.850
you get a response.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:50.480
Before the wave packet gets
there, there is no exaltation.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.580
So the OCR is defined--

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.180
the optically
coupled region-- it's

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.700
defined by the frequency,
the center frequency,

00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.570
of the probe pulse.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.110
So if we then look at--

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:20.100
OK, now, what's happening here?

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.430
When you excite
to this state, you

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:26.340
have CN electronically excited.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:29.470
When you look at this
limit, you have CN

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.500
not electronically excited.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:39.720
The CN A double pi x double
sigma plus transition

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:44.430
is one of the most studied
things in the atomic molecules.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.090
And so it's known.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:43:01.800
And like all transitions, the
intrinsic radiative lifetime

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:07.360
is on the order
of 10 nanoseconds.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:16.600
So if we excite to
this state, we're

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.310
going to get a photon out.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:23.590
But the lifetime of that
photon is 10 nanoseconds.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:24.965
Are we going to
measure dynamics?

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.380
This is the beauty of the
experiment right here.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:38.700
He catches the wave packet
at a particular position.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.020
And he puts it in the bank.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.180
And then eventually,
the CN flouresces.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.220
We don't care anything
about when it flouresces

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.380
or what frequency
it flouresces at.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.260
All we cared about is that--

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.500
if you're looking at
if the wave packet is

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.140
in the optically
coupled region, it

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.820
gets excited to this surface.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.910
And then when it
chooses to say, I

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:17.000
got excited, here is my photon,
then you can create a plot of--

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.445
so versus time.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.290
So you see nothing.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:41.740
And then you get something at
the optically coupled region.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.870
And you do a sequence
of experiments

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:51.700
where you vary where the
optically coupled region is

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:56.530
centered by adjusting the center
frequency of the probe laser.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:00.430
So sorry.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.650
I should really say, OK,
here is the intensity

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:04.820
of the fluorescence.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:11.580
And here is the 1 over the
wavelength of the probe.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.000
So this is related to
the energy of the probe.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.180
And so you do a
series of experiments.

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:25.250
And you discover that the
wave packet reaches this.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.840
And then you move that.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.510
And you get another.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:31.670
And so you get a picture.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:48.490
So what do I want
to say about this?

00:45:52.440 --> 00:46:01.320
So it basically is telling you
that, when the molecule breaks,

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.270
the frequency of
the CN excitation

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:10.170
is changing as a function of
the distance of the iodine atom

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:12.560
from the CN.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.810
And so that's mechanism.

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:17.370
Now, it's really a
very crude mechanism.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:21.360
But because it's
reduced to one question,

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.730
it's a function of one geometry.

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:28.450
But nobody's ever
be able to say they

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:34.400
observed this motion of the
wave packet in real time.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:38.460
And here is where people
really get annoyed with Zewail.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.360
Because he's looking at
real motion in real time.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.380
And it ain't real.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:52.840
He's probing one time at a time.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.400
But it's still mechanism.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.150
It's more than just looking
at when does something break.

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:03.275
What's the lifetime
of something?

00:47:03.275 --> 00:47:05.990
There's more than
one thing going on.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:10.406
Now, I really like
the next experiment.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:19.400
And the next experiment
involves sodium iodide.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.370
Now, if I were to
ask you, what is

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:30.450
the nature of sodium
iodide at equilibrium?

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:33.210
You'd say, it's probably ionic.

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:37.770
But because iodine
is at the bottom

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:42.810
as opposed to the top of
the periodic potential,

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:44.655
it's maybe a little
bit covalent.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.720
So here is the ground
state potential.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:03.220
And I just have to
make sure I understand

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.900
what I'm trying to do.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:09.890
And here is an excited
state potential.

00:48:19.961 --> 00:48:20.460
OK.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.270
So what I've tried
is crossing curves.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:26.940
Those are the diabatic curves.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:31.560
Now, I've connected-- I should
do it with dotted lines.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.010
Those are the adiabatic curves.

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:41.050
And so the question is,
suppose we create a wave packet

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:45.280
on this potential.

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:54.560
So it's created here.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.979
And this wave packet
feels a force that way.

00:48:58.979 --> 00:49:00.770
Because it's the gradient
of the potential.

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:01.557
It's a particle.

00:49:01.557 --> 00:49:02.390
It's in a potential.

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:04.670
And it's going this way.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:08.930
And then something
happens when it

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:12.325
goes through this
curve crossing region.

00:49:12.325 --> 00:49:13.450
But what's going to happen?

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:21.886
I should just say
this is the ionic.

00:49:21.886 --> 00:49:22.760
This is the covalent.

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:29.980
So this is NA plus plus I minus.

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:37.810
And this is NA plus I. When you
dissociate a neutral molecule,

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:41.110
you always get neutral atoms.

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:44.580
So there is a higher energy
limit where you can get ions.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.940
And so even if you create
this wave packet here,

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:57.600
which is below the
threshold for making ions,

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:01.544
it only can leave by this path.

00:50:01.544 --> 00:50:02.960
So what happens
is the wave packet

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:07.130
is going back and forth, back
and forth, back and forth.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:15.175
And each time it crosses through
this region, it has to decide,

00:50:15.175 --> 00:50:16.860
am I ionic or covalent?

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:27.360
And if I'm covalent,
I can leave.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.240
And if I'm ionic, I'm stuck.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:34.680
I've got to go back and try
again and again and again.

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:42.020
So this is where
Landau-Zener comes in.

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.960
Because what's happening
is the molecule

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.840
is addressing this ionic
covalent curve crossing.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:52.130
And it's deciding each
time it goes through,

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.560
what is the probability
of being able to get out?

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.750
OK.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:02.960
But then, there's
something else.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:08.960
And that is, well,
what are we probing?

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.530
So we probe to an excited state.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:27.530
And so this is where the
figures, even for this reduced

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:29.900
representation, are confusing.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.410
But basically, you're probing
by exciting this sodium

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:39.670
atom to an excited state,
which puts it in the bank.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:43.200
And it fluoresces
when it chooses to,

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.970
which is in 10 nanoseconds.

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:47.280
Because sodium's
radiative lifetime really

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.300
is about 10 nanoseconds.

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.590
And so how to describe this?

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:08.760
So you have a choice
of being able to excite

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:13.650
at the free sodium
transition frequency.

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:16.680
And then what you're only
seeing is these little packets

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.020
of sodium that make it out.

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:27.540
Or you can excite at a--

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.880
well, this is coming out wrong.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.320
But if you excite
to the red of that,

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:41.130
you will only see
the sodium atoms

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:45.890
while they are still
close to the iodine.

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:49.340
And so there are two
sorts of signals you get.

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:57.650
One is you get a series
of pulses separated

00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:01.320
by the round trip time--

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.570
the round trip
time is the period.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:07.480
And so the period is related
the vibrational frequency.

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.650
And so each time
this packet goes

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:12.990
through the optically
coupled region--

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:16.800
I'm sorry-- goes through
the curve crossing region,

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.180
you get a little puff of sodium.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.770
If you're exciting
so that you can

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:29.200
see only the free sodium,
well, then instead of this,

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:35.820
you see the signal,
another signal.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.920
So you get little steps.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:45.170
Each wave packet that makes it
out dies at the turning point.

00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.640
And I'm way over time.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.300
But this is really the--

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.300
so there's two pictures.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:53.120
There is this sampling of
the wave packet each time

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.320
it goes through.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:59.870
And there is the
delivery of the goods.

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:03.280
And again, the signal
is a slow signal.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:08.360
But the pump/probe delay is
femtosecond time resolution.

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:13.150
And so it can reveal this
wave packet propagation.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:15.140
So that's all I have
to say on the subject.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.990
I think it's really beautiful.

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:20.690
I like it more and more
the more I understand it.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:27.600
And the next lecture will
be on why gases condense.
