00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:27.850
PROFESSOR: So let's get started.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.231
[CHATTER]

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.060
Oh, it's interesting that
some of your questions

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.810
had to do with things that I
didn't quite cover in lecture,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.620
but that's fine.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.660
I'm going to cover them at the
beginning of today's lecture.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.480
This is a really
important question.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.040
How do you know
what channel is at--

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.260
how do you know what ion
a particular channel is

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.150
conducting?

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.650
It's actually hard to determine.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.650
There are various ways to do
it, where you can specifically

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.380
label the ion, or
follow a particular ion,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.470
and address whether or not
it's getting into a cell

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.200
or across a membrane, when
there's a particular ion

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.550
channel present.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.620
But it's not completely trivial.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.140
One of the things I didn't have
time to go through with you,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.670
but which is one of
the PowerPoints though,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.730
is the fact that ion channels
are really selective.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.560
And they don't conduct ions
on the basis of size, OK?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.540
So you're not going to get
a large ion channel that

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.620
could accommodate a large ion,
also accommodating a small ion.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.340
It's not a matter about of
just opening up a space.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.620
There are also
charge considerations

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.060
where the ions actually
interact with the molecules

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.840
in the channel, in the actual
pore through the membrane.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.860
And it's that interaction which
selects for a particular ion.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.970
But this notion of exactly what
ions channels are conducting

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.590
has been many, many
decades of work.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.609
And what I've written
up here is correct.

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.400
But if you want to
explore it more with me,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.290
come and talk
during office hours.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.540
And then a number of
you started asking me

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.000
about modulation of
neurotransmitters, which I'll

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.094
talk about in today's lecture.

00:02:21.094 --> 00:02:22.510
And these are
clearly of interest,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.220
because many recreational
drugs and medications modulate

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.410
neurotransmitter amounts.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.770
And that is how they work.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.320
So for example,
some of you might

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.000
be taking things called SSRIs,
specific serotonin re-uptake

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.030
inhibitors like
Prozac, which make

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.760
you feel less anxious
and better about things.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.380
And these act by prolonging
serotonin activity,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.040
by preventing it from being
retaken up into cells.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.100
And I'll touch on this at
the beginning of the lecture.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.390
And it takes a while--

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.830
is what I've written here--

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.220
for these medications to start
working, because you're really

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.960
asking for a rearrangement
of the whole synaptic process

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.131
and the synaptic structure,
in order that they can work.

00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:09.130
And here is another one.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.540
What about amphetamines?

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.890
Are they neurotransmitters?

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.730
No.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.440
They increase the
release of dopamine,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.580
which is a neurotransmitter,
and they also

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.380
seem to inhibit re-uptake of
dopamine and serotonin is all.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.110
I'll talk about re-uptake
very briefly in a moment.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.390
For many medications, both--

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.970
actually, for many medications,
no matter whether or not

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.400
they affect your brain or
other parts of your body,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.990
the precise mechanism of
action is really not known.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.030
There are guesses.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.870
There's data.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.080
But the precise mechanism
is often not known.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.290
So let's use that as a
segue into our lecture.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.080
I won't have office hours
today, due to my schedule.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.220
I will have them next Wednesday
due to the vacation schedule.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.770
And you're welcome to
email me in the meantime.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.280
All right.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.130
We've been walking
through the cells involved

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.410
in nervous system
formation-- the connections

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.900
between the cells.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.680
And now today we're
going to finish

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.290
talking about the
connections between the cells

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.730
and segue into the incredibly
complex topic of circuits

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.080
in the nervous system.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.020
So today, the first thing
I want to talk about

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.360
is regulating synapses.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.840
And you remember
that we're talking

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.910
about chemical synapses.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.469
And the second thing I want
to talk about are circuits.

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:48.260
Is there a problem?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.150
Can you hear me OK at the back?

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.660
Thumbs up.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.450
Great.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.950
Good.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.180
When I introduced circuits--
when I introduced synapses

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.940
to you, I told you that one
of the reasons that there

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.650
was this chemical synapse in
the midst with a slow chemicals

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.890
synapse, in the midst of this
rapid electrical transmission,

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.500
was because you could
regulate synapses.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.420
And that is really
what fine tunes us.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.860
It allows us to respond
in a graded way to stimuli

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.500
both from within the
body and outside.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.110
It allows the body to adapt in
ways that are not all or none,

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.240
where action potentials
are all or none.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.690
The overall response of
the body clearly isn't.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.250
It's very nuanced.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.810
And all of this has to do with
regulating chemical synapses.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.660
And that's what we'll talk
about for a few moments.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.540
You can regulate
chemical synapses

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.980
by changing the amount
of neurotransmitter.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.900
And if you think about
this for a moment,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.620
if you think about
the synapse, there's

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.340
the neurotransmitter released
into the space between the two

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.090
cells, diffuses across
the synaptic cleft,

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.900
and then does something to the
post synaptic cell, potentially

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.250
to lead to an action potential.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.060
Now if that neurotransmitter
stuck around

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.550
in the space between
the cells, it

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.190
would keep stimulating
the postsynaptic cell

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.010
over and over.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.240
And as more neurotransmitter
was released,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.390
so the postsynaptic cell
would be further stimulated.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.750
And you would get to a point
where the post synaptic neuron

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.720
was completely over stimulated.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.630
And that's clearly not a way
to regulate responsiveness

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.990
to any stimuli.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.420
So neurotransmitter does not
stay in the synaptic cleft

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.320
for very long.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.980
So it's changing the
amount of neurotransmitter

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.860
via degradation.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.450
Once neurotransmitter is
released, in some cases,

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.060
it's degraded by
specific enzymes.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.530
For example, in the
case of acetylcholine,

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.490
there's a particular enzyme
that breaks down acetylcholine.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.960
And if that enzyme is inhibited,
you go into respiratory shock.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.180
You cannot breathe anymore,
because you have to activate

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.460
and inactivate the muscles via
the nerves, as you breathe.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.360
You can also regulate the
amount of neurotransmitter

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:49.090
by something called re-uptake,
sometimes called reabsorption,

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.265
where the neurotransmitter--

00:07:51.265 --> 00:07:56.140
absorb-- tion-- where the
neurotransmitter is released.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.490
And then it's taken up by the
presynaptic cell, which is

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.440
a frugal way of doing things.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.940
It doesn't have to
keep synthesizing

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.950
the neurotransmitter, and that--

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.520
so reabsorb-- re-uptake
by the presynaptic cell.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.910
And that is the case for
serotonin and dopamine.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.960
And then in some
cases, you can regulate

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.630
the synthesis, the amount
of neurotransmitter

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.370
that's being made.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.640
And the big class of
neurotransmitters regulated

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.299
in this way are the
endorphins, which

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.270
are a group of peptide
neurotransmitters

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.870
that are the natural opiates
of the body, the natural pain

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.700
regulators of the body.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.740
And all of these
processes are regulatable

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.100
both for modulating
normal synapses,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.320
and also in all cases,
for medication targets,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.700
for drug targets--

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:15.045
so normal modulation
and drug targets.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.840
Let's look at a
couple of slides.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.650
Acetylcholine is
a neurotransmitter

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.280
that binds its receptor on
the postsynaptic membrane.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.460
And after it's done so,
acetylcholinesterase,

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:44.040
the E here, comes and breaks it
down and stops it restimulating

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.280
the postsynaptic cell.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.680
Many nerve gases-- sarin was
one of the famous ones that was

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.680
used in the Japanese
underground some years ago--

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.380
inhibit acetylcholinesterase.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.120
And in that case,
you get a buildup

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.860
of acetylcholine in the post--

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.600
in the synaptic cleft.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.840
You get repeated stimulation
of the postsynaptic cell.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.020
And that leads to, as
I said, respiratory

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.240
paralysis and death.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.250
Our troops overseas have
with them vials of atropine.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.780
Atropine is a competitive
inhibitor of acetylcholine--

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.690
binds to the receptor and
prevents acetylcholine

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:27.830
from binding.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.230
And in the case of
a nerve gas attack,

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.510
if you inject yourself
with atropine,

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.960
you'll stop the
acetylcholine from working.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.340
And you'll be OK.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.080
You get a little kind
of floppy, but you

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.600
can survive, because
they're ultimate mechanisms

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.440
of stimulating those nerves.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:44.940
OK.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.550
Here's serotonin, the
re-uptake pathway.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.910
Serotonin is released as
all neurotransmitters,

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.850
and then it's reabsorbed
by the presynaptic cell.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.820
And SSRIs, whose
mechanism of action

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.520
is really not
understood, do something

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.290
to block the re-uptake
of serotonin.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.830
All right.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.420
The other way, clearly,
that one could modulate

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.500
how often synapses are
active, or how often

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.430
the postsynaptic
cell is stimulated,

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.320
is by modulating the receptors.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.750
Intuitively, if you
have more receptors,

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.630
the neurotransmitter
has more places to bind.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.620
It can send a greater signal
by changing membrane potential,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.400
if you decrease the number
of receptors, and so on.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.990
And it turns out, if you
modify the receptors,

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.900
if you put phosphate
groups on them,

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.590
sometimes you can also
change how well they act.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:50.330
So the other thing to do to
modulate synaptic activity

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.080
is by changing the receptors.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:03.380
And there are really
three ways to do this--

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:17.190
change in number or
change in the type--

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:23.750
the subtype of receptor--
where there might be

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.850
a subtle change in amino acid.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.680
Because you are using
now a different gene

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.660
to make the receptor.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:37.930
You can increase or change the
affinity for neurotransmitter.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.720
And you can change
receptor responsiveness.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.360
All of these three
things have got something

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:04.285
to do with learning and memory.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.700
They have to do with addiction.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.950
And all of these
changes are slow.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:23.310
They occur over minutes,
days, weeks, even.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.140
And for some, we understand
how these changes occur,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.820
but for many, we don't.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.800
The outcome of changing
the receptors--

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:41.250
and I see we have
a board issue here.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.960
So I'm going to put this on--

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.960
actually, let me put
this board down--

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.950
and this board up.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.050
One of the outcomes
of changing all

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.660
of these parameters
about the receptors

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.090
is that over a long
period of time,

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.270
you really change
how a synapse works.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.834
And you can change how a synapse
works through these parameters,

00:14:05.834 --> 00:14:09.830
by repeatedly stimulating
that synapse, OK?

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.780
This is what practice does.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.750
When you practice your
musical instrument,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.450
or you practice your
biochemistry problems,

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.490
and you do it over
and over, you're

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:24.140
changing the synapses that allow
you to engage these problems.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.640
And these processes
have got names.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.070
So let me just complete this.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:37.850
So by changing receptors so that
repeated synaptic stimulation--

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.916
changes the responsiveness
of the synapse--

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:03.290
generally, as I say, through
the receptors in this case.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.650
OK.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.760
And there are two outputs.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.320
One, you can increase
the synaptic response.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.270
You can make it more
likely that there'll

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.700
be an action potential.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.230
And that would take place
at excitatory synapses.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.590
And this process is known
as a long term potentiation.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.540
It's the stuff you
want when you're

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.250
trying to learn something.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.350
It's believed to be
the way memory works.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.340
You can also
decrease the response

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.620
of a particular
synapse, and that

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.800
would work if it was
an inhibitory synapse.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.935
And in that case, the
process is called long term--

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.810
let's just write it out--

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.450
long term depression.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.920
Both of these processes have
been shown to work in the lab,

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.480
in culture--

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.850
hard to do those
experiments on real animals.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.610
But it's believed that
that's how memory works.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.460
So in your first handout, I've
drawn out for you the idea.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.400
Here is a normal axon.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.370
The presynaptic and
the postsynaptic cell--

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.930
neurotransmitters released.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.790
It engages receptors.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.480
And at some frequency, there's
an action potential elicited.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.420
If you change-- if you
repeatedly stimulate that axon

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.220
over time--

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.810
days, minutes-- you change
the receptor spectrum

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.640
on the postsynaptic cell.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.120
And in long term, potentiation
responsiveness increases.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.280
Whereas in long
term depression, you

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.400
decrease receptor number,
or some other parameter,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.946
and you lead to
decreased responsiveness.

00:17:00.946 --> 00:17:01.446
OK.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:14.020
Let us move on to our
second topic, which

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:21.510
is that of circuits,
which refers

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.240
to multiple connectivities--

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.130
multiple synapses forming
in a way that is stable,

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:33.285
and that can lead to particular
outcomes of particular stimuli.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.920
Let's look at your
next handout to try

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.020
to get a sense of where we are.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.660
So I've diagrammed
this out for you.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.510
And I've started
here with some kind

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.500
of sensory neuron, an
interneuron, and a motor

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.580
neuron--

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.081
three connected neurons.

00:17:57.081 --> 00:17:59.080
You could put a lot of
these other things called

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.850
interneurons in the way.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.460
Sensory neurons receive signals.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.660
Motor neurons tell things to
happen, like muscles to work.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.790
And interneurons, of
which there can be many,

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.610
are the connectors between
sensory and motor neurons.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.030
There's an input, and
there's an output.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.360
And what happens in between--

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.130
this is a synthesis
of what we've

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.810
talked about over the
last couple of lectures.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.710
The sensory neuron
makes multiple synapses

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.000
onto the interneuron.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.670
They can be excitatory
or inhibitory.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.005
They're summated.

00:18:35.005 --> 00:18:37.720
The interneuron then
decides whether to make

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.000
an action potential or not--

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.360
action potential-- yes
or no in each case.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.460
If it makes an
action potential, it

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.330
sends its signal to the next
neuron, the motor neuron.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.390
That motor neuron is
getting a bunch of inputs--

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.640
excitatory and inhibitory.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.160
And it, again, has to decide
whether or not there's

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.080
an action potential, OK?

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.260
So that's the context
that puts circuits,

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.040
where we have been discussing
the process of setting up

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.840
the connections in
the nervous system.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.170
The thing about circuits-- and
here's a term you should know--

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:20.515
is that they have to do
with axon pathfinding.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.470
And so let's, for a moment,
forget this diagram, which

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:33.580
is a diagram of what
there is in the adult.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.670
And let's think about how
these circuits are set up.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.080
The circuits that we have in
our brains and then our bodies

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.640
are of the close to uncountable.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.120
I'm not sure we ever will count
them in an animal as complex

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.140
as ourselves.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.050
It's been done in
caenorhabditis,

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.910
which has got 1,000
cells-- the little

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.700
worm we talked about--
it's got 1,000 cells.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.300
And all of the connections
in caenorhabditis

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.600
have been mapped.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.480
And they are extremely complex.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.340
But that's just a
handful of neurons.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.590
When you're talking
about 10 to the 10th, 10

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:13.380
to the 11th neurons, those
connections are enormous.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.350
But we can ask some
basic questions, OK?

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.190
And let's just state it.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.460
Neurons are connected
to form circuits.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.845
We can say that they're
functional circuits,

00:20:31.845 --> 00:20:32.345
if you like.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.860
That is implicit.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.620
And the big question is,
how do these circuits

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.515
know where to form?

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.430
Or if you like the
restatement, how

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.590
do the neurons
know where to go--

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.380
know to go and where to connect?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.290
And there are two kind
of intuitive answers,

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.810
both of which turn
out to be correct.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.960
Either the neurons just
go every which way.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.420
And if it works,
that's retained,

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.710
and the rest of the connections
just are dissolved and go away.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.210
And that's true.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:36.040
But the bigger truth is that the
neurons are told where to go.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.530
So you can phrase these
that the neurons undergo

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:47.800
some kind of random process
where neurons survive

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.555
if connections are made.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.910
Or there's some kind
of guided process

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.390
where the neurons
are told where to go.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:17.192
And both of these turn out,
after many, many years of work,

00:22:17.192 --> 00:22:17.775
to be correct.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.620
Let's look at some slides here.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.560
This is work from Professor
Fee, over in Brain and Cognitive

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.070
Science.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.730
He studies these little
birds and their song circuit,

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.390
which forms and reforms
during the life of the bird.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.920
The circuit is complicated.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.350
These are not single neurons.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.180
They are bundles of neurons.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.430
But it's kind of mappable.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.920
And this is one of the circuits.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.560
It's got something to do with
song within the bird brain.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.630
It's not the entire circuit.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.330
That's one of the things
that's going on here on campus.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:57.050
But when you start thinking
about things like language--

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.090
I really like this slide.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.090
Because these are activity
plots of the brain that

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.050
can be done in a number of ways
by monitoring oxygen uptake,

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.850
or glucose use.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.310
But you can look and
see different parts

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.970
of the brain are active.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.950
And when you think
about language--

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.860
here are these four
parts of the brain.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.140
Actually, here is a
huge part of the brain

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.480
used to generate words.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.320
Each of these parts of the
brain are millions and millions

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.150
of neurons, which are
connected to one another

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.240
within these regions.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.110
And then each of these regions
is connected to one another.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.750
And each of those
regions is connected

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:40.280
to the output, which would be
all of your vocal apparatus.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.490
And all of this is connected
to your auditory apparatus,

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.000
to your visual system, so
that you can read words.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.250
They can be
processed, and so on.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.830
The connections
that give language

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.920
probably take a very
large part of your brain.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.940
I would throw out 15%
to 20% of your brain

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.030
is involved in some
aspect of language--

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.270
receiving,
generating, or output.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.570
And the circuits there,
as I said, are enormous.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.200
OK.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.540
So do neurons know where to go?

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.380
Let me go with you.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.610
This isn't on your handout.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.360
This is to look on the screen.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.690
Do neurons know
where to connect?

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:21.630
There was a very famous
experiment done by Sperry,

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.750
some many years ago--

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:27.560
Roger Sperry-- who got a
Nobel Prize for his work--

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.540
that involved a frog.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.160
And it involved figuring out
where the neurons in the retina

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.030
went.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.620
So it turns out, if
you look at your eyes,

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.650
OK, there are neurons
that go from your eye

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.590
back into your brain.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.750
The neurons on the
side of your nose

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.100
are called the nasal neurons.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.810
And the neurons on
the side of you,

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.110
or the outside of your face,
are called temporal neurons.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.290
And what Sperry did was
to take an adult frog

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.470
and rotate the
eye 180 degrees so

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.740
that the nasal neurons would now
be on the outside of the head.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.460
The temporal neurons would be
on the inside of the head, OK?

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.370
And for a while
after the operation,

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.170
the frog was really confused.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:17.020
But after a while, it
actually recovered.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.460
Now let's lay out this--

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.990
and the recovery, as
I'm going to tell you,

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:27.000
told Sperry and the world that
neurons were told where to go.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.300
So here is the retina
depicted as a circle.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.060
And here's a part of the
brain called the optic tectum,

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.740
that the neurons connect to.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.860
It's the first part
of their circuit.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.850
Here are the temporal
neurons connecting

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.670
to the C region of the
brain, and the nasal

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:45.560
neurons connecting
to the R region.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.870
So after this rotation,
there were two possibilities.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.870
One was that the
axons growing out.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.030
So let's just be clear.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.330
In this rotation, these
axons were severed.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.500
They were cut.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.890
They had to regrow and find
their targets, if they could.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.610
So one possibility would be
that the axons would grow out

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.440
of this retina, and
they'd grow everywhere.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.440
And they wouldn't make
really wrong connections.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.090
And things would be a mess.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.340
In actual fact,
what really happened

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.800
was that the nasal
neurons, even though they

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.780
were on the wrong
side of the face,

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.820
found their way to the R region.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.670
And the tactile neurons found
their way to the C region,

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.370
just like they had
connected to before.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.740
And this was a really
profound experiment

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.040
that told investigators
that axons knew where to go.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.110
And we know the molecular
basis of this now,

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.240
but I'm not going to
tell you about it.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:47.360
In order to understand more
about this guidance process,

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.390
you need to understand
a part of the axon

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.990
that we haven't discussed,
and a time in the neurons life

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.060
that we haven't
discussed either.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.230
And that is a time when
neurons are growing.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:04.340
Most neuronal growth takes place
during embryonic development,

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.570
but it continues
throughout life.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.590
And so this is a developmental
process, but also

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.640
in that experiment,
that was an adult frog.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.310
OK.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:20.240
So guidance of neurons--

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:26.630
and as we'll discuss,
particularly axons--

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:33.740
occurs during
development and repair--

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.970
and learning as well.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:42.140
We can put that up as well--
during development, repair,

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.529
and learning.

00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:46.070
Although I'd say
for learning there's

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.330
a bit of a question mark
whether that's true.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.990
But I think it's probably true.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.900
OK.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.390
And the cell that
we need to consider

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.885
is a committed neuron, which
is called a neuroblast.

00:27:57.885 --> 00:27:59.460
It doesn't matter.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.580
But here's your
committed neuron.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.120
You have to think back
to past lectures--

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.220
a neuron that knows that
it's going to be a neuron

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.220
but hasn't decided to--
hasn't become one yet--

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.140
hasn't differentiated.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.660
It's called a neuroblast.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.400
And here it is.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.160
It's just a cell body
with the nucleus.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.980
And over time, this
neuroblast sends out

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.740
processes that are
called neurites.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.600
They initially look the same.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.760
Soon some of them
become dendrites.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.760
And one of them
becomes an axon--

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:52.680
some neurite, axon,
plus dendrite outgrowth.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:02.980
So you have a cell now
with some processes.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.730
And one of these is
going to be the axon.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.250
And that axon grows.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.560
And it's during
that growth process

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.380
that it figures out where to go.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.800
The cell body doesn't move.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.580
The dendrites don't move.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:20.110
It's the axon that is
doing the pathfinding.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:40.230
So the axon extends and
eventually finds its target.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:52.120
And this extension is a growth
process that we'll talk about.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.440
OK.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.570
For every-- a nerve--

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.400
when we talk about nerves--

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.660
there are actually many--

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.840
many neurons, many axons.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.070
There are bundles of axons.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.030
And there is something
about the first axon

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.760
to find a target,
that's very important--

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.600
the pioneer axon.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.510
The first one finds the target.

00:30:18.895 --> 00:30:19.895
And then others follow--

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.920
the same path that
lays down a path.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:36.350
And they form bundles,
also called fascicles.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:41.735
And these fascicles
together make the nerve.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.160
The part of the
axon that's really

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.880
important for this process
is the very tip of the axon,

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.670
and it has a special name
called the growth cone.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:08.080
So the axon tip, or the
growth cone, is crucial.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.820
And we can draw it on the board.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.760
If we now draw an axon--

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.540
and we've blown it up now.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.810
So usually we blow
up and we lose bits,

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.790
but now we're not going
to lose any bit of it.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.410
Here's the axon.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:35.230
And down the length of the axon
are parallel microtubules--

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.950
many of them.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:43.180
And these microtubules
both stabilize the axon

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.650
and also transport substances
to and from the cell body.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:56.980
So they stabilize the
shape of very long axons,

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:04.870
and they also transport,
like little railway tracks,

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:09.290
substances to and
from the cell body.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.070
That's not the tip of the axon.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.150
At the very tip, the
microtubules end,

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:21.940
and they interdigitate with
these finger-like protrusions,

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.560
which are very dynamic.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.060
That means they
change all the time.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:31.330
And these protrusions protrude
because of polymerized actin.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.539
And you might be saying, we
heard about that already.

00:32:33.539 --> 00:32:34.038
Yes.

00:32:34.038 --> 00:32:35.920
You've heard about
that in morphogenesis.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.480
We've talked about this.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:42.250
Cell biology is cell biology,
whether it's about neurons,

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.760
or cells in your stomach,
or cells in your--

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.130
that give rise to the
hairs on your head.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.330
All of these cells
are just cells.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.800
So there are these
protrusions at the end.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.950
So this whole thing is the axon.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:03.810
But the very end
is the growth cone.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:06.100
This very end is
the growth cone.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:21.590
And these protrusions go
by the name of filopodia,

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:27.350
filamentous, and lamellipodia,
more flattened feet.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.060
And they protrude because of
the polymerization of actin

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.165
within them.

00:33:36.165 --> 00:33:48.800
So there's F-actin
leads to protrusions.

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.070
Well, that's one
important thing.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.050
And I'll show you
a movie in a moment

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.330
to show you that
as an axon grows,

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:01.330
it's sending out zillions
of these things all the time

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.370
that are feeling their
way around the place.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:05.292
Actually, I'll-- no.

00:34:05.292 --> 00:34:07.750
I won't show you now, because
there's an intervening slide.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.980
But the other thing you should
know is that like all cells,

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.760
there are receptors on the
surface of the growth cone

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.170
that are also sampling what
ligands are in the environment.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:26.790
And if the ligands
are favorable,

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:30.540
they will either stabilize
these protrusions

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.000
and make more of
them to take place.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.015
So here are receptors
all over the place.

00:34:39.192 --> 00:34:40.425
This is a receptor.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:55.570
And if receptors
contact ligands,

00:34:55.570 --> 00:35:00.730
then again, you will
get F-actin formed.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.100
And protrusions will be formed.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.260
And they will be stabilized.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.910
OK.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:11.230
The growth cone is
paramount to axon outgrowth.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:15.430
There are signals which both
attract axons towards them,

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:19.110
and signals which repel axons.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.080
We can call those,
not surprisingly,

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.270
attractive signals.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.910
We'll talk about
some in a moment.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:33.390
And in that case, the
growth cone extends.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:40.350
And it extends-- not
to beat a dead horse

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:46.230
here-- but because F-actin
increases or is stabilized.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.570
And the flip is
that the growth cone

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:54.400
can be destabilized
and literally collapse

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.170
under repulsive signals.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:10.140
The growth cone collapses.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:16.380
And it collapses because
F-actin now becomes

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.580
G globula, or
unpolymerized actin,

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.150
using exactly the same
processes that we talked about

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.530
during the
morphogenesis lecture.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.050
Let's look at a
couple of slides.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.830
You don't have these.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.870
So just look on the screen.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:36.390
This is a cell drawn in
Professor Lodish's book.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.640
Here's the leading
edge of the cell.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.950
The direction of the
cell is where there

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.875
is lots of polymerized actin.

00:36:44.875 --> 00:36:46.640
This I've just
drawn on the board.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.410
And here is an
axonal growth code.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.860
And I really like this movie.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.990
It's a time lapse
taken over 10 minutes.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:58.280
And you can see all these things
at the end and on the sides--

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.700
these protrusions from
the cell-- very active.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.450
They're forming.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:05.410
They're disaggregating, forming
again and disaggregating

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:07.300
as the cell-- those
of the lamellipodia

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.620
and the filopodia--

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.160
as the cell is feeling its
way through the environment--

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.920
trying to find
somewhere to go, OK?

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.380
So this is a real exploratory
process by the cell.

00:37:20.981 --> 00:37:21.480
Good.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.770
What are these guidance signals?

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.230
Well, this is not
a mystery either.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.540
Ligands-- we know
about receptors.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.110
You know about the guidance
signals are ligands.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:38:00.170
And these ligands, when
they're bound to a receptor,

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.830
lead to signal transduction
and axon outgrowth.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:11.690
So ligands-- and we'll put in
parentheses, plus receptors--

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:23.380
to signal transduction-- and
a change in the growth cone.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.990
There are two kinds
of guidance signals

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.840
that are reasonably
separate from one another.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:41.260
They're called short range and
long range guidance signals.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:47.590
Short range signals
require contact

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:52.060
between the axon and the
extracellular matrix,

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.500
or the axon and another cell.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.150
So there's some localized
accumulation of a signal,

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:04.360
and that has to be directly
contacted by the growth cone--

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:13.255
so require axon ECM,
or cell contact.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.470
These signals are
not diffusible.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.010
Therefore-- and
they include things

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:32.740
like laminin, which is a part
of the extracellular matrix,

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.830
but also an axon
guidance signal.

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:41.740
And then there are
long range signals,

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.470
which would be the flip
of the short range.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.640
These are diffusible.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.320
And they can be concentration
dependent in their effect.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.370
And we talked about
things like this

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:03.220
previously when we
talked about morphogens--

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.910
other ligands that can act
at different concentrations

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:08.650
in different ways.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.190
OK.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.010
And an example that I'll
explore more with you

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.225
is the netrin protein.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:23.410
All right.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.960
Let me see what I have here.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.140
OK, this is nice.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.540
This is on your-- this
is your next handout.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.950
And this is an assay for
short range guidance signals.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.960
It's called a stripe assay.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.000
And this was how it was found.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.520
What those nasal and temporal
retinal neurons grew on--

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.890
the idea is you
take a plastic dish,

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:48.010
and you put stripes of
different molecules on the dish.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:51.726
And then you put neurons all the
way along one side of the dish.

00:40:51.726 --> 00:40:52.600
And you look at them.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.496
You ask where they grow.

00:40:54.496 --> 00:40:55.870
And they'll choose
where to grow.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.550
And if they like one
of the molecules,

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.370
if they can interact with one
of the molecules on the dish,

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:02.440
they will grow in
particular stripes,

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.570
and not in other stripes.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.570
And that gives you your
experiment and control

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:07.670
in one dish.

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:09.560
This is what it looks like.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:13.990
So here are the neurons from
the nasal side of the retina.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.330
And those nasal
neurons, which project

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:21.910
to the R side of the tectum,
grow on our membranes,

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:25.240
but not on C membranes,
which is where they don't go.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.940
You may not have this, but you
can go back and look at this

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.430
later on.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:31.450
All right.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.660
But let's move on
now to an example

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.230
that I want to spend
a bit of time on.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:44.390
And the example of a long
range signal is that the netrin

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:45.550
in the spinal cord.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.240
And what we're
going to talk about

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.060
are two types of
neurons, one of which

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.120
are growing down the spinal
cord from the back, more

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.030
towards the belly, and
another type of neuron that's

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:05.540
growing more from the belly
side of the spinal cord, back

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.790
towards the back, OK?

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.520
And those neurons
always know where to go.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.660
And it turns out they are told
where to go by the same signal.

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.270
So there are two
types of neurons.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:23.970
There are these things
called commissural neurons.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:35.890
And they grow
ventrally, or down,

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.170
towards something
called the floor plate.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:40.990
I'll show you in the diagram.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:43.090
And then there are
these other ones

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:52.910
called trochlear neurons
that grow dorsally, or up.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:57.230
And they grow away from this
thing called the floor plate.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:02.450
And it turns out,
using an explant assay,

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.440
that I'll go through
with you in your slides--

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.980
but you should understand--

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:14.180
it was found that a single
molecule called netrin, which

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:22.440
is a secreted ligand, a
secreted protein, that's

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.135
expressed in the floor plate--

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.840
which we'll talk
about in a moment--

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:48.130
is attractive for the
commissural neurons

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.625
and repulsive for the
trochlear neurons.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:01.990
And it also turns out, as
we'll go through in a moment,

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.660
that this has to do
with different receptors

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:09.190
and different receptor dimers,
which bind the same ligand.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.860
And so here there
is something called,

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.950
for the commissural
neurons, there

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.690
is something called a DCC--

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:19.355
DCC receptor dimer.

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:26.220
And for the trochlear
neurons, there

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:33.472
is a DCC UNC5 receptor pair.

00:44:33.472 --> 00:44:34.930
And this will not
mean much to you,

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.590
but now you can write it down.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.130
And then you can go
through your slides.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:44.530
And you'll have a reference
point on right with you.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:45.830
OK.

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.570
So here is the diagram.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:51.450
The cell bodies of the
commissural neurons

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:54.270
are up in this region
of the spinal cord

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.280
called the roof plate.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.630
It's the top of the spinal cord.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:00.510
And on the bottom of the
spinal cord, near your belly,

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:03.900
there is a cone-shaped
group of cells

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.630
that forms this thing
called the floor plate.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.910
The floor plate doesn't
actually make neurons.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.820
It turns out to be a really
important source of signals.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.860
It's an organizer, if you like.

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.880
And it not only organizes
these axons in the spinal cord,

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.647
it actually also
organizes your midline.

00:45:20.647 --> 00:45:22.230
And it's one of the
reasons, if you're

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.750
missing the midline of
the body, things go wrong.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.850
It's because the floor
plates are not there.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.030
So the floor plate
is an organizer.

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.610
They are the commissural
neurons growing towards it.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.880
And here are the trochlear
neurons growing away

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.950
from the floor plate.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:41.440
This is what it looks like
if you do an immunostain.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.180
The cell bodies are in red.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.190
And here are the
commissural neurons

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.090
coming down in the spinal cord.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:49.300
And this is a section
through the spinal cord, OK?

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.600
You've cut through--
cut through at the waist

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.330
and then turned the
section on its side.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:58.280
So you're looking
into the spinal cord,

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.270
which would be coming out in
its length from the board--

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.920
from the screen.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.460
All right.

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.840
Here's an explant assay to
figure out whether or not

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.670
that floor plate
has got something

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:14.180
to do with the direction that
those commissural neurons grow.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:17.550
So on your handout,
the idea was to take

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.830
a piece of dorsal
spinal cord that

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.620
hadn't started to
send neurons out yet,

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:26.190
and to culture it together
in the laboratory,

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:29.460
in a plastic dish, with
some fluid nutrients,

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.305
and so on, and
ask what happened.

00:46:31.305 --> 00:46:34.680
And if you did that,
that dorsal spinal cord

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:39.480
sent out neurons
towards the floor plate.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.940
On the other hand, you can
see that that experiment was

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:44.940
specific, because if you put
the dorsal spinal cord together

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.940
with some roof plate,
nothing happened.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.830
There was no outgrowth.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.800
So there was something
special about this floor plate

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.490
that elicited that
commissural acts on outgrowth.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.890
And the idea is that the
floor plate was attracting

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:01.530
the commissural axons.

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.040
This is what it
really looks like.

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.550
Here's a chunk of dorsal
spinal cord and floor plate.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.410
And here are the growing axons.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:10.310
And here's the
control experiment.

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:10.810
All right.

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:14.060
So what is the protein involved?

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.270
Well, the idea was that it was
something in the floor plate.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.130
And it was really
hard to find this,

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:21.110
because there's not much of it.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:23.870
Professor Tessier-Lavigne,
who is now

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:27.210
president of Rockefeller
University, but at the time

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:30.140
he was running a research
laboratory, and he

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.870
and many undergraduates,
and graduate students,

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:36.840
and post-docs, and so on,
went ahead and dissected many,

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.480
many little floor plates.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.760
And they also found that
the brain of the chicken

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.950
contained the same
kind of activity.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:45.920
So they dissected
out many thousands--

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.190
I believe it was 35,000--

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:51.480
chick brains and spinal cords.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.050
And they did biochemistry
on this material.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:57.246
And they used the explant
assay that I just showed you,

00:47:57.246 --> 00:47:58.620
where instead of
the floor plate,

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.820
you'd have a little pellet
of material in which you

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.770
had soaked the
material that you've

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:07.550
purified by biochemistry,
from your smushed up,

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:09.200
dissected brains.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.200
And from this-- it was really
successful-- from this,

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.700
they got a single protein.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.700
Here's the RNA for the protein.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:19.040
That's right expressed
in the floor plate.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.090
That's what the white is.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:20.890
That's the RNA.

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:22.760
This is an in situ
hybridisation.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.320
And they called it netrin.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.560
Netrin protein diffuses
away from the floor plate,

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.380
but it's still mostly
on this ventral side

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:31.880
of the spinal cord.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.360
And you could show that
netrin was important,

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.150
because if you meet a
mouse that lacked netrin--

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:41.060
here's the mouse
that lacks netrin--

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.280
the commissural neurons
go all over the place.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.920
They really don't
know where to go.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.120
All right.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.870
The netrin receptors,
as I drew on the board--

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.979
you can look on
your last handout--

00:48:53.979 --> 00:48:54.520
are two-fold.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:02.460
One of them are called
DCC, the tyrosine kinases.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.600
They also activate GTPases
and do some other signal

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.950
transduction.

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:12.090
And when netrin binds
to a dimer of DCC,

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:14.580
you get F-actin that's made.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.230
Microtubules grow.

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:18.420
And the growth cone extends.

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:24.540
On the other hand, when you get
this hetero dimer DCC and UNC5,

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:29.530
or a different homodimer, you
get cytoskeletal remodeling,

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:34.210
G-actin made, and the
growth cone collapses.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.880
OK.

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.710
Close enough.

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:38.840
We'll stop there.
