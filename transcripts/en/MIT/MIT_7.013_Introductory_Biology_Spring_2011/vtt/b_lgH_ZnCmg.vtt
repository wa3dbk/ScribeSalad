00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.420
TYLER JACKS: OK.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.930
So now we're going to change
gears entirely, and talk

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.650
about cancer.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.070
And to put you in the
mood to talk about cancer,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.070
I'm going to show you a
video, which we actually

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.780
produced last year for the
American Association for Cancer

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.320
Research annual meeting, to
open up that meeting, actually.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.910
Hopefully, there's sound.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.785
Guys, upstairs?

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.120
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.120
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.500
TYLER JACKS: Hopefully,
you're inspired.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.390
That video is on YouTube if
you want to watch it again.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.740
It's got to 15,000 hits.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.030
It's not exactly viral, but
still pretty good, pretty good

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.580
for a cancer research video.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.650
And the video really
was to kind of get

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.200
people excited about both
the progress that's been made

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.550
and the opportunity that exists.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.091
But also some of
the great challenges

00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:30.499
that we're referred to in some
of those facts and figures

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:31.290
that you saw there.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.040
So I want to review
some of that with you,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.950
and give you a
sense of what we're

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.560
doing to improve our progress,
accelerate our progress.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.140
And the bottom line
is I'm actually

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.420
extremely excited
about the potential

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.400
that we'll have over
the next decade or two

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.650
in really changing the course
of some of those numbers

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.520
that you saw there.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.180
But just to remind you of the
severity of the problem, when

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.700
we consider the statistics
regarding cancer in the United

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:04.550
States, in the United
States over the next year,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.390
there'll be about 1.4 million
new cases in the United States.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:22.540
That does not include common
forms of skin cancer--

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.430
squamous cell skin cancer,
basal cell skin cancer

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.580
contribute another
million cases.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.410
So it's a very,
very common disease,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.270
very commonly diagnosed
in this country,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.310
and indeed, around the world.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.445
Again, just considering
the next year,

00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:48.820
it's estimated
that there will be

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:59.490
about 560,000 deaths in the
United States due to cancer,

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.649
and about 8 million
in the world.

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:03.190
And you might have
seen the statistic

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.680
that more people die
in the world of cancer

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.110
per year than of malaria,
TB, or HIV aids combined.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.615
So very, very common,
very, very deadly disease.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.200
In this country, the lifetime
risk of developing cancer

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.830
is 1 in 2 for men,
1 in 3 for women,

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.510
based on current statistics.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.450
Again, hopefully by the
time you guys are old

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.300
and cancer typically is a
disease of older people,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.160
these statistics will change.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.900
But that's what they are now.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.270
So if they don't change,
then a large number

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.630
of you sitting here will
experience this diagnosis.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.510
And by current statistics, 1
in 4 deaths are due to cancer.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.080
Cancer has recently bypassed
cardiovascular disease

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.690
as the leading cause of
death in the United States.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.260
Cardiovascular disease rates
have dropped precipitously.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.930
Cancer rates have dropped
less significantly,

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.770
although they are coming down.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.890
Also, the population is aging.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.260
And cancer tends to be a
disease of older people.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.590
So the demographics
also increase

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.080
the numbers of people who
are dying from this disease.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.789
So a major problem.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:43.000
But also think of it
as a major opportunity

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.290
to do something really
important if you

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.390
choose to get into this field.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.940
So cancer, I think, is
familiar to everybody

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.520
on one level or another,
but you might not

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.830
have seen the disease up close.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.810
I hope that you haven't.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.990
But I want to teach you a little
bit about what it looks like,

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.930
and really what are some of
the fundamental definitions.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:10.390
So lung cancer, a very commonly
diagnosed cancer in this

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.530
country-- we'll talk more
about it in a minute--

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.709
is diagnosed either by a chest
x-ray following symptoms,

00:09:16.709 --> 00:09:19.000
and you can see perhaps,
although the light isn't great

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.610
here, that there's a
dark mass right here.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.750
And this dark mass indicates
the presence of a tumor.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.820
A more refined
diagnosis can be done

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.140
by basically serial x-rays,
commuted tomography.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.830
And you can see this very
clearly defined mass growing

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.150
in the lung of the individual.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.780
Cancer is an accumulation
of cells, an abnormal number

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.430
of cells within a tissue.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:47.040
And you can see that
solid tumor here and here.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.400
You can also see
cancers in the blood.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.710
Again, an abnormal
number of cells

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.150
within the blood, a leukemia.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.990
This is a normal blood smear.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.360
Here are red blood cells.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.170
And here is a normal number
of white blood cells.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.500
These might be B-cells.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.640
These might be neutrophils.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.670
And you can see an accumulation
of these nucleated white blood

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.820
cells in this leukemic patient.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.970
Thousands, hundreds of
thousands more of these cells

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.970
than should be present
within this blood sample.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.850
This is colon cancer.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.440
Colon cancer, as
you probably know,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.920
can be detected by
colonoscopy, a very important

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.450
diagnostic test,
preventative test.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.590
And we can actually see
the lining of the colon.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:38.180
And this is a normal section
of colonic epithelium.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.190
And here is a tumor developing.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.510
It's called a polyp.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:47.030
This is an early stage,
precancerous tumor.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.040
We'll talk more about the
details of that in a second.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.580
If this is diagnosed
during endoscopy,

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.610
they're actually removed
right during the procedure.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.550
And this is very important
to prevent those tumors

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.430
from progressing further
into true cancer.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.700
And actually, colon cancer
rates have dropped significantly

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.170
because of this test.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.380
When these lesions are
discovered, they are removed.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.970
And therefore,
they can't progress

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.290
into true colon cancer.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.680
However, sometimes you see this.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.170
And this is a tumor that
has progressed further.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.400
It's divided more.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.220
It's taken on additional
abnormal properties

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.730
and actually moved through
the wall of the colon

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.890
and is beginning to spread
throughout the body.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.950
This is true cancer and
much, much harder to treat.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.766
Not impossible, but
much harder to treat.

00:11:33.766 --> 00:11:35.390
When this is discovered,
you can't just

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.370
remove the specific lesion.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.380
You have to have surgery.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.660
And a section of
the colon is removed

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.850
to take out the
tumor in the hope

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.440
that that will get rid
of the disease entirely.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.110
But the concern is,
in this situation,

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.510
that the diseased cells
might have moved out

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.420
into the body in the
process of metastasis,

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.120
which will make the disease
much more difficult to treat.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.620
OK.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.080
So I've given you some
terminology there.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.295
Let me just explain some
of it in greater detail.

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.070
Actually, before I do
that, let me show you

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.810
one more, a couple of slides.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.020
So as indicated on
that slide, cancer

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.440
develops in stages
from normal cells

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.820
through the development of a
benign, precancerous lesion,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.740
finally to the development
of true cancer.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.400
And we can depict that
graphically, as shown here.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.070
This is a normal tissue.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.540
Here are normal cells.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.140
These might be epithelial
cells lining the intestine.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.020
Those cells sit on top of
a basement membrane made

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.770
of extracellular matrix
proteins, which provide them

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.750
structure and some function.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.850
There might be other cells
present in this region,

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.710
stem cells or
progenitor cells, which

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.260
will replenish those
differentiated cells as they

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.230
are sloughed off and die.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.810
These cells can
acquire alterations--

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.510
and we'll discuss this in great
detail today and next time--

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.300
alterations in
their genes, which

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.790
allow those cells to do
things they shouldn't do,

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.280
namely to proliferate
abnormally.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.380
So rather than having
a single line of cells,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.840
we now have a little
clump of cells.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.750
These cells might look
identical to their neighbors,

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.380
but there are too many of them.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.580
This is a process we call
hyperplasia, too many cells,

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.280
too much growth.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.390
Within this collection of
cells, additional alterations

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.590
may take place that allow those
cells to divide more rapidly

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.780
and to do even more
abnormal things,

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.270
to pile up on one or another,
which they shouldn't normally

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.350
do.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.190
This is the development of one
of those early stage tumors.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.530
I showed you a
polyp in the colon.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.930
That's a stage of cancer,
in the case of colon cancer,

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:48.950
called an adenoma.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.120
That's a benign tumor.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.580
It's not yet cancer.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.920
It's actually not
yet life threatening.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.590
But it's detectable because
it's a mass of cells

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.180
that shouldn't be there.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.850
Within that collection of
cells, still further alterations

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.170
can take place.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.240
And now the cells
do additional things

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.040
that are wrong and
potentially dangerous.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.120
One, they're recruiting
a blood supply.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.790
They're recruiting blood
vessels into the tumor

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.510
to nourish the tumor and
bring factors that the tumor

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.880
cells need for their survival.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.560
In addition, the
cells are starting

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.710
to degrade that
extracellular matrix.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:29.370
They're starting to acquire
the ability to move away

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.870
from their normal site.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.320
Most cells in your body know
where they're supposed to be,

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.760
and they stay there.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.870
Cancer cells acquire the ability
to leave their primary site

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.340
and to disseminate
throughout the body,

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.640
creating secondary tumors.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.940
This happens when the cells
access the blood vessels.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.790
They can then travel
within the blood system

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.870
and then take up residence
in some secondary site.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.860
And this we call metastasis.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.260
Metastatic tumors
are tumors that

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.080
are derived from
the primary cancer--

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.040
and this is true cancer here--

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.100
derived from the
primary cancer, that

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.310
have now created a secondary
tumor somewhere else.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.070
And this is actually the
most lethal phase of cancer.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.420
Of the 560 cancer--

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.000
560,000 cancer deaths
that will occur

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.290
in this country this
year, 500,000 of them

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.545
are due to this
phase of the disease.

00:15:25.545 --> 00:15:26.920
It's actually not
a phase that we

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.290
understand terribly
well today, but clearly

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.610
a very important one.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.370
So cancer arises
from normal cells

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.960
through the
sequential acquisition

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.480
of alterations that allow
those cells to do things

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.940
they should not
normally do, including

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.140
invade and metastasize.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.460
This is what it looks
like in real life.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.140
This is a tumor.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.560
It's actually a tumor from
a mouse created in my lab.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.280
It's lung cancer.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.080
This lacy appearance is
the normal lung epithelium.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.970
There's a lot of air
spaces in the lung

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.621
to allow you to get gas
exchange in the lung.

00:16:01.621 --> 00:16:03.370
And you can see in
this region right here,

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:08.440
there's a bit of a thickening
of those epithelial structures.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.460
Too many cells, that's this
area we call hyperplasia.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:17.870
Over time, these will
give way to solid growths.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.506
The cells within those solid
growths look pretty normal.

00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:22.130
And you might be able
to see that here.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.090
The cells are pretty
well organized.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.650
They are all lined up.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.320
There's just too many of them.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.960
That's a benign
tumor, an adenoma.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.660
Over time, these will give rise
to true cancers, carcinomas.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.750
And these have the
ability to spread locally

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.080
and throughout the body.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.440
In addition, the cells
look even more abnormal.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.400
They don't look like the
cells that gave rise to them.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.190
OK.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.577
Now let me give you some more
details of the terminology

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:52.660
that I've just been using.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:05.745
Hyperplasia is
increased cell number.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.980
But the architecture of the
cells is otherwise normal.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.210
They look like normal cells.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:25.950
If progression occurs, a
benign tumor might arise.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.710
This is not yet cancer.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:34.330
These tumors are
so-called not aggressive.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.510
They basically stay
where they started.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.565
They don't destroy
the local tissue.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.530
And they don't leave the site.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.960
And if they are detected,
for example in a colonoscopy,

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.680
they can be removed.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.720
If they're detected in the lung
when they're at this stage,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.980
they can be removed surgically
and the patient will be fine.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:14.030
However, they can progress
into a malignant tumor.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.850
And this is where we
use the term cancer.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.790
Cancer actually refers
not to just any tumor,

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.950
but a malignant tumor.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:30.820
And these, by contrast,
are aggressive.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.430
The cells are
dividing more rapidly.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:39.620
They're also causing changes
within the local tissue

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.390
such that they're
locally destructive

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.365
to the local tissue.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.620
And they have the
potential to spread,

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:56.300
to get outside of their local
area, access the blood vessels,

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.140
and move to a distant site.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:06.060
And that leads to
this final phase

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:20.080
of metastasis, which
is the tumor growing

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.260
at a distant site.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.930
And that can be one site
or it can be many sites.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.720
And again, it's the
combined effects

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.390
of the metastatic tumors that
tends to kill cancer patients.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.770
Now cancers can arise
in virtually all organs,

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.570
all tissues.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.610
Cancer is an umbrella
term that actually

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:46.310
refers to many different
diseases of abnormal growth.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:56.780
The most common tumors in humans
affect epithelial tissues,

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.580
epithelial tissues.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.560
And these epithelial
tissues will give rise

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.350
to a cancer type
called carcinomas.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.440
Carcinomas are cancers
of epithelial tissues.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:23.280
Breast cancer, lung
cancer pancreas cancer--

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.520
these are all cancers
of epithelial tissues.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:38.910
The precursor lesions are
called adenomas, in many cases.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:39.785
And these are benign.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.050
We can also have cancers
of connective tissues,

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.040
and these are
called, collectively,

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.130
sarcomas, sarcomas.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.400
Muscle tumors, myosarcomas.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.750
Fibroblast derived
tumors, fibrosarcomas.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:13.040
Cartilage derived tumors, these
tumors are rarer in humans,

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.780
but they occur.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.110
And when they occur, they can
be quite problematic, as well.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.330
And they go through similar
stages of progression,

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.550
as I've been describing
for the other tumor types.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:44.940
And we can have tumors of
blood cells, leukemias, too

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.950
many cells in the blood.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.959
And I showed you a blood
smear of a leukemic patient.

00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:53.250
The blood smear indicates
that there are too many cells

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.280
circulating.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:02.520
That contrasts to
lymphomas, which

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.120
is also a blood cell tumor.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:24.510
But here the tumor cells are
confined to lymph organs,

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:28.530
like the thymus or the
spleen or lymph nodes.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.260
So there actually aren't
too many cells circulating,

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:36.180
but there are too many of these
cells in these structures,

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.100
which likewise
can cause problems

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.030
within those local structures,
and surrounding tissues

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.940
as well.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.440
OK.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.000
So some terminology.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.660
Cancers affect all tissues,
or virtually all tissues.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.790
There are probably 200, 250
different types of cancer

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.540
when we think about
all the different cell

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.990
types in your body that
can undergo these changes

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:02.450
and result in one or
another type of cancer.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.950
All right.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.840
So cancers arise
from normal cells.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.240
They develop in stages.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.940
What causes them to
change over time?

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.810
What gives them the ability
to divide inappropriately,

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.520
to grow abnormally?

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.300
The answer to this question
is that alterations take place

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.660
in the DNA of the
developing cancer cells.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.440
And in this respect, cancer
is a genetic disease.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.270
And I'm going to use
this term in quotes

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.144
because when we talk
about a genetic disease,

00:23:43.144 --> 00:23:45.770
we tend to talk about
inherited diseases.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.560
You inherit a disease allele
from one of your parents.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.450
You develop a disease.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.740
In this case, cancer can
arise as a consequence

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.270
of an inherited mutation.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.680
We'll talk about that
in a subsequent lecture.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.610
But what I'm referring to
here is genetic alterations

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.940
that take place within
you, within your cells.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.380
And this accumulates over time,
over decades in some cases,

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.660
and allows the cells to progress
through these various stages.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.470
The case that cancer develops
through the acquisition

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:22.860
of mutations in genes has been
building for about a century.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.560
We've been suspecting that
cancer was a genetic disease

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.760
for a very long time.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.980
And now we know it's
true because we've

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.480
seen the alterations in
the genes of cancer cells.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.030
And we'll come to those
specific alterations

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:36.990
in subsequent lectures.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.323
But I want to give you the
background that led us there.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:53.570
The first and the oldest was
the observation going back

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:58.640
almost 100 years that cancer
cells have abnormal number

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.760
and structure of chromosomes.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:07.800
As you know, your cells have
46 chromosomes, 23 pairs.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.150
And most of your cells look
like the cells on the left,

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.440
where there's a pair
of chromosome 1, 2, 3,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.970
and so forth.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:20.060
These chromosomes are painted
with a specific chromosome

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.330
specific paint so we can
distinguish which one is which,

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.880
and this is a so-called
normal karyotype.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.470
Cancer cells can look like this.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.830
And you can see that they're
different in many respects

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:32.980
from normal cells.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.220
A, there's way too
many chromosomes.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.460
This is a condition
we call aneuploidy.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.620
Aneuploidy, as opposed
to being diploid,

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.210
the cells are aneuploid, an
abnormal number of chromosomes.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:56.620
Moreover, you can see in
some of the highlighted areas

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.044
that the chromosome
structure is abnormal.

00:25:59.044 --> 00:26:01.210
We have this chromosome
here, which has a little bit

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.960
of the pale blue chromosome--
which may be chromosome 4,

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.272
I can't read it--

00:26:06.272 --> 00:26:08.230
and a little bit of this
pink chromosome, which

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.810
is one of these guys here.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.630
A translocation has taken
place so that the structure

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.010
of the chromosome is abnormal.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.480
So we have aneuploidy,
defects in chromosome number,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.580
but also defects in chromosome
structure, like translocations.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.980
We also have deletions-- not
easy to see in this slide--

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:36.030
where chromosomes have incurred
big losses of genetic material.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.610
OK?

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.169
Chromosome
abnormalities in cancer

00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:39.960
have been known about
for a very long time.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.750
A second and very
important observation,

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.480
which occurred
sometime in the '40s--

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.270
maybe '30s, '40s, and '50s--

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:56.690
and built up over
time since then,

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:07.600
is that carcinogens,
carcinogens, which

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:20.440
are cancer causing agents, are
almost always mutagens, which

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.505
are mutation causing agents.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.530
So something that
can cause cancer in,

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.260
for example, a
laboratory animal,

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.370
can be shown to alter the
DNA and cause mutations.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.250
That would suggest
that the carcinogen

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.590
is acting through the
alterations in the DNA.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:51.020
And this observation was
made much more convincing

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.760
through the work
of an investigator

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.120
by the name of Bruce Ames, who
developed the so-called Ames

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.620
test.

00:28:00.764 --> 00:28:02.180
And I want to tell
you about that.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:09.110
But actually, before I do, let
me just show you graphically

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:16.670
how the agent can be tested for
its carcinogenic capabilities

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:20.070
and its mutagenic capabilities.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:25.870
The carcinogen is tested
by treating an animal--

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.290
a mouse or a rat--

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.060
injecting the animal
with the carcinogen

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.790
or painting the carcinogen
or the potential carcinogen

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.740
on the skin of the
animal, and then

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:38.400
waiting a certain amount of
time and asking the question

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.050
whether the animal
developed a tumor.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.729
And you can do this with
different doses of the agent,

00:28:42.729 --> 00:28:44.520
with large numbers of
animals, and actually

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.650
get quantitative
data that tells you

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.710
the potency of this
potential carcinogen.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:53.490
So that's the
carcinogenesis assay.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:58.910
To test whether something is a
mutagen, you can take the agent

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:03.320
and treat cells and ask
whether you can cause mutations

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.520
in those cells.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.340
You could do this in lots
of different types of cells.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.530
But the easiest types
of cells to do it in

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:14.720
are bacterial cells, for
example, salmonella bacteria

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.550
or E. coli.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:18.530
And the way this
assay is done is

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:22.190
to use cells that are
defective in the production

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.830
of an amino acid,
let's say histidine.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:29.300
So the cells have mutations
in a biosynthetic enzyme--

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.840
and I'll tell you more
about this in a second--

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.730
that is required for the
cells to make histidine.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.470
Now these cells can live if
you provide histidine to them

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:41.510
exogenously, for example,
on the Petri dish.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:46.280
But if you take those
cells and you plate them

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.880
on a Petri dish that is lacking
histidine, none of the cells

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:57.380
will be able to grow
because they require

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.060
exogenous histidine to live.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:04.090
However, if you
take that mutagen

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:08.480
and you add it to these
histidine minus cells,

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.780
the mutagen might
correct the mutation

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.700
in the histidine
biosynthesis gene,

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.410
thereby converting
it to a wild type

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.680
form at some low frequency.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.760
Such that if you plate these
now mutagen-treated cells

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.420
on a histidine minus
plate, you might

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.080
get a few colonies growing.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.170
And these would
be histidine plus,

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.510
capable of producing histidine
themselves, revertants.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.620
They've reverted the mutation
to now a wild type form.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.730
OK?

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.520
And it was this that was
the basis of the Ames test,

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:57.790
to test the mutagenicity
of potential compounds.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:04.660
Now we actually use different
versions of his minus bacteria,

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.320
because different mutagens cause
different types of mutations.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.570
And if you use just
one mutant bacteria,

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.200
you might miss certain
potential mutagens.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:21.280
So for example, if we have
a specific mutant, which

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:35.300
is in a gene required for
the conversion of histidinol,

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:40.010
in an enzyme that is called
histidinol dihydrogenase,

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:48.940
this enzyme is required
to produce histidine

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.650
in the final step
of the synthesis.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:12.950
The wild type enzyme would
have a particular sequence,

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:16.370
which would encode a
particular pair of amino acids,

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.650
glutamine and serine.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.500
And it is this collection
of histidine minus bacteria,

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.720
this collection of
histidine minus bacteria

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.960
that we use in this
assay, we might

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:40.160
have one mutant, which
has an alteration, which

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.950
converts that C to a T.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:44.480
This creates a
termination codon.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.804
So this is why that bacterium
can't make histidine,

00:32:49.804 --> 00:32:51.220
because it can't
make that enzyme.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.761
It has a stop codon
on that position.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.430
A second mutant might have
a different stop codon.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.060
This is determination codon.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:14.650
Here, this C has been
converted to a G,

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:15.820
creating the stop codon.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.810
And a third mutant might
have an abnormal number

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:27.530
of bases in this region, an
insertion of an A residue,

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:29.740
which would cause a frame shift.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.700
These are three
different mutants,

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.370
which would require three
different types of alterations

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:42.290
in the DNA to convert
back to the wild type.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:45.190
Here, this pyrimidine
would have to be converted

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:46.870
to a different pyrimidine.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:51.250
Here, this purine would have to
be converted to a pyrimidine.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.290
And here this abnormal
number of bases

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:57.970
would have to be corrected
to the correct number.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.760
This would allow
one to find agents

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.650
which function as
point mutagens, which

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.000
is a class of mutagens.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.469
They create point mutations.

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:11.679
And this type of
bacteria would allow

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:14.010
you to find what are called
frame shift mutagens.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.750
So these bacteria
are mixed together.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.310
The mutagen is added.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.230
And then you count the
number of cells that

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.690
survive on the his minus plate.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.480
That's the original Ames test.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.110
As Ames and others continue
to do this kind of testing,

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:57.110
they discovered,
to their surprise,

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:00.240
that some clearly
established carcinogens

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.710
failed the Ames test.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.840
They cause lots of
tumors in animals,

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.910
but they didn't
revert any bacteria

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.310
in that bacterial assay.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.070
So can anybody
think why that is?

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.420
Why might an agent, which
can clearly cause cancer,

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.510
fail that test?

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.530
Well, one answer-- and
the most common answer--

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:31.990
is that the agent itself
is not itself a mutation.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:40.880
But it can be
converted in the body

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.770
through the process
of metabolism.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:45.590
As your body tries to convert
that agent into something,

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.570
for example, that
it can excrete,

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.360
it alters it chemically
and converts it

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.580
from a promutagenic form
into a mutagenic form.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.780
And in this form, it can
cause mutations in your DNA,

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:03.060
and in theory, in the
bacterial cases as well.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.550
And here's an example
of a promutagen called

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:13.360
benzo(a)pyrene, a very important
mutation in cigarette smoke.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.580
This is converted,
through various steps

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:21.760
inside your liver, to a form
that is much more mutagenic.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.420
These epoxides are
much more mutagenic

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.910
compared to the
original compound,

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.450
much more reactive, much
more reactive to DNA.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:35.820
And in these forms, the compound
will actually covalently

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.260
attach to the bases of
DNA and cause mutations.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:40.890
OK?

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.430
So in this sense, your body is
actually part of the problem.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.860
It's trying to get
rid of this bad stuff,

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.220
but in the process of doing
that, it's making it worse.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:55.790
Recognizing that this
was an issue for actually

00:36:55.790 --> 00:37:01.460
quite a few potential
mutagens, Ames and others

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.496
modified the Ames test.

00:37:03.496 --> 00:37:05.120
It's now called the
Modified Ames test.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.390
In which case, you take
the compound of interest,

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:25.540
the potential mutagen, you mix
it with some extract from liver

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.810
to allow this
metabolism to occur.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:33.730
And then you take those,
the metabolized compound,

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:45.760
and you do the bacterial,
the bacterial mutagenesis

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.510
test that I just
reviewed for you.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:48.220
OK?

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.830
And now you find that many
of these things that failed

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.870
initially, score positively.

00:37:55.511 --> 00:37:56.010
OK.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:59.940
So stuff that we get exposed
to, like benzo(a)pyrene,

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.800
and other agents
in the environment,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.580
can cause mutations, and
these can also cause cancer.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:15.160
I just want to
take a few seconds

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:20.550
to rail against tobacco
smoke and cigarette smoking.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:23.850
Lung cancer is the most common
form of cancer in this country.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:29.190
175,000 deaths due to
lung cancer each year.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:33.720
About 150,000 of those
deaths are due to smoking.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.120
It's the most common
form of cancer,

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.090
and among the most
preventable forms of cancer,

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:43.830
through to the failure to
expose the body to carcinogens

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.150
in cigarette smoke.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:48.490
Not only is there benzo(a)pyrene
in cigarette smoke,

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:54.960
but there's about 1,000 other
carcinogens in cigarette smoke.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.020
Cigarette smoking is still
very common in this country,

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.610
remarkably common
in this country.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:04.290
About 46 million adults
still smoke in this country.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:06.360
A remarkable number of
high school students

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.220
still smoke in this country.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:11.820
And it's because of this that
lung cancer rates are still

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.830
very, very high.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.110
Moreover, smoking
causes all sorts

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:21.390
of other diseases--
emphysema, kidney diseases,

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.370
cardiovascular diseases.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:27.102
It's now estimated that among
the however many billions

00:39:27.102 --> 00:39:28.560
of people are on
the planet today--

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.860
what's that number, 6 billion
people on the planet today?

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.650
Something like 650
million of them

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:38.250
will die due to the
exposure to cigarette smoke.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:44.130
So my little lesson here is that
if you're currently smoking,

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:45.690
stop.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:48.540
If you're not
smoking, don't start.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.940
It's the easiest way
to protect yourself

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.701
against many, many
dangerous future problems.

00:39:54.701 --> 00:39:55.200
All right.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.650
So cigarette smoke is
something we do to ourselves.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:02.880
We expose ourselves to
mutagens that cause cancer

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.880
cells to develop in your
lungs and in other parts

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.330
of your body.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:18.140
There are other so-called
exogenous mutagens,

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.970
things that we get exposed to.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:28.440
Sunlight, for example, sunlight,
the UV rays in sunlight,

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.220
can cause damage to your
DNA, causing skin cancer

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.090
and melanoma.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:48.370
Dietary carcinogens,
barbecued beef,

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.690
has certain dietary carcinogens
in the category, actually,

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:56.380
of benzo(a)pyrene, that can
cause damage to your DNA

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.480
and induce colon cancer.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.990
Not at high numbers, not saying
you shouldn't eat barbecue.

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.970
But still, this is
an example of stuff

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:06.480
we get exposed to that
increases our cancer risk.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.710
Replication errors.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.810
Your cells are good
at copying the DNA.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:23.280
They're very good at it.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.100
They have proofreading functions
that make them better at it.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.630
But they're not perfect.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.660
So every time your cells
divide, you actually

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.240
run the risk of
making a mistake.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.370
And replication errors
are a common source

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:37.560
of mutations in cancer.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.520
As your cells are
moving DNA around,

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.890
they also sometimes break it.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:52.800
And these DNA breaks are
sometimes sealed properly,

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.850
but sometimes not.

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:55.170
And deletions can occur.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.520
And translocations can occur.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.800
And another endogenous process
that leads to mutations,

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.270
including in cancer cells.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.210
Defects in DNA repair.

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:17.730
You have lots of enzymes
that are looking at your DNA

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.370
at all times for adducts
that have formed,

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:21.930
and other alterations.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:26.010
And those enzymes remove those
damaged bases and fix them.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.020
But sometimes they fail.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.500
Sometimes they actually get
mutated in cancer cells,

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.220
raising the risk still further.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:37.590
So defects in DNA damage and
DNA damage repair enzymes.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.890
Your cells also produce
endogenous mutagens.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:07.140
Various reactive oxygen species
are produced, for example,

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.060
in the process of metabolism.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.730
And these reactive
oxygen species,

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:14.000
like superoxide,
hydrogen peroxide,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.690
can interact with the
DNA and cause mutations.

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:21.530
This is why antioxidants are
useful in preventing cancer

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.220
in some settings.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:23.750
OK?

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.780
So various things
that we get exposed to

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.710
or we expose ourselves to
cause mutations in DNA.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:34.245
And this results, ultimately,
in the development of cancers.

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:38.560
The last thing
I'll mention to you

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.040
is that this doesn't
happen overnight.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:46.000
It's not that a single
alteration in a single gene

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.210
is sufficient to derive
tumor development.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:58.440
Instead, it's a process
that occurs over time

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.510
and requires alterations
to many genes.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.290
So if you imagine a
cell, a normal cell,

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.710
which divides to produce two
daughters with the same DNA

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:13.170
content, at some frequency, this
cell might acquire a mutation.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.630
Maybe it got exposed
to cigarette smoke.

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.550
Maybe it got exposed
to superoxide.

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:19.270
Maybe it made a mistake.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.410
And this mutation then
confers upon that cell

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:27.030
the ability to divide
especially well.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:31.290
And now all of its daughter
cells carry that same mutation.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:36.480
And as that cell divides
further and produces

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:43.050
daughter cells of its own,
perhaps one of those cells--

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:45.900
and this might not be in
the very next cell division,

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.940
it might be five years later--

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:52.070
one of those cells
acquires a second mutation.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:55.460
And that mutation
gives that cell

00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:00.410
the ability to divide
even more rapidly,

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:02.810
or survive even better.

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:05.210
And again, all of
its descendant cells

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:09.330
will have that same
abnormal genotype.

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.790
And maybe within
that clone of cells,

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:14.130
a third mutation takes place.

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.900
And on and on we go.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.270
We now think that we
need somewhere between 5

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:22.320
and 10 mutations
in cellular genes

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.180
to allow the cells
to progress all

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.340
the way to that
full blown cancer

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.740
that I showed you
in pictures before.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:38.760
So this process continues
until we have true malignancy.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:44.130
And this process of developing
clones with increasing ability

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:58.890
to develop into cancer, we call
the clonal evolution theory,

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:03.850
the clonal evolution of
increasingly abnormal clones,

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:07.580
which eventually will
develop into a cancer.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.230
And next time we'll
talk about what

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:14.530
are the genes that are mutated
in these developing cancers.
