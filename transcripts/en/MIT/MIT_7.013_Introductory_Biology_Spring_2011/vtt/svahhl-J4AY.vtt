00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.411
TYLER JACKS: OK, good
morning everybody.

00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:29.910
Morning.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.970
Good morning, good morning.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.650
All right, we're going to
continue our discussion

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.100
about cancer today
as well as on Friday.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.150
In between you have
an exam on Wednesday.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.590
Partly in preparation
for that I'm

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:54.460
having office hours tomorrow
between 3:00 and 4:00 in 76453.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.630
And as the note says,
come with questions

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.180
that you have about
immunology, which I taught you,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.050
and the introductory cancer
class that I taught you.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.886
If you have questions
about other subjects

00:01:04.886 --> 00:01:06.260
that will be
covered in this exam

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.968
that Professor [? Sid
?] covered for you,

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:10.880
it's best to go to her
office hours, or to your TAs,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.730
or the other sections
that will be held.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.760
All right so towards
the end of last lecture

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.100
we talked about
smoking and cancer,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.270
and I warned you against
the evils of smoking.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.660
And I hope you were
paying attention.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.980
This slide shows you some
pretty startling statistics

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.090
that relate the increase
in smoking, shown here,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.080
among men in this country,
which began around 1900.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.240
And you can see it
rapidly increased over

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.800
the first part of
the last century.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.880
And you can also see that about
20 years later lung cancer

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.090
rates rose equally quickly.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.800
And this was some
of the evidence

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.170
that smoking caused lung cancer.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.600
And we now know, as I
mentioned to you last time,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.980
that there are lots of
carcinogens in cigarette smoke

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.060
that cause lung cancer.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.980
Lots of mutagens.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.030
Either mutagens in their
native form or promutagens

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.680
that can be converted
into mutagens, that we

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.700
expose ourselves to through
the process of tobacco smoking.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.410
That was men.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.470
But lung cancer has
also increased in women.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.480
You can see this also
precipitous increase

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.940
in lung cancer among
women in this country.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.910
And lung cancer has now
passed breast cancer

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.820
as the leading cause of
cancer deaths among women

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.620
in the United States.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.500
You can see that
in the case of men,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.870
smoking levels actually started
to drop quite some time ago.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.570
And coincident with
that, lung cancer

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.990
deaths among men in this
country also have been dropping.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.010
It's a direct result of
smoking cessation and people

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.690
not starting to smoke.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.300
That had not happened
in the case of women

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.500
until very recently.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.020
In fact, just last
month a study was

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.710
published that showed that also
for women lung cancer rates are

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.009
now starting to go down.

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.800
And that's a direct
consequence of the fact

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.390
that fewer women are smoking.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.630
It takes a few years to
see that effect play out

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.580
because people who were
smoking 20 years ago

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.550
are getting cancer
based on that now.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.720
So examples of why
smoking is bad for you.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:39.110
Cigarette smoke
can be considered

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.210
a environmental carcinogen,
although it's one

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.294
that we expose ourselves to.

00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:45.710
I talked to you
about a variety of

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.720
other environmental carcinogens
that we get exposed to.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.640
I also described this
phenomenon by which

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.460
chemicals that are not in
their native state, mutagenic,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.520
can become mutagenic through
metabolism in our bodies.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.520
Promutagens can be converted
to mutagens in our body.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.490
And I showed you the example
of benzo [a] pyrene which

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.910
is in cigarette smoke and gets
converted into a mutagenic form

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.800
in our bodies.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.960
And there are many other such.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:37.090
There are also examples, and
I didn't say this explicitly,

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.320
of nonmutagenic carcinogens.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.740
This goes against the rule
that carcinogens are mutagens.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.470
These are actually
nonmutagenic but they're

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.860
cancer causing so we
call them carcinogens.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:05:00.580
Examples of this would
be alcohol and asbestos.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.660
These affect cancer
rates, we think,

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.460
because they cause
tissue damage.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.090
Alcohol in the
liver, for example,

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.520
causes tissue
damage in the liver.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.190
Asbestos, if you breathe it
in, can cause tissue damage

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.810
in the linings of the lungs.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:30.650
This tissue damage then results
in increased proliferation.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.630
Cells are recruited
to grow in order

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.360
to repair the damage
that was caused,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:43.690
and this can then indirectly
result in mutations.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.270
Because as I mentioned to
you, every time your cell

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.820
divides there's a chance
that a problem will happen,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.950
a chance that a replication
error will occur.

00:05:57.596 --> 00:05:59.220
There's a chance that
an important gene

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.350
relevant to cancer
will incur a mutation.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.320
So more replication, more
proliferation, the greater the

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.060
chance that a problematic
mutation will take place.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.430
I didn't say this
explicitly, but likewise

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.800
problems in
chromosome segregation

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.840
can occur every
time a cell divides.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.350
We have intricate systems
to ensure that chromosomes

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.750
separate properly so
that each daughter

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.480
cell gets the right
complement of chromosomes.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.310
But sometimes that breaks down.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.140
And sometimes cells get the
wrong number of chromosomes.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:48.980
We talked about this in
the context of meiosis,

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.890
but non-disjunction events
can occur in mitosis as well,

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.520
leading to chromosome
imbalances, which

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.170
are also hallmarks of cancer.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.150
As I showed you
last time, if you

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.760
look at the chromosome
content of a cancer cell

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.730
it is often very, very abnormal.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.040
And these abnormal
chromosome numbers

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.490
occur due to defects in
chromosome segregation,

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.680
including
non-disjunction events.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.780
OK, so various things that
we expose ourselves to

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.610
or that just go along with the
normal process of cell division

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.310
can lead to mutations.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.010
And as I emphasized
in the last lecture,

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.120
cancer is the consequence
of the accumulation

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.150
of mutations in critical genes.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:44.540
So to summarize what I
told you about last time,

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.970
we now think of the process
of cancer development

00:07:46.970 --> 00:08:04.760
as going from a normal
cell through multiple steps

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.680
to the development
of malignant cells.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.400
This process, for
most types of cancer,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.490
will take years to accomplish.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.770
Cells acquire these alterations
over multiple years.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:42.070
And these arrows represent
mutations to cellular genes.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.460
Mutations in processes that
are important in determining

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.010
the normal behavior
of these cells

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.520
and allowing these cells
to behave abnormally.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.660
This process unfolds over
time, as I mentioned.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.370
And gives rise to
this phenomenon,

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.130
or this hypothesis
really for which we have

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.250
great evidence now, the
so-called clonal evolution

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.010
of cancer, which I drew on
the board for you last time.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.410
This is a nice version
of that same concept

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.020
from a figure from a book
from Bob Weinberg who teaches

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.990
this same class in the fall.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.900
Here you have a row
of normal cells.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.240
Within these cells
a mutation arises.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.530
This mutation gives that
cell the ability to expand,

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.350
perhaps better than
its neighbor cells.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.470
So a number of daughter
cells carrying this mutation

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.650
are born.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.570
Within this now clone
of singly mutant cells,

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.720
a second mutation can arise,
say in this cell here.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.050
This mutation, likewise,
confers upon these cells

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.040
a greater ability to
grow, divide, survive, out

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.040
compete their neighbors.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.170
So you get a lot
of these cells too.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.240
And then within that
expanded clone of cells,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.970
a third mutation
arises, and so on.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:59.390
Until one has enough patients
to have a fully malignant cell.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.320
So what are the genes
that are relevant here?

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.000
Well, let's think
about the processes

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.880
that we know are important
in cancer development,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.770
and those are listed
in the bottom right.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.730
Proliferation is the
most obvious one.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.880
Cells proliferate
abnormally in cancer.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.280
So mutations in genes that
regulate proliferation

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.610
are likely to be important here.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.460
Cancer is a disease of cell
number, too many cells.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.330
You can get that because you
have too much proliferation,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.170
but you can also get it if you
have too little cell death.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.890
So mutations in genes that
regulate cell death processes

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.930
are also found in cancer.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.060
I told you last time
about angiogenesis,

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.800
the process by which
blood vessels are

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.940
recruited into the tumor.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.270
These two are recruited
by virtue of signals

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.250
that the tumor
sends, some of which

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.500
other product of mutations.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.140
I told you that
cancer cells move

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.300
in the process of metastasis.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.475
They break their interactions
with their neighbors

00:10:56.475 --> 00:10:58.350
and they begin to move
throughout the tissue,

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.808
and ultimately
throughout the body.

00:10:59.808 --> 00:11:01.650
So they have increased
cell motility.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.064
And they also can invade.

00:11:03.064 --> 00:11:04.980
They can invade through
the basement membrane.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.960
They can invade into
the local tissue.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.460
So they have increased
invasiveness.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.600
And there are other changes that
take place within cancer cells.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:21.400
And so these mutations
then collectively

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:32.820
increase proliferation,
decrease cell death,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:46.200
increase angiogenesis,
increase motility,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.610
and increase invasiveness.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.480
It's important to know
about these because today we

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.160
are able to target some
of these mutations.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.700
We are able to target
the gene products formed

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.090
by these mutant genes
and thereby create

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.470
better therapies.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.800
So our goal is to understand
these processes such

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.860
that we can ultimately
control them more effectively

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.460
in the context of treatment.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.380
OK well, that then leads
us to what are the genes?

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.620
What amongst the 22,000
genes in your genome

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.670
get mutated in the
development of cancer?

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.480
How can we find them?

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.290
Nowadays, we
sequence the genomes

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.407
of cancer cells, that's
how we find them.

00:12:47.407 --> 00:12:48.740
But that's not always been true.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.907
It's actually been true for
only the last few years.

00:12:50.907 --> 00:12:52.614
And so I'll give you
some examples of how

00:12:52.614 --> 00:12:53.940
they were found previously.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.120
And why do we care?

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.494
Well, I've already
indicated some

00:13:04.494 --> 00:13:06.950
of this a few minutes ago,
but the reason we care

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.190
to understand the disease
at the molecular level.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.750
Ultimately we'll
be able to provide,

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.270
in very accurate detail,
improved diagnostic

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.927
information, improved
prognostic information.

00:13:28.927 --> 00:13:30.760
We'll be able to tell
that an individual has

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.200
cancer by detecting abnormal
genes in their blood.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.830
Circulating DNA in their blood
carrying specific mutations

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.770
associated with
particular cancers.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.520
We'll be able to
diagnose the disease

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.350
at an earlier stage that way.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.540
We'll be able to figure
out exactly what mutations

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.180
are present in the cancer
cell to know whether that's

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.700
a tumor that's going to
go on to kill the patient,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.470
or sit there and do nothing.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.660
Should we treat the
patient aggressively?

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.730
Or should we leave them alone?

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.790
Only with this molecular
information will be

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.110
will be able to figure
that out in detail.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.460
We will, and we already,
use this information

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.030
to make better cancer
drugs, molecularly targeted

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.300
therapies that will replace
conventional chemotherapy,

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.480
which I'll teach
you about on Friday.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.632
Chemotherapy can work, but
it's highly, highly toxic

00:14:33.632 --> 00:14:35.340
and we'd like to be
able to get rid of it

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.310
and replace it with drugs that
are much more specific, much

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.000
more selective, and much less
harmful except for the cancer

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.440
cells.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:54.570
And this will usher
in a new era, which

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.270
I would argue is already here
in some small way, called

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.210
personalized medicine.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.040
The individual's disease
will be diagnosed

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.680
at the molecular level
and a specific therapy

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.290
will be designed for them
based on those alterations.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.240
We'll dial up the right therapy
based on that information.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.250
And again, hopefully,
hopefully, yield better results

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.380
and less toxic side effects.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.120
Cancer is leading
the way, actually,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.740
in personalized medicine.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.750
But it will be true
for lots of diseases

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.250
in the not too distant future.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.530
OK, so what are the genes?

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.140
Well, I'm going to introduce you
to two broad classes of genes

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.670
today.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.950
The first of which
are called oncogenes.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.760
Onco for mass, genes.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.220
Oncogenes, cancer
genes, cancer causing

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.600
genes of one sort or another.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:58.190
The first of these oncogenes
was identified in the context

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.360
of oncogenic viruses.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.770
For example, rous sarcoma
virus, which is a retrovirus.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.230
We'll learn more
about those next week.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.170
Retroviruses are viruses
with an RNA genome.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.470
HIV falls into the same class.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.260
Rous sarcoma virus,
or RSV, has been

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.670
studied since about 1910 or so.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.010
It was discovered
by a virologist

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.260
at Rockefeller University
by the name of Peyton Rous.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:50.370
Peyton Rous was a virologist
and a Long Island chicken farmer

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:55.500
came to Peyton Rous with a
prize hen from his collection.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.780
A prize hen that had
a tumor mass growing

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.970
on its breast muscle.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.683
And the farmer brought
this hen to Peyton Rous

00:17:02.683 --> 00:17:04.349
and asked him to cure
the hen because it

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:05.790
was very valuable to him

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.410
Peyton Rous took the hen.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.550
The farmer said, thank you.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.490
The farmer went away.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:14.910
Peyton Rous then promptly killed
the hen and isolated the tumor.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.270
And was able to isolate
from the tumor a virus.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.290
A virus that could infect
another bird and cause

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.089
cancer in that bird.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.329
So this was the first
example of a virus associated

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:28.950
with tumor development.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.750
There have since
been many examples

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:35.400
of viruses associated with tumor
development in animal species.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.730
A few examples in people,
but relatively few.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.870
Most cancers in humans are not
virus associated but some are,

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.540
like human papilloma virus
associated cervical cancer

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.050
as an example.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.980
But these viruses studied
in laboratory animals

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.620
were extremely important
in teaching us about how

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.885
cancers arise normally.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:05.720
It was known using
rous sarcoma virus

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.920
that if you took a
normal chicken cell,

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.570
fibroblasts from a chicken and
infected it with rous sarcoma

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:18.480
virus, it would cause those
cells to round up and begin

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.530
to proliferate abnormally.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.940
And these cells were given a
term called being transformed.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.675
Transformed cells that had the
appearance of cancer cells.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.050
After that work, a
great deal of effort

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.050
went into figuring out what
were the genes of rous sarcoma

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.920
virus that allowed the virus
to cause those cells to become

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.085
transformed.

00:18:58.127 --> 00:18:59.960
And it was determined
that the virus carries

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.880
a single gene called
SRC, S-R-C, for sarcoma,

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.790
which is responsible for
this transformation process.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.710
You could basically
just add the SRC gene

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.300
and the same
process would occur.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.840
Trying to understand
the origins of the SRC,

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.840
two investigators at UCSF,
Mike Bishop and Harold Varmus

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:32.890
in around 1975, determined that
the SRC gene had a homologue,

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.380
a related copy,
in chicken cells.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.960
And they went on to
hypothesize correctly

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.280
that rous sarcoma virus stole
this gene from the chicken

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.880
cells that it was infecting and
incorporated into its genome.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.340
So the SRC gene, this cancer
gene, had a cellular origin.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.540
Moreover, they were able to show
that SRC exists in human cells.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.890
And this was quite shocking.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:18.060
This cancer associated gene
was present in our DNA.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.940
This discovery led
Bishop and Varmus

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.950
to win the Nobel Prize in 1989.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.890
And a funny story
happened that day.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.800
This is a true story.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.930
I actually worked for
Varmus as a PhD student,

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.040
so I heard it from
the horse's mouth.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.110
Varmus's sister-in-law was
standing in a cafeteria line

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.070
at Berkeley waiting
to get her lunch

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.490
and two guys were
standing in front of her.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.200
And one guy said
to the other what

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.000
are you going to have today?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.500
And the guy said, I
don't really know.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.640
And the first guy said,
well don't get the chicken

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.860
because two guys just won
the Nobel Prize for showing

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.791
that chicken causes cancer.

00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:53.122
This is sometimes how the
public perceives what we do.

00:20:53.122 --> 00:20:54.830
But anyway, they went
on to win the Nobel

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.670
Prize for this important work.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.230
And they proposed
that there were

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.780
genes in our DNA,
which they referred

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.740
to as proto-oncogenes,
which could undergo

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:22.500
mutation and become oncogenes.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.300
In the case of RSV,
the mutation was

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.730
to take the gene
out of the genome

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.810
and stick it in the
genome of a virus.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.990
But as we'll see today, there
are other ways to do that too.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.390
Now, what the heck are we
doing with proto-oncogenes

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.860
in our genomes?

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.450
What are these
genes doing there?

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.010
Why do we have the SRC gene?

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.770
Why do we have other such genes?

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.670
Who can tell me?

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.900
Why is it beneficial to have a
cancer causing gene in our DNA?

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.961
What might these genes be doing?

00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:01.460
AUDIENCE: They might be just
for normal metabolic processes.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.376
TYLER JACKS: Yeah, normal
metabolic processes.

00:22:03.376 --> 00:22:05.220
Or perhaps normal proliferation.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.290
Our cells divide too.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.870
You go from a single cell when
you're at fertilization to 10

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:10.910
to the 13 cells.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.140
It's a lot of cell division.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.350
That's a controlled process.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.540
There's lots of genes
that are devoted

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.070
to teaching your
cells what to do

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.480
when they're supposed to do it.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.480
And these genes are presumably
involved in those normal cell

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.840
division processes
but they get corrupted

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.220
in the context of cancer.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.380
They get altered so they
don't work properly.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.010
OK.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.230
So RSV was the first example,
SRC was the first example.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.950
But it still led to some
skepticism, some concern that

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.740
in fact what was seen in
the context of these viruses

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.297
might not be relevant
to real human cancer.

00:22:42.297 --> 00:22:43.880
Which as I told you
a few minutes ago,

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.360
rarely involves viral infection.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:23:00.380
And so along came Bob Weinberg
who was, and is still, at MIT.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.320
His lab is in the
Whitehead Institute.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.348
And Weinberg did a
critical experiment.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.780
He started with an individual.

00:23:13.021 --> 00:23:14.641
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:17.070
Sorry about that.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.171
This is a person.

00:23:20.171 --> 00:23:20.670
Sort of.

00:23:29.346 --> 00:23:30.970
And this individual
had bladder cancer.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:57.770
Weinberg isolated the DNA
from the bladder cancer

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.265
to ask the question, were
there cancer genes in there?

00:24:00.265 --> 00:24:02.570
Were there oncogenes in there?

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:06.170
Were there mutationally
altered genes

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.514
which the reason that
this tumor arose?

00:24:10.514 --> 00:24:11.680
And so he did an experiment.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.320
He took this isolated DNA and
he introduced it into some cells

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.720
in the laboratory.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.960
These were immortalized
mouse cells.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.580
Immortalize meaning that they
would grow in the lab forever.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.960
Which by the way, is not normal.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.626
Normally you take
cells out of your body

00:24:36.626 --> 00:24:38.300
or out of a mouse,
put them in the lab,

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.250
they'll grow for a
while but they'll

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:40.690
stop growing eventually.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.490
These cells were immortal.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.247
They could continue to grow.

00:24:44.247 --> 00:24:46.080
But they were otherwise
pretty well-behaved.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.920
They laid flat on the dish.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.130
They had normal
boundaries between cells.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.302
They were non-transformed.

00:24:53.302 --> 00:24:54.760
They didn't look
like cancer cells.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.360
And they were non-tumorigenic.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.630
If he introduced these cells
into an experimental animal

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.344
they wouldn't cause a tumor, OK.

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.260
They were immortalized
but they were otherwise

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.340
pretty well-behaved.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.280
He introduced the isolated
DNA from the tumor cell

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:27.380
through a process
call transfection,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.260
where basically the DNA gets
sheared up and introduced

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:39.460
into the cells such
that, roughly speaking

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:44.920
each cell is getting
individual genes spread out

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.810
amongst this population
of mouse cells.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.450
And then he waited.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.210
And what he found was
that at low frequency,

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:59.590
whereas most of the cells state
in their normal morphology,

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:00.940
occasionally he got this.

00:26:09.922 --> 00:26:13.430
[PHONE RINGING]

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.940
Can somebody get that?

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.440
A transformed colony of cells.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.590
And he assumed, correctly,
that this colony

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.650
arose because one
of these genes was

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:30.460
a cancer gene that allowed these
cells to divide abnormally.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.010
He further could show that
if he took those cells

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.790
and introduced
them into an animal

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.890
they would now cause a tumor.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.330
So they were not
just transformed,

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:40.710
they were also tumorigenic.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.960
He went on to isolate
the human gene.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.460
Which was not difficult to do
because the cells themselves

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.625
were mouse, so he's looking
for the human DNA sequence.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.790
And he found, eventually,
that it was a mutant version

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.942
of a gene called RAS.

00:27:07.942 --> 00:27:10.400
A gene that you've actually
learned about already in class.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.850
And I'll tell you more
about in a second.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.890
This discovery made
by Weinberg's lab

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:19.340
and a few other labs at the
same time in the early 1980's is

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.070
the reason I'm
standing before you.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:26.270
When I was your age
Weinberg came to my college

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.830
and gave a lecture on this work.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.890
And I was so excited
about the potential

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.650
of learning about cancer
at the molecular level

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.480
that I decided
right then and there

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.930
to start working on cancer,
and have been doing ever since.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:41.210
So sometimes the things
you learn in class

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.770
actually change your life.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.570
Not to say that's
going to happen today,

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:45.590
but sometimes it does.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:55.590
OK, so Weinberg isolates
the RAS oncogene

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:59.010
from these bladder cancer Cells.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.020
They went on to
sequence the gene

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.900
to determine how it was
different from the normal copy

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:04.590
of RAS.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.480
And that's illustrated here.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.540
Here's the normal RAS sequence.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.870
This is now not working.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.130
Here's the normal RAS sequence.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.170
It's a version of
RAS called H-RAS.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.810
That's insignificant.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:26.320
You can see the codons,
the encoded amino acids.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.000
Here's the change that has taken
place within the cancer cells.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.770
They didn't have a
G in this position,

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.640
instead they had a
T in this position.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.400
This gene wouldn't encode
glycine like it's supposed to

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.670
but instead valene at
codon position number 12.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.300
This change, this single
nucleotide change,

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.850
this single amino
acid substitution

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:52.530
caused this signaling protein
to go from a regulatable state

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.299
as shown here.

00:28:53.299 --> 00:28:54.840
And hopefully this
is familiar to you

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.750
because you learned about it
already in the signaling part

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.650
of cell biology.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:02.680
RAS is a GTP binding
protein, which normally

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:08.230
cycles between an active GTP
bound state and an inactive GDP

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.490
bound state.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:14.500
It goes from on to off through
this hydrolysis of GTP.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.530
In the context of this
mutation the GDP hydrolysis

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.040
is inhibited.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.960
So the protein stays in
its GTP bound active state.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.430
It gets stuck on.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.670
And rather than signaling
in a regulated fashion,

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.890
signals constitutively.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.350
Rather than telling the cells
to divide when they should,

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.410
it tells the cells
to divide always.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.270
And that's presumably
why this mutation

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:44.510
is selected for in this type of
cancer and many, many others.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:51.720
OK, I remind you that RAS is
a signal transduction pathway.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.730
Here's RAS itself.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.750
RAS interacts with upstream
receptor molecules and growth

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:58.840
factors.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.820
There are intermediary
adapter proteins

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.510
that help that interaction.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:08.850
There are downstream signaling
proteins, like kinases.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.940
And ultimately there are
nuclear transcription factors

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.680
and target genes
that they regulate.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.200
This is a signaling cascade.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.880
And actually what
we learn in cancer

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.780
is that many of these
genes, not just RAS,

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.170
but many of these genes can
be mutated in the development

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.880
of one or more cancers.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.990
For example, some genes
like these are amplified.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.000
And I'll tell you more
about that in a second.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.280
Others are the product
of translocation

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.380
so that they're
expressed abnormally.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.500
Others have structural
mutations like deletions.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.570
And others have very
subtle mutations.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.550
The RAS mutation is
a subtle mutation.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:48.450
It's a single nucleotide
change that allows this gene

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:51.460
to function abnormally.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:31:08.010
OK, so importantly oncogenes
dominantly transform cells.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.350
Weinberg added a
single mutant oncogene

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.600
and it transformed
those mouse cells.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:34.240
The mutations are a gain
of function mutations.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.860
They're dominant mutations.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.270
Gain of function mutations.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.310
There are now about 300
or so, and the number

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.040
is growing, known oncogenes.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.120
Within the 22,000 genes in
your genomes, about 300 of them

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:55.140
can be converted to an
oncogenic form through mutation.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.410
What types of
mutations do we find?

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.060
Well I've listed
them on that slide

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.460
but I'll just write
it down as well.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:11.610
Subtle mutations, RAS
is the classic example.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.370
A single amino acid change
will convert the protein

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.500
to an oncogenic form.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.160
We can also find
gene amplifications.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.410
Your genes are present at
two per cell, one from mom,

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:30.990
one from dad.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:32.590
You're supposed to have two.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.350
Sometimes in cancer
amplification

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.540
of regions of the DNA occur.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.800
So you go from having not
two, but four, eight, 50, 100

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.210
copies of the gene.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.610
And you can imagine having
too many copies, leading

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.430
to too much protein
product, would actually lead

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.110
to inappropriate signaling.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:53.200
So here the structural
gene may not be mutated,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.029
the amino acid sequence
may be the same.

00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:56.320
You've just got too much of it.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.890
Also, genes can be rearranged.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.090
Gene rearrangements.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.000
For example, translocations.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.550
And I showed you some
pictures of translocations.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:29.310
Chromosomes that get joined
inappropriately together.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:32.400
This can break two genes
and form a new gene

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.080
in the context of
the translocation.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.900
Perhaps a gene is expressed
from a weakly acting promoter,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:38.950
normally.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.890
But because of a
translocation event

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.750
a very strongly
acting promoter gets

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.980
stuck in front of
that gene by mistake.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.160
And now the gene is expressed
at very high levels,

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:47.920
inappropriately.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.070
It's not unlike the consequences
of gene amplification.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.620
So translocations,
likewise, occur frequently.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.890
And we'll hear about
consequences of amplification

00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:02.310
and re-arrangement next time
when we talk about therapies.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:06.810
OK, so oncogenes act dominantly.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:12.260
They can transform
cells all by themselves.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:18.610
But this should be in your
minds creating confusion.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:25.254
Because I've also told you that
cancer is a multi-step process.

00:34:25.254 --> 00:34:26.920
And if cancer were a
multi-step process,

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.250
how could it be that single
mutations can transform cells?

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.550
But in fact, we now know
that single mutations

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:45.154
are typically and maybe
never sufficient to produce

00:34:45.154 --> 00:34:45.654
true cancer.

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.770
So given that, can
somebody explain how

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.170
the Weinberg experiment worked?

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.250
How was it that Weinberg was
able to transfer a single gene

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:02.720
into these cells and cause
them to become transformed

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.701
and tumorigenic if single
mutations aren't enough?

00:35:06.701 --> 00:35:07.450
Why did this work?

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.740
Anybody?

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:17.170
The key is that they
weren't normal cells.

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.930
The cells he started with
are already abnormal.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.410
They were already immortalized.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.284
They'd already been
growing in the laboratory

00:35:23.284 --> 00:35:24.950
dish for a long time.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.980
So they were sensitive
to a single mutation

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.040
but normal cells in
your body are not.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.390
And that's a good thing.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.850
Because as you sit
there today you probably

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:38.600
have about a million RAS
mutant cells in your body,

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.710
scattered around.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.770
And that's just based on the
normal mutation frequency.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.480
The likelihood is
that we all have

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.410
about a million or more RAS
mutant cells in our body.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.390
But because RAS
mutations are not

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:54.080
sufficient to drive
cancer formation, that

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.890
may be in a tumor initiated cell
but it's not yet a full cancer,

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:00.740
other mutations have to
take place thereafter.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.300
We now believe that
there's probably

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:17.930
something like three
to 20 mutations

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.270
are required to make
a full blown cancer.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.450
OK, so I've told
you about oncogenes

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:31.170
and I've related their function
to normal cell division,

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:32.430
and that's appropriate to do.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:36.150
Normal cells do get
signals to divide,

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.890
make more of themselves.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:41.160
And moreover, they get
signals to stop dividing

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.470
when it's time to stop.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.150
In embryogenesis once
you form the liver

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.970
you want to stop cell division
within the liver cells.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.540
When you wound yourself you
recruit cells to divide,

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:55.170
but once the wound is healed
you want it to stop dividing.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.620
And so there's complimentary
signals, stop signals,

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.010
that come into play to
cause the cells to stop.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.530
Cancer cells have
defects in both

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.110
of these classes of signals.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.750
We've been talking now
about the oncogene signals.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:10.980
They are the go Signals.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.110
The signals to tell
the cell to divide.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.190
And because of these
alterations like in RAS

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:20.590
the cells are more
capable of dividing.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.930
They make more of themselves.

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:28.030
Moreover, the brakes on this
process, the stop signals,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:32.470
are also typically lost in
the development of cancer.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:35.830
Such that now the cells
lacking the breaking signals

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.590
will continue to
divide still more.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.890
And these two
classes of genes are

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:45.100
called oncogenes, that we've
been discussing already,

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.250
and tumor suppressor genes
that we'll discuss from now

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.930
to the end of the lecture.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.520
Tumor suppressor genes.

00:38:05.687 --> 00:38:07.520
There are a number of
tumor suppressor genes

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:16.980
now as well, more
than 200 known.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:21.240
So that's 500 or so known
cancer genes already.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.070
The first one,
the very first one

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:29.330
described occurred in
this type of tumor.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.980
This is a child with
a tumor of the eye.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.840
The tumor is called
retinoblastoma.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.660
And based on the examination
of the genes within those tumor

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.680
cells, it was hypothesized that
the retinoblastoma gene that

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.840
was responsible for
this disease was

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.150
one of these tumor suppressor
genes before any of them

00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.081
were actually known.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:05.510
That led ultimately to the
cloning of the RB gene,

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.505
the retinoblastoma
susceptibility gene called RB.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.500
Also in Bob Weinberg's lab.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.540
Which encodes a
protein called pRB.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:25.370
And further work in
Weinberg's lab and many others

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:29.150
showed why cells get
rid of the RB gene

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.970
in the development of
that cancer as well

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:35.320
as other cancers.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.990
The RB gene is now-- or the
protein that it encodes--

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:42.040
is now known to be an important
regulator of the cell cycle.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.470
We learned about the cell cycle.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:50.590
Cells go from my mitosis G1,
into S phase, and then G2,

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.200
and then into mitosis again.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.120
This is a regulated process.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.500
And the RB gene or protein is
important in controlling it.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:08.720
The RB protein acts here by
blocking the transition from G1

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.490
into S, and I'll
tell you a bit more

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:13.320
how it does so in a moment.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.610
This is when the protein
is in its active state.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.220
It can be inactivated
through phosphorylation.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.900
A phosphate group, actually
many phosphate groups,

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.360
can be transferred
onto the RB gene

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.061
through kinases, which are
stimulated by growth promoting

00:40:40.061 --> 00:40:40.560
signals.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:54.440
Growth factor binding to
a cell will ultimately

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.190
result in the stimulation
of these kinases

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:59.990
to phosphorylate the
RB protein, taking it

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:06.380
from this active state to its
phosphorylated state, which

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.250
is inactive.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.430
So the break is released
because the kinases inactivate

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.650
the break, OK.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.690
Just a little bit
more detail about RB.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.260
A lot is known about
this process now.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:33.120
This transition from
G1 into S requires

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.865
some transcription factors
called E2F transcription

00:41:36.865 --> 00:41:37.365
factors.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:50.887
And RB binds and inactivates
the RB transcription factors,

00:41:50.887 --> 00:41:51.720
keeping them silent.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:01.610
When it's an active state
RB has a little pocket

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:05.060
to which the E2F
transcription factors bind.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:10.010
Here's pRB, and here are the
E2F transcription factors

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.350
and they are sequestered
by the RB protein

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.810
and can't otherwise
do their job.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:20.510
But when RB gets
phosphorylated by those kinases

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:25.670
these phosphate groups interfere
with the binding of E2F,

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:29.780
and E2F is then liberated to
carry out its normal function

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.110
driving this transition.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:33.110
OK.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.120
So this is how the
break functions and it's

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.380
a very, very important break.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:41.030
RB is mutated in a very high
percentage of cancer cells,

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:43.670
not just retinoblastomas
but many others as well.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:46.460
And the pathway that
it is controlled by

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.830
is likewise mutated
in a high frequency.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:56.130
Tumor suppressor genes,
like RB, are the breaks.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:59.290
They negatively
regulate proliferation.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:15.350
As such, are these
genes normally hyper

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.760
activated or
inactivated in cancer?

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.180
Hyper activated or inactivated?

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.400
Inactivated.

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:42.620
That's in contrast to the
oncogenes which get activated,

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.630
hyper activated.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:46.515
These get inactivated or lost.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:02.930
These inactivating
mutations are recessive.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:08.910
They are loss of
function, again,

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.910
in contrast to the
situation with oncogenes

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:16.420
which are dominant
mutations, gain of function.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.327
And this actually creates an
interesting challenge for us.

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:25.620
If these are recessive
mutations and a cell

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.890
acquires a mutation in
one copy of the RB gene--

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:33.240
and I'll just show the
chromosomes on which RB exists.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.790
Happens to be chromosome 13.

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:39.720
We have a normal cell, say it's
a normal cell in the developing

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.070
retina.

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:42.720
And that cell incurs a mutation.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.230
Random chance,
cigarette smoking,

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:54.430
probably not in this
child, but random chance.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:58.990
Leads to the inactivation
of one copy of the RB gene.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:00.410
What's the phenotype
of this cell?

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:04.610
It's normal.

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:09.670
These are recessive mutations.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:13.060
Having one normal copy
is sufficient to provide

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:17.300
RB protein, to provide
control of the cell cycle.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.270
So the cell is
normal but the cell

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:26.290
is predisposed
because now it only

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:29.582
has one functional copy left.

00:45:29.582 --> 00:45:31.165
We could call this
the first mutation.

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:37.100
And now within
this clone of cells

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:42.080
if a second mutation occurs
then we're in trouble.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.360
And the second mutation
can occur in one

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.780
of a couple of different ways.

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:55.340
For example, it could be that
by random chance, bad luck

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.995
the normal copy on the other
chromosome gets mutated.

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:03.940
Or it could be, and it's
actually more frequent,

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.085
that a chromosomal
event takes place.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.940
For example, a cell arises
which only has one chromosome 13

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:15.740
through chromosomal
non-disjunction.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.820
And it's the one
with the mutant copy.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.960
These are functionally
equivalent.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.442
Both of these cells
are RB deficient.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:33.810
And they are on their
way to becoming cancers.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.960
Tumor suppressor genes
therefore require two hits.

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:48.970
Two hits, two mutational
events to inactivate the two

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:50.560
normal copies of the gene.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.179
They can be two
mutations within the gene

00:46:53.179 --> 00:46:54.970
or they can be one
mutation within the gene

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:56.350
plus some chromosomal event.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.800
And I've shown you one example
here, there are others.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.010
OK.

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:05.450
So that looks good.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.775
Everybody gets it
right, no problems?

00:47:07.775 --> 00:47:10.150
Let me show you this picture,
which I actually showed you

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:12.220
on the first day of class.

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:16.780
This is a child
who has bilateral,

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.170
multi-focal retinoblastoma.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:25.900
This child has 12 different
retinoblastoma tumors

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.070
affecting both eyes.

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:32.880
Not only that, this
child comes from a family

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.740
in which retinoblastoma
is passing

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.590
through the generations.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:40.800
The grandfather had it, he
passed on the predisposition

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:44.100
to multiple of his children,
who passed on the predisposition

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.000
to multiple of their children.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.360
This is an example of a
familial cancer syndrome.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.430
Familial predisposition
to cancer.

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.670
Most cancers don't have
this kind of pedigree.

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:16.210
Most cancers are sporadic,
but about 10% of cancers

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:19.090
look like this with a
clear family history.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:22.630
Familial retinoblastoma,
familial breast cancer,

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:26.110
familial colon cancer,
and there are others.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.551
These are caused by
mutations in genes like this.

00:48:29.551 --> 00:48:31.270
This individual
that I showed you,

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.000
the individuals in
this family have

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.980
inherited a defective
copy of the gene

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.310
from one of their parents.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:46.010
And as such they
have this genotype.

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:49.400
They are heterozygous
for an RB mutation.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.580
Heterozygous for an RB mutation.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.580
And because they're
heterozygous for an RB mutation

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.420
they are highly predisposed
to developing retinoblastoma.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.750
And the reason is that
within their cells,

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:06.040
within the developing
retinal cells in their body

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.870
two mutational events
are not required.

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:19.200
Instead in them, all of
their cells look like this.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.650
All of their cells are in that
heterozygous predisposed state.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:28.820
And therefore in
them, a single hit

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:34.430
is required to give rise
to a cell that is lacking

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.900
the function of RB altogether.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.910
And that's why
they're predisposed.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:43.810
And that's why BRCA1
patients get breast cancer,

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:47.980
and why APC patients get
familial colon cancer.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.220
This slide also raises for
you some interesting questions

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.290
and we'll talk about
them next time.

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:55.870
Here's a person who
has the right genotype

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:57.520
but he didn't get the disease.

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.930
Why not?

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.850
And another question,
what would happen

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:04.330
if two individuals who were
heterozygous for the mutation

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:08.200
were to marry, have a child who
was homozygous for an RB gene

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.290
mutation?

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:10.840
What would happen then?

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.260
We'll talk about that next time.
