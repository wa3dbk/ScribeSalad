00:00:26.307 --> 00:00:27.640
HAZEL SIVE: Some good questions.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.400
Let's zip through quickly.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.200
Why can't an initial
depolarization travel along

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.790
the length of the axon?

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.010
Last time, we went
through in detail

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.940
how a signal is transmitted
from the outside

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.170
to the inside of the cell by
ion flux across the membrane,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.730
and then how that ion flux is
transmitted down the neuron.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.820
Remember that the ions entering
the cell are just ions.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.000
They'll diffuse away.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.480
And so the depolarization
kind of dissipates.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.810
And it then needs
to be regenerated.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.400
The action potential,
each small depolarization

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.820
or the whole signal,
each small depolarization

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.800
with a specific magnitude, the
reversal of membrane potential

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.910
going from about minus 60
millivolts, negative inside,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.870
to plus 55 or 60
millivolts, positive inside.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.300
Each of those is an
action potential.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.764
And here is an interesting one.

00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:25.180
Why doesn't the
membrane potential

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.270
stop at zero when sodium
rushes into the cell

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.920
during an action
potential, which

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.340
is what you'd expect if
sodium was just moving along

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.290
its concentration radian?

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.550
Because the potential's not
only governed by sodium influx.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.100
There are chloride ions outside
the cell and potassium ions

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.040
inside over the duration
of the potential.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.480
And as we'll discuss
briefly in a moment,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.140
it's during the
rectification process

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.120
that you go back
to zero, and then

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.740
you reverse membrane
potential again.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.610
Well, let's move on
to Nervous System 2.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:11.910
And I want to cover two
things today, both of which

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.610
connect with last lecture,
and then move on to our topic

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.110
today.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.630
We've drawn the analogy
of the nervous system

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.260
as a communication
system through the body

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.180
where there are wires, there are
connections between the wires,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.600
and there are circuits
that need to be laid down.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.000
Today, we're mostly going to
talk about the connections.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.080
But I want to talk a little
more about pumps and channels.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.620
And then we're going to
talk about the connections

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.655
between neurons, which
is also called synapses.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.730
Let's begin with a little
more about pumps and channels.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.520
And I want to briefly
summarize where

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.700
we were with talking
about an action potential,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.200
and introduce one
last kind of pump--

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.620
of channel, excuse me--

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.720
that we didn't quite get to
at the end of last lecture.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.530
And then we'll talk about the
pumps and channels involved

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.940
in synapses.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.070
So in an action potential--

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.930
and the sequence of
an action potential--

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.160
we define three phases,
along the length of the axon

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.290
with regard to the
membrane potential

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.930
that was involved in
transmitting the signal,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.660
along the very long axon,
intracellular signaling those

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:02.970
with arresting potential,
the threshold or the action

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.270
potential of the threshold
leading to the action

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.000
potential, and then the
question of repolarization,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.339
resetting the membrane
potential, which is pivotal.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.485
Otherwise, the cell
can't fire again.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.190
And we talked about one
pump, which is really pivotal

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.120
for life-- we study it
in my own laboratory--

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.130
but one pump which
is on all the time

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.860
and which is involved primarily
in the resting potential

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.660
and the repolarization.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.750
This is the sodium
potassium pump.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.610
It pumps sodium out and
potassium in, but less sodium

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.520
out and potassium in.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.700
And it is on all the time.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.540
There are other channels
that are open all the time.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.540
The key one are
potassium channels,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.420
but there are also open
chloride and sodium channels.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.680
And those are open all the time.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.350
And depending on
the concentration

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.000
of the ions, and also
electrostatic repulsion,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.650
which will counter sometimes
movement along a concentration

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.460
gradient, those are
involved in everything.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.340
But primarily-- they're
open all the time--

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.220
but they are primarily involved
in setting up resting potential

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.120
and repolarization.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.670
So we'll put some dots.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.330
I'm going to dash the line
in the action potential area,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.570
which indicates that those
pumps and channel, that pump

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.210
and channel are being
used and active,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.790
but they're not pivotal
in those processes.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.180
The one that's really pivotal
in the action potential

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.150
is the voltage gated
sodium channel.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.710
We talked about this last time.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.020
You can look a bit
more on the slides

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.740
that I posted with
regard to the ideas

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.530
behind how the channel is closed
at certain membrane potential,

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.470
how if the membrane
potential changes slightly,

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.440
there's a conformational
change in the protein.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.140
And a pore opens
that allows sodium

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.290
to rush in down its
concentration gradient,

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.110
over a very small
area of membrane.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.840
So the voltage gated sodium
channel allows sodium in,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.320
and it is closed,
if we look at this.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.660
It's open during an
action potential.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:57.280
It is closed at resting,
but is ready to be open.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.510
And then subsequently, it is
closed during repolarization

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.940
when the membrane
potential is reset.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.040
And it's not openable--

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.970
it's not actually clear why--
there's some funny confirmation

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.800
and that pump is not ready to be
opened for some period of time

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.680
until the protein
structure resets itself.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.700
And then it's openable.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.800
So it's closed and it's
not ready to be opened.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.100
And this is really
pivotal in making sure

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.200
that an action
potential traverses

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.160
in one direction along the
axon, and doesn't go backwards

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.590
as the ions diffuse backwards.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.760
And then finally,
I want to mention--

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.520
or I want to tell you--

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:49.930
that there is a voltage gated
potassium channel that opens up

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.610
after the action potential.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.220
And that is one
of the things that

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.130
is pivotal in resetting
the membrane potential

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.020
during repolarization.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.390
The other thing that
is really pivotal

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.220
is this sodium potassium pump.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.530
So the voltage gated
potassium channel

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:14.160
gets potassium out of
the cell in the area

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.380
where there has
been depolarization.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.530
Your very positive
inside ions go out

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.630
along their
concentration gradient,

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.600
or along an
electrostatic gradient.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.920
And so potassium goes
out, both in this case.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.299
And so it is open
during repolarization,

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:37.110
and it is closed for
the rest of the time.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:44.836
OK.

00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:47.210
The thing you're going to have
to do with these channels,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.530
that you will do in section
and with your problem set,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.940
is to really work
through the kind of logic

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.390
behind what pump and channel
is doing what at what

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.280
stage of the action potential.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.110
And then it will
start to make sense.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.610
OK.

00:09:06.659 --> 00:09:08.200
So we're going to
move on in a moment

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.460
and talk about the synapse.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.970
But I'm going to talk about
the pumps and channels

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:18.760
during a synapse, and point
out to you that these pumps

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.840
and channels are being
used, but there are others,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.770
which are really crucial.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.500
One of them is the
voltage gated--

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.760
VG for voltage gated--

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.610
calcium channel.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:43.570
And the other are a
series of ligand gated,

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.560
or second messenger gated.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:57.390
Second messenger regulated,
let's say, not gated, ion

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:57.890
channels.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:09.710
And these ligand gated, or
voltage gated second messenger

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.540
regulated channels, these things
are specific to the synapse,

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.345
and are specific to the
connections between cells.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.170
So let's move on
to the major topic

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:42.760
today, which is this question
of the synapse, the connection

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.660
between cells.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.940
And let me throw out some facts.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.856
And then I'll show you
kind of a cool picture.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.230
Neurons connect with one
another to make circuits.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.140
That's the deal.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.420
That's the wiring.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.340
So how complex is this wiring?

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.770
I showed you a very
cool 3D reconstruction

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.590
of the brain that
showed you the packing

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.510
of the neurons in the brain.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.360
But quantitatively,
what does that mean?

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:20.010
One neuron can connect with,
can synapse with up to 100,000

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:20.625
other neurons.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.830
In the brain alone, there are
at least 10 to the 10th neurons.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.450
It's not clear
really, to anyone,

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.420
how you put those
two numbers together,

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.790
whether you can multiply
them, and whether that's fair.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.920
But whatever you
come out with, that's

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.950
a lot of connections,
just in the brain.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.140
OK?

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.320
The number of synapses,
therefore, is huge.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.650
So what kinds of
connections are there?

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.399
Let's just write this.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.440
I'm not going to try to--

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.419
huge number of synapses.

00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:19.960
There you go.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.970
That's quantitative.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.450
What are these connections?

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.300
We've talked a lot about an
electrical signal moving down

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.590
the axon.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.840
But now I'm going to
tell you that most

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.890
connections between
cells are not electrical,

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.190
they're chemical.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.520
And I told you last time
when we explored the reason

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.730
that you have these long
axons and intracellular

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.970
signaling rather than cells
all piled up next to one

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.200
another doing intracellular
signaling, that's slow.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.550
I told you that last time.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.830
And that's still
true in a synapse.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.260
The connections
between the cells

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.790
is the slow point of
neural transmission.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.425
There are electrical synapses.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.660
And they are used
sometimes, but rarely.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:17.980
They are fact because they are
connected by gap junctions, one

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.320
neuron to another.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.710
And that allows ion flow.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.260
But the thing about
electrical synapses

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.620
is that they're always open.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.510
The cells are always connected.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.740
They're unregulated.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.630
And the thing about
the nervous system

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.450
is that it is
exquisitely regulated.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.140
It is fine-tuned to respond
to the smallest stimuli,

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.260
both from within your
body and from without.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.590
And unregulated synapses
will not do that for you.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.625
So the flip of those
are chemicals synapses.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:19.390
They are slow, their
diffusion limited,

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.310
and they're diffusion
limited of chemicals

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.920
that we'll discuss
in detail, that

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.700
are called neurotransmitters.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.500
But they have the
wonderful property

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.940
of being highly regulatable.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.390
And so the majority of
synapses in higher animals

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.430
are these chemical synapses.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.110
And that's what we'll
talk about today.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.550
This is a picture
which I really like.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.780
It's a neuron where--

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.070
and these are the dendrites.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.920
And here's the cell body
and the axon coming out.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.410
And each of these dots
represents a synapse.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.000
Well, it doesn't
represent a synapse.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.430
It is, it's stained
for a protein that's

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.170
only found in synapses.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.710
And you can see this tremendous
studding of the dendrites

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.040
with synapses, which gives
you a sense of the complexity.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:31.920
OK.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.950
It's really pivotal, when we
talk about the connections,

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.160
that we get some of
the principles correct.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.600
So I want to spend a board going
through some of the principles

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.580
that we have to bear in mind in
thinking about the connections.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.580
So let's think about this.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:16:01.890
Here are neurons-- well,
let's have Neuron 1.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.240
But we could actually
have Neuron 1 to n.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.050
It doesn't matter.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.310
It could be a whole
bunch of Neuron 1.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.320
And along that one neuron,
or those bunches of neurons,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.050
is coming an action potential.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.470
And over here is Neuron 2.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:29.640
And between them is a
connection, is a synapse.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.610
And the thing that Neuron 2
has to decide when it connects

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.920
with Neuron 1 is
whether it's going

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.380
to make an action
potential, whether it's

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.070
going to send a signal.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.640
That is the big decision
that this neuron has to make.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:56.470
So Neuron 2 must decide to
make an action potential,

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.830
and it is a yes/no decision.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.140
It's not a sort of
an action potential

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.790
or a half an action potential.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:11.490
And so we need to remember
action potential facts, all

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.359
or none.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:15.780
You either get an action
potential or you don't.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.990
That means you get complete
depolarization or nothing.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.630
And if you have a lot of action
potentials coming along Neuron

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.770
1, the way Neuron 2
can respond is not

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.230
to make a big action
potential, obviously.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.940
But it can make a lot
of action potentials.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:48.760
So a change in input where we
can call this action potential

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.520
from Neuron 1, the
input, a change

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.440
in input results in
an increase or change,

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.540
let's just say, a
change in the number

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:08.380
of action potentials per time,
or the frequency of action

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:13.780
potentials in Neuron 2.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:22.015
Other facts, other
really key facts.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.075
Resting potential can change.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.620
Threshold potential and
the action potential,

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.705
as I've been belaboring,
do not change.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.170
And you can see that nicely
in the slide, where here's

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.540
a neuron firing, and
this is a different way

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.170
of showing the neuron firing.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.250
Here is the action
potential showing

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.880
as a spike of depolarization.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.890
And then there's a
time, another spike,

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:19.240
another action potential,
wait, another spike, and so on.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.376
Here is a neuron that's
gotten a lot of input.

00:19:22.376 --> 00:19:23.000
And look at it.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.020
It's spike, spike,
spike, spike, spike.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.330
But if you look at the
height of that spike,

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.730
that is the
depolarization height.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.520
It's the same within
the sensitivity

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.490
of the recording device for
each of these action potentials.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:41.010
So I really like that slide
to exemplify these principles

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.480
that I've just
put on this board.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:43.980
OK.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.880
There are the principles.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.230
How does it work?

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.130
Very cool.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.710
This is really amazing.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.750
Let's again have Axon 1.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.281
We're going to have Axon 1 here.

00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:58.780
OK?

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.440
Axon, oh, let's have axon
derived from Neuron 1.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.240
And now we've got to
distinguish two different parts

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:09.775
of the axon.

00:20:14.316 --> 00:20:15.940
And I'm going to draw
this on the board

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.398
and then I'm going to go through
it with you on a hand out,

00:20:18.398 --> 00:20:19.990
because it's important.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.960
There's an electrical
signal coming along Axon 1.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.200
And you know that it
involves an action

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.010
potential via the voltage
gated sodium channels.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.820
As that signal nears
the end of the axon,

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.630
the axon kind of bulges
out into a terminal,

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.845
and the voltage gated channels
change from sodium to calcium.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.470
So here's the end of the axon.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:02.170
And here you change to
voltage gated calcium

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:07.911
channels that are activated.

00:21:07.911 --> 00:21:08.410
OK.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.890
These voltage gated
calcium channels,

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.260
this is called-- actually,
let's put some terminology.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:22.040
This is called the
pre-synaptic neuron.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.510
And the voltage gated
calcium channels are

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.455
at the pre-synaptic terminus.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.200
Now the thing about calcium
that we've mentioned

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.420
before is that it is a
mediator of exocytosis,

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.910
of having little
vesicles containing

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.660
proteins or other molecules
released from the cell.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.820
These voltage gated calcium
channels increase intracellular

00:21:54.820 --> 00:22:05.630
calcium and lead
to the exocytosis,

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.840
the release of
chemicals that are

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.870
contained in
vesicles at the end,

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.210
at the pre-synaptic terminus.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:21.850
So the pre-synaptic
terminus contains vesicles

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.500
with neurotransmitter.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.030
We'll talk about this in detail.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.050
The voltage gated
calcium channels,

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:37.120
which increase
intracellular calcium,

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:46.810
lead to exocytosis release of
the neurotransmitter, which

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.480
is released outside the cell.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.890
And that neurotransmitter
diffuses across the space

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.982
between Neuron 1 and Neuron 2.

00:22:58.982 --> 00:23:00.850
It's about 30 nanometers.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.230
And it diffuses
across the space.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:07.760
And when it gets to
the other side to--

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:13.010
here's Neuron 2, called
the post-synaptic neuron--

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.250
when it gets to the
other side, and it'll

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:33.850
get to either the
dendrites or the cell body,

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:40.350
this neurotransmitter
binds to things

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:44.980
that we've talked about a
lot, it binds to receptors.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.160
Those receptors plus
ligand do all the things

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.650
we've talked about
in many lectures.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.810
They do something.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.820
In this case, they can
do one of two things,

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.230
as we'll talk about.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:00.430
But it all culminates
in changing ion flux

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.250
across the
post-synaptic membrane.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.760
So the neurotransmitter
diffuses.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.790
It hits the dendrites,
or cell body.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:22.710
It binds receptors to change
ion flux, or ion movement.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:31.900
And this eventually gets
turned into the action

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.875
potential decision.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.180
OK.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.000
So let's put some more on here.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.840
Here's an electrical
signal from Neuron 1.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.150
Here, this
neurotransmitter diffusion

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:58.780
is a chemical signal
across what is

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:06.490
called the synaptic cleft, which
is the space between neurons.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:14.050
And the signal in Neuron 2
becomes electrical again.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.350
So there's a conversion
device, which

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:21.530
converts electrical to
chemical to electrical signals.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:22.030
All right.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.910
Let's look at your
first handout and we'll

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.230
hammer this in in more detail.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.780
Here's the action potential.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.154
So let me stand here
in case you're--

00:25:36.154 --> 00:25:37.320
they don't like me doing it.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:37.820
OK.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.910
Let me stand here.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:43.800
Here's the action potential
coming along Neuron 1.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.230
Voltage gated sodium
channels until you

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.510
get near the end,
when you switch

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.420
to these voltage gated
calcium channels.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:58.290
Calcium flows in, leads
to exocytosis of vesicles

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.410
containing neurotransmitter.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.470
The neurotransmitter diffuses
across the synaptic cleft,

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:09.570
binds to receptors on either
side, which changes the ion

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.950
flux into Neuron 2.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:18.030
And there is an action
potential decision--

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.290
it's on your sheet--

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:22.440
an action potential
decision that eventually,

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.370
as we'll discuss, involves
voltage gated sodium channels

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.850
so that the cell
decides whether or not

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.660
it's going to fire
an action potential.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.160
OK.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.270
We'll talk about the
neurotransmitters

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.070
and the receptors in
more detail in a moment.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:43.980
But I want to introduce
you to three concepts

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.800
of the synapse, which are
really very important.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.160
The first is the
concept of summation.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.290
And now we go back to the
notion that many neurons

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.640
can give signals to
another neuron, such

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.340
that that other neuron
is deciding yes, no, I'm

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.020
going to fire an
action potential

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.290
and transmit the signal.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:12.720
The neuron that's receiving
all of that signaling

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:18.030
has to add up its inputs and say
what's the sum of the inputs.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.560
Literally, it has to
add up the inputs.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:34.620
So summation is the addition
of all synaptic input, which

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:46.230
is change in membrane potential
governed by change in ion

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:54.435
movement on a recipient neuron.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.650
OK.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.380
So the addition of
all synaptic input

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.960
on a recipient neuron,
or bio-recipient neuron,

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.400
if you like.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.910
There's two kinds.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:14.630
There's spatial
summation, which has to do

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.110
where the signal is received.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.290
And so those synapses
that I showed you

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:29.590
in that picture of the
cell with all its dendrites

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.650
and all of those little dots
were all over the place?

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.540
Each of those little
dots is getting

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.320
a signal on the
dendrites, on the ends

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.410
of the dendrites, near the
cell body, in the cell body.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.520
All of those inputs
have to be added up.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.040
So where the signal
received, is received,

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:57.140
cell body plus dendrites, that
would be spatial summation.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:02.040
And then temporal
summation means over time,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.510
when the signal is received.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.600
Over a period of a
millisecond or so,

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.770
all of those inputs to
the neuron are added up.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.510
And the addition is
actually a simple one.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:23.540
The addition is how much has
the membrane potential changed,

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.510
and overall, have you brought
the membrane potential

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.930
of the recipient
neuron up to threshold.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.080
If you have, that
recipient neuron fires.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.390
And if you haven't, it doesn't.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.770
So the total
membrane potential--

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:43.820
so the answer of
whether to fire or not,

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:59.200
is the total membrane potential,
which is the decision.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:06.090
And if it's threshold
potential, out of that,

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.035
an action potential results.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:16.310
The addition, the summation
is done in the dendrites

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.750
and the cell body.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:22.400
And the answer is read at the
place where the axon comes off

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.930
the cell body, which is
called the axon hillock.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:39.340
So the sum is calculated
over all of the dendrites

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.710
plus the cell body.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:48.290
But it is read at this thing
called the axon hillock.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:58.660
And they only read
the axon hillock

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.860
is where the axon
leaves the cell body,

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.705
or originates from
the cell body.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:12.510
And the reason that that
is an important place

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.300
is that that is where
the voltage gated

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.150
sodium channels are found.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.320
It's only there.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.560
They start at the axon
hillock, and they are present

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.917
all the way down the axon.

00:31:23.917 --> 00:31:25.875
There are no-- and you
can look at your diagram

00:31:25.875 --> 00:31:28.620
for this-- there are
no voltage gated sodium

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.800
channels in the cell
body or the dendrites.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.410
So they can't fire
an action potential.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.470
They can add up how
membrane potentials changed,

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.760
but they can't do
anything about it.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.530
So the hillock is where the
axon leaves the cell body,

00:31:43.530 --> 00:32:01.580
and where the voltage gated
sodium channels begin, begin,

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.240
and where an action potential
can therefore come out.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.962
That's a bunch of sentences.

00:32:08.962 --> 00:32:09.462
OK.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.280
Couple more terms.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.400
Excitatory and
inhibitory synapses,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.790
excitatory and inhibitory.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.320
It's kind of like a
simple math problem

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.440
where you're adding positive
numbers or negative numbers.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.140
You know, you come out with
something that's either 0,

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.000
negative, or positive.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.680
Same idea here.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.430
When you add all these
inputs that a neuron gets,

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.830
it figures out what
it's going to do.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.670
And the inputs can be either
pushing a neuron closer

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:05.120
towards an action potential,
closer towards threshold,

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.580
or pushing a neuron
away from being

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.160
able to make an action
potential, further

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.900
away from threshold.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:19.070
Excitatory synapses bring
the resting potential

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:34.320
closer to threshold,
whereas inhibitory

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.890
bring the resting potential
further from threshold.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:47.890
All right.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.920
Here's where it gets
even more complicated.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:55.030
One neuron can be making both
excitatory and inhibitory

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.210
synapses.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.720
And depending on
which predominate,

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.310
the recipient neuron
will either be

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.070
told to fire or not
to fire, to make

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.660
an action potential or not.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:22.316
So one neuron can make both
excitatory and inhibitory

00:34:22.316 --> 00:34:22.816
synapses.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.330
How does this work, you ask?

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.190
Well, you have all
the tools to know.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:34.929
It's all got to do with ion flux
and which ions are flowing in

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.480
and which ions are flowing out.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.270
And we can answer that by
looking at your next handouts.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.790
In Number 2 of
your handouts, I've

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.500
shown you the synaptic cleft.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.330
Here's a synaptic cleft.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.850
And here are the voltage
gated calcium channels

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:57.960
opening to allow calcium
in and neurotransmitter

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.580
vesicle exocytosis.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:07.360
Here is an excitatory synapse
bringing the resting potential

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.130
closer to threshold.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:10.960
Let's think about that.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:15.340
You want positive ions to
come in from the outside.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.980
That would help bring
your resting potential

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.820
closer to threshold.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.780
So there is some sodium
channels that can open,

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.870
maybe calcium channels that can
open-- not the voltage gated

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.360
ones.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.860
And that would increase
the resting potential.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.700
That would increase the
potential inside the cell,

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.520
bring it more positive,
closer to threshold.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:41.480
Conversely, in an
inhibitory synapse,

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.390
you'd get a net inflow
of negative charges.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:48.260
The chloride ions might
move from the outside in.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.660
That would take, make
your inside of your cell

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.170
more negative and further
away from threshold.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.360
You could also
get potassium out.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.550
And that would, again,
make the inside of the cell

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:01.250
more negative and
further from threshold.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.032
So you can see already I've
got four different channels--

00:36:04.032 --> 00:36:05.990
they're not the ones
we've talked about before,

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.100
they're different ones--

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.170
four different
channels which can

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:13.270
modulate the membrane potential
on the recipient cell.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:18.400
All right.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:26.200
Let us move on now to
those neurotransmitters

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.652
and their receptors.

00:36:39.696 --> 00:36:43.890
Neurotransmitters and
neurotransmitter receptors

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:46.050
are very cool because
they are probably

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:50.310
what makes us who we are
in terms of personality,

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:55.260
in terms of ability, in terms
of our interface with the world,

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.070
in terms of whether we're an
intrinsically happy or not so

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.980
happy person, er cetera.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.360
Neurotransmitters, however,
are a class of molecule

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.760
we have previously encountered.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.960
They are ligands, but
they're different ligands.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.270
When we talked about
ligands previously,

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.830
we have largely been talking--

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.750
not entirely--
we've largely been

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:24.780
talking about peptides
or molecules that

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.820
are sort of a reasonable size.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.540
Not always.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.660
The steroid, the steroid
hormones are very tiny.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.310
Neurotransmitters are
pretty much all very tiny.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.960
And the thing that
you should know

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:44.920
is that you can have one or
many types of neurotransmitter

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.380
per synapse.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.860
Here's another complication.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:38:01.170
Neurotransmitters can
be peptides sometimes,

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:05.280
but they are very largely amino
acids, the same amino acids

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:11.160
that you build proteins
with, nucleotides,

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:22.790
or other small molecules,
like the kinds of synapses.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.160
Synapses are excitatory
or inhibitory

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.170
because of the kinds
of neurotransmitters

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.620
that they're making.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.720
So there are excitatory
neurotransmitters.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:41.610
Glutamate, glutamate,
glutamate, glutamic acid--

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:44.490
OK, the same one we've
talked about before--

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:50.060
and adenine are both
examples of excitatory,

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:56.360
are examples of excitatory
neurotransmitters.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.510
Glutamate is involved
in being alert.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.670
Adenine is involved
in being sleepy.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.130
And one of the things
that caffeine does

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.220
is to counteract the
effects of adenine

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:19.480
so that it's thought
to competitively

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.800
interact or competitively
inhibit adenine function.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:30.670
Inhibitory
neurotransmitters, something

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.170
called GABA, gamma-Aminobutyric
acid, and glycine

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:38.980
are the two major CNS,
Central Nervous System

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.520
neurotransmitters.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:45.670
GABA particularly is an
anti-anxiety neurotransmitter.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:56.010
And things like Xanax, which
I will get to today or Friday,

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.900
are things which will be
agonists of GABA function.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.930
And sometimes,
neurotransmitters can be

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:06.650
both excitatory and inhibitory.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:17.480
Acetylcholine,
for example, which

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.110
is involved in connections
between nerves and muscles.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:27.560
Neuromuscular connections,
and also found in the CNS,

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.950
can be both excitatory
and inhibitory.

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:36.040
And serotonin-- and
I'll put dopamine

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.720
on the same line for
space-- serotonin

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.730
and dopamine, both
of which are kind

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:51.940
of feel good
neurotransmitters, also

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:58.560
involved in alertness
and other things.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.960
For dopamine-- locomotor
activity movement--

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.090
they can be either
excitatory or inhibitory.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.030
What do they look like?

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.740
Let me go on and then I'll show
you some pictures in a moment.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.360
All right.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.640
So how can something be
excitatory and inhibitory?

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:29.380
What's downstream of
these neurotransmitters?

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:34.260
The receptors.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.491
Good job.

00:41:36.491 --> 00:41:36.990
All right.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.650
Neurotransmitters,
ligands bind receptors.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.390
And the way the
neurotransmitters

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.400
affect what they're
going to do is

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.310
by binding the
appropriate receptor.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:52.830
So here are the receptors
for the neurotransmitters.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:56.590
And like the
neurotransmitters, there

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.850
can be many different
kinds per synapse.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:15.710
There are two classes of
receptors that you should know.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:17.860
One are ion channels.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:21.240
They're receptors which
bind the neurotransmitter,

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.430
and they open up.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.650
They're ligand
gated ion channels.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:29.310
But the other kind
are not ion channels.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.530
They bind the
receptor and then they

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:33.720
activate a second
messenger system,

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.550
as we talked about before.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.130
And it's the second
messenger system that

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:41.100
later on opens an iron channel.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.500
They have names.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:49.895
So two classes, one
are the iron channels.

00:42:53.447 --> 00:42:57.190
They're called
ionotropic receptors.

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:03.805
So they're ligand
gated ion channels.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.740
And the thing about these
is that their response

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:22.300
is very rapid, in the
millisecond range.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.100
There's another class
of those receptors

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.935
which activate ion channels.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.730
They are called metabotropic.

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.510
It's the concept that is
more important than the term,

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:47.090
but I'm giving you the
term for completeness.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:53.960
And they act via
a second messenger

00:43:53.960 --> 00:44:01.546
system that almost always
involves G proteins.

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.075
And these are slow.

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:15.150
Their response is at least
a second, often much greater

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.860
than a second.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:22.750
OK.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:26.724
And let me, as the last
thing I'll tell you today,

00:44:26.724 --> 00:44:28.390
I'll show you-- if
we have a moment I'll

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:29.848
show you some
pictures-- but I want

00:44:29.848 --> 00:44:33.550
to tell you that one
neurotransmitter can activate

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.190
different kinds of the receptor.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:50.320
So one neurotransmitter can
activate greater than one type

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:50.830
of receptor.

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:57.250
And this was implicit
in the notion

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:01.060
that neurotransmitters could be
both excitatory and inhibitory.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:08.920
For example, serotonin
binds to no fewer than 14

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.470
different receptors.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:16.060
And one neuron can express
probably not all 14,

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.020
but it could probably express
five different serotonin

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.280
receptors.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.360
And they do different things.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.115
One of them is a ligand
gated sodium channel.

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:46.340
Another type is G
protein coupled, so

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:50.820
including both metabotropic
and ionotropic receptors.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:57.620
And to throw out at you
the last couple of slides,

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:01.350
here are some of these amino
acids and small molecules

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.230
that are neurotransmitters.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:08.040
And this really exemplifies
what I've said on the board.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.680
So I'm going to stop here now.
