00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
All right.
I am going to start with

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Friday's lecture notes because
there was a significant amount

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
on them that I had not finished
up yet.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We had finally gotten to the
point where we were talking

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
about what does a wave function
mean, what is the physical

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
significance of it and how does
it actually represent the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
presence of an electron?
And what we saw was that the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
physically significant
representation of the wave

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
function, if you have some wave
function Psi labeled by three

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
quantum numbers,
n, l and m.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And, of course,
it is a function of r,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
theta and phi.
The physically significant

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
quantity was this wave function
squared.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That wave function squared,
that was interpreted as a

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
probability density.
The wave function squared has

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
units.
It has units of inverse volume.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It is a density.
It is a probability per unit

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
volume.
Now, as an aside,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
because someone asked me,
I should tell you that the more

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
comprehensive definition of the
probability density is Psi,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
not squared,
but Psi times Psi star,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
where Psi star is the
complex conjugate.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Because it turns out that some
wave functions are imaginary

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
functions.
And so, if you took an

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
imaginary function and squared
it, then you would still get an

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
imaginary function after it.
And then it is hard to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
interpret an imaginary function
as a probability density.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And so the more comprehensive
definition is Psi times Psi

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
star, where Psi star is the
complex conjugate of Psi.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And, when you multiply Psi by
Psi star, if Psi is a complex

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
function, well,
then you get a real function.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This is the more comprehensive
definition of the probability

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
density, Psi times Psi star.
We won't use that.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I just wanted to let you know
about it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So, probability density.
Not only do we want to know

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
something about the probability
density.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We also want to know something
about the probability of finding

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
the electron some distance away
from the nucleus.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And, to do that,
what we were talking about was

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
this quantity,
this radial distribution,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the radial probability
distribution.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And what that is,
is the probability of finding

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
an electron in a spherical shell
of radius r and distance or

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
thickness dr.
For example,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
if this gray portion here
represented the probability

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
density of the 1s wave function
in our dot density diagram.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Remember, we squared the wave
function, got the probability

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
density and then represented it
with a dot density diagram,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
where the density of the dots
was proportional to the value of

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
the wave function squared.
And, in the case of the 1s wave

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
function, we saw that the
probability density was largest

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
right at r equals 0,
and that is exponentially

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
decayed in all directions
uniformly.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
That is what that gray part
represents.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
But now, this blue,
here, is my spherical shell.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It has a radius r,
and it has a thickness,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
here, dr.
And the radial probability

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
distribution is asking,
what is the probability of

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
finding the electron in this
spherical shell?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And that spherical shell has a
thickness dr.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Another way to ask that is the
probability of finding the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
electron between r and r was dr.
That is what we wanted to know,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and that is what the radial
probability distribution tells

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
us.
Now, how do you get a value out

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
of that?
How do you actually calculate

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
the radial probability?
Well, to do that,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
what we have to know is this
volume, here,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
of the spherical shell.
The volume of this spherical

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
shell is just the surface area
of that spherical shell,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
4 pi r squared,
and the volume is times this

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
thickness, this thickness dr.
It is a very thin shell.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It is an infinitesimally thin
shell of thickness dr.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Well, if we know that volume,
then what we can do is take our

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
probability density,
Psi squared,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
which has units of probability
per unit volume.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And we are multiplying it,
here, by our unit volume.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
The unit volumes cancel,
and we are left with a

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
probability.
So, that is our probability of

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
finding that electron in a shell
of radius r and a thickness dr.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Let's look at the result of
calculating the radial

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
probability distribution for the
1s wave function.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
What did I do?
I took Psi squared for the 1s

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
wave function at some value of
r, then I multiplied it by 4 pi

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
r squared dr,
and I did that for many

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
different values of r and
plotted the result here.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
That is what that radial
probability is as a function of

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
r.
Well, the first thing you see

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
is that the most probable value
of r, or the value of r where

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
the electron has the highest
probability of being is at this

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
value, a nought.
The most probable value of r is

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
this value, a nought.
a nought is what we call

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
the Bohr radius.
And today, in a moment or so,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I will tell you why it is
called the Bohr radius.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
It has a numerical value of
0.529 angstroms.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And so it is most likely that
the electron is about a half an

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
angstrom away from the nucleus,
making, then,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
the diameter of the hydrogen
atom, on the average,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
a little bit over one angstrom.
That is how we think about the

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
size of a hydrogen atom,
is to take this most probable

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
value of r and double it to get
the diameter.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
The most probable value of r,
or the most probable distance

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
of the electron from the
nucleus, is half an angstrom

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
away.
The most probable distance of

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
the electron from the nucleus is
not r equals 0 because the

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
radial probability here is zero
at r equals 0.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
That seems a little strange
because the other day we plotted

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
the probability density for the
1s wave function.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And, when we did that,
here is Psi(1,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
0, 0) squared versus r,
what we saw was that the

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
probability density was some
maximum value at r equals 0 and

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
that it exponentially decayed
with increasing r.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And that is the case.
Probability density for the s

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
wave functions is a maximum at r
equals 0.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
But the radial probability here
is actually zero at r equals 0.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Why?
Look at how we defined that

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
radial probability,
here.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
It is Psi squared times this
volume element.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Our volume element is this
spherical shell.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And, at r equals 0,
the spherical shell goes to a

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
volume of zero.
So, our radial probability here

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
is equal to zero at r equals 0.
That is really important,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
that you understand that this
radial probability here is

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
always going to be zero at r
equals 0 for all of the wave

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
functions that we are going to
look at.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And we will talk about this a
little bit more,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
the fact that the electron is
about a half an angstrom away

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
from the nucleus.
But before I do that,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I also just want to point out
that in your textbook,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and sometimes in the notes,
that sometimes that radial

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
probability is actually written
as the following.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It is written as the r squared,
the distance variable,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
times the radial part of the
wave function.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
That is the radial part
squared.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
We talked about the radial and
the angular part last time.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And the radial part is labeled
only by two quantum numbers,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
n and l.
And so, for the 1s,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
that is n equals 1,
l equals 0.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Where does this come from?
Well, let me just emphasize or

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
explain where this comes from.
This radial probability

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
distribution here,
we said for the s wave

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
functions, was Psi squared.
You could take Psi squared,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
the probability density,
and multiply it by this unit

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
volume or the volume of the
shell, 4 pi r squared dr.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Let's write that out again,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
but write it out now so that we
write out Psi squared in terms

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
of the radial part and the
angular part.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Remember, we said last time,
for the hydrogen atom wave

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
functions, that Psi is always a
product of a factor only an r,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000
which was the radial part,
and a factor only in theta and

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
phi, which are the angular
parts.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Now, what you also have to
remember in looking at this is

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
that the angular part for the 1s
wave functions,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000
2s, 3s, all s wave functions,
was equal to 1 over 4 pi to the

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
1/2.
If you square that,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
you are going to get 1 over 4
pi.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Therefore, the 4pi's here are
going to cancel for the 1s wave

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
functions.
And what you are going to have

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
left is this r squared times
just the radial part dr.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
That is why the y-axis in your

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
book is sometimes labeled this
way for the radial probability

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
distribution.
But this is also important

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
because if you were calculating
the radial distribution function

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
for something other than an s
wave function.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
The way you would do it is to
take just the radial part of

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
that wave function times r
squared, or just the radial part

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
of that wave function and
evaluate it at that value of r

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
times r squared dr.
You could not,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
for the other wave functions,
take psi squared times 4 pi r

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
squared dr.
And that is because the angular

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
part for the other wave
functions that are not

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.000
spherically symmetric is not the
square root of 1 over 4 pi.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
This is a broader definition
for what the radial probability

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
distribution function is.
It just works out,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
in the case for the s wave
functions, these 4pi's cancel.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And so you can write the radial
probability for the s wave

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
functions like that.
So, those are just some

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
definitions.
I want to talk some more about

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
this radial probability
distribution function,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
here, for the 1s wave function.
I want to talk about it and

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000
also explain why a nought
is called the Bohr radius.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
The reason for that is the
following.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
The nucleus was discovered in
1911, the electron was known

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
before that, and Schrˆdinger did
not write down his wave equation

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
until 1926.
And, in between that,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
1911 to 1926,
the scientific community was

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
really working very hard to try
to understand the structure of

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
the atom.
And we saw how the classical

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
ideas, as predicted,
would live a whopping 10^-10

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
seconds.
And one of the people who were

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
working on that problem was
Niels Bohr.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And, in 1919,
Niels Bohr of course realized

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
that classical physics fails
this kind of planetary model for

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
the atom where you put the
nucleus in the center and the

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
electron is going around that
nucleus with some fixed orbit.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
We will call it r.
Well, he knew that it was not

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
going to work,
that those classical ideas

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
predicted that this would
plummet into the nucleus in

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
10^-10 seconds.
But, he said,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
obviously, that does not
happen, so let me just forget

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
classical physics at the moment.
Then, what he did was to impose

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
some quantization on this
classical model for the hydrogen

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
atom.
And the reason he got this idea

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
of quantization is because he
already knew the hydrogen atom

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
emission spectrum.
He knew that in the hydrogen

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
atom emission spectrum that
light of only certain

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
frequencies was emitted.
That is, there was some idea

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
that there was something about
this hydrogen atom that is

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
quantized.
He said, well,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
let me just ignore classical
physics for a moment.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Let me give this a circular
orbit.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
But let me quantize something
about this hydrogen atom.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And, in particular,
what he went and did was

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
quantized the angular momentum
of that electron.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
He kind of just pasted the
quantization onto a classical

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
model for the atom,
because he is trying to work

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
toward explaining what the
observations were.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
When he pasted that
quantization onto this classic

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
model, he was able to calculate
a value of r.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And that value of r is what we
call the Bohr radius,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
a nought, and has the value
0.529 angstroms.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:59.000
That came out of it.
And if you calculate for the

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000
radial probability distribution
function for this model,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:15.000
which is called the Bohr atom,
would be one where that radial

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:23.000
probability is 1 right here at r
equals a nought.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
In Bohr's model,
the electron had a

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
well-defined,
precise orbit.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
The value of r at which it went
around the nucleus was given by

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
a nought.
He knew exactly where the

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
electron was in his model.
This kind of model,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
which is this classical model,
really, is what we call

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
deterministic.
It is deterministic because we

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
know exactly where the particle,
in this case the electron,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
is.
I want you to contrast it with

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
the quantum mechanical result
from the Schrˆdinger equation.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
What you see,
in the quantum mechanical

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
result, is that we don't really
know where the electron is,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
so to speak.
The best we can tell you is a

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
probability of finding the
electron at some value r to r

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
plus dr.
That is the best we can do

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
because quantum mechanics is
non-deterministic.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
There is a limit to which we
can know the position of a

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
particle.
That limit is given by

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
something called the uncertainty
principle.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
The uncertainty principle is
not something we are going to

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
discuss, but it tells us that
there is a limit to which we can

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
know both the position and the
momentum of a particle.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And that is the basis for why,
here, we have a probability

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
distribution and knowing sort of
where the electron is.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
We don't exactly know where the
electron is, here.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
This is the classical model on
which Bohr just kind of pasted

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
the quantization of the angular
momentum of the electron onto

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
it.
In the case of the Schrˆdinger

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
equation, the quantization drops
out when you solve the

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
differential equation.
It comes out of the equation

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
just naturally.
We did not paste it onto it.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
We did not make an ad hoc kind
of representation.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
That is the big difference here
between quantum mechanics and

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
classical mechanics.
In quantum mechanics,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
it can only tell you about a
probability.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
It cannot tell you exactly
where the particle is going to

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
be.
Questions on that?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Okay.
Anyway, this value a nought,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
that is why it is called
the Bohr radius.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And then it turns out,
quantum mechanically,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
that this value of r,
the most probable value of r

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
is, in fact, exactly a nought.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
In a sense, Bohr was pretty
lucky.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And this is kind of an accident
that he got a nought out

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
of this, and it has to do with
the actual form of the Coulomb

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
interaction.
But, of course,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
this doesn't work for anything
else, other than a hydrogen

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
atom.
Whereas, the Schrˆdinger

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
equation, as we are going to see
in a moment, is applicable to

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
all the atoms that we know
about.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
So that is the radial
probability distribution

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
function for the 1s atom,
for the 1s state.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
We want to take a look at the
radial probability distribution

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
for 2s and for 3s.
Let me plot those.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
And you can actually put these
lights on here.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
That is okay.
I am going to use this board

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
for a moment.
Here is the radial probability

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
distribution function.
I can write it as little r

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
times R(2,0) squared of r,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
or RPD.
This is for 2s versus r.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
And when I do that I get a
function that looks like this.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And, if I evaluate it here,
what is this value of r at

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
which the probability is a
maximum?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Well, this most probable value
of r is 6 a nought.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Look at that.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
The most probable value of r
for 1s was a nought.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
In the case of the 2s state

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
here, the electron,
the most probable value is 6 a

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
nought, six times as far from
the nucleus.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
If you have a hydrogen atom in
the first excited state,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
in a sense that hydrogen atom
is bigger.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
It is bigger in the sense that
the probability of you finding

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
the electron at a larger
distance away from the nucleus

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
is larger.
And that, in general,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
is the case.
The radial probability

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
distribution,
here, also reflects the radial

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
node that we talked about last
time.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
That radial node is r equals a
nought.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Radial node is the value of r
that makes your wave function go

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
to zero.
Notice, again,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
that this radial probability
distribution function right here

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
is zero at r equals 0.
This is not a node.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
This is not a radial node.
This is a consequence,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
right here, of our definition
for the radial probability.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Our volume element has gone to
zero.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
r equals 0 is never a radial
node in any wave function.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
What about 3s?
Well, let's plot 3s.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Here is 3s.
This is the radial probability

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
distribution.
I take Psi for 3s and square

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
it, multiply by 4 pi r squared
dr,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000
and do so for all the values of
r, and I am going to get

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.000
something that looks like this.
Now this most probable value of

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
r here, where the 3s wave
function is equal to 11.468 a

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
nought.
For the second excited state of

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
a hydrogen atom,
that electron,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
on the average,
is 11.5 times farther out from

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:38.000
the nucleus than it is in the
case of the 1s state right here.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Again, for that second excited
state, that hydrogen atom is

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
bigger in the sense that the
probability of it being farther

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
away from the nucleus is larger.
That radial probability

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
distribution of the 3s also
reflects the two radial nodes in

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000
the 3s wave function.
The radial nodes are at 1.9 a

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
nought, here,
and 7.1 a nought.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Again, the value here at r
equals 0 is not a radial node.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Now, as you look at this,
it is tempting to ask the

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
following question.
You might want to ask,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000
if the electron can be at these
values of r, and it can be at

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
these values of r,
and it can be at these values

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:53.000
of r, how does the electron
actually get from here to here

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000
to here if right at r equals 1.9
a nought and 7.1 a nought the

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:08.000
probability is equal to zero?
Well, you might say maybe this

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
probability isn't exactly zero.
It is something small.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
But I am telling you that it is
zero, goose egg,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
zilch, zippo,
nada, cipher,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
nix, nought.
Anybody else have another name?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Nil.
It is nothing.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
It is zero.
How do you answer that

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
question?
Well, it turns out,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
of course, that it isn't an
appropriate question.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
And the reason it is not is
because that question is asked

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
in the framework of classical
mechanics.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
When you ask,
how does a particle get from

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
one place to another,
you are asking about a

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
trajectory.
You are asking about a path.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Particles over here,
over here, over here,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
how does it get from one place
to another?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
And, in quantum mechanics,
we don't have the concept of

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
trajectories.
Instead, what we have to think

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
of is the electron as a wave.
And we already know that a wave

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
can have amplitude
simultaneously at many different

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
positions.
And so it has simultaneous

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
amplitude or probability here,
here, and here,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
all at the same time.
We cannot talk about

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
trajectories anymore.
And that, again,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
ties into the uncertainty
principle, our inability to know

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
exactly the position and the
momentum of a particle at any

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
given instance.
The best we can tell you is a

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
probability.
We have to change the way we

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
think about electrons.
You cannot cast them in the

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
framework of your everyday
world.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
This is part of our world,
but you have to go do a

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000
specific type of experiment to
see this part of the world.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
That is why it seems so strange
to you, because it is not part

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
of your everyday experience.
But this world works with

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
different rules that you really
do have to accept that it just

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
works differently.
Questions?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Now, I am going to stop talking
about the s wave functions and

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
move on to talk about the p wave
functions.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
With the s wave functions,
we talked about the

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
significance of the wave
function, probability density,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
radial probability
distribution.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
We talked about what a radial
node was.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Now it is time to move onto the
p wave functions.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
And the p wave functions,
of course, are not spherically

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
symmetric.
And to represent them,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
we are going to do our dot
density diagram again.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000
We are going to take the wave
function and square it to get

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
the probability density and then
plot that probability density as

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
a density of dots.
We the dots are most dense,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
well, that means the highest
probability density.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Here is the result for the pz
wave function.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
It is pz because you can see
the highest probability,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
here, is along the z-axis.
It is symmetric along the

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
z-axis.
Here is the probability density

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
for the px wave function.
You can see that the

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
probability density is greatest
along the x-axis.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
It is symmetric along the
x-axis.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
And, if you look really
carefully, you can see that

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
there is no probability density
in the y,z-plane for the px wave

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
function.
And, over here,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
if you look carefully,
you can see that there is no

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
probability density in the
x,y-plane for the pz wave

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
function.
And here is a py wave function,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
the probability density of it.
The probability density is

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
concentrated along the y-axis.
It is symmetric along the

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
y-axis.
And, if you look very

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
carefully, there is no
probability density,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
here, in the x,z-plane.
Well, the fact that there is no

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
probability density,
here, in the x,y-plane,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
in the case of pz,
indicates that we have an

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
angular node.
An angular node at theta equal

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
90 degrees.
An angular node is the same

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
thing as a radial node in the
sense that it is the value of

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
the angle that makes the wave
function be equal to zero.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Here is the wave function for
pz.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
You can see that when theta is
equal to zero,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
this wave function is going to
be equal to zero.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
An angular node is the value of
theta or phi that makes the wave

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
function be zero.
And the consequence,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000
then, is that we have a nodal
plane, because everywhere on the

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
x,y-plane, theta is equal to 90
degrees.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
For the px wave function,
the value of the angle that

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000
gives you that nodal plane is
phi equals 90.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000
That means everywhere in the
y,z-plane is phi equal to 90.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
In the case of py,
when phi is equal to zero,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
well, that is everywhere in the
x,z-plane.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Everywhere in the x,z-plane,
phi is equal to zero.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.000
So, that is the angular nodes.
In general, and this is

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
something you do have to know,
an orbital has n minus 1

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
total nodes.
And what I mean by total nodes

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
is angular plus radial nodes.
The number of angular nodes is

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
given by this quantity,
l.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
The quantum number l that
labels your wave function always

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
gives you the number of angular
nodes.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Therefore, if n minus 1 is the
total and l is the number of

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
angular, well then,
the number of radial nodes is n

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
minus 1 minus l. This is

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
something that you do have to
know.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
If I give you a wave function
and ask you how many radial and

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
angular nodes it has,
you need to be able to

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
calculate that,
and vice versa.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Sometimes I will tell you a
function has three radial nodes

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
and six or seven angular nodes
or something,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
what is the wave function?
So, we go both ways.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Well, I also want to take a
look at the radial probability

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
distribution functions for the p
wave functions.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.000
We looked at it for the s wave
functions already.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
I actually want to contrast the
radial probability distribution,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
say, for 2p,
here it is, with that of 2s

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
that we looked at a moment ago.
Remember, how do you get the

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
radial probability distribution
function here for 2p?

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
It is the radial part of the 2p
wave function times r squared

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
dr.
It gives me the probability of

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:05.000
finding the electron a distance
between r and r plus dr.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Again, what you see is that at
r equals 0, that is zero.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
That is not a radial node.
But what I really want to point

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
out here is that the most
probable value of r,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
for the 2p wave function,
is actually smaller than it is

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
for the 2s wave function.
That is, it is more likely for

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000
the electron in a 2p state to be
a little closer in to the

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
nucleus than it is for the 2s
state.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
In general, as you increase the
angular momentum quantum number,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
the most probable value of r
gets smaller for the same value

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
of n.
Similarly, here is the 3s

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:01.000
radial probability distribution
function that we looked at.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Here is a radial probability
distribution for 3p.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Now, with the 3p,
you can see the value of the

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
radial node.
You can see the radial

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
probability distribution
reflects a radial node,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
here.
And here is the radial

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
probability distribution
function for 3d.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
We did not look at the
probability density of 3d.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
You will do that with Professor
Cummins when you talk about

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
transition metals.
But here, I just drew in the

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
radial probability distribution
for 3d.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
But the point again that I want
to make is here is the most

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
probable value of r for 3s,
here it is for 3p,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
here it is for 3d,
again, the most probable value

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
for 3d is smaller than it is for
3p, than it is for 3s.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Again, as you increase the
angular momentum quantum number,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
that most probable value gets
smaller.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
However, ironically,
if you actually look at the

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
probability of the electron
being very, very close to the

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000
nucleus, that probability is
only significant for the s wave

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
functions.
Look at the 3s wave function.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Here, you see that you really
do have some probability very

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
close to the nucleus.
You don't see that in the 3p

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
wave function.
You certainly don't see that in

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
the 3d wave function.
Again, in the 2s wave function,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
you have some significant
probability of the electron

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
being really close to the
nucleus in 2s,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
but you don't in 2p.
That is important.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
And it seems in contradiction
to the fact that on the average,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
the most probable value of r
gets smaller as l gets larger.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
These two facts that look
contradictory are important.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
They dictate the behavior of
atoms.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
These two facts seem like kind
of loose threads at the moment

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
in the sense that you are
probably wondering why I am

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
telling you what I am telling
you.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
But we are going to use that
information in a few days,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
and you will see really the
significance of this plot.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
And this plot will be an
important one for you to refer

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
back to.
Yes?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Probably.
I am not exactly sure of the

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
picture you drew in high school,
but yes.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
If the electron in general is
further out from the nucleus,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
that is a higher energy state.
The electron is less strongly

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
bound, as we are going to see in
the multi-electron atoms here.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Oh, no.
For the hydrogen no.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Let me explain that.
For the hydrogen atom,

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000
the energies are only dictated
by the n quantum number,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
so 3s, 3p, 3d all have the same
energies.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Where the energies become
degenerate is with a

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000
multi-electron atom.
And we are going to talk about

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000
that and how that reflects here,
these wave functions in the

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
next day.
That is all I am going to say

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
about the hydrogen atom.
Now it is time to move on,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
to helium.
And, of course,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
the Schrˆdinger equation
predicts the binding energies of

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:39.000
the electrons to the nucleus in
a helium atom also very well.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
But, of course,
it is a much more complicated

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Schrˆdinger equation.
And I am not even going to

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
write out the Hamiltonian in
this case, but I want to show

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
you the wave function here.
See the wave function?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
The wave function is a function
of six variables.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
It is a function of two r's,
two distances from the nucleus,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
one for electron one,
one for electron two,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
two theta's and two phi's.
We have six variables for the

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
wave function.
And the consequence of this is

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
that our solutions for the
binding energies for the

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000
electrons in helium or any other
atoms are not going to be nice

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
analytical forms.
We are no longer going to have

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
e sub n equal minus the Rydberg
constant over n squared.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
If you
actually solve for those

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
energies, and you have to do it
numerically, you are just going

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
to get a list of numbers,
a table of numbers,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
but not a nice analytical form.
If you solve for the wave

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
function, you are not going to
get a nice analytical form,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000
like we got for hydrogen.
Instead, what you will get is a

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
value for the amplitude of Psi
as a function of r,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
theta and phi.
But if you get actually much

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
above three electrons,
it turns out that even

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
numerically, you cannot solve
the Schrˆdinger equation,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
exactly.
You have to use approximations.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:30.000
And we are going to look at the
most basic approximation that is

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
used that works,
amazingly.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
It works well enough for us to
have a framework in which to

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
understand the reactions of
these atoms.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
And what is that approximation?
Well, that approximation is

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
called the one-electron wave
approximation or the

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
one-electron orbital
approximation.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
What does that mean?
Well, that means this.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
I am going to take my wave
function here for the helium

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
atom, which strictly is a wave
function that is a function of

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
six variables,
and I am going to separate it.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I am going to let electron one
have its own wave function and

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
electron two have its own wave
function.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
That is an approximation.
In addition,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
what I am going to do is let
the wave function for electron

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
one have a hydrogen-like wave
function.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
I am going to say that it has
the 1s wave function,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000
or the Psi(1,
0, 0) wave function of a

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
hydrogen atom.
And I am going to let electron

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
two have the Psi(1,
0, 0) wave function of a

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
hydrogen atom.
Or, I am going to write it as

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
1s of 1, for electron one,
times 1s of 2,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
for electron two.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Or, another shorthand,
I am going to write it as 1s.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
squared.
And, if I continued on,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
here, it is for lithium.
Lithium, the wave function

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
strictly has nine coordinates,
but I am going to let every one

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
of those electrons,
in the one electron wave

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
approximation,
have its own wave function.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
And I am going to let electron
one have a wave function that

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
looks like a hydrogen atom
wavefunction.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
The 1s wave function.
The same thing with electron

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
two.
And then I am going to let

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
electron three have the 2s wave
function of the hydrogen atom.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
And in simplified notation,
that is just 1s squared 2s.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
And here is
beryllium, 16 variables,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
but I am going to let every
electron have its own wave

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
function.
And I am going to give electron

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
one the 1s wave function,
electron two,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
the 1s, electron three,
the 2s, electron four,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
the 2s.
I can also write that,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
as you have already done,
1s 2 2s 2.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
And I can keep going.
And these electron

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
configurations that you have
been writing down in high

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
school, that is what they are,
electron configurations,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
well, they are nothing more
than our shorthand notation for

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
the electron wave functions
within this one-electron wave

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
approximation.
That is what those were,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
that you were writing down.
Those were a shorthand notation

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
for the wave functions in
Schrˆdinger's equation within

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
this one-electron wave
approximation.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Now, one thing you do notice is
that I did not,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000
in the case of boron here,
let all five electrons be in

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
the 1s state,
or let all five electrons be

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
represented by a 1s hydrogen
atom wave function.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
I didn't because of a quantity
that you already know about,

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
called spin.
You already know that if you

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
are going to put electrons in
the 1s state here that one

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000
electron has to go in with spin
up and the other spin down.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
And the 2s, spin up and spin
down, etc.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
What is the phenomenon called
spin?

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Well, spin is entirely a
quantum mechanical phenomenon.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000
There is no correct classical
analogy to spin.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Spin is intrinsic angular
momentum.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:00.000
It is angular momentum that is
just part of a particle,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:07.000
such as an electron.
The spin quantum numbers

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
actually come from solving the
relativistic Schrˆdinger

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
equation, which we did not even
write down.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
When you solve the relativistic
Schrˆdinger equation,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
out drops a fourth quantum
number.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
That fourth quantum number we
are going to call m sub s.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
And we find that m sub s

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
has two allowed values.
One of those values is one-half

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
and the other is minus one-half.
Here, we have a case where the

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
quantum number is not an
integer.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
It is one-half and it is minus
one-half.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Now, if it helps you to think
about the electron spinning

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
around its own axis,
like I depict here,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
well, if that is the case,
then the angular momentum

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
quantum number is perpendicular,
here ,to this plane in which it

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000
is rotating.
And you might want to call that

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
spin up.
And, of course,

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
if it is spinning in the other
direction, well,

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
then the angular momentum
vector is pointed in the

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
opposite direction.
You might want to call this

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
spin down.
If it helps for you to think

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
about this, okay,
but remember that this is not

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
correct.
This is a classical analogy

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
that we are trying to draw here.
We are trying to say that this

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
electron is rotating around its
own axis.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
That is not true.
This angular momentum is just

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
an intrinsic part,
the intrinsic nature of a

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
particular such as an electron.
Next time, I will tell you

00:49:52.099 --> 00:49:55.000
about Uhlenbeck and Goudsmith.
See you Wednesday.
