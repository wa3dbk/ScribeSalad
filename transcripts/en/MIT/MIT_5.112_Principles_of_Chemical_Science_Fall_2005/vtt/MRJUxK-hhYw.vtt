00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Last time we were talking about
the general interactions that

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
are present in a chemical bond.
And we were,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in particular,
looking at the energy of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
interaction, here,
as we brought two hydrogen

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
atoms together.
We were looking at that energy

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of interaction as a function of
the distance r between these two

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
nuclei.
And we saw, of course,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
way out here,
that the energy of interaction

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
was minus 2,624 kilojoules per
mole.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
As we brought the two hydrogen
atoms in closer together,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that interaction energy went
down.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It became a maximum negative
value at some r.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
That r is the equilibrium bond
length.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And then, as you try to push
the two nuclei closer together,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the energy of interaction goes
up again, so far up that when

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
you get them really close,
the energy of interaction is

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
greater than that of the two
separated hydrogen atoms.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And so, in this region,
the hydrogen atoms are no

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
longer bound.
Wherever this energy is lower

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
than that of the separated
hydrogen atom limit you have a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
bound molecule.
This was the attractive part of

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the potential.
This was the well depth or the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
bond association energy,
measured from here to here.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That is how much energy you
would have to put in to pull the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
two hydrogens apart.
This is the repulsive region of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that interaction potential.
We were talking about how that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
curve, that energy,
was really the sum of three

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
components.
That energy of interaction was

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the sum of the nuclear-nuclear
repulsion.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
That is, the repulsion between
the nucleus of this hydrogen and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the nucleus of that hydrogen.
In addition to that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
nuclear-nuclear repulsion,
there is the electron-nuclear

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
attraction.
The electron-nuclear

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
attraction, between the electron
on the original nucleus and,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
when the two hydrogens get
close enough,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the electron attraction between
the other nucleus.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And then, finally,
there is the electron-electron

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
repulsion.
When these two hydrogen atoms

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
come so close,
the electrons now are going to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
repel.
And so, this curve is actually

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
the sum of those three
contributions.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And what we were trying to do
last time is to look at the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
dependence of these
interactions,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
individually,
on r.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And then we wanted to sum them
up to see why we actually have

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the shape of this interaction
potential that we do.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We are trying to decompose
this.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
We are trying to understand
over what regions of r,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
which one of these interaction
energies is dominant.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
That is what we are doing.
And I think last time we

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
started in the sense that we
recognized what the r dependence

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
was for the nuclear-nuclear
repulsion.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
The nuclear-nuclear repulsion
is just the Coulomb interaction

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
energy between two like positive
charges.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
That nuclear-nuclear repulsion
was e squared over 4 pi epsilon

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
nought times r.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And so that component I could
easily draw.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And I did draw it last time,
I think.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
This is one over r
dependence.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
This is the e squared over 4 pi
epsilon nought r.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
That was one of them.
Now, next, these two terms are

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
what I am going to call the
electron interactions because

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
both of them involve the
electron.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
This one did not.
This was just the nucleus.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
It turns out that I don't have
a nice simple way to tell you

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
what the r dependence between
the nuclei will be for the

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
electron-nuclear attraction,
nor do I have a nice simple way

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
to figure out what the r
dependence will be for the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
electron-electron repulsion.
I cannot do that without

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
actually solving the Schrˆdinger
equation.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I don't have a simple way to
break that down.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
However, what I can do is I can
estimate what the sum of these

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
electron interactions are at two
extremes.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Is this noisy?
Can you hear me?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I can see why it is noisy.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I do know what it is at two
extremes.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I know what those sums of those
interactions are for very large

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
r, and I know what it is for r
equals 0.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
What I am going to do is
calculate it for r equals

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
infinity and r equals 0.
And I am going to then put it

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
on this plot.
And then to just estimate what

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
the r dependence is,
I am going to draw a line from

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that point to that point.
That is the best I can do.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Let's do that.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Let me start with this energy
of interaction at r equals

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
infinity.
I want to evaluate what the

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
repulsive interaction is between
the electrons at r equals

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
infinity.
What is that interaction

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
energy?
It is zero because the

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
electrons are so far apart at r
equals infinity that there is no

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
interaction energy.
It is the repulsive

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
interaction.
It is this kind of interaction,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
r equals infinity.
That is going to be zero.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
But now this term,
this electron-nuclear

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
attraction.
When the two hydrogen atoms

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
here are very far apart,
what is the energy of the

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
electron-nuclear attraction
there?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I cannot hear you,
so I will tell you.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It is the binding energy of a
1s electron.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I mean that is the energy of
interaction.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
When r is very large,
when r is infinity,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the energy of interaction is
just the 1s binding energy of

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the electron to each of its
nuclei.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
The energy of interaction,
the electron-nuclear attraction

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
is just E sub 1s for
this one.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And e sub 1s for that
one.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
In a hydrogen atom that is what
it is.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It is the electron-nuclear
attraction.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And so, right here,
this is equal to 2 times E sub

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
1s.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Now, you know that E sub 1s
is equal to minus

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
2.18x10^-18 joules,
but in kilojoules per mole,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
that is equal to minus 1
kilojoules per mole.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And, if we have two of them,
as we do, 2 times E sub 1s

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
is minus 2
kilojoules per mole.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I calculated what the electron

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
interaction energy is at r is
equal to infinity.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
That is way out here.
This is hydrogen plus hydrogen.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000
This is minus 2,624,
the same number I got over

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
there.
Now, what we have to do --

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
-- is calculate what that
energy of interaction is at r is

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
equal to 0.
When r is equal to 0,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
we have two hydrogen atoms
right on top of each other.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
We have two hydrogen nuclei
right on top of each other.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
That means, in our kind of
thought experiment here,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
that the charge on the nucleus
is Z equals 2.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
That means when the two
hydrogen atoms are right on top

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
of each other,
it looks like we have a helium

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
nucleus.
And there is electron number

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
one around it and electron
number two around it.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
That looks like a helium atom.
What is the total electron

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
interaction in the case of a
helium atom?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
What is the total energy of
interaction there?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Well, the total energy of
interaction is going to be minus

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
the first ionization energy,
this is going to be the energy

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000
of interaction of the helium,
for a helium atom.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Because minus the first
ionization energy of the helium

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000
atom is the binding energy of
the first electron to the helium

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
plus minus the second ionization
energy of the helium atom.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
In other words,
if I hid this one away,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
then the electron-nuclear
attraction between the helium

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
nucleus in electron two is just
minus the second ionization

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
energy of helium.
Does that make sense?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You are too hot to think.
Okay.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
That is what that is.
And if you look them up,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000
the total energy of interaction
is minus 7,622 kilojoules per

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
mole.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I can plot that on this graph
at r equals 0.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I have minus 7,622 kilojoules.
Now, I have two points.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I have a point over here and a
point over there.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I am going to draw a straight
line between the two.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
To get my total energy of
interaction, I am going to add

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
this curve to that curve.
And when I do that,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000
we are going to get something
that looks like that.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:52.000
The bottom line is that this
shape here is determined by the

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
competition between the electron
interactions,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000
which are always attractive.
They are always negative.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
The electron interactions are
actually the sum of an

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
attractive term and a repulsive
term, but the repulsive term is

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
not so repulsive as to overcome
the attractive term.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
It is always negative.
Overall, the sum is still

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
attractive.
The electron interactions are

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
attractive.
This particular curve is the

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
competition between the electron
interactions,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
those attractive interactions
and the nuclear interactions,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
which are repulsive.
In other words,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
you have to get the two
hydrogen atoms close enough in

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
order for the attractive
interactions to take hold.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
But you cannot get them so
close because if you get them

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
too close, the nuclear-nuclear
repulsions set in.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Where your chemical bond length
is, is determined by that

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
competition between the electron
attractive interactions and

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
those nuclear-nuclear
repulsions.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
That is what determines the
bond length.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
That is fundamentally,
here, what determines the bond

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
strength, the competition
between these overall attractive

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
interactions due to the
electrons and the

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
nuclear-nuclear repulsion.
That was the concept,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
really, that I wanted to get
across here, those fundamental

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
interactions that make up this
kind of curve.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
You are going to see this curve
a lot.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
All chemical bonds have this
kind of dependence on r,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000
energy of interaction on r.
There is one other point I want

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
to make.
That is that what we often and

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
usually do is we reset our zero
of energy.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Another words,
we are going to reset our zero

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
of energy, here,
so that the zero of energy

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
corresponds to the separated
atom limit.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Why do we do that?
Well, because this energy

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
difference, the minus 2,624,
was really the attractive

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
interaction between the electron
and its nucleus.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
It did not have anything to do
with the attraction or repulsion

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
between the two atoms.
And so, when we want to talk

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
only about the chemical bond and
the energy changes when we make

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
a chemical bond,
it is often useful to shift our

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
zero of energy down,
so that the separated atom

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
limit is our zero of energy.
And now, everything that is

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
negative relative to that is a
bound interaction.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
When it gets too close,
it will be a positive

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
interaction and the atoms are no
longer bound.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I mean, we are not forgetting
about this energy here.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
We know if you are calculating
the total energy,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
it has to be there,
but oftentimes we just want to

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
talk about the relative changes
of the energy of interaction as

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
a function of r when we are
concerned only with forming a

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
bond.
Make sense?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Okay.
That is the general phenomenon.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Now, what I want to talk about
is one very simple model for an

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
ionic bond.
This is a classical model.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And the amazing thing about it
is that this simple classical

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.000
model does give us insight into
the mechanism by which this bond

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
is formed.
It is a mechanism that is only

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000
going to work when you form a
very ionic bond.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
This is particular for a very
ionic bond.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.000
We want to take a look at this
mechanism because it is going to

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000
give us some insight into how
the bond is actually formed.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
We are going to look at the
formation of sodium chloride,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
here.
We have a sodium atom and a

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
chlorine atom,
and they are coming together,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
moving toward each other.
What happens is that at a

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
certain distance from each
other, the sodium atom,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
believe it or not,
actually ejects an electron.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And that electron hooks onto
the chlorine.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
When it does that,
of course the chlorine now

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
becomes bigger than the sodium,
but now we have two charges

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
separated.
A positive and a negative ion.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And there is a large attractive
interaction between those two.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
What happens is these two ions
are attracted in to each other.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
They are just roped right in.
It is called the Harpoon

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Mechanism.
Why does the sodium and the

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
chlorine just pull right into
each other?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Well, because of that rope.
That rope is that Coulomb

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
interaction.
This really happens.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
At some distance the sodium
atom ejects that electron,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
and then that sodium just pulls
that chlorine right into it

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
until it gets close enough to
form a chemical bond,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
--
and you have sodium chloride.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
This is a reaction mechanism
that was elucidated many years

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
ago, called the harpoon
mechanicism.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
It is a mechanics elucidated by
Dudley Herschbach,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
who is here at Harvard in the
Chemistry Department,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
who has since retired.
John Polanyi,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
who is at Toronto,
and Yuan Lee,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
who was at Berkeley,
for most of his career.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
They received the Nobel Prize
for this discovery of this

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
mechanism, and many other kinds
of mechanism and dynamics of

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
chemical reactions.
Yuan Lee right here,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
this gentleman was actually my
Ph.D.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
thesis supervisor at Berkeley.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
This is a simple picture,
and this is exactly what is

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
going on.
This seems a little strange to

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
you, so let's try to understand
exactly how this is working.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
To understand this,
what we are going to have to do

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
is look at the energetics of the
system.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And now I am going to raise
this screen here,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
I think.
No, I don't want to.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
I am going to raise it a little
bit.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
How is that?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
All right.
What we are seeing is this gas

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
phase sodium atom ejecting an
electron to form this gas phase

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
sodium ion, plus this electron.
And of course,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000
that is going to cost energy.
The energy change is the

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
ionization energy,
which for sodium is

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
kilojoules per mole.
But, at the same time,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
that electron is being caught
by the chlorine.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And when a chlorine and an
electron recombine to form the

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Cl minus gas phase,
there is an energy

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
release, as we saw.
That energy release is minus

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
the electron affinity of
chlorine.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
That is equal to minus
kilojoules per mole.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Overall, going from a gas phase

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
sodium atom plus a
gas phase chlorine atom

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
to a gas phase sodium ion
and a gas phase

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
chlorine ion,
the overall energy change here,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
which is now the ionization
energy minus the electron

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
affinity, that overal energy
change is 147 kilojoules per

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
mole.
Although we get some energy

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
back when that electron attaches
to the chlorine,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
we don't get enough energy back
to compensate for having to pull

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
the electron off of the sodium.
Right now, this still looks

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
like an overall endothermic
reaction.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.000
We have to put 147 kilojoules
into the system to make it go.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
It is beginning to seem a
little peculiar.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
How does this work?
Well, we have to remember that

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
once we make that sodium plus
and the chlorine minus,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
that there is that Coulomb
interaction.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
The Coulomb interaction,
bringing the sodium ion plus

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
the chlorine ion together to
make the sodium chloride,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
that delta E,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
if I take two ions,
sodium and chlorine,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
in from infinity and bring them
together at the bond length,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
that energy change is minus
kilojoules per mole.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
If I add up all three reactions
to get sodium gas plus chlorine

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
gas to make sodium chloride in
the gas phase,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
the overall energy change there

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
is minus 445 kilojoules per
mole.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
And, of course,
the reaction is downhill.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
But that still doesn't give you
a really good feeling for what

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
is really going on here.
To do that, let's look at an

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
energy level diagram.
You want to kill the front

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
lights.
This is going to be back and

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
forth here.
All right.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
What have I draw here?
I have drawn the energy of

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
interaction between a sodium
atom and a chlorine atom,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
just like I did for hydrogen.
I said all chemical bonds have

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
this same shape of energy of
interaction.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Here is the bond length.
2.36 angstroms.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Here is the well depth or the
dissociation energy.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
In this case,
I show it measured from here to

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
there.
It is minus delta E sub d,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
minus 445.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Here I set the zero of energy
at the separated atom limit,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
sodium plus chlorine.
When sodium and chlorine are

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
way out here,
when r is really large,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
we saw that it is going to take
147 kilojoules to make a sodium

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
ion from sodium and a chlorine
ion from chlorine.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
That is what I calculated,
right here.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
If the two are far apart,
if you pull an electron off a

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
sodium and put it onto chlorine,
it is still going to require

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:03.000
energy, 147 kilojoules per mole.
However, I also said that when

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
the sodium and the chlorine come
close enough,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.000
the ions are pulled in close
enough such that they can form a

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
chemical bond,
the energy you get back is

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
kilojoules per mole.
On this diagram,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
where is that?
Well, that is this energy.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
From up here to down there is
592 kilojoules per mole.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Where did I get that number,
592 kilojoules per mole?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Well, I calculated it using the
Coulomb potential energy of

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000
interaction, which I am calling,
here, U of r sub E

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
at this value of r.
The Coulomb potential energy of

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
interaction is right here for a
point charge.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
If you treat the sodium as a
plus one charge and you treat

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
the chlorine as a minus one
charge.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
All of a sudden,
we are forgetting everything

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
about the other electrons.
We are just treating sodium ion

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
and chlorine ion as two point
charges.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
If you forget completely about
the other electrons and just

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
treat them as point charges,
that is the interaction energy

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
right here.
That 592 comes from taking that

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
expression and plugging in 2.36
angstroms.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
That is how much energy you get
back.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Now we understand the energies
a little bit,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000
but we still don't understand
exactly how this electron jump

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000
process is happening.
Because the way I have it

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000
drawn, here, it still looks like
we have an electron jumping from

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
sodium to chlorine way out here.
And we have to put in

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
kilojoules before we get any
energy back.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Well, that is not the case.
And that is not the case

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
because of this.
This blue curve,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
here, is just the Coulomb
energy of interaction.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
We evaluated that point,
that number,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
from here to here using this
expression.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
But you know that this is a
minus one over r

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
dependence.
If you are way up here and you

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
treat this as a zero of energy
for a plus charge and a minus

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
charge, one over r kind of looks
like this.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
That is the blue curve.
But you also notice that right

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.000
here, you see that that Coulomb
interaction is intersecting with

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:24.000
this interaction potential
between a neutral sodium atom

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000
and a neutral chlorine atom,
right in there.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Right at this value of r,
which we are going to call r

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000
star, the potential energy of
interaction from here to here is

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000
equal to the sum of this
ionization energy minus the

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
electron affinity.
Right here, the electron can

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:03.000
jump without having to put any
energy into the system.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
You are close enough for the
electron to jump because that

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Coulomb interaction has gotten
lower, and it is right at that

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
point when you can have that
electron transfer and not have

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
to put any energy into the
system to get it to go.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
In other words,
right here, the energy from

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
right there to this point is
minus e squared 4 pi epsilon

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000
nought r star.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
That energy right at that point
is equal to, if I am measuring

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
here from the top minus the
quantity ionization energy of

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
sodium minus the electron
affinity of chlorine.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
In order to solve for this

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
distance r at which the electron
jumps, for which that electron

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
jump is energetically allowed,
I am going to set this equal to

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
this.
I know what the ionization

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
energy and the electron affinity
of sodium and chlorine are.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
I know everything except r star,
so I am going to solve

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
for r star.
Let's do that.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
I am going to need the lights,
here.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
If I rearrange that equation,
r star is equal to e squared

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
over 4 pi epsilon nought times
the ionization energy of sodium

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
minus the electron affinity of
chlorine.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
I know

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
what e star is.
It is 1.602x10^-19 Coulomb's

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
squared.
I have a 4 pi epsilon nought.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
I know what epsilon nought is.
And then, the difference

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000
between the ionization energy
and the electron affinity I

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000
calculated over there.
That is 147 kilojoules per mole

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:35.000
or 1.47x10^5 joules per mole.
But now, and this is what

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000
everybody forgets on an exam,
I have to calculate r star per

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.000
molecule, not per mole because
per mole does not make sense.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And I have this energy written
here per mole,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:03.000
so I need an Avogadro's number
up here, 6.022x10^23 per mole.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Don't forget Avogadro's number
when you calculate r.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000
What is r star?
Well, it comes out to be

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:26.000
9.45x10^-10 meters.
Let's get a perspective on

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:34.000
these distances.
The sodium atom diameter is 3.8

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
angstroms.
Chlorine atom diameter,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
2 angstroms.
What I am saying is that this

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
electron can jump,
or does jump from sodium to

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:59.000
chlorine at this distance r
star, which is equal to 9.45

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
angstroms.
So, the sodium and the chlorine

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
really are a considerable
distance apart when that

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
electron jumps.
But that electron can jump

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
because it is at that point that
the Coulomb interaction is large

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.000
enough here to compensate for
the difference in the ionization

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
energy and the electron
affinity.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
And this actual number,
here, was verified in these

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
experiments by Herschbach and
Lee.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
It actually does happen.
And this very simple classical

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
model, where we are actually
treating the sodium and the

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
chlorine as point charges,
we have forgotten everything

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
else about the electrons,
that works remarkably well.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Now, what this model does not
give you very well is the bond

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
energy.
Because, if you look at this

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
diagram again right in here,
let me go back on here,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
this 147 kilojoules here,
that I can look up.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
This 592 kilojoules,
that is just the Coulomb

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.000
interaction between a positive
and a negative charge at 2.36

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
eV.
That is all that is.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
You can calculate that.
And so, therefore,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
if I want to calculate the bond
energy of sodium chloride,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
the bond energy is just the
difference between this energy

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
and that energy,
and that is 435 kilojoules per

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
mole.
Well, that does not come out so

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
well in terms of the actual bond
energy.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
The actual bond energy is
kilojoules per mole.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
And we know why that did not
come out too well.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.000
That is because this depends on
all of the interactions that are

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
much closer into the nucleus.
By the time you get down here,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
the repulsive interactions are
present.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
The nuclear-nuclear repulsions
are present.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
And, in our simple model,
we did not take that into

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
account, the nuclear-nuclear
repulsions.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
This simple model worked to get
r star because r star is further

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
out.
The nuclear-nuclear repulsions

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
have not really set in yet.
Therefore, the simple model

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
works when you are at a far
distance, when r is large.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
But to get the bond strength,
here, you are much closer in.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
You are at 2.36 angstroms.
That is the difference in

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
energy from here to there.
We forgot about the repulsive

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
interactions between the two
nuclei, so the model is not

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
going to work so close to the
nucleus, but it does a really

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
good job of getting r star far
away from the nucleus.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Again, this simple model only
works for very ionic compounds,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
very ionic bonds like sodium
chloride.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000
It won't work very well for
hydrogen chloride,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
for example.
Questions on that?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Yes?

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
We are going to deal with
entropy and Gibbs free energy

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
changes in a week or two.
Right now, what I am writing

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
here are energy changes.
I am actually dealing with

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
single molecules.
I might have,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
in my mind, here,
energies per mole.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
But what I am thinking about is
not an ensemble of molecules.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
I am actually thinking about
what is happening in each

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
individual single molecule
interaction.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
That is why I have not talked
about delta G here at all.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
And, in the field of chemical
dynamics, that is where we want

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000
to look at individual events as
opposed to a Boltzmann average

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
of events.
That is what I am talking about

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
right here, but we are going to
talk about collections of

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
molecules and the energy
changes.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000
I am going to change my
definition from delta E to delta

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000
H, the bond enthalpy,
in a couple of days or so.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Other questions?
Okay.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Well, there is one other just
rather brief topic that I wanted

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
to talk about.
That is, measuring dipole

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
moments.
And then, from the dipole

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
moments, getting out some ionic
character to a chemical bond.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Your book actually calls ionic
bonds polar covalent bonds.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
And that is fine because even a
very ionic bond like sodium

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
chloride is not completely
ionic, in the sense that when it

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
is the molecule you know that it
is not a point charge on sodium

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
and a point charge on chlorine.
You have an electron

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
distribution when you are that
close.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000
And so, what you have in an
ionic bond or a polar covalent

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
bond, here, is an asymmetric
charge distribution.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
In HCl, here,
you have both electrons,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
on the average,
being closer to the chlorine

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000
nucleus than to the hydrogen
nucleus.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
And you have that because you
have a bond between atoms with

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
two very different
electronegativities.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
So, that is a polar covalent
bond.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Now, what we are going to do is
we are going to use this symbol

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
delta here as a measure of the
amount of electron transfer.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Delta is the fraction of a full
charge that is asymmetrically

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
distributed.
This plus delta,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
this delta that was on the
hydrogen, is now on the

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
chlorine.
That is the interpretation of

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
that symbol.
That asymmetric charge

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
distribution leads to a dipole
moment, which is defined as q,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
where q is the magnitude of the
charge separation,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
times r, where r is that charge
separation.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
It is, strictly speaking,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
a vector.
Q times R is what we define as

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
a dipole moment.
The units of dipole moment is

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Coulombs times meters.
You can see that from Q times

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
R.
A dipole moment is also a

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
vector.
I have the vector on this slide

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000
going from the positively
charged end to the negatively

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
charged end.
That is the way your present

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
book does it.
In your notes,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
I have it reversed.
I have it reversed because the

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
last time I taught this,
I was using a book that used a

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
different notation and I sent it
out for Xeroxing before I

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
noticed it was different.
So, change it around.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Not that it is every going to
make any difference,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
but your book has this
convention from positive to

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
negative.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
This unit, though,
of a Coulomb meter,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
is a very large unit,
an inconvenient unit,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
so we have another unit.
It is called the Debye,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
named after Peter Debye who
first studied these polar

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
covalent molecules.
And a Debye,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
here, is defined as the
following.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
It is defined as if you have a
full unit charge,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
not a delta,
moved from here to here,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000
and the charge is separated by
0.208 angstroms,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
that defines this unit called
the Debye.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
So, there are 0.208 angstroms
per Debye.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
If you knew the fraction of
charge that is separated and you

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
knew the bond length in
angstroms, and then you have our

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
definition for a Debye,
which is 0.208 angstroms per

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Debye, you could calculate the
dipole moment in Debye.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Usually what we do is not to
calculate the dipole moment.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
We usually measure the dipole
moment and calculate the partial

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000
charge distribution.
Because we usually don't know

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
this.
We can measure that.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
We can measure the dipole
moments in kind of a capacitor

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
arrangement, where we have some
molecules that have a dipole

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
moment, a positive charge on one
plate, a negative charge on the

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
other.
And, when you do that,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
of course, these electric
dipoles are going to align.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
That is going to change the
capacitance.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
If this capacitor is part of a
resonant circuit,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
it is going to change the
resonant frequent.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
The resonant frequency is
related to the dipole moment.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
And, in that way,
you calculate or measure the

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
dipole moment.
That is how it was originally

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
done.
However, you can now measure

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
dipole moments very accurately
by rotational spectroscopy.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000
And we are going to look at
that in a few lectures or so.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
But take HCl right here.
Here is HCl.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Here is the measured dipole
moment, and here is the bond

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
length.
We can use these two pieces of

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000
information to calculate the
fraction of charge distributed.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
And, in the case of HCl,
that is about 0.18.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Sometimes, we refer to this in
a percentage.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
So, this would be 18% of a
charge separation.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Sometimes we say 18% ionic
character in HCl.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.000
That compares to something like
70% or 80% in sodium chloride or

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
lithium chloride.
So, HCl is not anywhere near as

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
ionic.
The charge distribution is not

as asymmetric as it is in sodium

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Thank you very much for hanging
in here today.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
It has been hot.
Have a nice cool weekend.
