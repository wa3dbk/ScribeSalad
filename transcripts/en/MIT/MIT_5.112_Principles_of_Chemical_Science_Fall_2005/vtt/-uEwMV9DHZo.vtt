00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I am going to start now by
telling you a little bit more

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
about Lewis theory.
Last time we went through

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
aspects of the cube theory of
Lewis and showed how that could

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
account for single bonds and
double bonds,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but not triple bonds.
And that when that was

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
superseded by the electron pair
theory, the idea being that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
these electron pairs would,
in fact, be oriented at the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
vertices of a tetrahedron.
And I showed you that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
tetrahedron, as described in a
cube last time,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that you could then account for
triple bonds.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And, if you looked at the
notes, you also saw that certain

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
aspects of the dynamic behavior
of certain bond types,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
rotation around single bonds,
hindered restricted rotation

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
around double bonds,
and so forth.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Those were accounted for by
this electron pair theory in

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
which the four pairs of
electrons were oriented at these

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
vertices of a tetrahedron.
So, that was another quite

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
important triumph of that part
of Lewis's theory.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And the problem was,
although that electron pair

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
theory initially put forward by
Lewis was so successful at

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
accounting for the properties of
many different kinds of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
molecules and was a good
description of their electronic

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
structure, there was one class
of molecules,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
a very important class of
molecules, namely those known as

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
aromatic.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And the most important member
of the class of aromatic

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
compounds is,
in fact, the benzene molecule.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Benzene has the formula C six H
six.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And we can easily calculate the
number of valence electrons in

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
benzene if we just say 4 for
carbon times 6,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
plus 1 times 6 for the number
of valance electrons from each

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
of the six hydrogens.
And that is 30 electrons.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So, in trying to understand how
these 30 electrons in a valence

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
shell of benzene hold this
molecule together,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
it is known to be a planar
molecule, how do those electrons

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
not only hold it together,
--

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
-- but how do they account for
the structure of benzene,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and how do they account for its
amazing stability?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And this picture that I have
drawn here is a representation

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
of benzene, I will explain to
you in a moment,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
but it comes from a person by
the name of Ernest C.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Crocker.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Ernest C.
Crocker was an MIT Bachelor of

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Science degree holder,
who earned that degree in 1917.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
He was an MIT undergraduate
like you.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And he published a paper.
Let me write down the reference

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
for that paper.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:55.000
This is the Journal of the
American Chemical Society,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
1922, Volume 44,
Page 1618.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
That paper was the first paper
in which the Lewis electron pair

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
theory was applied to an
understanding of the electronic

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
structure of aromatic molecules,
in particular,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
benzene.
And the amazing thing about

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that paper is --
Well, there are many amazing

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
things, but one of the amazing
things about that paper is that

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
there is only one author on that
paper, Ernest C.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Crocker.
And Ernest, who was a very

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
bright individual,
nonetheless did not go on in

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
graduate school to earn a Ph.D.
in chemistry,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
had many various
chemistry-related interests.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
He explained the chemistry of
many different kinds of

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
fragrances and odors.
I think he was referred to as

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
"the man with the million dollar
nose."

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So, this person had quite a
variety of interests.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
He worked in what was then the
Applied Chemistry Laboratory at

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
MIT after his graduation with
his Bachelor of Science degree.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And one of the things he was
thinking about was how to use

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
modern electronic structure
descriptions,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
such as Lewis theory,
to explain molecules like

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
benzene.
And so, if you go and read this

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
paper, you are going to find a
very lucid discussion of how the

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Lewis electron pair theory could
represent benzene according to

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
this formula that I have drawn
here.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And in this formula,
there is considered to be an

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
electron pair between each
carbon and each of the hydrogen

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
nuclei.
There is an electron pair along

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
each carbon-carbon axis,
as shown here,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and here, and so on,
all the way around the ring.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And then, finally,
you have six more electrons to

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
come up to the number of 30,
which is the number of

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
electrons in benzene.
And so, the question really is

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
what to do with this remaining
six electrons.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And I have shown them around
the outside of the ring,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
here, which is where Ernest
arranged them in his work.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And I just want to point out
that he put forward the idea

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that these six electrons were
circulating around the plane of

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
the ring and involved a net
one-half bond between each pair

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
of adjacent carbon atoms in the
benzene ring.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So, in effect,
when we draw benzene this way,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
with a circle in the middle,
we know that that circle

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
represents the circulating six
electrons in what we are going

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
to call the pi system.
But Ernest C.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Crocker was the man who put the
circle into the middle of

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
benzene.
And he was an MIT undergrad.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And this was a sole-authored
paper.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Aromaticity has a vast history
in chemistry,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and it is still a very active
and unfolding history because of

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
the problems,
to our understanding,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
posed by electrons that seem to
be circulating around a whole

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
molecule rather than localized
between pairs of nuclei.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So, Ernest Crocker,
Bachelor of Science,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
1917, MIT, had a huge hand in
that.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I thought you might find that
interesting.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And, having looked at benzene
rings like that,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I will now draw them perhaps
another way that is also useful,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
which comes from KekulÈ.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Because I want to continue our
discussion of Lewis acid-base

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
theory.
And I am going to draw two

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
molecules here that are going to
be pretty similar.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
When I write a molecule,
as I have done here on the

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
left, I haven't explicitly
indicated each of the hydrogens

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that are present on the
periphery of this substituted

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
benzene ring.
But you should understand from

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
a formula like this that this is
the molecule boron C 18 H 15.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And over here I am drawing

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
explicitly, at each of these
peripheral positions on the

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
substituted benzene rings,
fluorine atoms in place of the

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
hydrogens.
So, this is a different
130
00:10:17,609 --&gt; 00:00:15,000
molecule with formula B C 18 F

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
These are both Lewis acids.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And based on our discussion,
last time, if you were to add

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
ammonia to one of these
molecules, where would the lone

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
pair of electrons on the ammonia
bind?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
The boron.
So, yes, you have here a

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
trigonal planer boron center.
And, if you were to add an

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
ammonia molecule,
the lone pair of electrons

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
would come in and stick to the
boron --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
-- because the boron is
electron deficient.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Just like the aluminum we
discussed last time,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
it has only six electrons
around it, and it wants eight.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
But what if we were to add one
ammonia molecule to a flask

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
containing both of those Lewis
acids that would then be

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
competing for the ammonia
molecule?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
What I am asking you to do is
something I will ask you to do

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
throughout this semester,
and that is to analyze a

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
molecule's properties based on
its structure and its

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
composition.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Exactly.
She said that it would

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
preferentially stick to the one
with the fluorines because these

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
very electronegative fluorines
are drawing electron density

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
away from the boron.
This is one of our most

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
electronegative elements.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
So you have a whole bunch of
fluorines in that molecule.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
The whole thing,
we call it perfluorinated.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It is a perfluorinated triaryl
boron reagent.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
These, in fact,
are great Lewis acids,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
really powerful Lewis acids.
And they are modern Lewis acids

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
whose implementation in chemical
processes has come about really

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
in the last 10,
15 years.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And, in fact we were talking a
little bit about Professor

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Schrock last time.
In some of his research,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
he has used that perfluorinated
Lewis acid as an activator in

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
catalysis to get catalytic
polymerization reactions to

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
work.
And that is a very popular

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
approach these days in Lewis
acid chemistry.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
The design of new kinds of
Lewis acids with interesting

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
molecular architectures is
something that is very much a

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
current topic of interest in
research in chemistry,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
because you can make lots of
chemical processes happen when

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
you have something that can tug
on electron pairs.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And this one tugs a lot harder
than that one because this one

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
has very electronegative
fluorines to pull electron

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
density away from that boron and
to adjust the distribution of

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
the electron density in the
molecule.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And we will be talking more
about electron density and

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
distribution in a few minutes in
connection with what I am going

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
to show you now.
And that is --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
That has to do with this
molecule, which is the SO two

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
molecule.
Anyone know where SO two

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
comes from in nature?
Or in the environment,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I should say?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Volcanoes, absolutely.
And also coal-burning power

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
plants.
Coal is a very dirty fuel,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and it contains a lot of
sulfur.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And, when you burn that coal
without controlling the way you

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
burn it, you emit SO two
into the atmosphere.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
So, that can be a big problem.
And we will try to understand

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
why.
One of the things that SO two

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
can do when it gets into
the atmosphere is it can react

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
with dioxygen.
And that can give you --

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
-- SO three.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And if SO two and SO
three are present in the

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000
atmosphere and if there is also
water present in the atmosphere,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
acid rain, that is exactly the
type of process that we will be

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
talking about here.
SO two and SO three

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
are examples of what we
call anhydrides.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Anhydride is a word that means
without water.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And so you should not be
surprised that SO two

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
can react with water.
And when it reacts with water,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
it takes up water.
And the product of that

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
reaction will look like this.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
I draw it like that.
Okay.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So, H two O plus SO two going
to H two SO three.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000
The name of this
molecule is

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
sulfurous acid.
And, alternatively,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
when SO three reacts
with water --

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I have one extra electron pair
that should not have been there.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So, both SO two and SO three,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
as they react with water,
are going from a situation in

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
which they are electron
deficient to a situation in

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
which the sulfur attains an
octet.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Okay?
And you should verify that the

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
number of electrons that I have
drawn up here actually is

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
consistent with the elements
that I am using with the stated

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
charge that I am using.
But when SO three

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
reacts with H two O to
give H two SO four,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
we have now got sulfuric acid.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Okay.
And, as I did over there,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
I have two acids that I want
here now to compare in terms of

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
their relative strengths.
Here I have a Lewis acid SO

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
three and a Lewis acid
SO two engaging in a

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
hydration reaction,
which produces sulfurous acid

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and sulfuric acid.
And the type of acids that

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
these are on the bottom is
Bronsted acids,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
--

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
-- distinguished from Lewis
acids in that the way that they

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
behave as acids is through
ionization that produces a

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
proton.
They are also Lewis acids

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
because the Lewis definition of
acidity is far more general,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
in saying that acids are simply
entities that can accept a pair

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
of electrons.
Protons can accept a pair of

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
electrons, so they are Lewis
acids.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
But if you are talking about
Bronsted acids,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
you are talking exclusively
about protons that are produced

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
by ionization of some kind of a
Bronsted acid.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Which one of these is the
stronger acid?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Sulfuric acid.
And why?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Yes, down here.
You got the other one right.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Exactly.
When this ionizes,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
you get SO four minus.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
I will draw is a slightly
different way that is quicker.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
You get HSO four minus.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
There is your ionization.
And the idea now is that this O

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
minus that you have,
the negative charge can

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
actually be shared among a
greater number of

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
electronegative oxygens here,
namely four,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
as compared to here,
where we have only three

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
electronegative oxygens.
It is a consideration of the

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
very electronegative elements in
your molecule that will help you

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
understand the properties that
these molecules will have in

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
terms of acid-base chemistry.
Now, how many electrons do we

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
have in the valance shell of SO
three?
270
00:21:00,000 --&gt; 00:00:24,000

00:00:24.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And, that being the case,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000
what molecule from last time
does that remind you of?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Maybe seeing a picture of it
will help refresh your memory.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
AlCl three.
Exactly.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
I am going to show it to you
anyway.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And this is going to be faster
than the last time,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
if I set this up right.
Just to remind you.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And if we could have the lights
down just a little bit for a

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
moment.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
I want to refresh your memory
of the electron density

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
distribution here in AlCl
three.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
This is an electron density
isosurface of AlCl three.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And what you are noticing is

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
that the electron density drops
to a low value in between the

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
central aluminum and the
radially disposed chlorides,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
the three chlorides that
surround that central aluminum

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
ion.
And the coloring in this is

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
such that the blue regions
represent regions in space where

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
there is a high probability of
finding paired electrons.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
So, basically you have three Cl
minus's that are packed tightly

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
around an Al three plus.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
This is a very ionic compound.
See the empty region in space

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
between aluminum and chloride,
and the polarization of that

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
otherwise spherical cloud of
electrons around the chloride in

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
the direction of that positively
charged aluminum?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
There is your electron density
distribution for that.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And now I want you to keep that
in mind, and we will compare the

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
isoelectronic SO three
molecule to it.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
SO three.
Here is another case where we

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
have 3 times 8,
24 valance electrons in a

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
system.
But the character of this

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
molecule in terms of electron
density distribution is very

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
different.
While on the blackboard,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
I am not able to really tell
you very much about the

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
difference between SO three
and AlCl three,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
here I think you can
see that indeed they are quite

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
different.
This is an electron density

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
isosurface at the same contour
level as what we were looking at

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
for AlCl three.
Now, to explain this and to

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
understand just what is going on
here, you need to remember that

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
the electronegativity difference
between the central sulfur and

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
the peripheral oxygens is not
very great compared to the

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
electronegativity difference
between aluminum,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
which is a very electropositive
and metallic element,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
and chlorine,
which is a very electronegative

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
halogen.
And so, what that results in,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
as shown here,
is a much more equal sharing of

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
the electrons between that
central sulfur and these

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
peripheral oxygens.
So, even though these things

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
are both Lewis acids and they
both have 24 valance electrons,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
the electron density
distribution in

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
three-dimensional space for
these molecules and the covalent

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
verses ionic character of these
molecules, is really quite

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
different.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Our section that is going to be
devoted to bonding has not

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
really kicked into gear yet,
but the nice thing is that

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Lewis theory applies both to
acid-base chemistry and to

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
bonding, so we are able to talk
a little bit about that.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
In a few moments,
I will tell you a little more

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
about an issue that is very
important in chemistry as

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
regards bonding.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And it has to do with what
happens when acids,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
like sulfuric acid,
ionize in water.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.000
When Bronsted acids ionize in
water, we get this ion produced.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:03.000
H three O plus,
which is the hydronium ion.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
That is to say that if you
ionize in water some Bronsted

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
acid, the protons that are
produced through that ionization

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
are not floating around freely,
naturally, because they are

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
positively charged and they are
attracted to negatively charged

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
electrons.
So, they look around in

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
solution and find the next
source of an electron that they

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
can.
And you know that if we draw

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
out a molecule like water,
according to the Lewis dot

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
structure, it has two extra
pairs of electrons,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
in addition to those two pairs
of electrons it is using in

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
making bonds to the two
hydrogens that are on the oxygen

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
of the water molecule.
So, H plus is not just

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
isolated around by itself in
solution.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
It perches on an oxygen lone
pair.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
So, H three O plus is
what you get when Bronsted acids

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
ionize in water.
And furthermore,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
when you put these things in
solution you find that you

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
organize the water molecules
that are close to the hydronium

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
ion.
Let's draw here a neighboring

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
water molecule.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And another one.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
And I think you can imagine
that throughout a solution,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
we might have many of the kinds
of interactions that I have

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
drawn here as dotted
peach-colored lines.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Those lines represent what we
call hydrogen bonds.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
And hydrogen bonds are
enormously important in

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
chemistry.
Later, when we talk about the

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
structure of proteins in DNA,
in particular,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
you may be aware that the DNA
double helix is held together by

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
a network of hydrogen bonds
between complimentary base

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
pairs.
So hydrogen bonds are not only

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
restricted to the hydronium ion
in aqueous solution.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
There are many other types of
molecules that can form what we

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
call hydrogen bonds.
Another really interesting

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
thing is that in water,
the hydronium ion can move

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
around really rapidly,
much more rapidly than

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
molecules normally diffuse
through aqueous solution.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And the reason for that is if
you look at the arrangement of

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
electrons and nuclei here,
all I have to do is,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
without even moving the nuclei
much at all, reorganize the

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
hydrogen bonding network as
such.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
And now you can see that
through just a slight set of

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
motions, our hydronium ion has
moved from the left-hand side of

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
this hydrogen bonded network,
where you can see that it is

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
indicated with the positive
charge and the three solid lines

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
drawn to the oxygen,
over to the right-hand side.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
But it did that not by coming
off and moving over,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
but rather through just
redistribution of the electron

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
density, so that the positively
charged part ends up down on the

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
other side.
And so this way of propagating

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
hydronium ions in aqueous
solution is one of the really

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
special aspects of Bronsted acid
chemistry that takes place in

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
water.
And I think I will also show

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
you what a hydrogen bond looks
like from the standpoint of

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
electron density.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
First, I am just going to show
you the position of the nuclei

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
in a very simple hydrogen bonded
system.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Here what you can see,
the oxygens are drawn in red as

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
spheres and the hydrogens are
drawn in white as spheres.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
You can see that the geometry
around the oxygen atoms is

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
slightly pyramidal.
And that is due,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
of course, to the presence of
that extra lone pair here,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
up above one oxygen and here,
up above the other oxygen.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
And what we have now is a
hydrogen serving in a bridging

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
fashion.
And the number of electrons in

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
this system is exactly 2 times
8, because we have two water

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
molecules and we have an
H plus.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
So this is a positively charged
ion in which a hydronium ion,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
and you can pick either side,
actually, is interacting with

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
one of the lone pairs of the
other water molecule.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
And you could imagine lots of
different types of water

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
clusters like this that are
singly positively charged.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And people have done a lot of
work to study such clusters in

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
solution.
What you should remember,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
though, is that the size of the
spheres that I have drawn there

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
to represent those oxygens and
hydrogens is somewhat arbitrary.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
But what is not arbitrary is
the way that the electron

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
density represents a molecule
like this.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
So, we will show that to you
next.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Here it is.
And if we could have the lights

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
down just a little bit,
please, since this one is a

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
little harder to see.
What you should see here is

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
that we have the same structure
now surrounding that

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
representation of the water
molecule hydrogen bonded to the

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
hydronium ion that I drew a
moment ago.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
We now have this sort of mesh,
which is exactly what we have

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
been looking at with these other
molecules, namely,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
an electron density isosurface.
And what you can see is that

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
the electron density is falling
to a pretty small value in the

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
middle, here,
where we have the proton that

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
is the connecting glue binding
together these two water

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
molecules in this 16 valance
electron system.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
And after one more
representation of that,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
we will be onto our next topic.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
And this one is a solid display
of the electron density

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
isosurface associated with this
hydrogen bonded cluster.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And it is, once again,
color mapped with this function

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
that tells us about the
probability of finding electrons

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
paired up together in space.
There is H three O plus

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
hydrogen bonded to H
two O.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
The blue color represents those
regions in space where you are

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
most likely to find pairs of
electrons.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
And you can see that the two OH
bonds over here are nicely

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
colored blue.
The lone pair of electrons up

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
here is nicely colored blue.
And then we have an interesting

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
situation where there is some
blue in between that bridging H

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
plus and the two lone
pairs that are pointed at it

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
that produces,
in fact, our hydrogen bond.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
So, there is a picture of
hydrogen bonding in terms of

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
electron density.
And it is a type of bonding

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
that compliments the straight,
covalent, and ionic bonding

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000
that I was talking about in
terms of SO three and

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
AlCl three.
So, we have added this third

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
type of hydrogen bonding to our
list of bonding interests.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
And now, we will talk more
about what we can do when we

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
consider Bronsted acids
ionizing.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Here is a generic
representation of the formula of

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
a Bronsted acid,
HA.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
A might be, for example,
the HSO four minus

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
ion that we showed over there.
When we put a Bronsted acid in

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
aqueous solution,
as I said before,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
we can get ionization into H
plus and A minus.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
But we know that it is not just

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
H plus.
It is actually H three O plus

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
**H3O^+**.
And H three O plus is

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
further hydrogen bonded in
networks in the water system.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
But, for simplicity,
I will just write it as H plus

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
right here.
Recently, in your crash review

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
of thermodynamics,
you were talking about

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
equilibria and equilibrium
constants.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And we are going to make use of
some of that right here because

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
we are going to talk about the
acidity constant,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Ka.
And that is going to be defined

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
as equal to the hydrogen or
hydronium ion concentration

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
times the concentration of the
conjugate base,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
A minus --
When a Bronsted acid ionizes it

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
produces what we call the
conjugate base of the acid.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Here is conjugate base --

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
-- divided by the concentration
of the acid.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
And this is at equilibrium.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
And let me just emphasize
something so that you don't

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
forget.
This is an important piece of

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
nomenclature.
These square brackets here

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
refer to concentration,
usually in molarity.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Okay?
So that is what we are talking

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
about.
And concentration is something

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
that can be measured.
You may be familiar,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
for example,
with the pH meter invented by

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Arnold O.
Beckman and its utility in

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
measuring the concentration of
hydrogen ions in solution.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Well, we can make use of
information like that to talk

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
about the properties of our
Bronsted acids.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
How can we do that?
Well, let's say we are going to

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:08.000
take a particular acid such as
this one, which is acetic acid.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
You know the smell of acetic
acid if you have ever been in an

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
establishment where they were
making barbecued chicken wings.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
That is the smell of acetic
acid.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
A beautiful smell.
Anyway, what you do here is you

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
are trying to figure out what is
going on.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
You have some concentration of
the acid HA, which is,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
we are going to talk about,
acetic acid.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
And in solution there may also
be a hydrogen ion or a hydronium

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
ion.
And then there may also be A

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
minus, which in the case of
acetic acid would be acetate,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
--

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
-- where we have two
electronegative oxygens,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
among which the negative charge
can be shared and the acetate

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
ion, which is the conjugate base
of acidic acid.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
So we make a table.
We need to have some initial

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
concentration.
That is to say let's consider,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
for example,
tenth molar acetic acid.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
We are just choosing tenth
molar as a concentration for

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
acetic acid solution.
What that means is you have

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
pure acetic acid.
And then you dissolve it in

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
water and bring it up to a total
volume such that the

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
concentration was 0.1 molar,
assuming that none of it had

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
been ionized yet.
And so that means we have an

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
initial concentration of acetic
acid of 0.1 molar.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
And initially,
before the ionization,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000
we have zero H plus or
hydronium and zero A minus.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
And then, the concentration

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
changes.
And it changes because the HA

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
ionizes to some particular
extent, depending on the KA

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000
value for the acetic acid.
And what is going to happen is

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
that some of the HA ionizes.
And the amount of the HA that

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
is undergoing ionization is x,
so we are going to lose x.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
And then, for every HA that
ionizes, we get that same amount

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
of H plus produced and
that same amount of A minus.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
And so then,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
after the system reaches
equilibrium, we will finally

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
have 0.1 minus x as our
concentration of HA

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
and x and x will be our
concentrations,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
respectively,
of H plus and A minus.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.000
And so let me put this board

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
all the way up.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Therefore, we can write the
following, that Ka is equal to x

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
squared over 0.1 over x by

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000
substituting into the expression
for the acidity constant.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Ka is our acidity constant.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.000
And we can go to a table and
look up the acidity constant for

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
acetic acid because it is a
known quantity.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000
And it turns out that that is
1.8x10^-5.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
And now that we have this
equation for the acidity

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
constant and we know what the
acidity constant is,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
we can solve this for x.
Of course, this is a cubic

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
equation.
We are going to get two roots.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
You will see that you get a
positive root and a negative

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
root.
The negative root is

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
meaningless because
concentration cannot be

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
negative, so you pick the
positive root.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
And when you have done that,
you can then go ahead and

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
answer questions,
like, what is the pH of the

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
solution?
And what is the percent

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
ionization?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
And we can talk about that.
So next time,

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
at the beginning of class,
we will do that calculation.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
We will find what the pH of a
tenth molar solution of acetic

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
acid would be.
We will also go on and talk

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
about pH and the pKa scale,
and also a general equation for

00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:03.000
discussing titrations and
buffers.
