00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.576
Great.
Well, let's get going.

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:22.085
Last time we ended up by
discovering the electron.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:27.423
We discovered the fact that the
atom was not the most basic

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:33.107
constituent of matter.
But in 1911 there was another

00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:38.571
discovery concerning the atom,
and this is by Ernest

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:43.392
Rutherford in England.
And what Rutherford was

00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:49.714
interested in doing was studying
the emission from the newly

00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:54.642
discovered radioactive elements
such as radium.

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:59.678
And so he borrowed,
or he got, from Marie Curie,

00:00:59.678 --> 00:01:05.913
some radium bromide.
And radium bromide was known to

00:01:05.913 --> 00:01:09.390
emit something called alpha
particles.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.936
And they didn't really know
what these alpha particles were.

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:20.011
Now, they did know that the
alpha particles were heavy,

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:24.992
they were charged and that they
were pretty energetic.

00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:30.351
That is what was known.
Of course, today we know these

00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:34.662
alpha particles to be nothing
other than helium with two

00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:38.816
electrons removed from the
helium, helium double plus.

00:01:38.816 --> 00:01:42.891
Rutherford is in the lab and
has this radium bromide,

00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:47.437
alpha particles being emitted
and has some kind of detector

00:01:47.437 --> 00:01:50.572
out here to detect those alpha
particles.

00:01:50.572 --> 00:01:55.275
And he measures a rate at which
the alpha particles touch his

00:01:55.275 --> 00:02:00.812
detector.
And it is about 132,000 alpha

00:02:00.812 --> 00:02:05.151
particles per minute.
That's nice.

00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:12.776
Then what he does is takes a
piece of gold foil and puts it

00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:19.876
in between the radium bromide
emitter and the detector.

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:26.055
And that gold foil is actually
really very thin.

00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:32.835
It is 2x10^-5 inches.
Two orders of magnitude thinner

00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:38.323
than the diameter of your hair.
I often wonder how he handled

00:02:38.323 --> 00:02:42.713
that, but he did it.
He put it in the middle here

00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:48.567
and then went to count the count
rate as a result of putting this

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:54.054
foil there, and the count rate
is 132,000 alpha particles per

00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:57.347
minute.
It didn't seem like that gold

00:02:57.347 --> 00:03:02.281
foil did anything.
The alpha particles were just

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:05.035
going right through to the
detector.

00:03:05.035 --> 00:03:09.677
It didn't even seem to matter
that there was that gold foil.

00:03:09.677 --> 00:03:13.060
The post-doc that was working
on it, Geiger,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.837
of the Geiger Counter,
was actually disappointed.

00:03:16.837 --> 00:03:19.355
Gee, that is a boring
experiment.

00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:23.997
But Geiger was even a little
bit more unhappy because he had

00:03:23.997 --> 00:03:27.223
this undergraduate hanging
around the lab,

00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:31.000
this undergraduate named
Marsden.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.520
And Marsden was really
enthusiastic about doing

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.811
something in the lab.
He really wanted to do

00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.183
something.
And Geiger, you know,

00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:42.862
what am I going to do with this
kid?

00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:47.147
Geiger goes to Rutherford,
look, this kid really wants to

00:03:47.147 --> 00:03:50.132
do something.
What should I have him do?

00:03:50.132 --> 00:03:53.959
And Rutherford said,
well, what you should have him

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.551
do is take this detector and
have him build it so that it can

00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:03.314
be swung around.
So that it can be positioned

00:04:03.314 --> 00:04:05.958
here.
So that we can check to see

00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.760
whether or not any of these
alpha particles are

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.818
backscattered,
scattered back into the

00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:17.363
direction from which they came.
And Geiger went away and

00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:20.917
thought, good,
this is something to give the

00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:23.727
undergraduate.
This is a ridiculous

00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:27.033
experiment.
We know all the particles are

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:31.000
going right through the
detector.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.547
Okay.
But Marsden was real happy.

00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:38.243
He gets to build this detector.
He swings it around and gets

00:04:38.243 --> 00:04:41.348
Geiger there to do the first
experiment.

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:45.805
He puts the radium bromide and
they listen and hear tick,

00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:48.034
tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick.

00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:50.582
Geiger says,
"Oh, it must just be

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.925
background.
Let me do a control experiment.

00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:58.064
Let me take the gold foil out
of here so that all the

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:03.000
particles have to be going in
this direction."

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.258
They take the gold foil out of
there and listen,

00:05:07.258 --> 00:05:12.061
and they hear nothing.
They put the gold foil back and

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.961
they hear tick,
tick, tick, tick,

00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:18.766
tick, tick.
And they put a platinum foil in

00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:22.572
there and they hear tick,
tick, tick, tick,

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:25.925
tick, tick.
Whatever metal they put in

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:31.000
there, there were some particles
coming off.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.138
And they got Rutherford down in
the lab.

00:05:35.138 --> 00:05:39.489
Rutherford looks them over
their shoulder.

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:44.265
They do this again and again.
Hey, it is real.

00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:47.873
It is real.
And what is coming off?

00:05:47.873 --> 00:05:53.497
Well, the count rate is about
20 particles per minute.

00:05:53.497 --> 00:05:59.921
Not large but not zero.
And the probability here of

00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:05.547
this backscattering is simply
the number of particles

00:06:05.547 --> 00:06:08.360
backscattered,
which is 20,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.419
over the total number of
particles, or actually the count

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.937
rate that the particles
backscattered over the total

00:06:19.937 --> 00:06:23.832
incident count rate.
That is 2x10^-4.

00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:26.104
That is not zero.
Wow.

00:06:26.104 --> 00:06:32.232
Rutherford was excited.
Rutherford later wrote,

00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:37.279
"It was quite the most
incredible event that has ever

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:42.714
happened to me in my life.
It was almost as incredible as

00:06:42.714 --> 00:06:48.635
if you fired a 15 inch shell at
a piece of tissue paper and it

00:06:48.635 --> 00:06:53.585
came back and hit you." What was
the interpretation?

00:06:53.585 --> 00:06:59.408
The interpretation was the gold
atoms that make up this foil,

00:06:59.408 --> 00:07:05.640
they must be mostly empty.
Now, they knew that those atoms

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.835
had some electrons in it because
the electron had already been

00:07:10.835 --> 00:07:14.328
discovered.
But these alpha particles seem

00:07:14.328 --> 00:07:19.523
to be going right through those
gold atoms, for the most part.

00:07:19.523 --> 00:07:24.889
The atom, which he knew to be a
diameter of about 10^-10 meters,

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:30.000
most of that atom must be empty
was the conclusion.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.818
But occasionally these helium
double plus ions,

00:07:35.818 --> 00:07:40.233
these alpha particles,
hit something massive.

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:46.453
And that something massive then
scatters those helium ions into

00:07:46.453 --> 00:07:49.864
the direction from which they
came.

00:07:49.864 --> 00:07:55.682
And since that probability is
small, well, the size of this

00:07:55.682 --> 00:08:01.000
massive part has to be really
pretty small.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.272
And from knowing the
probabilities and knowing

00:08:05.272 --> 00:08:11.160
roughly what the diameter of the
atoms were and how many layers

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.148
of atoms he had,
he was able to back out of

00:08:15.148 --> 00:08:20.750
those experiments a diameter for
this massive part of 10^-14

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.359
meters.
And he called this massive part

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:28.062
the nucleus.
He called it the nucleus in

00:08:28.062 --> 00:08:33.000
analogy to the nucleus of a
living cell.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.677
The heavy part,
the dense part in a living

00:08:36.677 --> 00:08:41.162
cell-- that is where the name
"nucleus" comes from.

00:08:41.162 --> 00:08:46.634
Now, Rutherford also realized
that this nucleus here has to be

00:08:46.634 --> 00:08:50.760
positively charged.
He knew about electrons and

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.784
knew the atoms then were
neutral, and so he reasoned this

00:08:55.784 --> 00:09:00.000
nucleus had to be positively
charged.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.318
And then he did a bunch more
experiments, more sophisticated

00:09:05.318 --> 00:09:10.456
experiments in which he actually
measured here the angular

00:09:10.456 --> 00:09:15.594
distribution of the helium ion
scattered from the nucleus.

00:09:15.594 --> 00:09:20.552
And from those very detailed
measurements of the angular

00:09:20.552 --> 00:09:24.157
distribution,
he was able to back out the

00:09:24.157 --> 00:09:28.845
fact that this nucleus,
the charge on it was actually

00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:34.003
plus Z times e.
Z is the atomic number.

00:09:34.003 --> 00:09:38.183
e is the unit charge.
He did a bunch of different

00:09:38.183 --> 00:09:43.758
metals and was able to establish
that the nucleus had a charge of

00:09:43.758 --> 00:09:48.200
plus Z times e.
His model is that there is a

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.987
very dense center,
10^-14 meters.

00:09:50.987 --> 00:09:55.777
This diameter of the nucleus is
something that every MIT

00:09:55.777 --> 00:10:01.491
undergraduate should know.
And he realized that then the

00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:05.787
electrons have to fill out the
rest of this volume.

00:10:05.787 --> 00:10:09.739
That was his interpretation
from these results.

00:10:09.739 --> 00:10:14.293
And think about Marsden,
what a great UROP experiment.

00:10:14.293 --> 00:10:17.988
He discovered the nucleus.
Isn't that great?

00:10:17.988 --> 00:10:22.627
Marsden had a long and
successful career as a scientist

00:10:22.627 --> 00:10:26.322
also after that.
Now, I should also tell you

00:10:26.322 --> 00:10:31.133
that this backscattering
experiment is really the essence

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:36.811
of how a quark was discovered.
Quark are the fundamental

00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:40.000
elementary particles in protons
and neutrons.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.536
Essentially,
they took a high energy

00:10:42.536 --> 00:10:46.594
particle, scattered it through
the proton or the neutron,

00:10:46.594 --> 00:10:49.275
and it backscatters.
And, in that way,

00:10:49.275 --> 00:10:53.405
they discovered the quark and
measured the diameter of the

00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:55.942
quark.
And this was done by a couple

00:10:55.942 --> 00:11:00.000
of my colleagues in the Physics
Department.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.866
Jerry Friedman and Henry
Kendall, who has since passed

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:09.851
away.
Jerry Friedman is still around.

00:11:09.851 --> 00:11:13.614
He loves to talk to
undergraduates,

00:11:13.614 --> 00:11:18.152
and many of you will get that
opportunity.

00:11:18.152 --> 00:11:24.793
Now it is time for us to do our
own Rutherford backscattering

00:11:24.793 --> 00:11:26.564
experiment.
Yeah.

00:11:26.564 --> 00:11:31.427
[APPLAUSE]
Here is our gold lattice.

00:11:31.427 --> 00:11:35.409
These Styrofoam balls are the
gold nuclei.

00:11:35.409 --> 00:11:39.196
The space around them are the
electrons.

00:11:39.196 --> 00:11:44.732
These things in the center here
are just the posts on this

00:11:44.732 --> 00:11:48.131
frame.
[LAUGHTER] This is a piece of

00:11:48.131 --> 00:11:52.889
equipment from my lab that I
pressed into service,

00:11:52.889 --> 00:11:58.522
and so I couldn't cut these
posts away because I would have

00:11:58.522 --> 00:12:04.057
trouble taking my manipulator
out of my machine at a later

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:08.014
time.
So they are just there.

00:12:08.014 --> 00:12:11.868
But this is our one monolayer
of gold nuclei.

00:12:11.868 --> 00:12:17.124
And so what are we going to do?
Well, what we are going to do

00:12:17.124 --> 00:12:22.467
is try to measure the diameter
of these Styrofoam balls in the

00:12:22.467 --> 00:12:27.372
same way that Rutherford did.
And so we are going to need

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:34.043
some alpha particles.
What are we going to use for an

00:12:34.043 --> 00:12:39.652
alpha particle?
Well, we have some ping-pong

00:12:39.652 --> 00:12:44.869
balls for alpha particles.
Let's do that.

00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:51.000
We have 287 alpha particles,
or ping-pong balls,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and we are going to measure the
probability of backscattering.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.429
The probability of
backscattering will be the

00:13:04.429 --> 00:13:10.570
number that actually backscatter
divided by the number that we

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:16.107
throw, or the total number.
That is what we are going to

00:13:16.107 --> 00:13:19.630
measure.
But now I have to take this

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:25.570
probability and I have to relate
it to the diameter of these

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:30.000
nuclei.
How am I going to do that?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.974
Well, that probability is going
to be equal to the total surface

00:13:36.974 --> 00:13:42.730
area of the crystal here.
I have already measured the

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.158
total area.
I know that the total area is

00:13:47.158 --> 00:13:52.361
2,148 square inches.
That is in the denominator,

00:13:52.361 --> 00:14:00.000
but now the numerator is simply
the total area of the nuclei.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.310
The total area of the nuclei is
the area of one nucleus,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.751
A sub i,
summed over the total number of

00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:13.903
nuclei, which I have already
counted as 119.

00:14:13.903 --> 00:14:19.503
And so the total area is 119
times the cross-sectional area

00:14:19.503 --> 00:14:25.586
here of any one of these nuclei.
And that is pi d squared over 4.

00:14:25.586 --> 00:14:30.417
I can solve that equation,

00:14:30.417 --> 00:14:34.600
for the diameter,
in terms of the probability.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:40.085
And when I solve that equation,
d is equal to 4.79 times the

00:14:40.085 --> 00:14:45.105
probability to the one-half
power.

00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:50.032
What we are going to do is
measure this probability by

00:14:50.032 --> 00:14:55.889
throwing the ping-pong balls and
calculating and determining how

00:14:55.889 --> 00:15:00.072
many backscatter.
And then we are going to use

00:15:00.072 --> 00:15:05.000
that to get this diameter of the
nuclei.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.982
The same experiment that was
done to actually measure the

00:15:09.982 --> 00:15:14.608
diameter of the nucleus.
Now you are going to do this

00:15:14.608 --> 00:15:18.167
experiment.
Every one of you are going to

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:21.103
get a ping-pong ball from the
TAs.

00:15:21.103 --> 00:15:25.284
TAs, why don't you give out the
ping-pong balls,

00:15:25.284 --> 00:15:30.000
and then I will give you some
instructions.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.095
All right.
The pi d squared over 4

00:15:34.095 --> 00:15:40.994
is the cross-sectional
area in terms of the diameter of

00:15:40.994 --> 00:15:45.413
these balls.
I just wrote it in terms of d

00:15:45.413 --> 00:15:48.000
instead of r.
Yes?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.035
That is correct.
Good point.

00:16:02.035 --> 00:16:06.633
That balls that we are throwing
actually have size compared to

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:11.155
in the case of the Rutherford
backscattering experiment where

00:16:11.155 --> 00:16:15.376
the projectile was almost a
point compared to the size of

00:16:15.376 --> 00:16:17.638
the nucleus.
In our experiment,

00:16:17.638 --> 00:16:20.879
you are quite right,
our balls are about the

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:24.346
diameter there.
And so, if we were doing a more

00:16:24.346 --> 00:16:27.889
exact experiment,
we would do a little different

00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:31.799
calculation.
We would take into

00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:37.100
consideration the size of the
actual ball that we were

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.600
throwing.
But we are not going to do

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.799
that.
Because we are not throwing

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:47.799
that many balls,
we don't really have the

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:53.000
statistics to do a more exacting
kind of calculation.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
But you are quite right.
Yes?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.569
Well, he didn't know.
Although, he knew the fact that

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.659
it was backscattering,
that it had to be much,

00:17:11.659 --> 00:17:13.993
much less massive than the
nucleus.

00:17:13.993 --> 00:17:18.112
I think that he also measured
the energy of the backscattered

00:17:18.112 --> 00:17:19.691
particle.
And from that,

00:17:19.691 --> 00:17:23.947
you can back out the fact that
it is much less massive than the

00:17:23.947 --> 00:17:26.556
nucleus.
There are a few other details,

00:17:26.556 --> 00:17:29.851
you are quite right,
that I have left out in this

00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:35.000
discussion that he had to know
in order to get this number.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.888
Here is the thing.
You have to aim your alpha

00:17:39.888 --> 00:17:46.222
particles at this lattice.
And then you have to watch your

00:17:46.222 --> 00:17:50.222
ball.
[LAUGHTER] You have to watch to

00:17:50.222 --> 00:17:56.888
see if it scatters back at you,
because at the end I am going

00:17:56.888 --> 00:18:02.000
to ask you if your ball
backscattered.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.468
And we need an accurate count.
Now, if you hit one of these

00:18:07.468 --> 00:18:11.804
things and it backscatters,
that doesn't count.

00:18:11.804 --> 00:18:16.329
Only if it hits the Styrofoam
ball does it count.

00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:20.666
If it hits the Styrofoam ball
and goes through,

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:25.380
that doesn't count.
It literally has to backscatter

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.000
at you.
Was there a question over here?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.903
If you miss you miss.
[LAUGHTER] Now,

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:37.500
I do invite you to come a
little closer so that you can at

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.000
least hit the crystal.
Yes?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.445
That is correct.
Well, you have got a defect.

00:18:50.445 --> 00:18:55.066
These are a little bit lighter.
Oh, you have some more here.

00:18:55.066 --> 00:18:57.885
Oh, okay.
You can have a regular one.

00:18:57.885 --> 00:19:01.254
Anybody need one yet?
I have a couple.

00:19:01.254 --> 00:19:03.372
Oh, all right.
You need one?

00:19:03.372 --> 00:19:08.000
Because I need them all thrown.
Did you have a question?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
What is the mean free path?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.309
That I am going to have to give
you an expression for at some

00:19:25.309 --> 00:19:30.000
other time, but there is
certainly a decay pathway.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.989
I have another ball here.
Now, are you ready?

00:19:35.989 --> 00:19:43.068
You can come down closer,
but now I have one piece of

00:19:43.068 --> 00:19:48.785
advice for you.
That is, only fools aim for

00:19:48.785 --> 00:19:56.000
their chemistry professor.
[LAUGHTER] Go to it.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Did you throw your balls?
You missed the crystal.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.689
All right.
Has our supply of alpha

00:21:05.689 --> 00:21:11.551
particles been exhausted?
All done?

00:21:11.551 --> 00:21:18.103
All right.
[APPLAUSE] Now comes the big

00:21:18.103 --> 00:21:23.793
test.
How many of you had an alpha

00:21:23.793 --> 00:21:33.381
particle that backscattered?
Let's keep your hand high

00:21:33.381 --> 00:21:37.980
because I have to count
accurately.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.038
In this section I see one.
Two?

00:21:42.038 --> 00:21:43.526
Cheater.
No.

00:21:43.526 --> 00:21:48.125
Two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:51.371
eight, nine,
ten, eleven,

00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:58.000
twelve, thirteen.
Did I get everybody?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.900
I got everybody?
13?

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.799
Right, not deflection.
If it hit and went through,

00:22:09.799 --> 00:22:15.000
that does not count.
It has to come back at you.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.152
Yes.
[LAUGHTER] That is right.

00:22:23.152 --> 00:22:27.173
All right.
Does anybody want to change

00:22:27.173 --> 00:22:30.000
their count?
13 balls?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.719
I am sorry?
If it just hit it and moved but

00:22:34.719 --> 00:22:38.988
did not backscatter,
it does not count.

00:22:38.988 --> 00:22:43.033
The nuclei will move.
They will move,

00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:48.314
certainly, because there is a
momentum transfer.

00:22:48.314 --> 00:22:51.573
Well, not quite like that.
No.

00:22:51.573 --> 00:22:55.505
We have 13 balls that
backscattered?

00:22:55.505 --> 00:23:00.000
Okay.
Let's see what we got.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.005
The probability,
here, then, is 13 over 287.

00:23:13.005 --> 00:23:19.335
That probability is equal to
0.049.

00:23:19.335 --> 00:23:29.015
If I now that this probability
and plug it into here,

00:23:29.015 --> 00:23:40.000
what we are going to get is a
diameter of 1.0 inches.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.181
And the diameter on the average
of those particles is about 0.85

00:23:48.181 --> 00:23:52.727
inches.
You did a really pretty good

00:23:52.727 --> 00:23:56.753
job.
You got the diameter of the

00:23:56.753 --> 00:24:00.000
nucleus.
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.250
That is great.
And that is the way the nuclear

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.462
diameter was,
in fact, measured and

00:24:07.462 --> 00:24:11.052
discovered.
But now we have the problem

00:24:11.052 --> 00:24:16.247
that the scientists had in 1912,
and that is what is the

00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:21.065
structure of the atom?
We now know it has a nucleus.

00:24:21.065 --> 00:24:25.315
It has an electron.
How do they hang together?

00:24:25.315 --> 00:24:31.906
Where are they in the atom?
We are going to talk about the

00:24:31.906 --> 00:24:35.587
classical description here of
the atom.

00:24:35.587 --> 00:24:39.946
And the first question that we
have to ask is,

00:24:39.946 --> 00:24:45.371
what is the force that keeps
the electron and the nucleus

00:24:45.371 --> 00:24:49.053
together?
What are the four fundamental

00:24:49.053 --> 00:24:51.184
forces?
Gravity is one.

00:24:51.184 --> 00:24:55.059
And that is the strongest or
the weakest?

00:24:55.059 --> 00:24:56.609
Weakest.
Gravity.

00:24:56.609 --> 00:25:01.233
Next stronger force?
Electromagnetic.

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:05.012
I will just abbreviate it EM.
Next stronger force?

00:25:05.012 --> 00:25:06.863
Weak force.
And the next?

00:25:06.863 --> 00:25:08.868
Strong.
Weak and strong are

00:25:08.868 --> 00:25:12.647
intranuclear forces.
They are operable between the

00:25:12.647 --> 00:25:17.275
protons, the neutrons and the
other elementary particles that

00:25:17.275 --> 00:25:20.745
make up the nucleus.
It does not have a lot of

00:25:20.745 --> 00:25:24.678
effect, the weak and the strong
force, on chemistry,

00:25:24.678 --> 00:25:30.000
except for beta emission for
the radioactive elements.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.242
Gravity actually does have no
known chemical significance to

00:25:36.242 --> 00:25:40.580
chemistry.
And so all of chemistry is tied

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:45.658
up here in the electromagnetic
force, which I am,

00:25:45.658 --> 00:25:50.419
at the moment,
going to simplify and just call

00:25:50.419 --> 00:25:55.286
the Coulomb force.
Now, we know how to describe

00:25:55.286 --> 00:26:01.000
the Coulomb force between
charged particles.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.549
We know what expression to
write down.

00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:06.098
Let's do that.
If we have the nucleus,

00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:09.543
which is positively charged,
and the electron here,

00:26:09.543 --> 00:26:13.608
which is negatively charged,
and they are at some distance r

00:26:13.608 --> 00:26:16.915
between each other,
the expression that describes

00:26:16.915 --> 00:26:20.429
how that force of interaction
changes with distance,

00:26:20.429 --> 00:26:24.287
this Coulomb's force law,
it is just the magnitude of the

00:26:24.287 --> 00:26:28.559
charge of the electron times the
magnitude of the charge on the

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:31.866
nucleus over 4 pi epsilon nought
times r squared.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.279
I am going to just treat the
force as a scalar,

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:43.348
just for simplicity purposes
here.

00:26:43.348 --> 00:26:47.441
Epsilon nought is the
permittivity of vacuum.

00:26:47.441 --> 00:26:51.627
It is a factor in there for
unit conversation.

00:26:51.627 --> 00:26:56.465
r, then, is the distance
between the electron and the

00:26:56.465 --> 00:27:00.000
nucleus.
What does this say?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.965
Well, this says that when r
goes to infinity,

00:27:03.965 --> 00:27:06.037
what is the force?
Zero.

00:27:06.037 --> 00:27:09.462
The particles are infinitely
far apart.

00:27:09.462 --> 00:27:13.427
There is no force between them.
In this case,

00:27:13.427 --> 00:27:16.311
an attractive force between
them.

00:27:16.311 --> 00:27:20.095
When r is equal to zero,
what is the force?

00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:23.069
Infinite.
And anywhere in between,

00:27:23.069 --> 00:27:28.566
that force is described by this
one over r squared

00:27:28.566 --> 00:27:33.115
dependence.
You can see that as the

00:27:33.115 --> 00:27:39.002
particles come closer and closer
together, the force between them

00:27:39.002 --> 00:27:42.958
gets larger and larger.
The closer they get,

00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:47.097
the larger the force,
the more they want to be

00:27:47.097 --> 00:27:50.777
together.
This expression is just telling

00:27:50.777 --> 00:27:56.296
me, if I held one particle and
the other particle in my hand,

00:27:56.296 --> 00:28:02.000
and I held them at some
distance from each other --

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.982
That expression is just telling
me the force with which I have

00:28:06.982 --> 00:28:09.841
to kind of exert to keep them
apart.

00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:14.007
But now, if I let them go,
you know what is going to

00:28:14.007 --> 00:28:16.376
happen.
They are going to come

00:28:16.376 --> 00:28:19.561
together.
They are going to want to come

00:28:19.561 --> 00:28:23.972
together because of that force.
And what is not in this

00:28:23.972 --> 00:28:27.321
expression?
What is not in that expression

00:28:27.321 --> 00:28:31.732
is any information about how
those particles move under

00:28:31.732 --> 00:28:37.485
influence of that force.
Nowhere in this expression is

00:28:37.485 --> 00:28:42.200
there an r of t,
how that distance changes with

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.285
time.
And so what we need to describe

00:28:45.285 --> 00:28:48.028
that is a force law.
And in 1911,

00:28:48.028 --> 00:28:52.657
the force law that seemed to
describe the motion of all

00:28:52.657 --> 00:28:56.599
bodies, including astronomical
ones, of course,

00:28:56.599 --> 00:29:01.400
the equation of motion that
described how bodies move are

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.443
Newton's equations of motion.
And, in particular,

00:29:06.443 --> 00:29:09.331
F equals ma.
And, of course,

00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:13.586
I can write that acceleration
as a time derivative of the

00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:16.170
velocity, dv over dt.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.741
And that velocity,
of course, itself is a change

00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:22.477
in the position with respect to
time.

00:29:22.477 --> 00:29:26.428
This is m, the second
derivative of r with respect to

00:29:26.428 --> 00:29:30.000
time.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.551
If I know the force that is
operation, which is this,

00:29:34.551 --> 00:29:39.803
I can take this and plug it in
here, and I am going to have a

00:29:39.803 --> 00:29:44.355
differential equation.
And that differential equation

00:29:44.355 --> 00:29:49.519
is going to allow me to solve
for what r is as a function of

00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:53.371
time, the distance between the
two particles.

00:29:53.371 --> 00:29:58.798
And it is going to allow me to
solve for that distance in a way

00:29:58.798 --> 00:30:03.000
that we call deterministic,
exactly.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.875
In other words,
if I know where the particles

00:30:06.875 --> 00:30:11.102
are to start with,
using this equation of motion,

00:30:11.102 --> 00:30:14.713
this force law,
I can tell you where those

00:30:14.713 --> 00:30:19.380
particles are going to be for
all future time exactly.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:23.255
It is deterministic,
the classical mechanical

00:30:23.255 --> 00:30:26.426
approach.
Now, in order to solve this

00:30:26.426 --> 00:30:31.093
differential equation,
I am going to have to develop a

00:30:31.093 --> 00:30:36.330
model for the atom.
All differential equations,

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:40.388
for the most part,
describing physical processes

00:30:40.388 --> 00:30:44.964
are going to need a model.
They are going to need some

00:30:44.964 --> 00:30:48.503
boundary conditions or initial
conditions.

00:30:48.503 --> 00:30:52.129
And the model,
of course, that came to mind

00:30:52.129 --> 00:30:55.841
for the atom,
is one in which the nucleus is

00:30:55.841 --> 00:31:00.786
in the center.
And the electron moves around

00:31:00.786 --> 00:31:06.264
that nucleus with uniform
circular motion and with a fixed

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:09.915
radius.
We are going to call that fixed

00:31:09.915 --> 00:31:14.336
radius r star.
It is a planetary model.

00:31:14.336 --> 00:31:19.909
That seems like a good guess
for the structure of the atom.

00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:25.099
Now, if you have a particle
undergoing uniform circular

00:31:25.099 --> 00:31:30.000
motion at some well-defined
radius here.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.873
That particle is being
constantly accelerated.

00:31:34.873 --> 00:31:40.072
And I can write that
acceleration a as the linear

00:31:40.072 --> 00:31:45.054
velocity squared over that
radius of its orbit.

00:31:45.054 --> 00:31:51.444
It is being
accelerated because the velocity

00:31:51.444 --> 00:31:55.018
vector.
The direction is changing,

00:31:55.018 --> 00:32:00.000
so there is a constant
acceleration.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.935
Now, this expression,
for many of you,

00:32:02.935 --> 00:32:06.742
I pulled out of the air.
Some of you have seen it

00:32:06.742 --> 00:32:08.884
before.
It is an 8.01 topic.

00:32:08.884 --> 00:32:13.406
You are going to see it this
semester, but later on and in

00:32:13.406 --> 00:32:15.944
8.01.
You are not responsible for

00:32:15.944 --> 00:32:19.752
this right now here,
but you will recall later on

00:32:19.752 --> 00:32:23.639
this semester that you have seen
it here in 5.112.

00:32:23.639 --> 00:32:26.177
But, if this is the
acceleration,

00:32:26.177 --> 00:32:30.778
I can take this expression for
the acceleration and plug it

00:32:30.778 --> 00:32:36.985
into here.
Plug in my operating force law.

00:32:36.985 --> 00:32:42.000
And, in so doing,
I am going to get --

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.046
-- e squared over 4 pi epsilon
nought r star squared.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.045
That is the F.
Mass times the acceleration,

00:33:04.045 --> 00:33:09.728
m times v squared over r star.
That is my equation of motion

00:33:09.728 --> 00:33:14.254
particular to this problem of a
planetary model.

00:33:14.254 --> 00:33:20.130
And now I can solve that for v
squared, the linear velocity of

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:23.790
that electron going around the
nucleus.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:29.376
That comes out to be e squared
over 4 pi epsilon nought m r

00:33:29.376 --> 00:33:34.000
star.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.374
Now, the reason I wanted to
calculate the velocity squared

00:33:39.374 --> 00:33:44.088
here is because I want to
calculate kinetic energy.

00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:47.671
And that is easy to do.
Kinetic energy,

00:33:47.671 --> 00:33:51.819
I will call K,
is one-half m times v squared.

00:33:51.819 --> 00:33:57.382
If I plug in
the v squared right in there,

00:33:57.382 --> 00:34:03.134
I get one-half e squared over 4
pi epsilon nought r star.

00:34:03.134 --> 00:34:10.193
So far, everything looks okay.

00:34:10.193 --> 00:34:15.730
We have a planetary model.
Coulomb's law is operable.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:21.585
We know the acceleration.
We just calculated the kinetic

00:34:21.585 --> 00:34:26.695
energy of this electron going
around the nucleus.

00:34:26.695 --> 00:34:33.296
What I want to do now is I want
to know the total energy of the

00:34:33.296 --> 00:34:37.826
system.
I just calculated the kinetic

00:34:37.826 --> 00:34:42.601
energy of the system,
but I want to know the total

00:34:42.601 --> 00:34:47.279
energy of the system.
And the total energy of the

00:34:47.279 --> 00:34:52.639
system, I am going to call this
capital E, total energy,

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:58.000
is the kinetic energy plus the
potential energy.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.526
And I want the total energy of
the system for two reasons.

00:35:02.526 --> 00:35:06.496
One is I want to show you that
the system is bound,

00:35:06.496 --> 00:35:10.069
that the total energy is going
to be negative,

00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:15.071
that it is lower than the total
energy when the electron and the

00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:19.200
nucleus are separated.
I want to show you that within

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.330
this classical model,
the electron and the nucleus do

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:26.585
look bound.
To do that, I need to show you

00:35:26.585 --> 00:35:32.724
the total energy is negative.
To do that, I need to calculate

00:35:32.724 --> 00:35:36.854
the potential energy.
That is what I want to do.

00:35:36.854 --> 00:35:41.951
Secondly, I want to get an
expression for the total energy.

00:35:41.951 --> 00:35:47.400
Because, using that expression,
I am going to show you how this

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.881
classical mechanics fails.
How Newton's equations of

00:35:51.881 --> 00:35:55.572
motion won't work to describe
this problem.

00:35:55.572 --> 00:36:01.231
Now, I have run out of time.
I will do that on Monday,

00:36:01.231 --> 00:36:04.892
but that is where we are going.
All right.

00:36:04.892 --> 00:36:06.092
See you on Monday.
