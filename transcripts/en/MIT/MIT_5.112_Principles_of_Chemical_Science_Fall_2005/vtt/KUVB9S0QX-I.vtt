00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Last time, we saw that these
electron configurations that you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
have been writing down are
nothing other than a shorthand

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
way of writing down the wave
functions for each electron in a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
multi-electron atom within the
one-electron wave approximation,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where we let every electron in
the system, or in the atom have

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
its own wave function.
And, as an approximation,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we gave it a hydrogen atom wave
function.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But we also saw that at most,
we gave two electrons a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
hydrogen atom wave function,
the same hydrogen atom wave

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
function.
And, of course,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
you already know that the
reason we did that is because of

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
this quantum mechanical concept
called spin, quantum mechanical

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
phenomenon called spin.
Spin is the intrinsic angular

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
momentum.
It is the angular momentum

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
built into the particle.
And that angular momentum comes

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
in sort of two polarities,
a spin up and a spin down,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
--
-- corresponding to the two

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
possible values of the spin
quantum number,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
m sub s,
that we looked at last time.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
m sub s can have the value plus
one-half, or it can have the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
value minus one-half.
We are about to talk,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
now, about how spin was
actually discovered.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And it was discovered by these
two gentlemen here,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
George Uhlenbeck and Sam
Goudsmit.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
They were really very young
scientists.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
They might have been post-docs
at the time.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
What they were looking at was
the emission spectra from sodium

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
atoms.
And this is 1925,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and so they already knew enough
about the electronic structure

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
to anticipate at what frequency
they ought to see emission from

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the sodium atoms.
And so they got a discharge

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
going, looked at the emission,
disbursed it,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and they thought that they
would see some emission at this

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
particular frequency.
But instead,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
what they saw was some emission
a little bit lower in frequency

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
than they expected and a little
bit higher in energy than what

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
they expected.
In spectroscopy,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
this kind of emission,
here, is called the doublet.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
A little lower and a little
higher.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
They looked at these results,
thought about it and said I

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
think we can understand those
two lines, those emissions at

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the two frequencies there,
if the electron,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in particular that extra s
electron in the sodium,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
existed in one of two spin
states.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
This was a revolutionary idea.
They were quite excited about

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
it.
They took the results of their

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
experiment and their
interpretation to the resident

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
established scientist at the
time that was closest to them,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
this guy, Wolfgang Pauli.
Wolfgang Pauli was not a nice

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
man.
They showed him the data and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
said, this makes sense if the
electron is in two different

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
spin states.
And Wolfgang Pauli said

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
rubbish.
You publish that and you will

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
wreck your young scientific
careers.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit let
dejectedly.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
No sooner than the door slammed
shut, Pauli sits down and writes

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
a paper on the presence of the
fourth quantum number,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
m sub s.
This is one of the best

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
well-known travesties of
science, now well-known.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And it actually took,
however, another three years

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and another gentleman,
Dirac, who actually wrote down

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the relativistic Schrödinger
equation and solved it.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
When you do that,
out drops this fourth quantum

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
number, m sub s.
However, Pauli did contribute

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to this problem in the sense
that he worked on the principles

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
behind these problems with
electrons being fermions,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
etc., which we won't go into.
Out of that work came something

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
called this, the Pauli Exclusion
Principle.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And the essence of that
principle is that no two

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
electrons in the same atom can
have the same electron wave

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
function and the same spin.
Or, another way to say that,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
no two electrons can have the
same set of four quantum

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
numbers.
For example,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
in our electron configuration
here of neon,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
this electron has the quantum
numbers 1, 0,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
0, plus one-half
for m sub s.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
This electron has the quantum
numbers 1, 0,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
0, minus one-half
for m sub s.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
These two electrons don't have
the same set of four quantum

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
numbers, and that is why we
could only put two electrons,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
here, in this 1s state.
Likewise, this electron,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
here, has the quantum numbers
2, 1, minus 1,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
plus one-half.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
This electron has the quantum
numbers 2, 1,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
minus 1, minus one-half.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
That is the Pauli Exclusion
Principle, which prevents us

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
from putting more than two
electrons in each one of these

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
states, 2s, 2s,
2px, 2pz, or 2py.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Now, what I want to do is try
to look at the wave functions

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and what they look like for the
electrons in the multi-electron

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
atom.
And, to look at their shapes,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
what we are going to do is
we're going to look at the

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
radial probability distribution
function.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Remember what the radial
probability distribution

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
function tells us?
It tells us the probability of

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
finding the electron between r
and r plus dr.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I plotted those radial
probability distribution

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
functions versus r for each one
of the electrons in the

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
different states for this
multi-electron atom,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
argon.
And what we want to do is we

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
want to compare and contrast
these wave functions for the

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
individual electrons in this
multi-electron atom to those of

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
hydrogen.
Well, first the similarities.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
If you look at the radial
probability distribution for the

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
1s wave function here,
what you see is that the radial

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
probability distribution is zero
at r equals zero,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
as all radial probability
distributions.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
That is not a radial node.
That probability distribution

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
increases, goes to a maximum,
and then decays exponentially

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
with r.
That is exactly what a 1s wave

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
function looks like for a
hydrogen atom.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
If you look at the 2s wave
function, it starts at r equals

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
zero, it goes up a bit and then
goes to zero.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Here is a radial node in the 2s
wave function.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And then goes back up.
Here is the most probable value

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
of r and then decays
exponentially.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Again, it has the same
structure as the 2s wave

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
function in the hydrogen atom.
The similarity is that all of

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
these wave functions have the
same kind of basic structure as

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that in a hydrogen atom.
They have the same number of

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
nodes, the same number of radial
nodes and the same number of

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
angular nodes.
The difference between these

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
wave functions and those of the
hydrogen atom is that all of

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
these wave functions are closer
in to the nucleus.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
For example,
if you looked here at what the

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
most probable value of r is for
that 1s electron in argon,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
it is 0.1 a nought.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
What is the most probable value
for r in the 1s state of

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
hydrogen?
a nought.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
This is ten times closer.
This is much closer to the

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
nucleus than it is in the
hydrogen atom.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And if we went and compared the
most probable values for 2s,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
2p for those of hydrogen and
3s, 3p for those of hydrogen,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
we would find that all of these
are much closer into the

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
nucleus.
Why?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Because the nucleus has a
larger positive charge on it.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The Coulomb interaction here is
the charge on the electron times

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the charge on the nucleus.
For argon, that charge is plus

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
18 times e.
That greater attractive

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
interaction holds those
electrons in closer to the

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
nucleus.
That is the bottom line.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
That is how these differ.
The structure is the same,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
node structure is the same,
they are just all closer into

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000
the nucleus because of that
greater attractive interaction.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Now that I have this radial
probability distribution

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
function up here,
I also want to use it to just

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
illustrate a concept that I
think you already know.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
That is this concept of a
shell.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
You know about the n equals 1
shell, n equals 2 shell,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
n equals 3 shell.
And the word shell also denotes

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
some kind of spatial
information.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I want to show you how the
spatial information is depicted,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
here, on this graph.
I want you to see that for the

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
n equals 3 states,
3s and 3p, well,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
the most probable value is not
exactly in the same place,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
but it is in the same place as
when you compare it to the 2s

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and the 2p.
You can see how well the n

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000
equals 3 shell is separated in
space from the n equals 2 shell.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Again, the most probable value
for 2s and 2p are not exactly in

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
the same place.
We saw that 2p is actually a

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
little closer than to 2s,
but in terms of comparing it to

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
where the most probable values
are for 3s and 3p,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that is much closer in.
And so this graph,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
here, gives you an idea of the
spatial information that is

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
denoted when we talk about
shells.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
The n equals 3 shell is further
out, the n equals 2 shell closer

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
in, and the n equals 1 shell
even closer in.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I think that is a concept that
you mostly know.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Here, you see it on the radial
probability distribution.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Now, we have taken a quick look
at those wave functions.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Now, it is time to actually
look at the energies of the

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
states.
We have not done that yet.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
On the left here,
I show an energy level diagram

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
for the hydrogen atom.
We saw this before.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Here is the n equals 1 state.
Here at n equals 2,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
we have four degenerate states.
Here at n equals 3,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
we have 9 degenerate states.
Here at n equals 4,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000
we have 16 degenerate states.
But the difference between the

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
hydrogen atom and any other
multi-electron atom,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
starting with helium,
are two differences.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
One is that the energies of
these states in the

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
multi-electron atom are all
lower than they are in the

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
hydrogen atom.
That is, the 1s state here is

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
lower in energy than the 1s
state in the hydrogen.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The 2s is lower than the 2s
state in hydrogen,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
the 3s is lower,
the 2p is lower,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
the 3p is lower,
etc.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
The energies of those states
are all lower.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Why?
Because of the charge on the

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
nucleus.
That potential energy of

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
interaction is greater because
the charge on the nucleus is

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
larger.
That greater potential energy

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
of interaction lowers the energy
of the states.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
It makes those electrons more
strongly bound.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Starting with helium,
all of these energies are lower

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
than those in the hydrogen atom.
That is the first difference.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
The second difference is,
you can see,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
now, that the 2s state is lower
in energy than the 2p state.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
The degeneracy between 2s and
2p in a hydrogen atom is lifted

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
or is broken,
as we say.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Likewise, the 3s state is lower
in energy than the 3p state,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
than the 3d state.
The degeneracy in those states

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
is lifted, or it is broken.
That is now what we have to

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
talk about, why that is the
case.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Why is 2s, for example,
lower in energy than 2p?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And the reason for this has to
do with the phenomenon called

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
shielding.
We have to talk about this

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
phenomenon, shielding,
and we have to talk about how

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
that leads to a concept called
effective charge.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
But to do that,
I am going to do the following.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I am going to realize that each
one of these energies here,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
E sub nl,
so now these energies are

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
labeled by both the principle
quantum number and the angular

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
momentum quantum number.
I am going to realize that

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
these energies here physically
are minus the ionization energy

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
because these energies are minus
the energy it is going to

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
require to rip the electron off
from that particular state.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And I am going to set those
binding energies equal to a

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
hydrogen atom like energy level
here.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And now I am going to use the
board and explain that just a

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
little bit more.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I said these energies,
which are now a function of n

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and l, they are minus the
ionization energy from that nl

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
state.
And I am going to approximate

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
that as a hydrogen atom kind of
an energy scheme.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
That is, I am going to set this
equal to R sub H,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
the Rydberg constant over n
squared.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Out here,
there is going to be a Z,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
but this Z is going to be Z
effective, Zeff.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And it is going to be squared,
of course.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And that Z is going to depend
on that particular nl state that

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
you are in.
This Z effective,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
here, is the effective nuclear
charge.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000
It is not the nuclear charge.
It is the effective nuclear

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
charge.
Why?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Well, because of shielding.
Let's try to explain that.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Let's take helium.
Z is equal to plus 2e.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
We have plus 2e here,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
and let's do a thought
experiment in that we are going

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000
to take electron number two,
here, and place it kind of

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
close to this plus 2 charged
nucleus.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And then we are going to have
electron number one way out

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
here.
In this case,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
with electron number one way
out here, the nuclear charge

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
that electron number one
experiences, because it is so

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
far out, kind of looks like a
plus one charge.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Because this electron,
on the average,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
is canceling one of the
positive charges on the nucleus.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
So, the effective charge here
for this electron way out there,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
we are going to say,
is plus one.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
If that is the
case, well, then the binding

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
energy of that electron is one
squared times R sub H over n

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
squared.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
We are going to consider n
equal one because we are going

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
to talk about the ground state
of the helium atom,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
here.
But you know what this value is

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
going to turn out to be.
It is going to turn out to be

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
minus 2.180x10^-18 joules.
That is the binding energy of

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
an electron in a hydrogen atom.
This is a thought experiment,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
now.
This is helium,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
this is just one electron way
out here, and it cannot

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000
discriminate too well between
the nucleus and this electron,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
so the overall effective charge
it sees is plus one.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
But now, we take the other
case.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
The other extreme case is we
are going to bring in electron

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000
one really close to the nucleus.
And electron two is way out

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
here such that it does not do
anything as far as this electron

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
is concerned.
And so this electron,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
in this case,
is experiencing the total

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
nuclear charge on the nucleus.
And so we say in this thought

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
case here, with this electron
really close,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
that the effective charge is
equal to plus 2e for this

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
electron.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Well, if that is the case,
we can calculate the binding

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
energy of this electron.
And that is going to be 2

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
squared R sub H over one
squared.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000
We can plug in R sub H.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And we are going to get minus
8.72x10^-18 joules.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
What this is is the binding
energy of an electron in helium

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
plus.
And so, in this extreme case,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
with the electron really close,
that is the binding energy.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
With this extreme case,
with the electron way far out,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
this is the binding energy.
This is total shielding.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
This case is no shielding.
The electron is much more

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000
strongly bound.
The reality is that the binding

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.000
energy of an electron in helium
is somewhere in between.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.000
That is, the ionization energy
for helium, for an electron in

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.000
now neutral helium here,
is 3.94x10^-18 joules.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Somewhere in between this
extreme case of total shielding

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
and this extreme case of no
shielding at all.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
And that is because,
on the average,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000
there is another electron in
between that electron and the

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
nucleus.
And we can calculate the

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
effective charge,
then, from the experimental

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
binding energies by just taking
this expression and rearranging

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
it.
I am going to solve that

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
expression for the effective
charge, Zeff.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
And, when I do that that,
add, of course,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
this n squared times the
ionization energy over the

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Rydberg constant.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
n squared is going to be one
because we are talking about the

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
ground state.
The ionization energy,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
I said, was 3.94x10^-18 joules.
The Rydberg constant is

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
2.180x10^-18 joules.
In the end, I find an effective

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
charge here of plus 1.34.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Again, why is that the case?
Well, that is the case because

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
here is my electron,
here is my helium nucleus and,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
just on the average,
between this electron and the

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
nucleus there is always another
electron around.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.000
This electron kind of partially
shields this nuclear charge.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
It partially shields it so that
we calculated,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000
from using this scheme and
using the experimental

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
ionization energies,
an effective charge of 1.34.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000
So now, we sort of understand
shielding and effective charge.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
That is a square root,
thank you.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
All right.
Now, we have to use this idea

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000
of effective charge and
shielding to understand why the

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
2s state is lower in energy than
the 2p state.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
And here comes that.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Let's think about the lithium
atom.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
The electron confirmation of
lithium is 1s 2 2s 1.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
The electron configuration of

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
lithium is not 1s 2 2p 1.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Why?
Because 2s is lower in energy

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
than 2p.
But why is that the case?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Well, to look at that,
we have to look at the radial

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000
probability distribution
functions for 2s and 2p.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Here is a radial probability
distribution function for 2s.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Here is the radial probability
distribution function for 2p.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Now, you have to do a thought
experiment, here.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
In this 2s radial probability
distribution function,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
what you see is that there is
some finite probability of the

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
electron in the 2s state being
really close to the nucleus.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
For the sake of the argument,
here, I am going to say that

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
for this part of the probability
distribution function,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
the effective charge Zeff is
going to be plus 3e.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
I mean, that is an exaggeration

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
because obviously we have some s
electrons.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
But for the sake of this
argument, I am going to say the

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
effective charge for this part
of the probability distribution

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
function is plus 3e.
For this part of the

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
probability distribution
function for 2s that is much

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
further out.
And I have those 1s electrons

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
closer in.
So, for the sake of this

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
argument, I am going to say that
these s electrons completely

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
shield the nuclear charge.
And so, the effective charge

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
for this part of the
distribution is plus 1e.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Now, what about 2p?
Well, in the case of 2p,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
you can see that this 2p wave
function, although it is a

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
little bit closer in,
for the most part it is about

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
in the same place as the second
lobe here of the 2s wave

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
function.
We are going to say that this

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
effective charge is plus 1e,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
just like this lobe of the 2s
wave function.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
But now, to get the kind of
total effective charge,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
I am going to have to take the
effective charge and average it

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
over this probability
distribution function.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
And so, since in the 2s
function I am going to average

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
over a part that has a plus 3
effective charge and a part that

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000
has a plus 1 effective charge.
Well, if I average over that,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000
that is going to be larger than
the effective charge of this 2p

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
wave function because the 2p
everywhere is plus one.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
The effective charge here for
the 2s is going to be greater,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
on the average,
than for the 2p.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Because of this part of the
probability distribution

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
function, this part that is
really close to the nucleus,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
where the electrons can feel
more of the nuclear charge or

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
experience more of the nuclear
charge than they could if they

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
were a 2p electron.
Therefore, since that 2s

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
electron has a greater effective
charge, here,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
what that is going to mean is
that the binding energy of the

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
2s state is going to be lower in
energy.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
It is going to be more negative
than the binding energy of the

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
2p state.
The same thing for 3s and 3p.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
The same reasoning there.
And it is all because of this

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
little part of the probability
distribution function.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Now we can understand why the
2s is, in fact,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
lower in energy than the 2p.
Yeah?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Because the 3s,
although it does,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
in fact, have this,
it is a little bit further out

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
here, enough to make for this to
compensate.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
But, again, 3s is lower than
3p.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
We are just going to compare 3s
and 3p within the same shell.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Yes, it does have to do with
the net area underneath.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
If the probability was much
higher, and it is not that much

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
higher, but if it were then you
are right, it could cancel it

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
out.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Now, therefore,
we are ready to write the

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
electron configurations of all
the atoms on the Periodic Table.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
And you already know that we
use the Aufbau Principle to do

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
that.
Aufbau means building up.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
What do you do?
You take all the allowed states

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
and order them according to
their energy.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Most strongly bound or most
negative energy goes on the

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
bottom, and next most negative
energy, on and on.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And we will talk about a
pneumonic for remembering those

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
energies in a moment.
We use the Aufbau principle.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
We start with the lowest energy
state and we put an electron in

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
for hydrogen.
There it is,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
the 1s state.
For helium, well,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
we also put that into the 1s
state.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Except, as we fill these
states, we have to heed the

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Pauli Exclusion Principle.
This electron,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
here, goes in with the opposite
spin.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Next lithium,
2s electron.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
For beryllium,
another 2s electron,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
opposite spin.
And then for nitrogen,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000
electron, here,
has to go into the 2p state.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Now, it does not matter whether
you put it in 2px,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
2py or 2pz.
They are all the same energy.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
The next electron,
carbon, what are we going to do

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
here?
Well, here we have to obey

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000
something called Hund's Rule.
And Hund's Rule says that when

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
electrons are added to states of
the same energy,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
and that is what we are doing
here in the 2p,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
a single electron enters each
state before a second electron

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000
enters any state.
And, those single electrons

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
have to go in so that the
resulting spins are parallel.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
That is, they have the same
spin.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Do we put in an electron like
this?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
No.
Do we put it in like that?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
No.
Do we put it in like this?

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Yeah, according to Hund's Rule.
And then the next electron has

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000
to go into that other empty p
state before any of these states

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
double up.
Then we keep doubling them up.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
The next electron has to go
into the next state 3s.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Again, we double them up.
Now we are to the 3p state

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
again.
One electron goes into 2px.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
The next electron will go into
either 2py or 2pz,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
according to Hund's Rule,
and the spins remain parallel

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
to get the lowest energy
configuration.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And then the next electron 2pz.
And then we start doubling up.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And we keep going.
You keep going in that way so

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
that you write the electron
configuration of all the atoms

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
in the Periodic Table.
Let's look at these electron

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
configurations kind of quickly
here.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Let's start with the third
period, the third row here,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
sodium going across here to
argon.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Here is the electron
configuration for sodium.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Notice here that I don't mind
if you write that electron

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
configuration as 2p 6
instead of 2px,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
2py, 2pz.
Because you cannot tell the

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
difference between x,
y, and z, anyway,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
if you are not in a magnetic
field.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
These electrons here in sodium
that make up the inert gas

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
configuration of argon,
of course, are the core

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
electrons.
When we talk about core

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
electrons, we are talking about
the electrons that make up the

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
nearest rare gas configuration.
And then the valance electron,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
well, is the electrons that are
beyond the nearest but lowest

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
inert gas configurations.
And also, when you are writing

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
these electron configurations,
say, for sodium,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
you can write it as the neon
configuration and then just show

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
the valence electron, 3s 1.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
As we go across that third
period here everything is very

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
normal.
3s fills up first and then the

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
3p's fill up.
Now we get to the fourth

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
period, from potassium to
krypton.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Fourth period,
what happens here is that those

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
first two electrons go into the
s states.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
They do not go into the 3d
states.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000
They don't because those s
states are lower in energy than

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
the 3d states.
And so these electron

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
configurations are argon 4s 1,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
argon 4s 2 **[Ar]4s^2**.
And then, once we fill those 4s

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
states, we start filling the 3d
states.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Here is scandium,
here is titanium,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
here is vanadium,
everything is normal,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
3d 1, 3d 2,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
3d 3,
and then we get to chromium.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
We have an exception here,
chromium.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Chromium is not what you would
expect.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
It is not 4s 2 3d 4.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Chromium is 4s 1 3d 5.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
There is no way for you to know
that a priori,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
unless you do a very
sophisticated calculation,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
but this is experimentally
observed that this is the

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
configuration.
Why?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Because it is lower in total
energy than this configuration.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
It turns out that there is some
extra stability in having a half

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
filled 4s shell and a half
filled 3d sub-shell compared to

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000
having a filled 4s shell and a
less than half filled 3d shell.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
This is an exception that you
do have to know.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
But after chromium,
here, manganese behaves well.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Iron behaves well.
Cobalt okay.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Nickel okay.
And now we get to copper,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000
and we have a problem.
It is not what you would

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
expect.
It is not 4s 2 3d 9.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Instead, it is 4s 1 3d 10.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
*Again, this configuration is

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
something you could not have
predicted a priori.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
If you do a sophisticated
calculation you can see it,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
but this is also experimentally
observed.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
We know this to be the
configuration.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
This is not the configuration.
This is the lower energy

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
configuration.
Here is another exception that

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
you have to know,
copper.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
And then after copper here,
zinc, things follow a pattern

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
again.
The next electron,
513
00:39:08,000 --&gt; 00:00:10,000
then, just fills up the 4s 2 3d

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Now, at gallium,
all of those are filled.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
We start filling up the 4p
states.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Everything is fine until we get
to krypton.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000
So, you have to know chromium
and copper.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Now, the fifth row here,
starting with rubidium,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
strontium, ytterbium,
zirconium, etc.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
all the way across here.
Starting with rubidium,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
again, the electrons go into
the 5s shell.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
They do not go into the 4d.
That is because with rubidium

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
and strontium,
5s is actually lower than 4d.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
And it is only once you fill up
the 5s states that you start

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
filling up the 4d states right
here.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Now, there are exceptions along
this fifth row.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
The two exceptions,
molybdenum and silver,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000
are the same kind of exceptions
as chromium and copper.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000
You have to know the exceptions
for silver and copper and

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
molybdenum and chromium.
The same identical kind of

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
exception as in the fourth row
here.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
There are other exceptions
along this fifth row.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
You do not have to know those.
There is really no way,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
a priori, for you to know that.
Again, it is an experimental

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
observation.
A sophisticated hard

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
calculation will also show that.
And then, once you are done

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
with cadmium,
well, then the 5p's start

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
filling and everything is normal
and you get to the xenon inner

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
gas configuration.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
How do you remember what the
ordering is of these states,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
the energy ordering?
Well, here is a pneumonic that

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
maybe some of you have seen
before.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Start out and write 1s,
then write 2s right below it

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
and then 2p to the side of it.
And then write 3s,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
3p, 3d.
And then write 4s,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
4p, 4d, 4f.
And then write 5s,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
5p, 5d, 5f, and 6s,
6p, 6d, and 7s,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
7p.
And now, to get the energy

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
ordering we are going to draw
diagonals.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Well, first of all,
the 1s is the lowest energy

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
state, and then the next highest
energy state is the 2s state,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
and then the next highest
energy state is the 2p.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
We are going to draw a
diagonal.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
The next state to fill is 2p.
The next one is 3s.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Now we are going to draw a
diagonal again.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
The next one to fill is 3p.
The next one to fill is 4s.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Draw another diagonal.
The next one to fill is 3d,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
4p, 5s.
4d, 5p, 6s.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
4f, 5d, 6p, 7s.
5s, 6d, 7p, and that is all

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000
that is going to be important.
That is one way to remember the

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000
relative energy orderings here.
And you do have to be able to

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000
write this down on an exam.
You will have a Periodic Table,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000
but it won't have the electron
configurations on it.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Now, I am going to tell you
something that sometimes people

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
find a little bit confusing.
That is, the electron

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
configuration of ions.
What I am about to say has no

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
effect on what I just said about
how to write the electron

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000
configuration for neutrals.
This does not affect anything

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
in your writing down the
electron configuration for

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
neutrals.
This is for ions.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
The point I want to make is
that if you actually look at the

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:56.000
energies of the individual 3d
states and 4s states across that

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
fourth row, this is what they
look like.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
For example,
at potassium,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
that 4s state is lower in
energy than the 3d state.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000
That is why we put the electron
in the 4s state when we wrote

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
the neutral.
The same thing for calcium.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
That is why we put that
electron into the 4s state and

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
not the 3s state.
Lo and behold,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
right here at scandium,
Z equals 21.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
What happens is that the 3d
state actually drops below in

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
energy than the 4s state.
These are the energies of the

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
individual state now,
and that continues all the way

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
across the Periodic Table.
However, that does not affect

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
how you write the electron
configuration of the neutrals.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
For example,
if you are writing the electron

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
configuration for titanium,
here it is.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
It is the argon core,
4s 2 3d 2.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
And, by the way,
I don't care whether you write

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
3d 2 4s 2 or 4s 2 3d 2.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
You can write them in either
order.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Now, you might say,
well, why is this the electron

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
configuration if at this value
for Z, Z equals 22,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.000
titanium, the 3d state is lower
than the 4s state?

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Why don't these 4s electrons
just hop into the 3d states?

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Well, they don't do that
because this electron

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
configuration actually minimizes
the electron repulsions.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
If these four electrons were in
the 3d state,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
well, then the repulsive
interactions would be greater.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Because they are in the same
state now.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
And, therefore,
the entire energy of the atom

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
will be larger.
And it is the entire energy,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
the total energy of the atom
that is important when we look

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
at the electron configurations.
In this particular case,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
if we look at the individual d
states and the 4s states,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
yeah, the d states are lower in
energy.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
But what is important is when
we sum up all of the energies of

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
the interactions,
what is lower?

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
What I am saying to you is that
when we do that,

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
when we sum up all of the
interaction energies,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
this still is the lower energy
configuration,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
even though the 3d electrons at
this value of Z,

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.000
those 3d states are lower in
energy than the 4s states.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
That is why we do not have this
hoping over into the 3d states

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
for the neutral.
Now, here comes the ion

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
configuration.
If you have this configuration

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
for the neutral,
and now you ionize titanium to

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000
make titanium plus,
the electron configuration is

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
argon 3d 2.
That is, it is the 4s electrons

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
that come off,
that are plucked out.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
They are plucked out because
they are the higher energy

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
electrons now.
This is the electron
624
00:47:41,127 --&gt; 00:00:02,000
configuration for titanium plus

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
We are going to pull out those
higher energy electrons,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
which are the 4s electrons.
Again, this affects only the

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000
ion configuration.
The same thing happens here on

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000
the fifth row.
The fifth row starting here

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
with rubidium and strontium,
5s is lower in energy than 4d.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
That is why that rubidium
electron went in the 5s state.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
The same thing with the
strontium electron,

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
it went in the 5s state.
But right here at ytterbium,

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
the 4d state goes below in
energy the 5s state.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Again, that does not affect how
you write the electron

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
configuration of a neutral.
For example,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:42.000
silver, which is way out here
and is one of those exceptions,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
if you ionize it,
if you pluck off an electron,

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
which electron is going to go?
5s.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:57.000
And so the silver plus one
configuration is the

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
krypton core, 4d 10.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
It is that 5s electron that is
going to disappear.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.000
This is important.
Do not let it confuse you with

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000
the writing the electron
configurations of the neutrals.

00:49:19.276 --> 00:49:22.000
Okie-dokie.
See you Friday.
