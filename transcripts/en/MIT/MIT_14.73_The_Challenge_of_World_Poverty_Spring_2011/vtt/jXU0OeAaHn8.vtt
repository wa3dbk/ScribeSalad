00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.610
PROFESSOR: So this is a really,
really, really, really

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.780
stunning fact in a sense of we
talk about lots of forms of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.830
inequality and unfairness
in the world.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.074
But here's a fact that's
really quite,

00:00:43.074 --> 00:00:45.700
quite, quite striking.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.895
You start from the basic,
just the fact.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.200
It's the fact that if you look
at the ratio of men and women

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.780
in the population, most
countries in the world have

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.080
many more women than men.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.900
This is mostly because
women are just better

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.460
designed, it turns out.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.830
When men get to the age of about
60, various bad things

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.520
happen to them.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.410
In particular, their arteries
seem to harden.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.170
And lots of them die
from various

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.460
cardiovascular diseases.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.390
So as a result, most countries
have many more women than men.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.020
So the ratios up there,
Europe has 1.05.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:54.190
Sub-Saharan Africa has 1.02.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.900
All of Latin America
is above 1.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.490
The US is about 1.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.340
And while it doesn't look like a
lot, 4%, we're talking about

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.310
4% of 3 billion.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.690
So that's a fair number
of extra women

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.570
we're talking about.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.620
The world has many more women
than men overall.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.310
But the one place where that's
not true is in this belt which

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.780
goes from basically North
Africa to Korea.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.140
That's that one belt in the
world pretty much all the way.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.920
You can draw a belt starting
somewhere in Morocco and keep

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.820
going east, about at
that latitude.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.780
And then go a bit north into
China, and you'll find that

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.460
that's where they are about
4% or less women than men.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.690
These numbers are not
necessarily the worst numbers

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.320
you're going to see.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.300
So I'll show you some more
striking numbers in a minute.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.590
I mean, just the fact that
there's 6% less women than men

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.210
is striking, given that that
doesn't look like the

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.460
biological model.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.720
So Amartya Sen, who was a Nobel
Prize winner at Harvard

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.290
did this calculation, basically
very simple

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.550
calculation.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.700
He said, look, Sub-Saharan
Africa is the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.080
poorest part of the world.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.680
So if there is some maybe
institutional reason why women

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.310
die, so there might be reasons
why women die that have to do

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.010
with poverty.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.640
What's an example of a reason,
which would hurt women more

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.880
than men, reason why
poverty would hurt

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.816
women more than men?

00:04:07.816 --> 00:04:09.160
AUDIENCE: During childbirth.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.260
PROFESSOR: Childbirth, the
obvious one is childbirth.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.750
Yeah?

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.160
AUDIENCE: And then compounding
upon that, if women in poor

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.426
situations have less access to
contraceptives and have more

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.060
children, which increases
the lack [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.434
There will be complications
for [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:25.950
PROFESSOR: So everything to do
with childbirth is reason why

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.330
you might think that in poor
countries, women will have a

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.990
disadvantage.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.360
You do see evidence of
the disadvantage.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.250
Sub-Saharan Africa has less
women than Europe.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.320
So you do see an example
of that disadvantage.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.100
It's about 2 percentage points
or 3 percentage points less

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.320
women than Europe.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.110
If you think of Sub-Saharan
Africa as the part of the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.860
world which has the highest
maternal mortality rates.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.220
It's the part of the world
which has the highest

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.180
fertility rates.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.460
Both to your point and your
point, if you take the part of

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.770
the world where women are most
likely to die in childbirth,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.960
and the place where women have
the most children, both of

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.590
those are highest in
Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.620
So you could think of this
as being a reasonable

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.350
approximation of the worst
case scenario.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.850
Take the worst case scenario
and then go to China.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.270
So that's the exercise.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.570
Let's take the worst
case scenario.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.440
Now go to China and ask, if
we applied the Sub-Saharan

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.650
African ratio to the Chinese
population, how many more

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.370
women would they have had?

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.450
The answer is they would have
had 44 million more women.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.420
So 44 million more women
are missing.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.900
And you keep doing that, and
same order of magnitude in

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.640
India, and then smaller
countries, so smaller numbers,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.850
but it all adds up toward
100 million.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.090
So you get about 100 million
missing women in the world by

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.300
doing this simple exercise.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.690
And that's sort of prima
facie evidence.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.690
As we'll see, you have to think
harder about exactly

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.950
what this evidence means.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.820
This is prima facie evidence
of something

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.070
very bizarre happening.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.330
We'll see what's
going on here.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.150
But there's something very
troubling about this fact.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.640
Because it seems like somehow
populations are managing to

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.970
get rid of women, quote unquote,
"losing women"

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.120
through mechanisms which are
not the normal biological

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.370
mechanisms.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.720
So that's the missing women.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.020
Yeah?

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.120
AUDIENCE: So this order for
killing women in China, are

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.790
they missing in rural China?

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.700
Or is it just all
around China?

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.925
PROFESSOR: I'll show
you in a minute.

00:07:00.925 --> 00:07:03.300
I'll show you all kinds of facts
about China, in fact.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.790
So before I come to that,
there's just some hypotheses

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.970
you might have.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:21.370
One is, is development
the answer?

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:33.640
Maybe there's some reason why
just being undeveloped for

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.630
reasons we don't understand
translates into less women.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.950
Maybe we have a theory that
maybe it's the case that

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.830
people are more traditional,
something.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.010
Now what makes this fact much
more worrying is that

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.870
development is not making
this fact go away.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:58.940
That's sort of at least
within modern history.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.320
We don't know what happened
100 years ago.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.380
But right now, development is
not making this fact go away.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.090
If you look at the sex ratio in
India, it's not changing.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.250
It's in fact pretty
much steady.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.770
I'll show you numbers
in a minute.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.950
If you look at the sex ratio
in China, it's falling.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.740
It's less and less women
every year in China.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.450
And if you look at the richest
parts of China versus the

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.640
poorest part to your question,
you see a negative

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.260
correlation.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.419
The riches parts of China
are the ones which

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.010
have the least women.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.066
Yeah?

00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:42.561
AUDIENCE: Do we know anything
about missing men?

00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:46.553
Maybe there's some component
where there's just a general

00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:49.048
[INAUDIBLE] for children in
some parts of the world.

00:08:49.048 --> 00:08:51.044
And the number of children
in total are missing,

00:08:51.044 --> 00:08:54.510
not just the girls.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.650
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:00.380
I think that's what people do
when they say, the infant

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.290
mortality rate is too
high or something.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:08.800
And I think that that's
also a concern.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.910
It's not that there
aren't other

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.160
concerns because of this.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.790
A lot of people would say that
you shouldn't just look at GDP

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.230
to measure welfare.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.880
Emphasize infant mortality
rates.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.360
Infant mortality rates is
exactly the question you're

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.570
asking, missing boys
and girls.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.900
That number is very high
in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.280
Sub-Saharan Africa has the
highest infant mortality rate

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.040
in the world by far.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.490
China has now infant mortality
rates which are approaching

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.410
that in the US.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:52.440
So infant morality rates by
itself, by now it's not a huge

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.770
problem in China.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:58.330
China is down to the range
where it's very, very

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.760
close to the US.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.497
I think it has infant mortality
rates of like 25 our

00:10:02.497 --> 00:10:04.890
of 1,000, 1,000 live births.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.660
US has 18 or 14 or something.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.700
It's really in the range, where
Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.520
Sierra Leone has 140.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.260
So if you want to see where
infant mortality is a problem,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.655
that's not where missing
women is a problem.

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:24.270
These are different problems.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.870
It's not to say you're
not right.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:26.740
That's another problem.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.190
But it's a different one.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:39.300
So this is sort of just
to show you that fact.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.770
So what I showed you so far
was the levels, how

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.830
many women per men.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:11:00.170
This is, in 2005, what's
the future.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.920
Future's much more scary
than the present.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.170
The present is what--

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.440
there was like 95 girls
per 100 boys.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.440
So that's about 105 boys
per 100 girls.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.990
That's the current.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.555
The future, look at the number
for Eastern Asia.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:33.680
That number is 120 boys
for 100 girls.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.980
It's a completely different
order of magnitude.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.590
Think of the future.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.942
These are the kids who are
being born under five.

00:11:41.942 --> 00:11:45.930
So at point, if this is what
stays steady, we are going to

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:51.830
see numbers more like
120 than 105.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.640
Right now there are 105 boys
to 100 girls in China.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.340
And that number is going to go
up to closer to 120 as this

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.510
cohort ages.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.505
So that's just backing up the
first claim I made, which is

00:12:09.505 --> 00:12:10.880
it's not getting better.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.230
If you look at the number
for India, it's 108.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:21.960
108 is bigger than the
current ratio of

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.630
men to women in India.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.155
So current ratio is about
106, and that's 108.

00:12:27.155 --> 00:12:30.200
So all of these countries,
which are getting richer,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.250
their ratio is getting worse.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.660
Do you see what this is, how it
this is different from the

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.910
one I showed you before?

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.320
This is the ratio among
under fives.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.120
So these are the future of the
population, whereas I showed

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.200
you the present of
the population.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.450
Future's worse, not better.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.725
Korea has the same kind of
numbers, which are worse.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:11.710
Interestingly, Afghanistan and
Nepal, which are relatively

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.110
poor countries, are not getting
rich very fast,

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.550
actually you don't see
much of a change.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.800
They're about where they were.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.780
Under five is about what they
are in the adult population.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.590
So that suggests that they
aren't getting worse.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.255
It's the richer countries
that are getting

00:13:28.255 --> 00:13:29.630
richer are getting worse.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.091
Yep?

00:13:30.091 --> 00:13:31.935
AUDIENCE: But wouldn't you
expect this number to be

00:13:31.935 --> 00:13:36.300
higher than the overall
population because women are

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.620
more likely to live longer
and more [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.760
PROFESSOR: That's
absolutely true.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.700
So 121 go to 120.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.930
120 is going to go to 115.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.300
That's about the difference.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.030
So 120 is going to
do 115 of 14.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:57.840
But 114 is a lot
worse than 106.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.332
All of the trends are bad.

00:14:00.332 --> 00:14:02.940
Just to understand, this
is a big problem.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.270
And it's not one that's getting
solved on its own as

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.490
far as I can tell.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.530
So here's another way
to look at it.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.455
So this is India and China.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.600
Give yourself a few minutes
to look at this.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.910
So the darkest areas are
the worst areas.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.590
Does anybody know which are
the richer areas of China?

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:49.964
AUDIENCE: The black areas?

00:14:49.964 --> 00:14:53.516
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's pretty
much exactly the same.

00:14:53.516 --> 00:14:58.040
I think Shanghai is that gray
area right there, which is

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.040
actually doing surprisingly
well.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:08.000
The really poor areas of China
are those very light

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.550
areas in the west.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.310
That's the Gobi Desert, the

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.480
Taklamakan Desert, the Chinkiang.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.890
All the areas with large Muslim

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.140
populations are in the east.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.880
These are the poorest parts of
China, and they're the ones

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.020
which are doing by
far the best.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.580
The areas that are being really
badly are the most

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.510
prosperous.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:39.210
The dark areas in the southeast,
that's like

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:43.350
Guangdong, and Guangzhou, and
all these really fast-growing,

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.820
wealthy provinces of China,
that's the southeast.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.470
Yeah?

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.782
AUDIENCE: So I'm not really sure
exactly how [INAUDIBLE],

00:15:57.782 --> 00:16:01.439
but the fact that there is
[INAUDIBLE] in the number of

00:16:01.439 --> 00:16:03.510
kids that couples can have.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.304
You know, people might be
deciding on purpose to have

00:16:07.304 --> 00:16:10.208
boys because they want boys
for whatever reason.

00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:13.959
And maybe the people who make
those decision are people to

00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:17.960
have more money, because to have
abortions is expensive.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.880
PROFESSOR: I think that has
a lot to do with it.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.940
We'll come back to it.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:26.400
You're perfectly right that a
lot of this ease has something

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.656
to do with people's active
choices also.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:32.150
I'll come back to that
in a little.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.990
As China gets even richer,
because this is the trend, and

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.780
it's a worrying trend,
let's say.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.060
Now look at India.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:54.383
Again, do you know what those
relatively pale areas are?

00:16:54.383 --> 00:16:55.830
AUDIENCE: South India?

00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:00.210
PROFESSOR: The South India,
which is relatively prosperous

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:06.430
and well-educated, and East
India which is the poorest and

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.680
the most backward
part of India.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:23.334
Richest state in India, large
state in India, is

00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:29.270
Maharashtra, which is kind
of the striped state.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:34.180
Let's see, on the west coast,
if you go from the south on

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.940
the west coast, the first
striped one, that's

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:37.390
Maharashtra.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.990
That's the richest.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:45.530
The second richest large state
is Punjab And Punjab is that

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.520
piece of black that's
right in the north.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.330
So that's literally the second
richest, and still recently

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.580
the richest state in India,
is that area in black.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.420
So again, the same pattern--

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.640
rich states have worse outcomes,
not better outcomes.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:11.210
And there's no evidence of a
positive correlation between

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:16.246
income and the gender ratio.

00:18:16.246 --> 00:18:20.190
AUDIENCE: Is Punjab the only
state in India that has a

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.148
different religion than the
rest of the others?

00:18:23.148 --> 00:18:24.630
Or would that be a reason?

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.880
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.370
What that is is there's really
two states there.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.060
There is Punjab and Haryana.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.690
They used to be both
a part of Punjab.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.120
Now they've been split into
two states for some years.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.720
But one of those states
is Sheik majority.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.500
Sheik is a particular
other religion.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.580
The other is Hindu majority.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.450
There's no difference.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.750
Actually, Haryana's slightly
worse that Punjab.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:54.500
Delhi City is one of the worst
places, actually, in India.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.950
So that's one of the absolutely
riches places.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.920
So basically no evidence of a
positive correlation between

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.440
income and the gender ratio--

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.660
gender ratio, if anything, gets
worse as you get richer,

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.770
for reasons that may very
be close to what you're

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:13.270
suggesting.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.080
But it's clear that you get this
rather dismal pattern.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.900
Here's something else, another
fact about sort of China.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.580
And it's sort of a very long
term view of China.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.680
This starts in 1920.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:47.120
And you can see that basically
from the 1920s the excess sex

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:54.380
ratio, which is in the five-year
birth cohort.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.380
So people who were born in that
year, what's the fraction

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.280
of boys versus girls?

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:09.320
So it used to be about 7%
more boys than girls.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.830
Then it went up to about 16%
during the years when there's

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.730
a lot of political
instability.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.180
So if you think of those years
as Japanese invasion, before

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.990
that and after that, in a sense,
China is in civil war.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.910
What are called the warlords
are fighting each other

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:29.780
through China.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.430
So during wars, you see this
ratio going way up.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.470
Then it comes in down, down,
down, down, down, down, down,

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:41.820
down, till about 1976
or something.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:47.310
Now right around 1976 something
else happens.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.060
China introduces what's called
the one child policy.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:55.180
The one child policy is one
where at least in the richer

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.850
areas, where it was the only
place it was enforced,

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.146
families were allowed to have
only one child at most.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:10.350
Then that policy gets
implemented in the mid '70s.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.950
And you see what's
happened since.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.220
What's striking is it doesn't
just go up and stay up.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.180
It keeps going up.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.810
So there's something else going
on on top of the fact

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.030
that the one child policy
gets instituted.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.760
In fact, over time, the one
child policy has been relaxed.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.550
And this reflects some
of the tests of

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.920
the population clearly.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.070
Families which had one daughter
in some areas were

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:43.250
allowed to have a son or have a
second child more recently.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.100
So there's some attempt to relax
the policy in exactly

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.390
the direction that suggests
that there's a

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.150
preference for boys.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:55.360
But with all that, the
trend has been up.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.240
Yep?

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.165
AUDIENCE: Do you know what's
happened to those policies?

00:21:58.165 --> 00:21:59.985
Were they implemented,
[INAUDIBLE] relaxation?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.860
PROFESSOR: A bunch to the
relaxations happen.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.810
You see they're flattening
in about 1982.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.060
That's the first relaxation.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:17.680
So you do see a flattening,
but the trend is bad.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.025
Yeah?

00:22:19.025 --> 00:22:21.110
AUDIENCE: Even if it's being
relaxed, just being relaxed,

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:26.074
if the first kid that you have
is a girl, and then in that

00:22:26.074 --> 00:22:27.493
case, you might then
try to have a boy?

00:22:27.493 --> 00:22:30.325
But if they had the boy right
away, maybe they'd just stop

00:22:30.325 --> 00:22:31.500
having kids.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.290
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.060
Actually, let's take it.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:42.220
So could this be generated
by a stopping rule?

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.980
So imagine that families have a
stopping rule which says, we

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:54.810
will stop when we have
the first boy.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.410
This is their stopping rule.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.930
This is a plausible
stopping rule.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:05.450
My mother has one brother
and three sisters.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.390
The brother's the youngest.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.640
So that's not an implausible
stopping rule.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.250
My mother's only brother has
three daughters and once son.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.280
The son is the youngest.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.660
It's not an implausible
stopping rule.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:26.240
However, imagine we had
this stopping rule.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.410
But in any but, the probability
of boy and girl

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.790
would equal.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.180
What would be the population
sex ratio?

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.644
AUDIENCE: Still the same.

00:23:38.644 --> 00:23:39.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
boys, right?

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.572
No, you'd have more women.

00:23:41.572 --> 00:23:43.524
AUDIENCE: No, it's half.

00:23:43.524 --> 00:23:44.988
PROFESSOR: Which one?

00:23:44.988 --> 00:23:48.892
AUDIENCE: If you keep having
children when you have women,

00:23:48.892 --> 00:23:52.198
then you stop as soon as you
have one boy, you'd have more

00:23:52.198 --> 00:23:55.174
women, or you would
expect more women.

00:23:55.174 --> 00:23:56.662
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:56.662 --> 00:23:57.912
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:01.622
You stop immediately.

00:24:01.622 --> 00:24:04.102
You stop immediately if
you have one son.

00:24:04.102 --> 00:24:07.078
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:09.558
There might be a family where
there are more girls

00:24:09.558 --> 00:24:10.808
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:17.650
But most families
will stop there.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.818
PROFESSOR: So do you think
they'll be more [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:23.818 --> 00:24:26.806
AUDIENCE: I think it pretty
much evens out.

00:24:26.806 --> 00:24:29.046
AUDIENCE: I think there will be
more boys, because if you

00:24:29.046 --> 00:24:30.292
have a boy, you just stop.

00:24:30.292 --> 00:24:31.786
So then that family
just has a boy.

00:24:31.786 --> 00:24:34.774
And if you have a girl and then
you try again, if you

00:24:34.774 --> 00:24:37.762
have a boy, then right now you
have one family with one boy

00:24:37.762 --> 00:24:39.256
and another family with
a girl and a boy.

00:24:39.256 --> 00:24:41.248
But there's still more
boys than girls.

00:24:41.248 --> 00:24:43.490
So whenever you get to
a boy, you stop.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.378
PROFESSOR: You want to
come back to that?

00:24:45.378 --> 00:24:48.035
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and so if we
just do an expected values,

00:24:48.035 --> 00:24:49.826
and you get half.

00:24:49.826 --> 00:24:52.316
Half the cases you'll
have one boy.

00:24:52.316 --> 00:24:54.310
What are the cases
of girl and boy?

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.470
PROFESSOR: You're
exactly right.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.640
The answer is it doesn't
change anything.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.900
And it's very simple to see.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.000
The reason why it
doesn't change

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.570
anything is very simple.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:06.930
Which is that every but has a
50% chance of having a boy.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.340
So just take the number buts.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.620
Forget about families.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.460
There's a certain
number of buts.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.890
Let's say 50 million buts.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.680
25 million of those
buts will be boys.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.580
And 25 million of those
buts with be girls.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.800
It doesn't matter which
family it happens.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.220
Every but is a separate,
independent event and has a

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.080
50% chance of being a boy.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.010
So paradoxical as it sounds,
stopping girls don't change

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.000
the sex ratio.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.750
They change the distribution.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.930
Now here's what might be
going on, which is more

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.306
complication.

00:25:38.306 --> 00:25:38.804
Yeah?

00:25:38.804 --> 00:25:42.790
AUDIENCE: But again, but the
relaxation is now there.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.242
Like, it's completely relaxed.

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:45.520
So then you can have it.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.150
So it won't be true if you can
have as many kids as possible.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.185
This is going to make a
difference, though, if you

00:25:50.185 --> 00:25:51.910
have to stall--

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.930
PROFESSOR: As long as you don't
determine the sex of the

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:01.260
child directly, it
doesn't matter.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.860
Every but is an independent
event with a 50% chance of

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.780
being a boy.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.570
So take the number of bus,
multiply it by 50%, you're

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:09.660
going to get the number.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.670
So it makes no difference.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:15.000
Now let's think of one more
step in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.420
Which families would a lot
of girls grow up in?

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.440
Would they have more children
or less children?

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.580
Would girls grow up on average
in a family with more children

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.356
or less children?

00:26:26.356 --> 00:26:27.170
AUDIENCE: More children.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:28.490
PROFESSOR: More children.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.680
So if you think that families
that have more children have

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:37.710
less resources, then you have
a stopping rule, then girls

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:41.110
would be growing up in families
with more children,

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.550
and therefore less resources.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:51.880
And therefore, a stopping rule
can have an effect on child

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:58.070
outcomes, because it leads to
girls all living in large

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.970
families and boys all living
in small families.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:05.480
So boys get all the attention,
the parent, the resources.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:12.510
The seven girls and one boy
in the girl families, and

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.340
therefore the girls end up with
getting less resources.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.860
So that's one possible reason
why you might get this

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.400
outcome, because it has
something to do with the

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.210
stopping rule, but
not directly.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.450
It has to do with the stopping
rule then generates an

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.180
allocation of girls
across families.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.160
Yeah?

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.206
AUDIENCE: So that's also true.

00:27:30.206 --> 00:27:35.175
But If you think of about even
with the relaxation, imagine a

00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:39.840
family in a rich area where
everything's more expensive.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.910
Let's say even if it was a
little more relaxed, they

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.990
still limit themselves to say,
OK, we're going to have a

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.750
maximum of two kids.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:51.200
So let's say, yeah, maybe the
first kid that they have is a

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.780
girl, but then they say, the
probability of having a girl

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.130
for the next one, maybe it's not
really 50%, because they

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.130
say, well, we're only going to
have this kid if it's a boy.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
what you're saying

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.145
is completely right.

00:28:06.145 --> 00:28:11.220
The only way you get away from
50-50 is by deliberately or at

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.100
least doing something to the
girl that makes her not live.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.330
That's the only way
you get there.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.470
If the girls who are born
live, then you can't

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.530
get away from this.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.820
It doesn't matter what your
stopping rule is.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.900
Even if the government makes
complicated policies, the

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.390
policies don't change that.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.690
Every but is either
a boy or girl.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.880
So here's the last fact I wanted
you to see, which is

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.190
that if you look at these sex
ratios in India, they're

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.090
getting worse.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:48.140
They got worse for a while, now
they have stabilized at a

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.460
low number.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:54.710
So in 1900, there were 972 girls
for boys, men for women,

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.260
women for men.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.960
Now there are 933.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:05.680
In India, you don't see a trend
after 1971 or 1981.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:13.430
But the historical trend
is very negative.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:20.480
So that brings us to sort
of the question.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.020
Before we get to policy, in
a sense we need to know

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.320
what's going on.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.740
What's going on-- there are
two possible answers.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.010
One is kind of tradition, and
the other is economics.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:37.800
So one is there's a set of
traditions which make bad

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.570
things happen.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.760
But people are not willing
them to happen.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:45.840
The other is that people are
actually making choices to

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.090
make these things happen.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.580
So what we're going to spend
some time doing is trying to

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.810
distinguish between
these two views.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:55.580
Is it tradition?

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.830
Is it economics?

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.680
So you could imagine just
traditionally there's a theory

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.300
which says that girls
need less food.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.190
That's false.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.600
But you believe it.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.750
And you don't actually
actively do anything

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.170
to make them die.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.700
You have wrong beliefs.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.630
You think girls need less food,
because adult women are

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.000
smaller than adult men.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.270
And so you feed your
girls less.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.140
This is not an attempt to kill
them, it's just a tradition.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.590
But then that could feed back
and have a consequence.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.440
Problem is how do
you test this?

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:43.732
Yeah?

00:30:43.732 --> 00:30:51.260
AUDIENCE: If you actually look
at fertility rates, so if the

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:57.210
number of people that are born
are essentially all 50-50, but

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.308
then within five years you would
see a clear difference.

00:30:59.308 --> 00:31:00.740
So maybe at some point
that's happening.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.655
But even if in turns of birth
rate, if there's a difference,

00:31:04.655 --> 00:31:06.460
then it's something else.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:10.380
PROFESSOR: So one answer to this
question is if these guys

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.470
are not getting born, then
obviously something

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.890
else is going on.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:23.910
Now mostly still about five
years, not five, 15 years ago,

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:27.960
you don't see a big trend
in birthrates.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.180
Now you actually see a trend
in birthrates as well,

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:37.145
reported butts they're more
and more reported boys

00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:38.120
relative to girls.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.790
But over 15 years ago,
you don't see that.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.910
What you did see was more
different mortality rates for

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.540
boys and girls.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:49.130
So imagine that you wanted
to test this view.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:52.260
Well the problem is how
do you test it?

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:57.400
You don't actually observe who
eats what in a family.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.120
So it's hard to imagine you
going and figuring out oh,

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.390
they're not feeding
their daughter.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.530
They're feeding their son.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:07.150
That's just too difficult to do,
because everybody eats out

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.480
of the same cooked food.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.810
And so it's going to be
very hard to find.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:14.000
Somebody had a very good
idea of how to do it.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.895
We just looked at specialized
adult goods, like cigarettes.

00:32:21.066 --> 00:32:24.402
Your daughter, a five-year-old
daughter, doesn't smoke a

00:32:24.402 --> 00:32:28.130
cigarette, nor does your
five-year-old son.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:34.190
So when a son is born, if
there's an effect on how much

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:43.720
smoking you do, it has nothing
to do with the children, the

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.690
children smoking.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:48.110
So children are not going to be
a direct source of demand.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.270
So why is that good?

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:55.870
Because then you can look at
what happens to smoking when

00:32:55.870 --> 00:33:00.550
the family gets a
boy or a girl.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.905
And if girls are fed less,
what would you expect?

00:33:08.016 --> 00:33:09.462
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:09.462 --> 00:33:12.354
They would smoke more cigarettes
because they have a

00:33:12.354 --> 00:33:14.120
larger share of their budget
to spend on cigarettes,

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.210
because they'll give
less to the girl.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:20.040
PROFESSOR: Right, smoking
goes down by less.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.310
So the basic observation you
should see is when a child is

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:28.210
born, adult income goes down,
because adults have less money

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:29.590
to spend on themselves,
because they

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.120
will feed the child.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:36.330
But if they feed the girl less
than the boy, then you'd see

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:43.960
that when a boy is born, they'll
really cut back on

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.610
cigarettes.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:47.950
But when a girl is born,
they'll cut back less.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:51.970
Because they are feeding
the girl less.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:56.460
We have a pretty precise
measurement of demand for

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.730
adult goods.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:58.800
So we can use that.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.540
We don't know who smokes.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.080
But we know that the kids are
not doing the smoking.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.060
So therefore, we can by
observing what happens to a

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.420
family when the child is born.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:14.010
We can back out whether or not
there is a difference in the

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:17.219
way you feed boys or girls.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:20.920
Is that clear why that's better
than trying to measure?

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.199
It's very hard to measure
who eats what.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:28.340
But clearly the kids don't
smoke cigarettes.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.469
And they don't drink alcohol.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:32.040
So if you look at alcohol, and
cigarettes, and a few other

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.900
things that are essentially
adult goods, we should be able

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.780
to back out what's happening
when the child is born.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:53.469
Somebody did that.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.500
So take beverages.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.910
Beverages doesn't
include milk.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:12.330
So it's soda, and tea, and
all of those things.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:21.620
This table is horrible, but this
paper was published in a

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:26.260
obscure journal many
years ago.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.660
This is just a scan of that.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.120
There's nothing else
I could find.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.450
There's no electronic
version, et cetera.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:38.100
What you're looking for is the
effect of a boy versus a girl,

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.780
so number of males between
zero and four, versus the

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.270
number of females between zero
and four, and the effect of

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:49.350
that on the consumption
of beverages.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.730
And the answer is it has no
effect, that what's in the

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.250
bracket is the tea statistic.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.500
The tea statistic is zero.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.160
Both the numbers are zero.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.550
And that's basically
what you find.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:14.370
You see what you'd expect, which
is that, for example,

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.090
when a child is born,
you're just poorer.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:21.420
So you buy less rice,
less wheat.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.750
But there's no difference
between girls and boys.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.907
Boys and girls have the same
effect, if anything, on both.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:38.790
Basically there's no evidence
that when boy child is born,

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.220
families cut back more than
when a girl child is born.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.970
We don't find any evidence.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.280
And this will be looked
in many countries.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.410
So another tradition story
is the following.

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:55.950
Imagine that tradition is when
the child gets sick, do I take

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:57.650
it to the hospital?

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.010
And with the boy, the tradition
is I always take it

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:00.830
to the hospital.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:09.480
With a girl, I just give her
some water and generally sing

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.770
songs to her, but I don't take
her to the hospital,

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:15.900
something like that.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.890
Do we see any evidence
of this?

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:24.360
So this is hard to study,
because we don't actually

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:29.000
observe that many episodes of
life-threatening diseases.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.210
But there's a nice fact that
Elaina Rose identified, which

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.460
is the following.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:45.890
Over time, different parts
of India have droughts at

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.370
different points of time.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:54.120
So some areas have
droughts in 2006.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.730
Some have droughts in 2004.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:58.100
Some have droughts in 1996.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.005
So a drought is a time
of economic stress.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.210
What's a drought?

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.460
Why is it economic stress?

00:38:14.629 --> 00:38:17.491
AUDIENCE: Lower end qualities
to low crop yield.

00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:20.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah, basically
you can't grow anything.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.340
It's too dry.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:26.100
So when the rains fail,
crops fail.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.480
Families have no money.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:33.540
Well, how are they dealing with

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.450
this particular emergency?

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:40.150
And there she finds some
evidence that relative to

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:45.640
non-drought years, in drought
years, girls die more.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.060
So that suggests that
emergencies might be

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.440
a part of the story.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.140
In emergencies, girls are
not treated as well.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.510
So I gave one example,
which is not

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.570
taking her to the hospital.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.350
The other one might be, when I
don't have money, I don't buy

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:03.350
food for her.

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:07.160
So some tradition of that
kind might explain it.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.850
Problem is that droughts are
not frequent enough.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.600
And remember the trends.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.020
The trends are all bad.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.910
They're all getting worse.

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:17.610
India and China are
getting richer.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.670
The dependence on agriculture
in general, these kinds of

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:24.560
extreme events, is
just going down.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.160
Droughts don't matter as
much in India now.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.160
30 years ago, agriculture
was 50% of GDP.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.010
Now it's 25% of GDP.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.060
So basically, droughts matter
less to people.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.090
And since droughts matter less
to people, you would imagine

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.940
the trend being favorable
rather than against.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.320
Think of China.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.850
Most people are now
in industry.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:50.290
They're also richer.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:52.780
And as you get richer, and you
would imagine that emergencies

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.900
are less serious.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.850
Because you always
have some money.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.520
You're no longer at the
margin of starvation.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:02.290
So the problem with this story
is that it's just inconsistent

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.090
with the fact the things are
getting worse over time.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.370
You would think that under this
story things would be

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:09.940
getting better, because it's
an emergency story.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.806
And as countries get richer and
less exposed to risk, you

00:40:13.806 --> 00:40:15.500
would see less and less
of this, rather

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.300
than more and more.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.465
So that's why this can't be
the whole explanation.

00:40:19.465 --> 00:40:20.940
It could be a piece of it.

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:29.700
So going back to our distinction
between kind of

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:37.380
the tradition-based stories and
the more economic stories,

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.150
here is an economic fact,
which is striking.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.910
So in other words, what I mean
by an economic story is that

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:54.050
tradition-based stories say that
there's some rule people

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.210
use, fixed rule.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.670
They have not decided
on this rule.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.100
This is given to them.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.700
And that rule somehow, under
some circumstances, has bad

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.590
outcome for girls.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:07.860
So when the girl is
sick, you don't

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.400
take her to the hospital.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.650
That's a rule.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.450
We're now asking a question,
when the economic incentives

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:20.270
to treat girls better changes,
do you treat them better?

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.170
That suggests that you don't
have a fixed rule.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:27.810
You're actually behaving in a
rational way, quote unquote

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:31.770
"rational way." You're actually
planning to have bad

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.540
things happen to girls.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.990
So do you see what the
distinction is between

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.810
tradition-based stories
and economic stories?

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:43.320
Economic stories are ones which
essentially say that we

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.890
are making active choices which
have consequences for

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:52.990
girls, rather than this is a
rule we use and sometimes bad

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:56.630
things happen, because we
use a particular rule.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.880
Here is a nice example.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:04.920
So in China, after 1979,
agriculture is liberalized,

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.910
meaning people are allowed to
keep the money from going

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:09.270
their crops.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:12.630
This is the start of China's
economic miracle.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.270
It's called the family
responsibility system, and

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.850
it's sort of when everything
in China starts.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:26.130
Tea is one crop where women have
a comparative advantage

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.430
and even absolute advantage.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:32.230
Tea is something that has to
be picked very patiently.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:36.970
The most valuable leaves in
tea are the smallest ones.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:40.360
So here to pick the small
leaves, you have to pick them

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.600
without bruising them.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.310
If the leaf is bruised,
the price goes down.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:54.820
The best leaf teas, like Chinese
teas, sell for $600 a

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.180
kilogram, so something of
the order of magnitude.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.660
It's pretty expensive.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.430
So if you actually have the best
teas, you bruise a leaf,

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:04.570
that costs money.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:06.630
So you better have somebody
who picks with

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.380
very delicate fingers.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.670
Whether it's true or not, I
don't know, but it's believed

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:14.180
in China that women are
better for picking

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.380
expensive tea leaves.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.410
Maybe they are.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:21.745
Maybe this is a story that men
made up to make them do it.

00:43:21.745 --> 00:43:26.130
But whatever the explanation,
this is the belief.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.280
So given that belief,
what matters is what

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.530
people believe here.

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:34.320
Because would imagine that
another crop, which is the

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.780
opposite, is fruits.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.840
Fruits need someone to climb
a tree and pick them.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:44.080
And again in China, the belief
is that men are better at

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.770
climbing trees--

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:49.910
maybe again false.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:53.530
So men are better at
picking fruits.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:56.460
Women are better
at picking tea.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.390
That's starting fact.

00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.730
At that's what people believe.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:01.220
Let's start from there.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:09.940
Now suppose parents respond
to economic incentives.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.580
And what would you expect
happens when the

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.910
price of tea goes up?

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:16.780
What do you think will happen
to their daughter?

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:17.550
Yeah?

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:19.020
AUDIENCE: They'll treat
their daughter better.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.290
PROFESSOR: They'll treat
their daughter better.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:25.170
They're going to feed her more,
or they're going to take

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:28.640
her to the hospital more
willingly, et cetera.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.790
So you'd expect that.

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:34.690
And likewise, when the price
of fruits goes up, you'd

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:38.350
expect boys to be
treated better.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:43.810
Now in fact, both price of
fruit and trees go up.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:45.850
And that's a trend.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:48.080
So it's hard to use a
trend to study this.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.890
Because everything's going up.

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:51.870
Both tea and fruits
are going up.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:54.220
So you can't distinguish
between these two.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.030
But one thing you can do is you
can look at areas which

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:02.800
are suitable for tea, areas just
suitable for fruits, and

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.670
areas that were suitable
for neither.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:10.780
Now you can say when tea prices
go up, do we see a

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:16.510
bigger change in the gender
ratio in the tea-suitable

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:19.600
areas relative to the others?

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:25.940
Or you can ask, when the price
of fruits go up, do we see a

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.760
bigger change in the gender
ratio in the fruit-favored

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:35.860
areas than in the areas where
neither is favored?

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:39.620
So we're always comparing areas
where, basically, wheat

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:44.300
or rice grows with tea areas
and fruit areas.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.940
Is that clear what
we're doing?

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.920
We're asking when the price of
fruits goes up, do we see a

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.260
different trend in fruit-growing
areas, relative

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.510
to wheat-growing areas?

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:00.690
Is that clear why that's
a good way to

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:01.940
look at this question?

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:05.970
What are we worried about?

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:09.120
If we just said, well, the
price of tea is going up,

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:14.170
what's happening to girls?

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:16.660
Well, the price of tea
is going up, but it's

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.200
going up over time.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.880
If the fraction of girls is
going down, we'll get a

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.530
negative association
out of that.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.290
Because there are two
things happening.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:28.000
One is that it's just going
down for other reasons.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.270
The other is prices of
tea is going up for

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.170
whatever economic reasons.

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:33.390
And I'm going to
correlate them.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.030
I'll find a negative
correlation.

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:36.190
So that's not what
we want to do.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:39.140
We want to look at areas which
are suitable for tea.

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.570
That's where the price of tea
should have an effect, should

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.250
not have an effect in
areas which are not

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.320
suitable for tea.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.810
So we're going to compare the
effect of an increase in price

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:53.140
of tea in girls in tea-suitable
areas versus

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.260
non-tea-suitable areas,
not compare trends.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.600
This is basically what is called
doing a difference in

00:46:59.600 --> 00:46:59.980
difference.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:05.500
And we'll take high tea price
periods, low tea price

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.770
periods, and compare
tea-suitable areas and

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:10.020
non-tea-suitable areas.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.430
You look more lost than
I would expect.

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:19.110
It's a very easy idea.

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:23.240
Somebody else want to say back
what I'm trying to say?

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:27.646
Who's going to volunteer to
improve on that explanation?

00:47:27.646 --> 00:47:29.610
I'm going to [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:30.860
Somebody [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:35.993 --> 00:47:37.466
OK, go ahead.

00:47:37.466 --> 00:47:40.657
AUDIENCE: Basically you're
trying to see that if this

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:44.340
does actually have an effect on
how parents treat children.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:49.800
You'll see girls treated better
in places where tea is

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.720
the cash crop or something and
the price increases, versus

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.680
areas where tea is not
the cash crop,

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.150
but the price increases.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:59.600
There shouldn't be a change in
how the girls are treated.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.090
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:04.220
So we're going to compare years
when tea prices went up

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:09.100
with years when tea prices
didn't go up and compare them

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:13.010
in areas where tea is a
plausible crop and areas where

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:15.770
tea cannot be grown.

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:18.800
So the increase in tea prices
should have no effect where

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.100
tea cannot be grown.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.760
It will have a spurious
effect, maybe,

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.850
but no really effect.

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:26.620
It should have an effect
where tea can be grown.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:32.010
So we're going to compare tea
possible areas with other

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:35.542
areas, when tea prices go up
versus when it doesn't.

00:48:35.542 --> 00:48:36.150
Yeah?

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.278
AUDIENCE: How about we think
about it just like you have

00:48:38.278 --> 00:48:42.613
you control population, where
the tea price going up

00:48:42.613 --> 00:48:43.245
shouldn't have an effect.

00:48:43.245 --> 00:48:45.661
And then you have your
non-control, and you just take

00:48:45.661 --> 00:48:47.866
you data and subtract your
control from it to see you

00:48:47.866 --> 00:48:48.310
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.630
PROFESSOR: That's
exactly right.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.950
So that's another way to
say the same thing.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:54.840
Anybody else want to add
anything to that?

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.040
So let me show you
some trends.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.950
So that's the basic fact.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:06.430
So that's tea prices.

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:10.400
Suddenly in '79, you see stock
tea prices just skyrocketed.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.820
That's the first fact.

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.420
Tea prices are going up.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.360
Tea production is going up.

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:20.150
Second thing is that if you
look at tea versus other

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:23.510
crops, tea prices are going up
faster than other crops.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.400
So other crops are like grain.

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.070
Grain is going up, but tea
is going up faster.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.830
Oil is going up, but tea
is going up faster.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:33.560
So tea is the crop
that is going up

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:37.750
fastest among these crops.

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.450
Look at this one.

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:42.680
Here we're comparing
fruits with tea.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.000
And fruits are going
up much faster.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.180
Fruits with other crops, like
grain, oil, and cotton, and

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:52.310
again, fruits are going
up much faster.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:57.360
So basically, what matters is
not the absolute price.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:02.410
The relative price matters,
because it's what makes you

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:04.280
want to do more tea.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.330
So tea areas are benefiting,
relative to those other areas.

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:15.010
So this is a complicated
graph, so

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:16.560
let's do this slowly.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.010
Try to understand what's
in this graph.

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:27.690
So what's in this graph is areas
which grow a lot of tea.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.055
This is the coefficient
in the regression.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:49.080
So this is the effect of having
more area devoted to

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.970
tea in a particular year.

00:50:50.970 --> 00:51:00.490
So what this is saying is that
before 1979, you see tea

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:01.650
prices are low.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:07.260
In those years, if you look at
the fraction of males, the

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.510
fraction of males
bounces around.

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:16.800
But the fact that tea is sown
has essentially very close to

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.110
zero effect.

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:23.040
After 1979, the fact that
tea is sown has

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:23.980
a much bigger effect.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:28.950
So this is the effect of how
much land you put into tea in

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:31.660
a particular year,
so year by year.

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:39.470
So in that year, what's
happening, in 1983, how many

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:46.800
boys versus girls were born
in high tea areas

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.410
relative to low tea areas?

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:50.150
That's always the exercise.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:56.480
So think of one more percent
of land devoted to tea.

00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.920
What is the effect of that
on the fraction of

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.940
boys born in 1983?

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.430
That's what that says.

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:11.300
So the main point to take
away is you see a

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:15.110
big drop after 1979.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:21.740
So tea areas, the fraction of
boys born goes down right when

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:22.850
you think it should go down.

00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:24.637
It is when the price
starts going up.

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.730
So that's what this is saying.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:35.390
Before that, the average
is kind of at 0.15.

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:39.720
After that, the average
is about 0.35.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.650
So the fraction of boys goes
down after the change.

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:49.130
This is what happens in
the fruit areas--

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:51.510
the opposite.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:55.330
After '79, fruit prices
go up also a lot.

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:56.580
And fruit favors boys.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.170
The ratio used to be lower.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.992
It goes up afterwards.

00:53:04.992 --> 00:53:05.483
Yeah?

00:53:05.483 --> 00:53:06.956
AUDIENCE: Are these significant
results?

00:53:06.956 --> 00:53:10.910
PROFESSOR: Yes, so the average
is significantly different.

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:11.850
You're right.

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:14.230
Year by year, they're
not significant.

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:16.930
But that's because it's a
small sample of people.

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:21.580
But if you take the average of
these periods, the averages

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.900
are significantly different.

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.470
AUDIENCE: I'm just having
trouble understanding how so

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:36.809
if women are better at picking
tea leaves, the economics make

00:53:36.809 --> 00:53:40.753
sense, but I can't see families
consciously choosing

00:53:40.753 --> 00:53:44.600
to have more girls.

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.720
In 12 years, they'll
begin to--

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.290
PROFESSOR: Well, yes and no.

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.450
You're right with that.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:52.910
But on the other hand, it also
sends a signal which reminds

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:55.750
them, oh well, you know.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:56.420
Two things--

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:59.280
one, you might imagine that
the women might be more

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.780
pro-girls, plausibly.

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:07.240
And if you think that
women income share

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.440
goes up in the family--

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.800
AUDIENCE: They have
more stakes.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.610
PROFESSOR: They have more say.

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.530
So that's one possible
mechanism.

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:19.780
The second mechanism is just
that maybe when girls' incomes

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:27.330
go up, they just look at it and
say, well, after all, all

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:28.770
the women are working
these days.

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:30.090
Why not have another girl?

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:31.620
They'll be fine.

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.540
They'll find a job as well.

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.880
I can't tell what's going
on at that level.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.040
But it's clear that this
result is significant.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.290
It's actually substantial.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:48.070
Final set of thoughts--

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:53.400
suppose this goes on.

00:54:56.085 --> 00:54:57.990
Let me back up.

00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:59.415
What's going on?

00:54:59.415 --> 00:55:01.245
How are they losing
all these girls?

00:55:01.245 --> 00:55:06.330
If it's an economic mechanism,
that says that there is

00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:08.360
incentive to lose the girls.

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.340
How are they actually
doing it?

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.590
What's going on?

00:55:19.754 --> 00:55:24.160
Unfortunately, it's all not very
nice, what's going on.

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.250
So two things are happening.

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:30.750
One is basically the technology
for pre-birth

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:34.530
detection of gender of the
child has improved a lot.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.690
If you do amniocentesis, which
is an expensive procedure, you

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:44.550
can basically very high
probability predict the gender

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.070
of the child.

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:50.380
The reason why rich areas are
doing the worst is precisely

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.120
because of that.

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.345
Rich areas are using
this technology.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.320
It's an expensive technology.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:02.230
You spend money to use it.

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:06.830
You see in like the richer parts
of India, signs up would

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:15.030
say, would you rather
spend basically $100

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:22.380
now or $10,000 later?

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:25.660
The idea is that you're to give
dowry for your daughter

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:26.720
to get her married.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.000
And that's your cost.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.190
And so you should really get
ready to spend, whatever, $100

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:37.460
now, identify her,
and then have an

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:40.380
abortion, rather than spend.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.960
You see these signs up.

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.000
They're all the illegal.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.450
Amniocentesis about eight
years ago was

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:48.490
made illegal in India.

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:51.010
It's still completely
prevalent.

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:55.420
And since people are willing
to try to have many babies,

00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:00.240
they're even willing to do
it by using a much weaker

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.750
technology, which
is a sonography.

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:06.280
Sonography, which is a
technology that is legal, it

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.760
doesn't identify the gender of
the child all the time, but

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.060
over 25% of the time, it does.

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:16.040
And when it does, then you can
immediately abort the child.

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.900
So they're using technologies
to identify.

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:21.650
This is why this is happening
more in richer areas, because

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:23.390
technologies cost money.

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:27.030
And the poorest areas are ones
where the technology is least

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:29.580
used, because it's
just expensive.

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:35.190
So you see basically a very,
very clear correlation between

00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:37.980
where the technology arrives
and the fraction

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:40.390
of boys being born.

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:42.210
So that's one thing
that's going on.

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:46.370
Second thing is going on almost
surely is a lot of

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:51.730
post-birth, I think, murder is
the only word you could use.

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:54.250
I think unfortunately there's
a lot of, I think, children

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:56.820
being disposed of.

00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:00.900
There are villages which report
to have, probably

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:04.110
report, there's a news report I
think from like the Chinese

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:12.220
news agency which says that we
haven't had a girl born in our

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.900
village in the last
five years.

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.370
There's a news report of the
village chief proudly

00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:21.400
announcing that there was no
girl born in his village in

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.140
the last five years.

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:25.940
So I think there is a lot of
just direct, deliberate action

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.860
going on there.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:32.540
Now, there are many things
to think about here.

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:33.350
How do you stop it?

00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:34.430
The government has tried.

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:37.210
It tried to have technologies.

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.905
There's a bunch of programs
around now, for example.

00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:45.860
India has a number of states
where they have programs that

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:51.580
basically promise parents a
certain amount of money if

00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.380
your girl graduates
from high school--

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:55.350
quite a lot of money.

00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:56.640
So that's one way
to [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.560
incentives based on
girls' arrival.

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:10.000
But it's not clear how
well that works.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.200
Because in some ways, it's
something that's based on 20

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:15.940
years later.

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:19.540
And you don't necessarily think
that people are that

00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.870
responsive to it.

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:24.530
The other thing you can think
about is is there any economic

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:32.090
force that this, by itself, sets
off, which will then make

00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:33.340
re-equilibrium.

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:36.910
So one issue that arises is
what's happening to the

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:38.150
marriage market?

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:39.150
So what do you think
will happen to the

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:44.484
marriage market in China?

00:59:44.484 --> 00:59:47.340
AUDIENCE: Well, if there are
fewer women, then each one is

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.250
essentially worth more.

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:50.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:56.570
Dowry should go down, and bride
price should go up.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.540
Why this hasn't happened already
in India, especially,

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.170
is that men tend to marry
women who are

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:13.914
younger than them.

01:00:13.914 --> 01:00:18.930
If the population is growing,
and people marry women who are

01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:28.790
younger than them, then even if
there are fewer girls born,

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:33.640
the girls are from a different
cohort, from a younger cohort.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.830
So the population is growing, so
there's more girls around.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.630
So that's one problem.

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:44.750
This force might operate,
but only if

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:46.110
population growth stops.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:48.640
So it's going to operate more in
China where the population

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.170
growth has stopped than in India
where the population

01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:52.800
growth is still going on.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.810
As long as there's population
growth, you're going to see

01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:57.975
this possibility of just going
down in the cohort chain.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.430
So you might imagine that the
price of girls will go up, but

01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:08.850
it won't go up if people marry
much younger women.

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:10.340
That's one issue.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:17.830
Second issue, so in China, one
of things that people are

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:20.750
often puzzled about
is what's going on

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:22.000
with the savings rate?

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:27.910
The savings rate in China,
personal savings, is

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:29.830
historically unprecedented.

01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:34.602
People save 30% of their
incomes, as it is compared to

01:01:34.602 --> 01:01:38.760
the US, which used to save zero
till recently, and after

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.090
the crisis has gone up to 7%.

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:46.300
So personal savings rates
in China are massive.

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.700
So one puzzle people have often
been thinking about is

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.980
what's going on with that?

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.170
There's a very nice paper which
does the following.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:03.110
If I look at areas which have
high gender ratios, where

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:08.890
women are really scarce,
are people saving

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:11.690
more in those areas?

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:12.940
Why would they save more?

01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:22.270
Why would you save more if
you're a parent of boy?

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:25.520
So he particularly asked, if
you're a parent of a boy, in

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.800
China it's easy, because
people have one child.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.760
So they're either a parent of
a boy or parent of a girl.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.040
If you're parent of a boy in an
area where the gender ratio

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:39.190
is particularly bad, so very
few girls, it turns

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:40.700
out you save more.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.950
Why would that be the case?

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:47.470
AUDIENCE: The price
of a bride.

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:50.350
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you have
to buy your son a bride.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.160
So people are saving more.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.720
So basically they suggest that
people are beginning to save

01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:00.760
more in order to buy their
child a bride.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.840
And the way you buy it
is you don't go and

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.960
buy her in the market.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.020
But basically women have become
very picky about not

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.040
marrying into families, which
can't afford to give their son

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:18.380
a separate apartment to move
into when they get married.

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.450
China has very poor
mortgage markets.

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:24.230
So you can't really take out
a mortgage to buy a house.

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:26.670
So the only you buy a house is
you borrow from your parents.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.450
Your parents give you a gift.

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:32.520
So parents now, it's become a
status issue for parents to

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.920
marry this sons.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.190
And the way you marry your son
is by buying him an apartment

01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:38.640
when he gets married.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.550
So if you don't have
enough wealth, you

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.720
can't buy an apartment.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.610
And then your son can't
get married.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:49.410
So this seems to be sort of one
of the facts that might

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:52.520
actually re-equilibriate China,
because it seems like

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.390
one thing that's going on in
China right now is this

01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:58.035
massive increase in savings.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:04.560
The problem with this method in
increasing savings is it's

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.490
a zero sum game.

01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:08.370
There are only so many girls.

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:13.890
So the fact that I'm saving a
lot for my son just means my

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:16.680
son can have a bride, but
not anybody else.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.220
It's not now that the number
of women go up

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.880
because they save.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.150
So this is not really
solving the problem.

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:25.920
It's squeezing parents.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.870
So if I were to save $1 more in
order to buy my son a house

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:35.010
so he can get married, then
somebody else is going to want

01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:35.890
to do the same thing.

01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:38.650
He's going to try to save even
more than me and buy a house

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:40.160
for his son.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.050
So that competition is a
very kind of a negative

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:44.880
competition.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.810
Everybody's getting hurt
by that competition.

01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:53.700
So that should make parents
really rethink this strategy.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:57.230
The one sign of hope I see is
this one, which is the market

01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:00.390
forces seem to be kind
of operating to make

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:01.430
this problem better.

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:05.610
That's true in China, much less
true in India, because

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.230
India's population is growing.

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:10.550
So there's still this minimizing
of adjustment.

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:14.810
OK, so questions, comments,
before we stop?

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:15.804
Yeah?

01:05:15.804 --> 01:05:19.780
AUDIENCE: In China, what you
see about the increase in

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.140
girls again, because parents
see that they don't have to

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.260
save money to have a girl?

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.640
PROFESSOR: So you
might see that.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.310
You aren't seeing it yet.

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:30.460
But maybe once it gets clear
that your daughter gets to

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.630
live in a wonderful apartment,
et cetera, and having a son is

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:38.030
a huge pain because you have
to now find ways to pay for

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:41.800
his apartment, you might start
preferring daughters.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.220
So maybe we'll see that.

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.860
OK, thank you.
