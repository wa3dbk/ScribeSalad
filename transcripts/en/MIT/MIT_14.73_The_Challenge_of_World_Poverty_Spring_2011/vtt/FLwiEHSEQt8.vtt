00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.340
PROFESSOR: Might as
well get started.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.460
So this is all carrying
on the conversation

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.670
that we had last time.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:45.920
We talked about, possibly for
very long-term historical

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.560
reasons, some countries might
have very different kinds of

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.820
institutions from others.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.890
In particular, some might be
much worse than others, at

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.990
least using the standard
measures.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.830
And then what do you
do about it?

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.846
So the first reaction is,
sometimes, well, tough.

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:12.670
If the story is that you had to
have some lucky break 400

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.700
years ago to get the
institutions right, then it's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.820
not entirely clear that
there's much you

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.410
can do about it.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.500
That's the pessimistic view.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:32.060
Now, for the people who really
worry about these issues,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.220
there's an interesting
debate going on.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.500
It's really between these five
people listed above, are on

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.820
the two sides of the debate.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.780
One side of it is a Stanford
professor called Paul Romer,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.770
who has come up with this idea
of charter cities, like

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.870
charter schools.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.170
So he wants, if you'd like,
to import institutions.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.850
So his basic idea is, the US has
good institutions, so a US

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.900
firm, or a US NGO,
would start--

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.610
if South Sudan wants to have a
city, then they should just

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.030
hire a US firm to set up the
city for them, have the same

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.020
guarantees that the US has.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:35.160
So it'll be a part of the
US institutional frame.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.850
So it's not clear exactly
how that works.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.960
Because for example, suppose
you set up a court in that

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.790
country, and it has the US laws,
but the judge in the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.640
court decides not to implement
those laws.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.720
Does the US invade?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.080
Who's making the commitment?

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.810
So this is a set of real
issues about how

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.540
you get that to work.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.039
Yeah.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.534
AUDIENCE: Isn't there even more
fundamental issues of

00:03:11.534 --> 00:03:14.029
what foreign country
would be willing to

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.025
sponsor a charter city?

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:18.520
Because seemingly, all the
advantages, even if you could

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.181
find a country to host it, like
a country that would be

00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:26.337
willing to give up the land, the
outside sponsor, for lack

00:03:26.337 --> 00:03:29.696
of a better term-- at least the
way you guys talk about it

00:03:29.696 --> 00:03:32.028
in the book-- they basically
give it up as soon as the

00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:34.184
city's kind of successful.

00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:36.579
He alludes to Hong Kong
being an example.

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.370
But Hong Kong had very different
circumstances,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.161
because Britain originally
colonized it in the hopes of

00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:46.616
having it as its own, having
it as a commercial center.

00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:49.562
And then they got the benefits
for 100 years before they

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.040
handed it over.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.960
PROFESSOR: And equally
importantly, they handed it

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.940
over under circumstances
when they really

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.400
didn't have any choice.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:12.770
So Britain is certainly in no
position to, let's say,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.029
disagree with China about
a city that's

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.170
next doors to China.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.740
So there was no leverage
is there whatsoever.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.019
Yeah.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.260
So there's several
issues there.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.250
You've just brought up one,
which is, how do I make the,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.110
to use your word,
the sponsoring

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.830
country, give up the city.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.570
Then there's the opposite
problem.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.450
How do I make sure the city
actually runs, and who's

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.700
guaranteeing it?

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.230
Suppose the judge who's supposed
to enforce US laws

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:06.020
in, I don't know, Benin, doesn't
do it, who's liable to

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.704
make it happen?

00:05:07.704 --> 00:05:11.113
AUDIENCE: But there's no one
preventing those countries

00:05:11.113 --> 00:05:12.087
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:12.087 --> 00:05:15.983
extracting institutions, they
have no incentive to be

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:17.931
[INAUDIBLE] either.

00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:19.181
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:28.218
AUDIENCE: So in the same was
as colonies where Europeans

00:05:28.218 --> 00:05:32.170
did not settle permanently
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.122
They set up [INAUDIBLE]
institutions that would be

00:05:36.122 --> 00:05:37.590
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.470
PROFESSOR: So you're right.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.740
There's the question of the
demand side for it.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.600
Maybe there's no country
that wants it.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.180
I think Paul's presumption is
that there are countries that

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.370
would like to have better
institutions.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.930
They cannot domestically
manufacture it.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.130
But if they just somehow
imported institutions, and

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.620
there was a [? guarantor ?]

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.720
behind it, then it would work.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.940
So what you're saying
is completely right.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.360
There needs to be
a demand for it.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.720
If the country doesn't
want it, it's

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.580
never going to happen.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.310
But let's say the country even
wants these institutions.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.880
Even in that case, there
are several problems.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.230
One is, how do you actually
run a charter city?

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.490
I mean, who's in charge?

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:36.420
Is the US prepared to back
up its commitment

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.890
to the charter city?

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.530
If it says the US laws, does
that mean the US is going to

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.034
send in an army whenever
the laws are violated?

00:06:45.034 --> 00:06:47.026
AUDIENCE: Likewise, does it mean
that if the country gets

00:06:47.026 --> 00:06:50.263
overrun by an outside invader
and the charter city gets

00:06:50.263 --> 00:06:53.430
overrun, will the US extend
its nuclear arms--

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.170
like, let's say--

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.330
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.060
Exactly.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.880
So [? what is ?] commitment
to it.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.706
AUDIENCE: Foreign policy.

00:06:57.706 --> 00:06:58.120
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.100
So all forms of commitment
are an issue, obviously.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.420
It's not enough to say that
we have US-style laws.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.680
In fact, if you look across
the world, laws

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.190
don't vary a lot.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.640
Legal systems vary relatively
little.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.790
What varies is the enforcement
of the law.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.345
So you have to make-- who's
watching that the laws are

00:07:21.345 --> 00:07:21.820
getting enforced?

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.302
Yeah.

00:07:22.302 --> 00:07:22.784
Melissa.

00:07:22.784 --> 00:07:25.194
AUDIENCE: I guess as an example
of this on a much

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:29.050
smaller scale is you have these
cruise lines set up

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.460
these enclaves in Caribbean
islands.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.518
And it'd be a town in Haiti, and
it functions much better

00:07:34.518 --> 00:07:36.116
than the rest of the country.

00:07:36.116 --> 00:07:38.032
And part of that's because they
have economic demand.

00:07:38.032 --> 00:07:40.906
But the cruise line has
basically bought the town and

00:07:40.906 --> 00:07:42.343
runs things.

00:07:42.343 --> 00:07:44.766
So like I said, it's all on
a much smaller scale.

00:07:44.766 --> 00:07:46.758
But it seems like that that's
the only thing.

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:49.995
AUDIENCE: In those instances,
generally speaking, the cruise

00:07:49.995 --> 00:07:51.156
line owns all of the land.

00:07:51.156 --> 00:07:52.570
And it's private property.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.920
And they setup the town.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.130
So it's really no--

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:56.780
PROFESSOR: It's like a hotel.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.410
AUDIENCE: It's like a privatized
government.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:58.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.360
It's like a large hotel.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.130
AUDIENCE: But it's larger
than a hotel.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.430
PROFESSOR: But a large hotel.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.410
Some hotels have their
internal currency.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.520
I was once trapped into this
completely horrible hotel

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.300
which had this internal currency
with high inflation.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.780
This was a hotel.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.750
Because whenever I wanted
to buy something--

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.940
so basically, there you
go into the hotel.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:18.770
It's like a resort.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.210
And they give you a certain
amount of currency, and you

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.170
spend it anywhere you
want in the resort.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.150
But it turns out that
the prices are

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.400
extraordinarily high.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.689
So that's sort of
the same idea.

00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:35.647
AUDIENCE: It's quite
different.

00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:39.805
But I guess it's just that we
don't really have anything on

00:08:39.805 --> 00:08:43.796
a smaller scale to this that
we could even say, does it

00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:45.150
work on a smaller scale?

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.090
PROFESSOR: So why is it
different from a resort where

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.270
you can go from one
shop to another?

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.730
The shops are competing.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.155
Why is it different?

00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:58.792
AUDIENCE: At least one thing
that's different is there's a

00:08:58.792 --> 00:09:01.362
major industry there that
creates demand.

00:09:01.362 --> 00:09:05.790
Whereas if you set some city
up in the middle of Africa,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.988
where there's not already an
economic industry, and

00:09:08.988 --> 00:09:09.740
everybody's--

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.530
PROFESSOR: So part of it is
that there is an economic

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.685
engine that's already there.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.920
Then there's a chicken-and-egg
problem, which is that the

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.150
city will only generate value
if it comes with an economic

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.120
model, and the economic model
isn't there already.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.640
If you just guarantee the
institutions, how good does

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.830
the guarantee need
to be before the

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.140
economic engine arrives?

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.790
That's a challenge.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.870
As you might imagine, the
problem might be that if I

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.590
tell you that I'm in Cote
d'Ivoire in the middle of the

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.260
civil war, but we have this
enclave that's protected, you

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.430
really need very good assurances
of protection

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.400
before some industry's going to
be willing to move to this

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.760
enclave in Cote d'Ivoire in the
middle of the civil war.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.560
So you're always this question,
who guarantees?

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.070
But also, I think there is a
third question, which is,

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:12.180
what's to stop the country
from withdrawing its

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.890
concessions?

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.480
So let's say the country
gave you some land.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.110
You build a lot of buildings.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.760
You've got a few factories
running there.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.620
What's to start a country with
bad institutions with coming

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.280
back the next year and saying,
well, now that we have all of

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.420
these factories, I want them.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.920
And who's going to stop that?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.150
Will the US send in an
army to stop that?

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:35.650
It seems like there are myriad
issues of implementation.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.342
It would make this a rather
wacky scheme.

00:10:39.342 --> 00:10:40.818
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:40.818 --> 00:10:42.786
also the fact that [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:42.786 --> 00:10:43.770
affect the rest of
the country.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:49.182
[? They're ?] going to build a
whole new city [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:52.626
And all the existing cities and
things surrounding that

00:10:52.626 --> 00:10:55.086
will not necessarily
be receptive to it.

00:10:55.086 --> 00:10:57.580
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.170
That too.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:05.070
Just how do you deal with the
inequality and all that within

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:05.630
the country?

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.598
Yeah.

00:11:06.598 --> 00:11:09.502
AUDIENCE: So when Paul Romer
proposed this, it sounds very

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.406
theoretical, and I don't think
he actually proposed how to

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:13.374
implement it.

00:11:13.374 --> 00:11:16.278
But did he mention the timeline
for these cities?

00:11:16.278 --> 00:11:19.575
Because although you might have
the framework for good

00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:21.725
institutions, you might have all
the laws, you still need

00:11:21.725 --> 00:11:24.000
the people to implement it,
the people to respect it.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.220
And that's somewhat a cultural
issue, that if you grew up in

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.670
a corrupt society, you have it
ingrained in you how to go

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.950
about things.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.209
So it would take at least one
generation, or several

00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:39.480
generations, to get people to
change their ways and actually

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.320
follow the law and help make
these institutions work.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.617
For example, Russia transiting
from the Communist society to

00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:51.192
democracy, they have all the
laws and all the rules and all

00:11:51.192 --> 00:11:51.770
the institutions.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:59.330
But people still have this old
mindset that's not working.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.580
PROFESSOR: That goes back to
the first point we were

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:09.360
saying, which is that the
evidence on institutions says

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.390
that if you got the right
accident which made your

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.480
institutions the right ones
200 or 400 years ago, then

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.140
that persists.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.850
That doesn't say anything
about transplanting

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:23.560
institutions.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.910
But I think Romer is asking the
right question, which is,

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.210
imagine that the US has
good institutions.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.980
Can a US company take advantage
of the fact that it

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.220
is a US company, and the US has
good institutions, to set

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:43.590
up a kind of a charter city in
Cote d'Ivoire which will have

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.350
good institutions?

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.070
So he's thought about
this issue.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.130
He thinks that, well, the way
you do it is, you import

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.610
institutions.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.980
That's the idea.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.670
And so in some sense, you're
totally right.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.800
It's not enough to just write
down the rules of the

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.710
institutions.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:04.900
And that's completely right.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.070
But he's not saying that.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.250
He's saying that plus
implementation will come from

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.310
US company.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.650
The question is whether a
US company can implement

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:13.190
anything like that.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.480
Yeah.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.530
AUDIENCE: Couldn't
to some degree--

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.544
I think it'll be interesting to
see in 20 or 30 years, what

00:13:18.544 --> 00:13:20.179
Afghanistan and Iraq
look like?

00:13:20.179 --> 00:13:22.047
I mean, obviously, they had a
pretty distinct population.

00:13:22.047 --> 00:13:24.860
But to some degree, the closest
thing to what Romer

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.540
suggested we're seeing
in action in Iraq.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.840
I mean, the level of US monetary
involvement has been

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.190
huge [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.320
military expenses.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.510
And they're trying to create
these new institutions.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.876
So that could be an interesting
example case to

00:13:39.876 --> 00:13:44.540
build off of in the future, when
changed institutions on a

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.770
wide scale he was
talking about.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.700
I mean, obviously, it's not very
sustainable, I imagine.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.960
And there will be a
series of issues.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.910
But just as an example.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.606
PROFESSOR: This is an aside,
but it's worth reading the

00:13:56.606 --> 00:13:59.960
book, I think it's called
Imperial Life in the Emerald

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.310
City, or something.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.310
Wonderful book.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:08.710
The Washington Post bureau chief
in Iraq, after a year

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:13.750
and a half there, wrote this
book about the implementation

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.120
of US institutions in Iraq.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.000
And what was wonderful about the
story in that book was--

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.970
and this is relevant for
what we're going to

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:23.920
talk about in a bit.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.880
So it's not entirely an aside.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.530
So the book was wonderful in
describing exactly how the US

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.860
went about implementing good
institutions in Iraq.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:40.310
So basically, rule one was that
the people who got hired

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:49.880
to do that were either
staffers of prominent

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.440
Republican congressmen or
senators, or prominent

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.210
contributors to the
Republican cause.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.300
Those were the only people
who were selected.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.990
Second, most of the staffers
who were given the

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.250
responsibility for, for
example, designing the

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:12.110
stock-market laws, were
23-year-olds who had an

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.110
undergraduate degree in
accounting were sent to the

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.850
set up these laws.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.560
And there was usually
one person.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.310
A 23-year-old with an
undergraduate degree was

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:34.700
assigned to be in charge of
setting up the stock market or

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.270
figuring out how to reform
the legal system.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:44.430
So these where people with
strong background in being

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:50.300
Republican operatives, and no
background in actually running

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.180
an institution.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.400
So the book is wonderful in that
it goes through how the

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.340
whole process was doomed
from the start.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.710
Because the people who were sent
to do these institutions

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.980
had no competence whatsoever in
doing the job, because they

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.680
were all political appointees.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.790
And the book is actually
worth reading.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.180
And it comes back to point
I'll come back to later.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.400
Which is that, imagine
you wanted to make

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.810
institutions better.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.300
You still need competence.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.640
And it's not just a matter
of having some

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.160
playbook from the US.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.310
It's a matter of actually having
the competence to turn

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.940
that playbook into reality.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:37.060
And I think that was a very
major problem in Iraq.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:54.600
So then there is Paul Collier,
who has a different view.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.050
In some ways, this view I
find less unrealistic--

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.740
maybe less defensible,
but less unrealistic.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:07.329
Which is, if the country has
really horrible institutions,

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:08.579
just invade.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.040
This is, I think, internally
coherent.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.099
Much more, I think, internally
coherent than the Romer

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.260
suggestion, which I don't see
how it would be implemented.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.869
But this one, at least the
policy prescription's simple.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:34.200
Invade, and then just set up
colonial rule for a while.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.560
This has been tried.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.760
It's been implemented
in the past.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.490
We know how it's to be
done, so there's no

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.970
implementation problem.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.050
You might have various
objections to it.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.570
But in many ways, this is
a more difficult one to

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:58.160
challenge on purely
a priori grounds.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.190
One of the sad facts is that we
know very little about the

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.590
effect of colonial rule
from history.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.550
That is to say, if you look
at places that didn't get

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.290
colonized, so few of them didn't
get colonized, and

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.240
they're so unique, like
China is one country

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.750
that didn't get colonized.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:27.040
But basically, poor countries,
most countries outside Europe

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.470
and North America
were colonized.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.865
And as a result, there's
just very little.

00:18:32.865 --> 00:18:35.460
And when you compare the ones
that got colonized with the

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.400
ones that didn't, the ones that
didn't get colonized were

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.760
Japan and China.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.540
And those are not random draws
from any population.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:47.990
So it's very hard to see
what the effect of

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.580
being colonized is.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:53.500
The one exception to that that
I know, which is not quite

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.490
perfect, but it does a little
bit of that, is, an MIT Ph.D.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.610
student some years ago, Lakshmi
Iyer, did this paper

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:09.090
where what she did is, she
looked at, in India, there was

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.260
what was called the
Doctrine of Lapse.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.320
The Doctrine of Lapse was
a beautiful idea.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.655
So the way India was colonized
was bit by bit.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.030
Some bits got left out.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.400
At any point, they would fight a
battle, take over some land,

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.030
and then some would
be left out.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:34.910
And then they'd have a treaty
with the local potentate at

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:40.020
that time to have a kind
of a dependent ruler.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.070
Basically, this process of
colonizing India ends in 1857

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:55.490
with about 2/3 of India under
direct British rule, and one

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.700
third of India under rule of
a whole bunch of rulers--

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.990
500-odd rulers who had a little
small territory, and

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.030
was the king of that territory,
and had a treaty

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:06.760
with the British.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.940
The British basically were
overseeing this person.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.260
So that's how the colonization
happened.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.320
Now, one of the ways in which
the British would take over

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.490
one of these little kingdoms was
under what was called the

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.510
Doctrine of Lapse.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:28.430
The Doctrine of Lapse was, one
might say, a cynical idea.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:34.800
But it was the idea that if the
king didn't have a natural

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:41.080
heir, then the kingdom would
lapse to British rule.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:49.090
So basically, what this paper
does, is she compares places

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.760
which, during--

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:56.540
Doctrine of Lapse was enforced
very heavily for eight years,

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.500
from 1848 to 1856.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:15.440
During this period, about 20
places had the king die.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:20.770
And I guess some of
those places had a

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.490
male natural heir.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.540
Natural heir means a son.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.470
And the other places didn't.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.910
So what she does is, she
compares the places which had

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.040
a natural heir with the
places which didn't

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.870
have a natural heir.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.920
So if you look at these places,
if you think that the

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.330
birth of a male child is kind of
a random accident, then you

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.970
might say that these
are comparable.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.560
And on most things, they
look comparable.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:51.550
If you look at these places 150
years later, the places

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:57.920
that were under British rule
do worse in almost every

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.690
attribute that can
be measured.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:05.360
Less good infrastructure, less
good education, less good

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.080
other things.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.260
So that's the only piece of
evidence I've seen that has

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.060
some bearing on this question.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.670
It's still a very special
set of 20 places.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.490
So I would say, we know very
little about even the economic

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.110
effects of colonialism.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.480
And then there are all the
political effects, which are

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.560
that colonists often create
hierarchies, and those

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.570
hierarchies create all kinds
of resentment, and a whole

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:42.540
bunch of other stuff that
potentially can go wrong.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.310
But I don't think there's a
great natural experiment that

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:51.270
tells you what would
have happened had

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.130
Algeria not been colonized.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.585
I don't think anybody
knows the answer.

00:22:54.585 --> 00:22:55.060
Yeah.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.435
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the fact
that everywhere from the Congo

00:22:57.435 --> 00:23:01.890
to the US and Canada have been
colonized suggests that it

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:07.576
doesn't matter so much
on the nature of it.

00:23:07.576 --> 00:23:10.890
Why do we want to make
a general statement?

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.360
PROFESSOR: I guess the question
is whether or not

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:20.480
once you interact race
with colony, you

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.040
get much worse outcomes.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.150
You almost surely do.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.800
The question is whether that's
interpretable or not.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:32.220
If I said, take colonies which
are nonwhite colonies, they do

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.490
a lot worse than
white colonies.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:35.920
Now, what that means
I don't know.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:42.570
But I do think that you could
make a firm hypothesis, which

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:46.210
I don't think is testable given
the data, that if you

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.420
were nonwhite and you were
colonized by white people, you

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.780
ended up badly.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.120
You could make the hypothesis.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.160
It wouldn't be rejected.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.330
AUDIENCE: [? Half the ?] people
in the US who were not

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.787
white who were colonized by
white people, it still ended

00:23:56.787 --> 00:24:00.040
up badly, economically, relative
to white Americans.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:00.530
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.760
So I'm not saying that people
resolved this question.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.620
I'm saying the hypothesis
would not be prima facie

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.670
rejected by the data.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.420
But my point is only
that we don't know.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.710
I wasn't saying more
than that.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.420
I would just say that it's not
implausible hypothesis, but

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:21.780
one that I don't think
we know enough to

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.500
answer Collier's question.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.010
I actually don't think that
this is a realistic idea,

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:26.790
because I don't think

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.880
anybody's prepared to actually--

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.050
I think if you look at the US,
the real problem with getting

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:37.910
the US to be a colonist is that
the US actually loves the

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:43.330
idea, maybe, of being
influential in the world, but

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.490
it doesn't actually like the
idea of having young US

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.750
soldiers fighting to protect
some foreign land from its own

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.850
internal conflicts.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.900
That is not a politically
popular idea.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.570
So I don't actually think any
country is volunteering to be

00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.750
a colonist.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.430
And that might be a good thing,
but it is certainly

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.190
true that, I think, after the
Vietnam war, the US has had

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.860
enough of long-term
colonialism.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.130
I think that's the given.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.340
So I don't think there is any
country that's volunteering.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.860
So again, I don't think
Collier's solution, whether

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.120
it's right or wrong--

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.170
I'm inclined to believe it
wouldn't work, even if you

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.390
tried, but that's
a [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.740
I don't think there is any
evidence that anybody's

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.560
willing to do it.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.810
So it's maybe moot.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.370
And then there is Bill Easterly,
who's been very

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.780
critical of both Romer
and Collier.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.820
And his position is very
internally consistent.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.070
His view is that there's
nothing you

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.300
can do to help countries.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.040
Countries have to
help themselves.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:55.380
There is no sense in which there
is really any outside

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.510
wisdom that's useful, with an
important caveat I'll come

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.620
back to in a minute.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.850
But therefore, colonialism won't
help, because countries

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:04.820
help themselves.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.200
They solve their own problems.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.670
You can't really help
any country.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:15.180
He doesn't quite stop there,
which would be really

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.350
internally consistent--

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.900
whether right or wrong is
a different question.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.910
He says, except you should have
free trade, democracy,

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.000
and capitalism.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.360
Those are the three things
that he's in favor of.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.370
And then he's not really in
favor of anything else.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:40.740
So he does believe that the
country should not have choice

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.650
on those dimensions, but once
you have implemented those,

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:47.130
you can leave them alone.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.390
Now, again, the problem is that

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.870
there is not much evidence--

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:57.100
I mean, certainly some countries
have figured it out.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.030
It's not clear that there's any
evidence that the process

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.340
of figuring out is a

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.790
particularly efficient process.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:08.460
We've talked a lot through this
semester about policies

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.630
that were tried and didn't work,
and they didn't work for

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:16.000
very good reasons.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.010
So in other words, there is a
lot of knowledge out there

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:25.030
that's useful for countries
to use.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.460
So it's not clear that you want
to take the position that

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:32.360
countries need to make every
mistake and figure it out.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.560
And it's not clear what
a country means.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:42.930
Is it really the case that, if
I think of Tunisia under Ben

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.500
Ali, there was a collective
experiment in dictatorship?

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.270
It doesn't seem like that's
the right description.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.260
So a country is just
a set of people.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:59.920
But it's not clear that there
is any organizing body which

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.810
is implementing a national
experiment.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:07.960
I mean, maybe some countries
are, but most countries, when

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.480
they fail, they seem to be not
doing anything particularly

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:10.980
interesting.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.870
Some guy is stealing a lot of
money, and the rest of the

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.120
people are suffering.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.860
It's not clear that's a symptom
of the process of

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.370
figuring out where you're going,
rather than just a

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.430
symptom of failure.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.890
And then, I think the most
internally consistent are

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:39.280
definitely our colleagues
Acemoglu and Robinson, whose

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.680
view is very much that there's
nothing you can do to help,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.560
but also that mostly nothing
good will happen.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.370
So their view is, I think,
most solidly internally

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.490
consistent.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:58.290
Basically, countries are
probably screwed.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:28:58.760
Yeah.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.195
AUDIENCE: I don't think that's
a fair assessment.

00:29:01.195 --> 00:29:03.873
Jim Robinson's doing all this
stuff in Sierra Leone now with

00:29:03.873 --> 00:29:06.065
the World Bank and
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:06.065 --> 00:29:08.500
PROFESSOR: But I know
Jim very well.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.830
I know Jim very well.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.080
I think he would say
he's a pessimist.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.040
He might be trying to do
something, but I think he's--

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.220
I would say that that's the most
internally consistent of

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.830
all of these positions that you
see, is the one of saying

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.710
that, look, if I really believe
that institutional

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.820
changes are very difficult, and
they only happen because

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.260
of major historical events,
then it's internally

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.970
consistent be pessimistic.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.500
Because why would we
have much hope?

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:49.380
And I think the example they
give of changes are the French

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.580
Revolution and the Glorious
Revolution.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.395
That's the two examples that
they mostly spend a lot of

00:29:54.395 --> 00:29:55.645
time talking about.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:09.040
So their view is that change
is possible, but change

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.450
happens when internal forces
within a country just happen

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:16.920
to be aligned in the
perfect way.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.190
And they give these two examples
of the Glorious

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:24.950
Revolution in Britain in 1688
and the French Revolution in

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:29.960
1789 as the two examples of
where you just had the right

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.410
alignment of forces.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.260
And then the internal
compulsions of the country

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.190
just drove the country towards
good outcomes.

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:41.000
That in each case, these were
just moments of liberation,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.485
and they did wonderful things
for the country.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.210
There are many, many other such
revolutions, and they

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:51.900
have been less successful.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.920
The Russian Revolution, the
Mexican Revolution, the

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.670
Chinese Revolution.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.270
There are many others you could
go through, and they

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.850
have been less successful,
clearly.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:09.740
So their view is that it's not
enough to have revolutions.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:13.370
You need to change societies
massively.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.130
You need to have revolutions.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.150
But revolutions are not easy.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:18.590
Mostly they go wrong.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:23.190
It's only when you have the
lucky matching of different

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.800
forces that you get
the right outcome.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.250
And therefore, mostly there's
not much you can do.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.230
You can get lucky.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:31.850
If you get lucky, things
will work.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.690
If they do not, there's not
much you can do about it.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.970
And that's very consistent with
the view that they have

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:43.890
from their evidence that all
we really know is that, if

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:48.080
countries got it right several
hundred years ago, then that

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.760
seems to persist.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.580
So when good things happen,
good things build on each

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.280
other, but we have no recipe
for creating good things.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.180
So that's a very, very
pessimistic and tough-minded,

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.140
but, I think in some ways,
admirably internally

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.685
consistent point of view.

00:32:07.685 --> 00:32:10.150
AUDIENCE: I think [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.108
has even tried to
see [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:13.108 --> 00:32:17.052
institutions, changing
institutions, is that US

00:32:17.052 --> 00:32:21.489
conventions, which are in the
treaties, even on things like

00:32:21.489 --> 00:32:24.447
child labor or [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:24.447 --> 00:32:27.898
So in your assessment, or
your generally economic

00:32:27.898 --> 00:32:30.856
[INAUDIBLE], is it part of the
reason, in many case, not

00:32:30.856 --> 00:32:32.828
effective enough,
or [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:32.828 --> 00:32:35.300
will not be effective?

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.960
PROFESSOR: So I'm going to
actually argue that lots of

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.960
institutional changes
are possible.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.980
Just, they're possible at a
different level from the ones

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.680
that we are talking about.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.560
And so I would agree
that many things

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.730
change within countries.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:59.830
Indeed, I would say that if you
look at status of women,

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.300
the standing fact about the
world is how much has changed

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.570
over the last 150 years,
not that there's

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.860
not a lot of change.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.400
And I think the change has
happened in China as much as

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.300
it's happened in the US.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.010
And China was an
extraordinarily, I would say,

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.880
anti-woman country.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.980
And you see massive
changes going on.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.770
So I'm going to argue mostly
that there is actually lots

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:29.550
and lots of possibilities for
changing institutions, just

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.200
that you don't--

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.080
this is asking a different
question.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:49.280
So what we want to argue
in the book is,

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.870
lots of things change.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:55.380
They don't necessarily change
wholesale, and you don't

00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:02.350
necessarily get better
institutions

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:07.140
in any macro sense.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.500
But that doesn't mean that
things are not changing all

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.850
the time, even within political

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:14.330
systems which are bad.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:17.639
So it isn't the case that--

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:24.179
for example, countries which
have had very large

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:28.870
improvements in education
and health.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.600
Indonesia under Suharto--

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.710
which was extraordinarily
corrupt, was often rated the

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:39.179
most corrupt country in the
world, and was under an

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:44.100
extraordinarily repressive
dictator who at some point,

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.969
it's claimed, killed a million
people by labeling them

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:51.389
Communists in the mid-'60s.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:55.000
Nevertheless, if you look at
what's happening in Indonesia,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.600
between the period of 1972 and
1990, is one of the world's

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:09.050
biggest, most successful
investors in human

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.290
capital in the world.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:15.070
You see big changes in education
levels, you see big

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:20.670
changes in health Suharto was
very, very concerned about

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:29.040
Indonesian health, nutrition,
and he created a nationwide

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:34.390
campaign of young people going
back to villages and bringing

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.270
message of better nutrition.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:38.710
And it's claimed to have
improved nutrition massively

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.560
in Indonesia.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.540
So in other words, that's not to
say that Indonesia became a

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:51.030
better country immediately, or
that corruption went away.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:55.370
In fact, during the same period
that education is

00:35:55.370 --> 00:36:00.590
improving in Indonesia,
corruption is also going up.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.630
Suharto is becoming more
and more corrupt.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.890
As his children get older,
they're becoming more and more

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:09.060
richer and richer, and buying up
larger and larger shares of

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.540
the country.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.620
So there was not that there was
a one-way of movement in

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.680
institutions.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.990
And indeed, that's my point.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:26.020
There is no sense in which
there's one institution in

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.100
place, one set of institutions
in place.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.050
There are many, many things
going on in any country.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:36.230
And many of those are
getting better.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.220
Others are getting worse.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.910
I think we're always looking
for leverage points.

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:51.110
What are the best places to
make a small push and see

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.230
where we can make a change?

00:36:53.230 --> 00:37:00.090
So once we start thinking about
institutions in small

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:00.780
letters, rather than

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.820
institutions in capital letters--

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:08.080
so not capitalism, but how a
specific market is run--

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.990
we do see lots of changes.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.850
And that's the level at which
we should think of

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:14.830
institutional change.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.273
Yeah.

00:37:16.273 --> 00:37:20.010
AUDIENCE: I get the sense that,
looking at it from one

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.250
perspective, you should almost
always prefer gradual reform.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.590
Because all the things that
you showed us on the last

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.940
slide are so out of sample that
the chances that they'll

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:33.213
actually work, just because
they're so far beyond what we

00:37:33.213 --> 00:37:40.218
can observe or test and
day-to-day things, that doing

00:37:40.218 --> 00:37:43.950
gradual reform would be the
path of lesser resistance.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:48.345
But then Jim and [? Daron ?]
and [? Pavel ?] have this

00:37:48.345 --> 00:37:50.080
paper where they talk about this
thing called the seesaw

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.152
effect, where you make one
dimension of institutions

00:37:52.152 --> 00:37:54.450
better, another gets worse
to compensate.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:57.140
Or Jeff Sachs would say
that we need to change

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.806
everything at once.

00:37:59.806 --> 00:38:00.798
Do we actually have--

00:38:00.798 --> 00:38:02.782
I mean, I guess that Jim
and [? Daron and ?]

00:38:02.782 --> 00:38:04.766
[? Pavel ?] have a little bit
of evidence in their paper.

00:38:04.766 --> 00:38:10.010
But do we really have much
in the way of systematic

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.690
evidence for that?

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.270
PROFESSOR: So I think
the answer's no.

00:38:19.231 --> 00:38:29.230
It could be that they're right,
that you can never

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:33.440
improve anything without making
something else worse.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.340
I find that implausible,
let's say.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.340
But I'll leave that as a--

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.450
My main point I'm trying to make
here is a simpler one,

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:52.420
which is that there is no grand
theorem which says that

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:58.750
everything that you can change
is determined by some

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.070
overarching institutional
frame.

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:04.060
That even within bad
institutions, there's lots of

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.020
things that do change--
some for the better,

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.340
some for the worse--

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:11.740
and that there is enough slack
within the system that you can

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.030
often change things even when
things look pretty dire.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:19.310
So here's an example.

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:21.120
In Chinese democracy--

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.730
this is not well-known, because
China's not supposed

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:25.910
to be a democracy.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:29.770
But in fact, China introduced
village elections quite early.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.900
And the elections were phased
in, so you could compare

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.160
places which had elections
with places which had a

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.880
centrally-appointed
village head.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.840
So this was just a comparison
of what happens to a place

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.340
when it becomes elected.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:40:00.750
So you been basically seem
to see that when these

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.720
institutional changes happen in
a place like China, which

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.560
is, after all, not
a democracy.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.430
Huge control of the
Communist party.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:16.410
Certainly, whenever there is
any real attempt to change

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:20.360
institutions at the high level,
it's been stamped out

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.160
with a great deal of clarity.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.475
There's never been any
debate on how--

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.710
challenges is to the power of
the Party have not been

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:34.960
entertained.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.670
So you might imagine that when
China introduces village

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.210
elections, this would
do nothing.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.070
Because power has not shifted.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.385
The same people have power.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.540
Turns out that when you
introduce elections, you get

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.790
very large changes.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.330
And this is not now.

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:57.440
This started, I think,
in the '80s.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.760
So when you start introducing
elections, you

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.570
get very large changes.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:04.980
Basically, two things happen.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.650
One is that the central policies
that are unpopular

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:09.040
are less enforced.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:14.150
So the one-child policy, which
is the policy of not allowing

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:17.960
people to have more than one
child, is relaxed much faster

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.920
than places which
have elections.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.890
So somehow, despite the fact
that the central government is

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:29.240
all-powerful, when the village
has an election, it does

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.900
enforce different things.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.370
Second, one other very important
part of Chinese

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:36.470
policy is reallocation
of farmland.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:40.970
Basically, what they were doing
was, they would, for

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:48.000
example, take farmland from
farmers and build cities, or

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.240
roads, or industrial estates, or
special economic zones, and

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.440
things like that.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.920
And basically, when the
village had elected

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.520
government, that stopped,
or went down a lot.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:04.030
So you couldn't take land away
from the farmers that easily.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.890
And this is where the
all-powerful state which was

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:10.050
supposed to have impunity.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:14.140
It was still true that you could
make many changes within

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.190
that system.

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:22.330
And it's so striking, even in a
system like China, how much

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:27.530
responsiveness there
is to local demands

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.140
once you start democracy.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.080
So you might have thought
that, well, the big

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:36.610
institution is, there is
no democracy in China.

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:40.150
China is classified as a
non-democratic state.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.820
Yet at some level, China is
actually quite democratic at

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:43.970
the local level.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:47.360
And that's a way to understand,
also, why China

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.540
has managed its conflicts
relatively effectively.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:56.960
It's because there is actually
pressure involved at the local

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.640
level, which allow it
to let off pressure.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:07.180
So there's a sense in which this
is an example of why we

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:13.750
shouldn't look at institutions
from a thousand miles up, but

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.216
we should look at how they
function on the ground a

00:43:16.216 --> 00:43:17.466
little bit.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.490
And, I think, equally
importantly--

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:30.580
so I just talked about why bad
institutions in capitals, like

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.450
lack of democracy, doesn't
really necessarily always mean

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.830
that is not democracy
on the ground--

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.630
the opposite is also true.

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:40.470
That you could have good
institutions, meaning good

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:46.070
electoral laws, nominally fair
elections, but those elections

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:48.810
may actually not
be at all fair.

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:50.470
And here's a nice example.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:58.280
In Brazil, there was
a complicated

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.890
paper ballot system.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:05.450
Brazil has, for the last many
years, had free and fair

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:07.690
elections, since about
the mid-'80s.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:17.800
And yet, in the Brazilian
electoral system, for a long

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.140
time, people just didn't
think about it.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:24.200
So you would have to write in
the name of the person who you

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.930
were electing, or the number.

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:27.140
Either name or number.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.400
You have to say, Mr. seven,
or something.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.800
And since many people were not
very literate, when they write

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.490
the names of somebody,
it is illegible.

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.130
So as a result, 11%
of the names were

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:43.100
rejected in any election.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.080
That's a lot, right?

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.460
11% of the votes
were rejected.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.760
That's a huge amount.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:53.830
So this was taking
too much effort.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:56.300
Counting votes was
too complicated.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.500
So they replaced it with
electronic voting.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.230
So you to press a button.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:07.940
So that meant that the invalid
votes went away.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:16.790
And as a result, the fraction of
the elected representatives

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:25.900
who were uneducated
or poor went up.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.205
The poor were voting for
people like themselves.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:40.600
As a result, health expenditures
went up, and a

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.170
bunch of pro-poor policies
were implemented.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:49.690
So this is an example of where
Brazil had good institutions

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:54.280
in capitals to start with, but
somehow those institutions

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.310
weren't doing what they
were supposed to do.

00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:00.640
So if you looked at it from a
thousand feet up, you will see

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.810
good institutions.

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.810
But that doesn't mean that the
institutions were actually

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:08.260
doing what the were supposed
to be doing.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.980
And so about 10% of the
population, and a huge

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.830
proportion of the poor,
were disenfranchised.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:19.710
11% percent of the votes
were eliminated.

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:23.950
That means that, if you take the
poor, probably 30, 40% of

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:25.360
the poor were disenfranchised.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.970
They couldn't vote.

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:30.120
That changed the nature of
voting and changed the nature

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:30.730
of outcomes.

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:36.210
So it's a beautiful example
of how something--

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.000
nobody thought about this.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.170
It's not that anybody had
this as a conspiracy.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:43.990
This was not somebody's plan.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:45.970
It just was something
that was just there.

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:48.010
People thought paper
ballots were fine.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:49.380
Nobody ever thought about it.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.520
Once you change the rules, and
you mostly changed the rules

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.850
not to fix it, but to just make
it easier to count votes,

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:57.850
it turned out that that had
massive consequences.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:01.590
This is the picture.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:02.950
I'll just skip this.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.525
So here's another couple
of nice experiments.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:27.860
So one argument that Paul
Collier makes a lot of is, he

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:32.030
says the reason why you have to
invade this country is that

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:36.100
these countries, have too much
internal conflict, that they

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.310
can't govern themselves because
they're fighting each

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:41.080
other all the time.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.730
Paul is very sympathetic to
these people, you have to

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:44.650
understand.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:50.930
He's a very, very soft-hearted
colonist--

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:52.180
imperialist.

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:57.340
I've known him for
many, many years.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:01.070
And he's certainly not someone
who's cynical about this.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:05.110
He certainly does really believe
that these people are

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:09.760
just caught in this eternal
fight against each other.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.350
They hate each other's guts.

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.890
And so, therefore, they
can never govern.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.870
Whenever one group takes
over, it starts

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:18.340
beating up on the others.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.550
And that's why you always have a
permanent state of civil war

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:24.000
and conflict.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.700
They're just not capable of
governing each other because

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.300
there's so much fundamental
hatred of each other.

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:38.000
So to look at this, Leonard
Wantchekon, who is a political

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.690
scientist from Benin,
did the following.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:49.630
Leonard was in the student
movement in Benin in the late

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.330
'70s, early '80s.

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:56.290
And that's when, I think, Benin
had a dictatorship.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:00.910
And so he went to jail with all
the other people who were

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.720
leading the student movement.

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.270
And so he's very good friends
with all the leading

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:08.370
politicians in Benin now.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:10.310
So Benin is now a democracy.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:14.590
And in the democracy,
he's good friends

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:17.110
with all the leaders.

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:19.660
So he basically talked them
into doing something quite

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.700
remarkable.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:26.610
His idea was, every leader,
he basically got

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:27.855
the following deal.

00:49:27.855 --> 00:49:33.240
He said, let's go to the area
where you are really dominant.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:36.080
Go to the area where you
are really powerful.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.860
So you're never going
to lose that area.

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.690
You're always going
to win that area.

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:42.910
So it doesn't really matter if
you get a little less votes.

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:46.210
So let's do an experiment
where you send different

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:52.250
messages in different areas.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:59.490
So within in that area, let's
say there's this region like

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:02.700
that, where this is where
you're totally dominant.

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:03.980
You're always going to win.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:07.930
So now let's chop this up into
little pieces and randomly

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:10.380
choose some of them.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:14.720
This is all within the area
where you're sure to win.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.850
We're going to randomize
the message you send.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.610
So there were two messages
they were sending.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:44.600
So this is the message that
primes people on their narrow

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.140
tribal interests, if you like.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.965
This says, the Bariba people
will get jobs.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.270
I am the representative
of the Bariba people.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:03.470
This is what Paul Collier is
particularly concerned with.

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:07.290
So this is the same guy going
to different in villages and

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:11.190
giving different messages.

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:14.080
The villages are randomly
chosen, so you can compare

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.690
what happens.

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:18.380
And they were willing to
do it because they

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.850
were sure of winning.

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:22.250
So they didn't have to worry
about winning there.

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.400
The question was many
votes do they get.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.390
This was the Clientelist
message, the message that I'll

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:33.080
serve you guys, my people.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.880
That's what people are
worried about.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.530
Here's the public
policy message.

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:40.050
Same person, different village,
goes and delivers

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:41.300
this message.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:49.410
We will fight corruption and
promote peace among all ethnic

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:52.600
groups in all regions
of Benin.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.940
This was completely rigged.

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:57.300
They were given these
messages.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:59.210
They agreed to deliver
it because they

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:03.020
were friends of his.

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:08.890
So this is what makes Paul
collier worried.

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:11.830
So this was the first experiment
that Leonard did.

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:15.520
So if you look at what happens
to vote shares, if you go to

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:19.240
the villages where you did the
public policy message, you got

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.830
only 59% of the vote.

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:23.320
When you did Clientelist
message, you

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.460
got 79% of the vote.

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.790
So this is what gets Paul
Collier worried.

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:32.540
He says it's not possible to
have democracy in these places

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.780
because people are
so narrow-minded.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.750
Now what happened--

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:39.630
let me just go back--

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:40.880
is--

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.000
OK.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.670
Let me see.

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:51.920
Where did it go?

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:03.640
OK.

00:53:07.905 --> 00:53:11.100
Let me mention one more,
and I'll come back to--

00:53:13.726 --> 00:53:16.640
no, actually--

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.470
so let me show you one
other experiment

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:19.620
before I come to this.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.302
Because this is sort
of interesting.

00:53:22.302 --> 00:53:25.280
I'll show you one more.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:31.370
So here's an experiment that we
did in India, which is kind

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:40.890
of the opposite of this
Wantchekon experiment, and has

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:42.300
the opposite result.

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:47.330
And I'll try and
interpret why.

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:54.930
This is probably the most
corrupt place in India.

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:06.740
About 40% of the people who are
elected from there have

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.600
criminal charges against them.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.550
In this area, we did an
experiment where we randomly

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:14.770
chose villages.

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:23.620
And in some of the villages, we
basically showed up with a

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:24.540
puppet show.

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:28.410
Basically, we showed up
with a puppet show.

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:32.860
The point of the public show
was to say, you should not

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.540
vote based on your caste, which
is the equivalent of

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.750
ethnicity in India.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:40.740
You should vote based on
who's going to do more

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.450
development for you.

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:43.730
So that was the message.

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:44.980
It was a completely
neutral message.

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:57.965
And the neutral message was
delivered by an NGO.

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:09.170
When you look at what happened,
the people who voted

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:16.700
for their ethnic party went
down by a quarter.

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.040
If you just went and told
people, don't do it, they

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.300
don't do it.

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:23.000
So this is sort of the opposite
story, which is, in

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.650
Benin, the experiment was that
you went and told people,

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:32.150
please vote for me based
on my ethnicity.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:34.190
Then they seem to vote
on ethnicity.

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:35.410
If you tell people,
don't vote on

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:37.800
ethnicity, they do the opposite.

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.360
Now, is Benin different?

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.040
I'll come back to that later.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.560
But what this made us think
about was, maybe the reason

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.750
why you observe this
ethnicity-based voting is not

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:53.440
because people are passionate
about their ethnic roots.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:54.300
Sometimes they are.

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.460
But maybe a lot of
people are not.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.400
But because they have no other
information, maybe they don't

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.170
know anything about
the candidate.

00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:06.445
And therefore, if I have no idea
who to vote for, there

00:56:06.445 --> 00:56:09.370
are three people running, I just
vote for the one who has

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:11.310
the same name as me.

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:11.520
Why?

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.370
Because I have no idea
who they are.

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:15.140
I've never met them.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.030
I have no idea what
they believe in.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:21.390
I don't trust them to have told
me the truth in any case.

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:34.850
So do you actually get
the right outcome?

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:39.050
So maybe the reason why people
vote based on ethnicity,

00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:47.620
whereas we think that somehow
people to just have some

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:52.330
biological or sociological
hatred of those other people

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:54.950
and they can't resist voting, in
fact, maybe the reason why

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:58.290
they vote for their own
ethnicity is only because they

00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:00.570
have no better choices.

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:02.830
They don't know anything about
any of the candidates, so they

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.340
might as well vote for
their ethnicity.

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.230
So this is what we were
investigating.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:07.510
Keep going.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:08.283
Yeah.

00:57:08.283 --> 00:57:10.583
AUDIENCE: In the Benin
experiment as well, it seemed

00:57:10.583 --> 00:57:12.227
like it was a way to
target things.

00:57:12.227 --> 00:57:14.445
Like, I'm this ethnicity, and
I'm going to get things for

00:57:14.445 --> 00:57:16.664
people of this ethnicity,
versus, I'm going to do good

00:57:16.664 --> 00:57:20.115
things for everybody.

00:57:20.115 --> 00:57:22.590
I don't know if that would be so
different than if somebody

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:26.150
was running for Senate in the US
and was like, I'm going to

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:28.406
do good things for the people of
Massachusetts, versus, I'm

00:57:28.406 --> 00:57:30.080
going to do good things for
everyone in the US.

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.230
PROFESSOR: So you may
well be right.

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:37.936
So that's another point.

00:57:37.936 --> 00:57:41.490
I'll come back to the
Benin in a minute.

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:45.100
I just wanted to show
this experiment.

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:48.220
And I'll come back to the
Benin one in a minute.

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:52.980
So based on this idea that maybe
voters don't know who

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:55.650
they are voting for--

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:58.500
and therefore, they just vote at
random, and maybe they just

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:02.050
vote for the guy who has the
right name or something--

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:05.850
we did another experiment where
we gave information

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:09.520
about the candidates
to the voters.

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:17.460
We told them, this
candidate works

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:18.720
harder than that candidate.

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:23.530
We showed newspapers printed
people's performance.

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:27.780
And when you do that, you see
that people do change their

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:30.190
voting patterns, suggesting that
people don't really know

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.540
a lot about the candidates.

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.730
If you give them information,
they react, which suggests

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:37.300
that information is
valuable to them.

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.010
They don't really know
what's going on.

00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:41.360
OK.

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:46.660
Let me now go back to Benin,
and I'll come back to this.

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.420
So here's what happened
in Benin.

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:53.290
Wantchekon did a second
experiment.

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:59.660
Second experiment was, instead
of people just saying, I'm

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:05.750
going to do good for everybody,
he actually had

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:09.790
them run a conference where,
in the conference, they

00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:12.780
discussed real policies.

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:16.450
So they had a long discussion of
real, substantive policies.

00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:19.520
Experts were invited.

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:25.500
And so parties took up the
policies that came out of that

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.970
conference and put it
on the platform.

00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:31.120
These were well-worked-out
policies, not claims about,

00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.370
I'll do good for everybody.

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:37.430
So the only difference--

00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:41.080
then he does the same experiment
as before in a

00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.080
different election,
later election.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:50.790
He does the same experiment,
which is telling some people,

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:54.280
either send an ethnic message
or a non-ethnic message.

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:05.830
And now, when you go and tell
I'm going to do good for

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:10.040
everybody, that actually
goes the other way.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.250
So when you say, I'm going to
do good for everybody, but

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:15.510
it's backed with a real policy
proposal, you get much more

01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:18.410
positive results.

01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:21.510
So it looks like the voters were
actually rightly cynical

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:22.870
about these politicians.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:26.310
They were claiming they're
going to do stuff for

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:29.760
everybody, but nobody believed
them, because they had not put

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.210
any content into it.

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:34.770
When you actually put content
into what you're claiming,

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:37.030
voters react very differently.

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:39.660
They feel like there's something
that's going on

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.870
that's maybe worth supporting.

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:47.310
So you see, instead of this
strong reaction for the ethnic

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.750
point of view, now you get the
opposite, which is a strong

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:53.408
reaction for the non-ethnic
point of view.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.350
Another example.

01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:20.180
So the point I'm trying to
make here is that in some

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:24.130
sense, what looks
like structural

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:27.892
resistance to any change--

01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:30.820
countries are just hopeless,
they have such ethnic conflict

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.760
that they can't do anything
about it-- that might be true

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.210
under some situations.

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:44.090
But, for example, if you want
to name countries which have

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:55.090
had some of the most serious
ethnic violence in the last 20

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:59.440
years, they include many
countries which are actually

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.460
very economically successful
countries.

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:12.040
So it's not clear that that's
something that the effects are

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:12.900
that strong.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.960
But even if you believe it, it's
not clear whether ethnic

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:21.690
conflicts are a result of other
failures or the cause.

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:24.350
So in other words, is it the
case that people are basically

01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:27.390
cynical about the political
system, and therefore they'll

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:33.450
vote for the person whose name
is the same as theirs, or is

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:40.220
it really the case that they
vote for people who have the

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.900
same name as theirs,
and therefore the

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.600
political system fails?

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.150
That's the challenge
in figuring out.

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:50.000
And at least there seems
to be some data

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.940
which suggests that--

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:54.170
this evidence that I've
been talking about--

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:58.240
suggests that it may well be
that, to a certain extent, if

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.400
people are cynical about the
political system, makes them

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.360
then vote more unreliably.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.650
And if you could actually get
the political system to be

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:10.760
more effective, then people
would actually be less

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.420
inclined to vote on
the ethnic basis.

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:17.380
So in other words, I'm trying
to make the case that what

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.270
looks like--

01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:22.350
in Collier's view,
the fundamental

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:26.040
problem is ethnic hatred.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.400
Whereas it may well be that
the fundamental problem is

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.610
just economic failure, and
ethnic hatred or ethnic

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.900
conflicts are just
a result of that.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:40.970
And it's not clear which
way that goes.

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:44.060
And in particular, it could
be very innocent.

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.760
People just are completely--

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.480
it's not that they
hate anybody.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.340
They just think, OK, well if I
don't have any information,

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.900
I'm going to vote for the guy
who has the same name as me.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.030
That might be a significant
part of what is

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:59.110
called ethnic voting.

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:02.650
Here's another instance
that's interesting.

01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:16.930
So going down this same path of
making the point that it is

01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:18.240
possible to--

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.820
So in other words, I
made two points.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:30.210
One is that having good
institutions is no guarantee

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:33.970
that you get good outcomes.

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:39.740
And the good institution at the
1,000-feet level is not a

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.840
guarantee that you get good
outcomes on the ground level.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:50.150
And conversely, if you look at
it from 1,000 feet, what looks

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:55.970
like bad outcomes may not be
necessarily some things that

01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:58.610
you should just take as, well,
it's not possible to do

01:04:58.610 --> 01:04:59.630
anything in this country.

01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:01.500
There may be lots of slack
in the country.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.890
Because, for example, even
ethnic preferences, which is

01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:08.150
seen as a fundamental
constraint, may not be that

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:09.120
much of a constraint.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.950
They may just be an outcome
rather than a constraint.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:20.560
To pursue that point, that it's
often possible to have

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:26.670
substantial changes even when
the economic incentives have

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:30.630
not been changed very much--
so the structures of power

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:33.550
have not changed, the
institutions are the same--

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:36.530
here's an example.

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:38.660
This is not someone saying
whether the institutions are

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:42.480
good or bad to start with, but
to say that it's possible to

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.770
change institutions
at the margin, a

01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:46.900
little, and get big effects.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.150
So here's an example
from Brazil.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:51.990
Brazil is interesting.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:54.190
The political system in Brazil
is among the most interesting

01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:55.580
in the world.

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:59.550
One thing they do is every
month, 60 municipalities are

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:02.425
chosen at random, and their
accounts are audited.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:14.840
So you audit the accounts,
and then the audits are

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.610
basically--

01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:17.860
there's a lottery.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.070
Literally.

01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:23.240
That's on TV.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.860
They're doing a lottery.

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:29.020
The winner of the lottery
doesn't get a lot of money.

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.160
The winner of the lottery
gets audited.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.156
So you don't want to
do be the winner.

01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:39.030
It's on TV, so it's very,
very transparent.

01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:42.130
Everybody can see that it
is really a lottery.

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:44.570
That's a big advantage
of lottery.

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:46.840
The audit is also given
to the government and

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.090
disclosed to the media.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:53.300
So there's a nice paper
studying the

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.510
effect of these audits.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:07:00.510
And basically what they do is,
they compare places that were

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:03.650
audited just before the election
and places that were

01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:05.030
audited just after
the elections.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:25.250
And in particular, it turns out
that if you look at the

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:31.950
average effect of being audited
before or after

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:33.620
elections, there's not
a big difference.

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.010
Why isn't there a
big difference?

01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:38.510
Well, turns out most people
don't find out the results.

01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:42.250
But if you look at the places
which have a which have a

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:48.080
radio station, and compare the
effect of being audited on

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.220
places which have a radio
station with the effect of not

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.890
being audited on places which
have a radio station, you see

01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:55.140
a massive effect.

01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:03.080
If you're corrupt, and you were
a mayor from a place that

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.040
had a radio station, and you
were audited before the

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:13.100
election, you are 25 percentage
points less likely

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:22.030
to get elected than if you were
a non-corrupt mayor from

01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:26.560
a place which has a radio
station and which was audited

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.800
before the election.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.940
So the difference in election
probability--

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:45.819
So what we're doing here is
comparing places that were

01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:48.460
audited before the election
and after the election.

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:51.510
And we're comparing good
mayors with bad mayors.

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:55.069
So good mayors are much more
likely to get elected in

01:08:55.069 --> 01:09:00.500
places where the audit was
before the elections.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.060
Whereas there's little
difference between good mayors

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:06.800
and bad mayors if
the audit was to

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.080
happen after the elections.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.990
So just this act of publishing
the audits seems to have

01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:15.040
substantially changed
the incentive for

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.390
corruption in Brazil.

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:20.670
So this is an example of
something where the system has

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:21.670
not changed.

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:23.470
The whole system is the same.

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:26.279
Brazilian democracy has
not changed a lot.

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:29.560
But just the fact that they
instituted these audits means

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.769
that being corrupt is
much more costly.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:41.380
This is a picture which
makes that point.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:47.649
The blue is those who the audit
was after the election.

01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:50.370
And being corrupt
has no effect on

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:51.620
your reelection rate.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:10:06.320
Whereas, if you had zero corrupt
violations and you had

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:13.630
a pre-election audit, you were
35 percentage points--

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:14.330
I said 25--

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:19.060
35 percentage points less likely
to be elected then if

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.700
you had three or more,
if there was a

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.370
pre-election audit.

01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:27.300
If you have a post-election
audit, it doesn't matter,

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.510
because the election is done.

01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:33.550
So getting information has
huge effects here.

01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:37.010
These effects are on
a magnitude which--

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:44.140
clearly, you go from having 50%
chance of being elected to

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:47.780
being a 20% chance of being
elected, just when you publish

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.030
the results.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:55.320
So again, making the point
that small changes in the

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.940
institutional frame, the little
institutions, changing

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:01.915
them a little might actually
give you big effects.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.190
So, so far, what I've been
trying to say is a bit that,

01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:22.300
even within bad institutional
frames, or without changing

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.510
the institutional framework
generally, you can make good

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:28.010
things happen.

01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:30.240
That doesn't mean that good
things are guaranteed to

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.760
happen-- whenever you try
things, good things happen.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.320
That's not at all
what I'm saying.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.930
So I'm saying that what's true
about economy at the

01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:47.340
1,000-feet level is entirely
one thing.

01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:52.660
And then there is possibly
what's irrelevant at the

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:55.430
10-feet level, and those
things are only weakly

01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:56.680
correlated.

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:03.020
So in other words, things fail
at the ground level whether or

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:06.470
not you have good institutional
structures.

01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:11.330
So let me give you an example
of where the institutional

01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:17.520
structures were all good, and
the system completely failed.

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:23.110
So we did an experiment where
there was a district

01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:28.350
administration in India worked
with an NGO to set up

01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:34.050
monitoring system to make sure
that nurses come to work.

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:36.290
Nurses often don't
come to work.

01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:38.460
You saw that, I think, at
the beginning of the

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.090
semester with Esther.

01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:44.150
And this is a big concern
for the health system.

01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:48.330
Because you show up, nobody's
there, that's not so good.

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:52.210
So the way it was implemented
was that there was a date and

01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:55.770
time stamp given
to every nurse.

01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:58.450
This was just on Mondays
when she was required

01:12:58.450 --> 01:12:59.920
to be in the center.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.730
She was required to stamp her
presence on something that was

01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:05.850
stuck to the wall.

01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:11.430
So she would have stamped it
there so that people could

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.000
check whether she was
there or not.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So she had to stamp
it on the wall.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.420
So she had to be there.

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:24.060
And this NGO was in charge of
collecting the stamps and

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.930
counting them up and giving
them to the government.

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:33.530
So the district administration
was very

01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:35.180
taking this very seriously.

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:40.120
They announced that anybody who
doesn't come to work at

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:44.630
least 50% of the time
will get fired.

01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:50.240
So there was a quite major
top-down attempt to reform.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:54.510
So the institutional frame
was doing everything

01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:57.340
it needed to do.

01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.650
So when this was announced,
immediately--

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.240
just compare the dashed lines
to the dashed lines.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.200
I didn't tell you the story
of the solid lines.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.690
So just compare the dashed
line to the dashed line.

01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:17.520
You see there's a very
major effect.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:24.600
At the beginning, the presence
of the nurse goes from 15%--

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.500
15%.

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.050
They don't show up at all--

01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:30.200
to about 55%.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.800
It goes up massively.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.750
When you announce this program,
it goes up massively.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:38.270
They start to come to work.

01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:39.330
And that's not surprising.

01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:40.880
You told them.

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:44.740
And then what happens, you see
those curves getting closer

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:48.620
and closer, and they
finally cross.

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:54.290
So after a while, it turns out
that in the places where the

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.710
nurses were threatened with
losing their jobs, they're

01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:59.450
coming to work less than where
they were not threatened.

01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:03.250
So what happened?

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:04.500
Why did it get reversed?

01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:14.330
So what happened was
very interesting.

01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:16.845
So two things happened.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:22.680
The nurse has an immediate boss
whose job is to decide

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.120
whether the nurse needs to
come to work or not.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:25.550
Why?

01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:28.140
Because the nurses have
things like training.

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.700
So some days, they're not
required to come to work.

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:32.160
Those are called exempt days.

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:40.570
And then the date and time stamp
had to work in order to

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:41.610
monitor the nurses.

01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:45.880
So the date and time stamp
got broken, you

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.150
couldn't monitor them.

01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:50.190
Now there was a rule which said
that, if it's broken,

01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:51.490
they would have bring
it in to the

01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:54.230
center and get it replaced.

01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:58.310
But still, once it gets broken,
it's less easy to

01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:59.320
monitor them.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.880
So what happened was
very simple.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.580
Absence did not go up.

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:09.300
It's not that the
absence went up.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.110
The exemptions went up.

01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:14.810
Meaning that their immediate
boss basically declared, fine,

01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:16.190
you don't have to
come to work.

01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:17.610
From now on, you're
not absent.

01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:19.620
You're exempt.

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:22.810
Meaning the boss said,
I don't care if you

01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:24.190
don't come to work.

01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:28.480
So I'll give you an official
excuse to not come to work.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.660
That was part of
what happened.

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:31.210
Part of what happened was
that they started

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:32.480
breaking the machines.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.620
The machines started breaking
in increasing frequency.

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:38.750
And the bosses who should
have complained

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:40.500
about that didn't complain.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:47.770
So the machines kept breaking
and nobody was objecting, so

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.750
the whole program collapsed.

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:53.152
Now, why did this happen?

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:19.060
So clearly, this was a result of
the fact that the nurse and

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:21.130
her immediate boss
were colluding.

01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:24.180
That's not surprising.

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:28.370
But the reason why it actually
happened was not because the

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:30.400
institutional frame was bad.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.200
In some sense, there
is democracy.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.000
There was supervisor who
wanted it to happen.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.640
There was an NGO that
was implementing it.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:44.300
The reason why didn't work was
mostly because there was no

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:45.910
demand for it to work.

01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:48.280
It wasn't so much that
the institutional

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.275
frame wasn't there.

01:17:49.275 --> 01:17:53.380
It was just that, basically,
people figured out that if it

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.680
didn't work, nobody
would complain.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.590
And why would nobody complain?

01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:01.350
Well, you saw this before.

01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:05.500
Nobody ever showed up in these
health centers in any case.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.230
So there was no one
to complain.

01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:11.300
So there's no political
compulsion to fix it.

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:16.380
And that meant that at some
level, there was no pressure

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:18.110
to make it work.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:24.640
This is what sometimes
we call triple-i.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.690
In other words, the reason why
this intervention didn't work

01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:35.080
is not because the institutional
frame was not

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.240
working, but because there was
no one on the ground who

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:43.820
actually had any stake
in making it work.

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.965
Nobody went to the health
center, so nobody complained.

01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:54.580
The system was designed with
the idea that these nurses

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:59.450
have some internal desire
to serve of the people.

01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:06.160
So the system has no effective
culture of making sure that

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.130
the nurses one want
to come to work.

01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:12.020
They never invested in it.

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:19.450
And finally, there was no one
had thought about the fact

01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:32.890
that there were these exempt
days, and that these exempt

01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:34.230
days were not regulated.

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:37.580
So that it was mostly just
the fact that, when this

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:40.740
intervention was introduced,
nobody had actually put enough

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:45.280
thought into how the
system would react.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:50.780
And so it was not so much that
the institutional frame was

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:53.220
particularly bad here.

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:55.150
Other interventions do work.

01:19:55.150 --> 01:20:00.380
It's just that this was a system
where there was no one

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:04.170
who actually had thought about
how to design an intervention

01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:08.130
that would work, and therefore
it didn't work.

01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:13.570
Indeed, when we went back,
we figured out why

01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:14.900
you get this crossing.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.800
Why do you think we
get this crossing?

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.420
Why do you think the nurses
came less when they were

01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:22.234
incentivized to come?

01:20:34.534 --> 01:20:37.832
AUDIENCE: I think it's a
situation where there were new

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:39.296
measure put in place.

01:20:39.296 --> 01:20:41.614
Once it became clear that those
measure weren't going to

01:20:41.614 --> 01:20:45.152
be enforced at all long-term,
it was an even clearer

01:20:45.152 --> 01:20:46.970
indication that no one would
check up on them.

01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:49.480
It's one thing to have a policy
that in theory exists,

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:51.418
and no one tries to
ever enforce it.

01:20:51.418 --> 01:20:58.303
But if then they try to
institute this new policy and

01:20:58.303 --> 01:20:59.642
indeed, it was very [INAUDIBLE]
that there was no

01:20:59.642 --> 01:21:01.911
enforcement, that sends an even
stronger message that you

01:21:01.911 --> 01:21:03.480
can shirk out your
responsibilities.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:03.940
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:07.770
So they realized that their
bosses were very willing to

01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:10.550
collude with them to
not let them work.

01:21:17.690 --> 01:21:21.710
So because they had had a policy
which required their

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.790
bosses to enforce, now they
could learn that the bosses

01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:27.090
had no interest in enforcing.

01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:28.590
Before this, they didn't
know that.

01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:30.840
So in the control villages, they
don't yet know that the

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.610
bosses don't care.

01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:35.090
In the treatment villages, they
really learned that the

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:36.730
bosses don't give a
damn whether they

01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:37.960
come to work or not.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.280
So they stopped coming
to work.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:55.445
So whether these institutions
at the 1,000-feet level work

01:21:55.445 --> 01:21:56.860
or don't work--

01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:59.310
I mean, there's a
democracy here.

01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:00.580
Lots of people vote.

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.330
There is political
competition.

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:04.660
All of those things that are
supposed to make these things

01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:06.510
work are all present.

01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:12.010
The reason why it doesn't work
is simply, at the micro level,

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:14.380
the incentive to make
it work isn't there.

01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:17.780
Because people don't go to the
health center, so nobody

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:21.136
actually demands that the
health centers work.

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:23.122
AUDIENCE: So actually, more
people started to go to the

01:22:23.122 --> 01:22:23.430
health centers.

01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:26.260
And yet there were few
people [INAUDIBLE]?

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:27.510
PROFESSOR: No.

01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:32.370
Basically, people have checked
out of the system.

01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:36.830
So more people use the health
center, but only by accident,

01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:37.750
when it's open.

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:41.650
So the probability, per day,
more people are not present.

01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:45.310
It's open more often, but it
doesn't have any effect on who

01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:47.310
gets treated per day.

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:48.180
Yeah.

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:48.783
Alyssa?

01:22:48.783 --> 01:22:51.148
AUDIENCE: The fact that nobody
is using these can't be that

01:22:51.148 --> 01:22:53.354
there wouldn't be a demand
for health care if they

01:22:53.354 --> 01:22:53.513
functioned.

01:22:53.513 --> 01:22:56.840
It's itself an outcome
of the fact that--

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.090
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:04.220
But this attempt to fix it
came from a bureaucratic

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:07.150
impulse which said, have
health center,

01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:08.560
will make it work.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:13.530
And they just did not think
about what was required to

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:15.650
make it work, which is to
get a demand for it.

01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:17.110
Otherwise, it's never
going to work.

01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:20.650
The political system only
provides incentives for things

01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:21.380
people want.

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:23.670
If people don't want it, the
political system doesn't

01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:25.610
provide incentives.

01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:31.940
It was a classic example of
trying to fix institutions

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:34.420
without really having
understood how the

01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:36.082
institutions work.

01:23:36.082 --> 01:23:39.140
So I'll continue with
this next time.
