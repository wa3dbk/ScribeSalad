00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.160
PROFESSOR: Why do people save?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.070
Well, that seems like--

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.790
I assume you know the
answer to that.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.990
Well, one answer is the
economics, in the sense of two

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.050
standard answers to
that question.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.950
One is consumptions smoothing.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.280
Consumption smoothing
is the idea--

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.805
what's consumption smoothing?

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:54.039
AUDIENCE: It means you're living
kind of like-- let's

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.670
say one day I purchase all these
different things and I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.018
eat really well on this day,
but tomorrow I starve.

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:01.522
The idea is that I'd spread it
out over a period of time so

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:05.537
that each day I would have the
maximum possible to make it as

00:01:05.537 --> 00:01:07.620
easy as possible over
all those days.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.946
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:01:07.946 --> 00:01:10.950
So not have too much variation
in consumption.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.470
And what's life cycle?

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.100
It's another code word
that economists use.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.575
What's the life cycle
reason to save?

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:20.926
AUDIENCE: Special events in a
person's life, like childbirth

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:26.000
or marriage, [INAUDIBLE] with
your parents, marriage.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.750
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so saving for
special events in your life.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.690
What's the most important event
a lot of people in the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.940
US save for?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.420
Retirement.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.770
So I think, among other
things, saving for--

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.300
you guys are kind of revealing
your age, I guess.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.080
But retirement is the
single biggest

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.730
reason why people save.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.350
And that's one life cycle
event which is very

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.940
predictable.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.450
At least, if you get there,
you'll need money.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:09.090
And then as you said, other
events you can predict, like

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.180
your child's wedding, own
wedding, child, but all kinds

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.750
of other predictable events.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.440
Any others?

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.690
Any other reason to save?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.088
Yeah?

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:33.064
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:33.064 --> 00:02:34.052
or an opportunity.

00:02:34.052 --> 00:02:37.650
Like, maybe you want to start
a business [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.520
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.170
The last reason, very important
reason is to take

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.950
advantage of opportunities.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.280
Starting a business is one.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.205
What else could you do
if you saved up?

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.580
AUDIENCE: Buying a home,
buying land.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.440
Buying home, buying land.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.170
Just paying for school fees.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.050
Sometimes, many places you have
to pay a big part of the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.550
school fees at the beginning
of the year, so you want to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.250
have money saved up so that
when this beginning of the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.440
year shows up, you can
pay the school fees.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.050
So there's are all kinds of
very standard reasons why

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.680
people save.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.230
So now coming to why
they may not save.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.620
So sometimes, I'm going
to say, it's

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.870
efficient not to save.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.600
What are situations where
you shouldn't save?

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:48.989
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:51.636 --> 00:03:52.100
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.710
So one possibility is that
today, your marginal utility

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.090
of consumption is very high.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.430
You're sick, and you
need money today.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.250
But let's say on a more
long-term basis, is there a

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.950
situation where it makes sense
not to save, even over five

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.820
years or something.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.312
Yeah?

00:04:12.312 --> 00:04:15.756
AUDIENCE: Well, if you know if
you save, and then you're not

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:18.462
going to get very much back from
the savings, there isn't

00:04:18.462 --> 00:04:19.200
much point.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.650
For instance, if the money you
put away under floorboards

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.945
rots or something like that.

00:04:24.945 --> 00:04:25.320
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.230
Another possibility is that it's
may be you can't save, or

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.480
it's just difficult.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.630
High inflation--

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.870
you have to save in money,
and so that makes

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.280
it you can't save.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.220
But I'm asking an even
simpler question--

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.780
or, maybe not simpler, but
different question, which is,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.400
imagine that you could save--

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.940
there's no problem saving--

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.760
would there be a situation where
you would actually find

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.290
it optimal not to save?

00:04:56.236 --> 00:04:58.765
AUDIENCE: If you didn't expect
to be [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:58.765 --> 00:04:59.615
by it.

00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:00.040
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:08.570
So one possibility is that you
have lots of money now, and

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.830
the future looks very sharp, you
should not save for sure.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.685
But that's something
important.

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:15.450
We'll come back to it.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.540
Yeah?

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.700
AUDIENCE: If Social Security
is very good, state-based,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.300
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.700
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.400
So if, for example, you
are in the US, social.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.260
security covers a large part
of your earnings if you are

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.020
poor, and not a large part of
your earnings if you're rich.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.420
So if you happen to be quite
poor, you know that actually

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.620
once you turn 65, Social
Security is going to start

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.920
paying you a fair
amount of money.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.350
And let's say Social Security
pays you $30,000 a year.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.250
You're making $20,000
a year now.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.180
There's no reason for
you to save, right?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.570
So Social Security, the
government has guaranteed you

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.670
$30,000 a year once
you're retired.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.960
You are 62, you're making
$20,000 a year.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.250
You have no reason to save,
because you know actually, if

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.350
you saved, your consumption
today would go down to, let's

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.430
say, $15,000.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.410
And then your consumption after
retirement will go up to

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.390
$35,000, but that
makes no sense.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.550
You want to actually smooth.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.260
So the general principle--

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.510
what's the general
principle there?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.660
Much more generally, where
would you expect

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.380
people not to save?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.324
AUDIENCE: When they're expecting
[? some money ?]

00:06:43.324 --> 00:06:48.184
might not be worth what
it is now [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:48.184 --> 00:06:50.128
where there's not really
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:54.910
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.220
So you are saying there's
no way to save.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.160
But let's assume there's
a way to save.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.740
I'm just asking the general
principle from the Social

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.750
Security example.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.320
Think about it, what's the
general principle.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.490
When do you want to not save?

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:14.710
AUDIENCE: When the utility of
the money becomes [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.226
PROFESSOR: Which means what?

00:07:17.226 --> 00:07:19.666
AUDIENCE: You're saving less.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:20.916
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.450
PROFESSOR: When you say usually
money decreases over

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.515
time, what are you saying
about the future?

00:07:30.678 --> 00:07:32.920
AUDIENCE: Maybe that you'll
burn more [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.080
PROFESSOR: You're
getting richer.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.140
Imagine you were someone
who expects to

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.780
get richer over time--

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.400
a lot richer over time--

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.850
that person should not be
saving, because if I think my

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.420
wages are going to grow at 10%
a year, then I have no

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.870
business trying to save,
because essentially my

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.870
consumption tomorrow in any case
will be higher, even if I

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.150
didn't save any.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.290
So I have no reason to save.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.670
So if I think the future's a
lot better than today, I

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.360
should not save.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.120
That's a general principle about
savings, which is that

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.590
you're trying to make
small consumption.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.930
If you're trying smooth
consumption, and you know your

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.640
consumption is going to be
non-smooth in any case, then

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.740
you want to counteract
that by not saving.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.140
So in general, people
who expect--

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.980
so here's a fact.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.490
I'm not going to actually
spend a lot of time

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.740
elaborating on it--
today at least--

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.600
which is, what's the country in
the world which is growing

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.850
the fastest?

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.380
Or at least, one at of the
countries in the world.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.078
AUDIENCE: China.

00:08:43.078 --> 00:08:44.370
PROFESSOR: China.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.830
Do you know what the personal
savings rate in China is?

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:49.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.570
PROFESSOR: 40%, or 30%.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.410
30%, I think.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:54.790
[? Possibly ?]

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.900
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.820
So you think of all of these
people whose wages are growing

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:08.260
at 10% a year, or 6-7% a year,
are saving 30% of their

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.640
incomes right now.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.040
So it's a very, very odd--

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.760
economists are completely
baffled by why Chinese are

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.110
saving so much.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.200
So that's just to remind you
that this sort of analysis we

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.000
went through actually has a very
clear implication, which

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.300
happens to false, which is the
Chinese should be not saving,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.020
because their wages are
going up very fast.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.830
Our theory clearly said that,
and we don't really know why

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.300
they say so.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.630
Well, we have some theories.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.250
I might come back to
that next time.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.060
But I want to just keep this
general principle in mind,

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.110
which is that the one solid
reason not to save is you

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.835
expect your income
to grow a lot.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.800
Whether that works
or not isn't--

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.658
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] essay,
they can write about

00:09:55.658 --> 00:09:56.630
that if they want.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.630
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.105
AUDIENCE: Meaning an essay with
an accompanying reading

00:10:00.105 --> 00:10:01.095
about China's and savings.

00:10:01.095 --> 00:10:04.790
So if anybody's interested.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that's
a good topic to write.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:12.020
Chinese savings is a great topic
to write an essay about.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:18.050
OK, another reason people often
cite for why people

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.950
don't save is they don't
have any money.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.600
How could they save?

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.070
Does that argument make sense?

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.320
When does it make sense?

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.390
So it's a very common
argument.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.460
How could the poor save?

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.710
They don't have any money.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.670
Is savings primarily
about having money?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.860
So let me put it differently.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:03.820
To a first approximation,
savings is about making sure

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.800
that there isn't a future where
I've eaten everything

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.600
that I have.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.270
So if I have money today, unless
I expect to get richer

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:20.170
tomorrow, then even if I'm poor,
I should save, because

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.680
it's not about whether
I have money or not.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.340
If I'm poor today, then I'm
going to be poor tomorrow.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.430
Then it's no different
from I'm rich

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.660
today, I'm rich tomorrow.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.260
We have the same incentives to
save, because what you're

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.500
trying to achieve is efficient
division of consumption

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.160
between today and tomorrow.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:47.160
So the fact that I'm poor
should not, per se, say

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.060
anything about whether I should
save or not, because

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.770
savings is about trading off
consumption today with

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.110
consumption tomorrow.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.890
And that same trade-off
exists, whether

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.200
you're poor or rich.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.190
If I'm poor, I still
have it tomorrow.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.620
And if I have it tomorrow,
then I should still save.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.340
Because if I'm worried that
tomorrow I'm not going to have

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.700
any money, that's true
for somebody poor

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.130
and somebody rich.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.930
So the fact that I have
little money today--

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:20.300
if I'm going to have even less
money tomorrow, I should save.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.470
So it's not about how much money
you have, but how much

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.330
money you expect to have
in the future.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.230
That's the same general
principle that we

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.480
went through a minute.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.520
Having said that, is there a
case where being poor might

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.920
make you not save?

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.150
What's a case where this
argument kind of fails?

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.765
AUDIENCE: Well, if your income
is so small that you have to

00:12:49.765 --> 00:12:51.490
consume all of it today just
to make it tomorrow.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.740
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.100
Excellent example.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.870
So one reason even the poor
may not want to save if

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.370
they're really so poor that
tomorrow will not show up if

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.180
they don't eat today.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:12.730
In that case, there's no
argument for saving, because

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.760
then you would, in any
case, not get there.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.660
So you're desperately poor and
you're starving, you probably

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.700
shouldn't save.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.280
But if you're not that poor,
then the fact that you don't

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.256
have income should not
matter that much.

00:13:27.256 --> 00:13:29.966
Or even a lot of income should
not matter that much.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:39.120
So another example how many of
you already suggested, another

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.930
argument for why people don't
save is that people just don't

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.610
have opportunities to save.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.530
Like many of you suggested,
inflation.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.240
So imagine that the only
way I can save is by

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.350
keeping cash at home.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:14:00.020
And prices go up, so cash
becomes less valuable.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.640
In other words, there's just no
point in trying to save in

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:08.670
that world, because you're in a
hyperinflation or something,

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:12.600
and any money you put away
is going to be valueless

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.600
tomorrow, why bother saving?

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.620
So one answer to that is that,
well, why not put it into a

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.020
bank account, or into an
investment account?

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:29.200
So you buy something that
that's inflation-proof.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.790
Why don't you buy an
inflation-proof government

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.390
bond or something?

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.250
So there are assets.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.500
You could buy gold.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.100
So if you still make the
argument that the poor are

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:55.760
particularly handicapped,
because they don't have a

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.110
place to save, you have to make
the argument that they

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.670
have less access to
bank accounts.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.700
And that's true.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.850
In the world, it's true.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:08.020
It's completely true that the
poor have very limited access

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.190
to bank accounts.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.720
Most countries--

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.110
like below 20% of the poor- have
access to bank accounts.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.510
So that's very true.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.590
And if you take investment
accounts or other money market

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.520
accounts, or other accounts
which are protected against

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.080
inflation, that's
even more true.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.740
Very few people have
access to them.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.840
But why is that?

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.710
Why don't the poor have access
to bank accounts?

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.730
Why should it be that
they have not

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.650
access to bank accounts?

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.154
What are arguments?

00:15:39.154 --> 00:15:40.618
Yeah?

00:15:40.618 --> 00:15:43.302
AUDIENCE: They might live in a
region where it doesn't make

00:15:43.302 --> 00:15:44.522
sense to have a bank.

00:15:44.522 --> 00:15:46.474
Like, if you're in a small-world
village, there's

00:15:46.474 --> 00:15:50.870
really not the infrastructure
or the skill for the bank to

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.360
be sustainable there.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.180
Likewise, the size of their
deposits might make it where

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.790
even if they are in, say, urban
slum, where there might

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.405
be banks generally around them,
banks aren't interested

00:16:01.405 --> 00:16:03.830
in catering to them because
there are certain fixed costs,

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.600
like we've seen in certain money
lending, that the size

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.398
of their deposit wouldn't be
worthwhile for the hassle that

00:16:09.398 --> 00:16:10.577
it would involve.

00:16:10.577 --> 00:16:11.050
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.960
So that's exactly right.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:21.600
So basic argument is that
whenever I want to have a

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.890
deposit-taking institution--

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.740
any institution that
takes your money--

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.280
once I take your money, there
is a cost of that, which is

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.880
kind of fixed, and doesn't
entirely scale with

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.740
the amount of money.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:42.110
So if I'm putting in $5, and the
cost is $5 to take care of

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.550
your money, nobody's going
to be willing to do it.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.247
So you need enough deposits
to make a bank work.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.770
What will be reasons why there's
a fixed cost, the

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.960
fixed cost of banking?

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.080
Why does banking have
a fixed cost?

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.808
Why should it have
a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:08.784 --> 00:17:10.776
AUDIENCE: Well you need to at
least hire some number of

00:17:10.776 --> 00:17:12.768
people to set up the system.

00:17:12.768 --> 00:17:14.262
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:14.262 --> 00:17:17.872
someone working at the bank,
someone who will keep track of

00:17:17.872 --> 00:17:20.736
all the records. things
like that.

00:17:20.736 --> 00:17:21.240
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:27.970
So I think one version of that
is that banks are required by

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:32.670
law to keep good records of
any deposits they take.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.670
And so even if the deposit is
$5, they can't just say, well,

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.470
we're going to just scribble it
down on a piece of paper.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.210
So basically, every deposit that
comes to a bank has to be

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.740
recorded in a proper way.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:55.230
Given that, even if it's $5,
somebody has to have a

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.400
computer there, open a computer,
enter the amount

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.440
into the computer, send
it to some place.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.280
So there's a lot of reasons
why they're

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.370
fixed costs of banking.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:09.820
And I think that's the single
biggest reason why most poor

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.720
people don't have access
to bank accounts.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:20.220
Now the alternative is
to save at home.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.920
And there are many reasons why
it's difficult to ave at home.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.100
One has something to
do with inflation.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.660
If you keep money and
the prices go up.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.090
Another problem is crime.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.660
You keep money at home,
somebody comes and

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.520
takes it, it's gone.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.960
You kept it a bank, it's a
bank's duty to keep it safe.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.190
So that's another reason
why you can do it.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.160
And then there are what I'm
calling the self-controlled

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.210
and spouse-controlled reasons.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:02.970
So self-control is, if I
have money, I spend it.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.020
If I don't have it, maybe

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:05.825
I don't spend It.

00:19:05.825 --> 00:19:07.480
So it's in the bank.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.590
It's not in my hand.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.030
I'm not going to be
able to spend it.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.950
If it's really in my pocket,
I'll just spend it.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.070
I see something I
want, I buy it.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.320
What's spouse control?

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:23.760
What do you think it is?

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.010
What's your guess?

00:19:28.982 --> 00:19:31.916
AUDIENCE: Your spouse might ask
you for money [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:31.916 --> 00:19:33.872
because they want it for
something [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:36.806 --> 00:19:39.760
based on [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.170
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:46.570
So it may well be that some
people in the family might--

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.010
this is more general
than that.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.290
So some people in the family
who have money might be

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.310
worried that other people in the
family who don't will come

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.370
and lay claims on it.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.120
So if you have nothing, you
can say you have nothing.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.380
But if not, your husband or your
cousin shows up and says,

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.270
well, you know, I really
need some money.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:17.030
I feel like I drink, or I
want to buy something.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.570
How do you say no to people?

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.810
So one other issue that
arises is that--

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.760
at least, you hear a lot of
reports of-- is people saying

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.240
that, look, I don't keep money
at home, because if it does,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.340
then somebody always shows
up and asks for it.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.840
And it could be a spouse, could
be your brother, could

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.560
be some friend.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.580
But if there's a lot of people
who come and ask money from

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.380
you, then you may actually not
want to keep money at home.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.950
Now the poor have evolved a lot
of different ways to save.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.250
One of them is called a ROSCA.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.310
Do you know what a ROSCA is?

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.820
Who knows what a ROSCA is?

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.760
AUDIENCE: It's like a type of
merry-go-round [? layover ?]

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.875
attributes a set amount And then
a particular day, you get

00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:25.286
all the money from the ROSCA.

00:21:25.286 --> 00:21:27.376
PROFESSOR: And then what
happens after that?

00:21:27.376 --> 00:21:30.352
AUDIENCE: I mean, it continues
usually until a set point

00:21:30.352 --> 00:21:31.602
where it stops.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.726
PROFESSOR: But like, let's
say five or four

00:21:37.726 --> 00:21:39.390
of us are in a ROSCA.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.890
So we all put in $10.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.200
What happens?

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.772
AUDIENCE: So you all put in $10,
and each individual in

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:49.970
the ROSCA gets that lump sum
on alternating days.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:57.420
So each individual will get
the lump sum at some point

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.150
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:03.250
So one form of ROSCA is one
where there's a fixed order.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.650
We all join the ROSCA.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:06.760
We have a lottery.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.125
And then the lottery decides
the order of people.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.150
Somebody goes first, somebody
goes second, somebody goes

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.630
third, somebody goes
four, somebody goes

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.780
fifth, let's say.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.680
They're five people
in the ROSCA.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:25.620
Now once that's set, then what
happens is that first day,

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.180
everybody puts in,
let's say, $10.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.870
And Mr. One gets all of it.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:36.910
Next week, everybody puts $10,
and Mr. Two gets all of it.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:43.650
And so, in the end, everybody
gets all $50.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:55.870
But a lottery determines
who gets it first.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:02.730
So if you think of a ROSCA,
what's the advantage of a

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:07.030
ROSCA over just saving
at home?

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.280
Is there an advantage?

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.540
What are the advantages?

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.310
Yeah?

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.656
AUDIENCE: You don't need the
discipline to make sure that

00:23:20.656 --> 00:23:23.524
you're saving money, because
if you have money at home,

00:23:23.524 --> 00:23:26.392
people tend feel tempted
to ask [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:26.392 --> 00:23:27.840
use it.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.590
PROFESSOR: So you get
your $50, and then

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.522
isn't that a problem?

00:23:32.522 --> 00:23:35.228
AUDIENCE: But you have a larger
amount of money that

00:23:35.228 --> 00:23:38.426
you can use for a larger
investment, versus like the

00:23:38.426 --> 00:23:41.230
$10 you might use that on a
short amount [? of time ?].

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:46.240
PROFESSOR: So you're saying,
if i have a goal associated

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.210
with the money, then I'm going
to join a ROSCA where-- let's

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.000
say I need $50 one
of these days.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.430
Then I'm going to join
a ROSCA, which has

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.390
the price of $50.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:03.350
That way, when I get it, I buy
it, rather than if I have to

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.120
save up to $50, then I'll
have $5 someday.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.590
I'll have $42, but not $50.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.140
And therefore, I still can't buy
the thing I want to buy,

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.600
but I now have $42.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.740
Maybe I feel like maybe I could
spend $2 out of that on

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:21.240
some pack off cigarettes
or something, and so.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.900
And you never reach $50.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.410
So the fact that there's a
matching between the amount of

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:29.270
the ROSCA and the
amount to what I

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.750
want to buy is important.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.430
That's part of the reason to
solve the self-control problem

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.050
is because of this matching.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:41.130
Because once I have the money,
I can just spend it.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:45.020
If I need $50, if I have to save
up to it, then there'll

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.330
be a lot of times when
I have less than $50.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.280
And I could say, well, maybe
I'll just spend $2 out of it,

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.180
and wait another day,
and put in $2 back,

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.480
you never get there.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.740
Whereas this gives you $50
all at once, and you

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.935
immediately spend it.

00:25:00.935 --> 00:25:04.960
So one advantage of it is
delivers the amount you want.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.210
What's another advantage?

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.630
Think of the group of us.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.130
Let's say we each need $50.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:21.780
How long on average would it
take us to get to $50 if we

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.785
saved by ourselves, and we
saved, let's say, $10 a week?

00:25:29.916 --> 00:25:33.050
AUDIENCE: The advantage of a
ROSCA would be potential for a

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.980
immediacy, access to the
large sums of funds.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.725
And even if you're the last
person in the ROSCA, that

00:25:40.725 --> 00:25:44.120
amount of time it takes you to
deal with that amount of money

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.545
would be the same as if you were
saving it by yourself,

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:49.455
whereas the guy who's first gets
it immediately, and then

00:25:49.455 --> 00:25:52.370
it averages out to half the
amount of time [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.450
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:58.110
So if you save $50, it would
take five weeks for each of

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:03.480
you, whereas the expected delay
for somebody in a ROSCA

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.440
is two and a half weeks,
because the

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.510
Mr. One gets it today.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.630
Mr. Two gets it in a week.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.530
Mr. Five gets it in five weeks,
but he's the last.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.400
So you bring it forward by
two and a half weeks.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.170
So it's a large gain.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.530
You immediately get a
large gain from it.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.230
So that's another
big advantage.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.800
So one is that it solves the
self-control problem.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.050
Another is it just brings it
forward to where you want.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:39.570
Now you know what a
bidding ROSCA is?

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.150
Yeah?

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.025
AUDIENCE: It's when people bid
for the right to get the money

00:26:47.025 --> 00:26:48.011
this time around.

00:26:48.011 --> 00:26:53.598
So if you get, say, an amount of
$50, you might bid up to, I

00:26:53.598 --> 00:26:58.364
don't know, [INAUDIBLE], but
realistically up to maybe $25

00:26:58.364 --> 00:27:01.322
or so just for the right
to get the money today.

00:27:01.322 --> 00:27:01.830
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:08.430
A bidding ROSCA is instead of
having a fixed order, we bid

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:12.320
on who's going to
get it today.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.060
So after we each put in $10
dollars, then the bidding

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.060
opens, and whoever wins.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:24.955
So we basically say that,
look, I paid my $10.

00:27:24.955 --> 00:27:29.970
I'll pay $10 extra
to get the $50.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.320
And then next week, somebody
else would do the--

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:38.900
maybe he'll say, I'll pay $4
dollars extra to get the $50.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.750
And then the guy who gets it
last, obviously, is going to.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.830
And what's happening, notice,
is that the pot

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.050
is now going up.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:54.450
So I pay $10 into the pot
to get the extra $10.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.730
That can be distributed
among everybody else.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:02.380
And so, everybody else is
paying less to get $50.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.480
And if the person who gets
it today is paying

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.200
more to get the $50.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.540
So instead of everybody paying
$50 to get $50, some people

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.170
are paying $60 and some
people are paying $40.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.550
Now why would that make sense?

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.170
What's the advantage of that/
why would we want to have a

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.271
bidding ROSCA, rather than
a fixed order ROSCA?

00:28:27.157 --> 00:28:30.524
AUDIENCE: Because that means
that it rises for a year,

00:28:30.524 --> 00:28:31.486
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:31.486 --> 00:28:34.612
rises earlier than you were
scheduled, so you want to make

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:35.815
the argument earlier.

00:28:35.815 --> 00:28:36.320
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.160
So you may want to be able to
express your preferences.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.010
You might be able to say, look,
I just discovered I have

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:48.070
this opportunity if I buy this
bale of cotton, I can produce

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:51.170
these shirts, and sell them
for a lot of money.

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:56.110
I need the money now, so
I'm going to step in.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:01.950
I'm going to put in the money
now quickly, and it's worth it

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.150
for me to pay some extra.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.170
What's the advantage
of the other?

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:13.590
So basically, what's the
advantage of that too is

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:18.650
others, it's effectively like I
am paying interest to other

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:19.620
people, right?

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.460
What it works out to be is if I
am bidding to get it early,

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.030
I am paying more.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.580
That's like saying other people
are getting interests

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.340
on their savings.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.980
So they they're paying
$10, but I'm actually

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.190
giving them $10 back.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:39.290
So they're getting some interest
on their savings.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.170
This turns it into much
more like a bank.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:44.260
A bidding ROSCA is much more
like a bank, because it's a

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.170
way for us to decide, I want the
money now, I pay the extra

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:49.330
to others to get it.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:54.290
So it turns it into much
more like a bank.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:30:00.080
Now, we talked about the
advantage of ROSCAs.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.250
What are the disadvantages?

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.220
What is a ROSCA not good for?

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.680
Yeah?

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.125
AUDIENCE: ROSCAs can be very
short-lived because the cycle

00:30:17.125 --> 00:30:19.570
only goes on for as long
as you have members.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.015
So if you're looking to save
over a long period of time,

00:30:22.015 --> 00:30:24.460
the ROSCA probably doesn't
meet your need.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.720
And it's also inflexible that
every member has to save the

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.861
same amount at the same time.

00:30:28.861 --> 00:30:32.284
And so, if you have a variable
income, then it might not be

00:30:32.284 --> 00:30:34.729
suitable for you to try to
save that same amount

00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:37.210
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:37.740
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.960
So two disadvantages.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.680
One is it's inflexible.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.820
You are to put in $10 every
time, and if your income is

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.470
variable, you may not want
to save $10 every time.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:55.010
And the other is that it's
typically short-term.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:58.160
So if you want to save for
retirement, it's not a very

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:06.250
good way to get there, because
it's something that takes--

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.510
it's going to end fairly so.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:17.330
And therefore, you're not going
to be able to save for

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.150
retirement using it.

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:27.100
Any other disadvantages or
limitations, let's say?

00:31:31.573 --> 00:31:32.567
Yeah?

00:31:32.567 --> 00:31:33.817
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:38.460
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:44.810
So the amount in ROSCAs tend
to be quite limited, and

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:49.290
they're limited precisely by
the fact that it creates an

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.510
incentive problem.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.730
Once I've got the money,
I got my $50.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:54.855
At that point, I have
no incentive

00:31:54.855 --> 00:31:56.550
to stay in the ROSCA.

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:58.700
So you need leverage over me.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.890
And if that was $10,000, you
may not have that much

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:02.540
leverage over me.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:07.340
So $50, the ROSCA will be small,
that I can save small

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.750
amounts with ROSCA.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.810
It's going to be hard to save
a large amount, because

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.160
somebody's going to be
very tempted by it.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.970
So one other way people save--

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:35.150
I remember, the house I grew
up in India was built--

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:45.140
my grandfather used to write
textbooks for high school.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.440
And whenever he got a contract,
he would build

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.980
another room in the house.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.700
So the house was like--

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.190
the first rooms were
built in 1939.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.390
The last room was
built in 1959.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.890
20 years, he kept
adding rooms.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.360
And that was because there
were not very many good

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.160
savings products available.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.350
And well, for him, it was
something that was going to

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.600
always have value.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.680
And so, for him, it was a very
logical way whenever he got

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.670
some money, he would
park it into

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.490
another room in the house.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:26.500
So if you look, every
room in the house

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.710
has a different floor.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:32.310
And you can tell that the tiles
that were used to buy

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.870
for room one had run out by the
time you got to room two,

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:39.180
because that was five
years later.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.170
So there was a different
set of tiles,

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.640
or different flooring.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.850
So every room had a different
floor, different color,

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.520
different tile, something.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:56.670
And that was very normal in
houses constructed in a

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.590
particular period, where
especially access to financial

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:00.890
assets was very limited.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:02.790
So people didn't have much
financial assets.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.400
They usually save in this way.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.920
Now if you go to developing
countries, one thing you

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:12.170
notice is this tons and tons
of unfinished houses.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:17.330
Like just in the outskirts of
any big city, you see all

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.020
these houses which are
half-finished.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:26.219
Like there's a couple of walls,
or a wall and a roof,

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:32.210
but then on the roof there are
still these pillars sticking

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.620
up from the roof, and the
house is not painted.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.330
It doesn't have any doors.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:40.330
That's a reflection of exactly
the same fact-- people are

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:45.710
actually building these houses
over time, partly because they

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:48.230
don't have good credit markets,
so they can't borrow

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.250
to build the house, partly
because they don't have good

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.690
savings opportunities.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.110
This a perfect way to solve
their savings problem.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.560
They're getting an asset
in the long run.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:07.350
And so when my mother had
somebody who used to drive her

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:11.390
car for her, and he would, like,
once in three months,

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:14.500
take leave and go build
a wall in his house.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.080
And he didn't even build
a whole wall.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.220
He would just have
enough money.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.890
He would save up enough money
to build half a wall, and he

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.270
would go build half a wall.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:27.510
And then he's show up two days
later looking all grimy,

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.700
because he'd been building
for two days.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.210
Then again, three months
later, he'd

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.850
build the next wall.

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:35.350
And now he has a house.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.340
He built his whole house.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:40.585
He his goal in life was he will
not get married until he

00:35:40.585 --> 00:35:41.420
had a house.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:46.320
So he's now gotten married,
because he had postponed his

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.670
whole marriage till he could
build his own house.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:53.550
So his whole strategy was
he would buy a door--

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.520
this was all an investment
towards his marriage.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.020
So once he got all of
that fixed, he went

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.170
ahead and got married.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.690
So that's a classic example,
but you see it everywhere.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:08.190
And it's quite a nice
way to say.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.620
What's a disadvantage?

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.095
What's a disadvantage of
saving brick by brick?

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:18.188
What's the obviously
disadvantage?

00:36:18.188 --> 00:36:18.652
Yeah?

00:36:18.652 --> 00:36:19.888
AUDIENCE: Stuff can
happen to the

00:36:19.888 --> 00:36:21.440
house before it's finished.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:21.945
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:36:21.945 --> 00:36:23.320
AUDIENCE: Things can
happen to the

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.630
house before it's finished.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.710
PROFESSOR: Things could
happen to the

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.290
house before it's finished.

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:28.331
That's true.

00:36:28.331 --> 00:36:31.157
AUDIENCE: If real value
occurs, then it could

00:36:31.157 --> 00:36:32.570
[INAUDIBLE] all of
the investment.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.930
So if you just have
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:36.140
PROFESSOR: It's not liquid.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.220
It's very illiquid
form of savings.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:45.350
You can't sell usually
two walls and a door.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:50.560
So therefore, if you need money
suddenly, it's a very

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.840
bad asset to have.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.330
If you knew that there was
a future which was very

00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:00.280
predictable, like this guy who
wanted to get married, and he

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.090
knew that one day he will
need this, so it's very

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:03.840
predictable--

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.400
that's an excellent asset.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.610
But if something which is
unpredictable, then it's a

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.080
very bad asset, because
it's very illiquid.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.240
It's like any other
illiquid asset.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:20.220
Now another similar asset,
which you see a lot in

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:24.710
developing countries,
is jewelry.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:30.860
You see very poor people wearing
gold jewelry all over

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.270
both India and China.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:37.090
You look at poor people, even
very poor people are wearing

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:41.690
gold, having a small piece
of jade or something.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.010
These things are expensive.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.040
But again, part of the reason
is that they are very good

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.220
real assets.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.760
They are inflation-proof.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.570
Gold goes up.

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:54.890
Actually, right now, gold
is at $1,500, which

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:55.905
is impressive actually.

00:37:55.905 --> 00:37:59.420
I wish I bought some
gold last year.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.600
But it's inflation-proof.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.350
It's very divisible.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.490
You can buy very, very
small amounts of it.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.290
You just buy a pair
of earrings.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.540
That's not a lot of money.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.030
And it's sort of nice
while you have it.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.680
You get some use value
out of it.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.460
And partly, gold is very
favored, because the quality

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.960
of gold is cheap to verify.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.630
This is why gold was always
made into currency.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:37.660
And as a result, it's
very liquid.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.860
So if you have a gold jewelry,
you can go to the local

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.250
jeweler, and he'll give
you a loan in two

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:44.470
minutes against it.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:49.820
It's very easy to mortgage
basically, because its quality

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.960
is very well known.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.190
If you try to mortgage your
house, people have to come and

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.730
do an inspection, figure out
if your house is actually

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.420
worth anything or not.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.640
Gold is gold.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.290
And so, you'll find in very poor
neighborhoods, in poor

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:07.900
countries, a jeweler, and the
jeweler's actually somebody

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.400
who's constantly giving
and taking money.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.190
It's very much a two-way
business.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:18.910
He's taking gold and giving
money, and giving gold and

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:19.780
taking money.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.000
And it goes in both directions
all the time.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.260
And the reason why gold is
essentially a more attractive

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.270
asset-- it has less use
value than a house.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:32.310
Obviously, a house--

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.800
maybe not.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.910
I don't wear a lot
of gold, so.

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:37.130
But

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.160
I suspect it has less use value
than a house, but it has

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.140
a lot more liquidity.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.680
It's extremely liquid.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.435
You can just take it to
the local jewelry,

00:39:45.435 --> 00:39:46.420
you get money back.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.480
So liquidity is extremely
important for the poor,

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.680
because there are often
problems, and if somebody gets

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.710
sick, you need money.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.320
The alternative to all of this
is financial savings of one

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.560
form or another.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.550
Some form of financial
savings.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:11.860
Financial savings are
like assets in

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.810
banks, or paper assets.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.950
Now these are different ways
to access paper assets.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.660
Even if you don't have a bank
account, these are ways to

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.990
access paper assets.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:25.840
Does anybody know what
a money guard is?

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.320
Maybe you're going to do your
readings a bit more carefully

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.194
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:41.194 --> 00:40:43.110
Yeah?

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.510
AUDIENCE: If someone
else [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.670
A money guard is somebody in
your neighborhood who just

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.622
accesses a bag.

00:40:52.622 --> 00:40:54.546
AUDIENCE: How does that differ
from a savings collector?

00:40:54.546 --> 00:40:56.810
Isn't that basically what
a savings collector--

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:59.100
PROFESSOR: No, a savings
collector--

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.230
how does it differ from?

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.660
Anybody want to try
to answer that?

00:41:08.082 --> 00:41:10.480
AUDIENCE: Is that where they
actually visit your house on a

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.610
regular basis, collect
small amounts?

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.090
PROFESSOR: Savings collectors
typically

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:16.770
take you to the bank.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.620
So the difference is a savings
guard is someone

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.940
who keeps it herself.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:26.640
AUDIENCE: But I thought in the
reading the woman in the

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.895
village, I didn't think she
was taken to the bank.

00:41:28.895 --> 00:41:29.960
They said--

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.046
PROFESSOR: She was depositing
it somewhere else.

00:41:32.046 --> 00:41:33.504
AUDIENCE: And not
at her house?

00:41:33.504 --> 00:41:34.719
So really, the only
distinction is

00:41:34.719 --> 00:41:36.420
where they keep the--

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:41.760
PROFESSOR: Yes, but I think
it's very different.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.210
The incentives are
very different.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:48.690
So imagine that you deposit all
your savings with me, and

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:52.030
you have no documentary proof.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:56.780
I say, well, tough, I have
no idea where it went.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.150
What do you do?

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:02.420
If somebody is putting it in
the bank, then the maximum

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.710
they can steal from you
is that today's flow.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:10.540
So if you put it in the bank,
then I give it to them.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:14.360
They put it in the bank, they
get this stamp in a book that

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.740
says that they put
it in a bank.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:21.640
I know that essentially all they
can steal is the amount

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.750
they collected today, not be the
entire stock up to today.

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.492
AUDIENCE: So when they put it
in the bank, aren't they

00:42:28.492 --> 00:42:31.490
[INAUDIBLE] in your
bank [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.660
PROFESSOR: The could either
put it in your name, or

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.630
sometimes what people do is
they have to put in--

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:40.760
let's say 10 of us have to each
give you $1, and you have

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.490
to put in $10 into the bank.

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:44.830
So it's an easy check.

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:48.155
AUDIENCE: But I mean, assuming
that, couldn't the savings

00:42:48.155 --> 00:42:48.630
collector--

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.893
I mean, if the bank [INAUDIBLE]
their bank, can

00:42:50.893 --> 00:42:53.350
they still steal everything
that they [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:54.700
PROFESSOR: It's not
in their name.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.490
Typically, they can't
take it out.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.400
The accounts are such that
it's deposited into an

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.870
account, and to take it
out, somebody else has

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:05.000
to authorize it.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.980
So these are different designs,
because in some

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.270
sense, if there's somebody in
your neighborhood who is very

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:14.910
reliable, you can just
give them the money.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:19.970
Somebody very reliable, they
can save the money for you.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:23.300
But if you don't have somebody
very reliable in your

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.690
neighborhood, then you often
use a savings collector.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.970
Savings collector is basically
someone who doesn't hold on to

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:36.480
the money, and therefore is
much less able to run away

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.730
with the money.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:56.820
What are self-help groups?

00:44:01.024 --> 00:44:02.518
Yeah?

00:44:02.518 --> 00:44:06.004
AUDIENCE: It's where a group
of people basically collect

00:44:06.004 --> 00:44:08.494
and they stay together
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:08.494 --> 00:44:10.486
the process.

00:44:10.486 --> 00:44:12.990
It's [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:13.640
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.670
But a self-help group,
in a sense, is more

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:18.610
flexible in a ROSCA.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:22.530
It basically takes the money.

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:25.200
Whoever gives them money, they
take it, and then they lend it

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.290
to other people within
the group.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.400
Or, sometimes what they
do is they just

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.290
deposit it in a bank.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.460
That sort of turns them into
a savings collector.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.446
So I think the more--

00:44:36.446 --> 00:44:39.720
AUDIENCE: But isn't a ROSCA a
type of a self-help group?

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.060
PROFESSOR: Yes, I guess
you're right.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:41.760
You're right.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.060
ROSCA is a type of self-help
group, but a lot of self-help

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.650
groups are much more flexible
than a ROSCA.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:53.860
They allow you to the option
of putting the money into--

00:44:53.860 --> 00:45:01.320
I put whatever, either $2,
$1, et cetera, into it.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.630
So the trade-off between a ROSCA
and a self-help group is

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:08.520
that as self-help group--
particularly the ones that

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.510
work well--

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:11.580
have to have a good
accountant.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.100
A ROSCA is very simple.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.220
We don't need to have
any accounting.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.440
We know there's $10.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.440
We put it in each.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.480
There's $50.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.070
Somebody gets it.

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.050
Requires zero accounting,
right?

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.550
A ROSCA requires zero
accounting.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:28.910
Self-help group requires some
accounting, and there's some

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:33.420
evidence that when there's no
one that can do accounting,

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.170
they collapse.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.550
Because you basically need to
make sure, I'm making a

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:37.570
flexible deposit.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:44.300
I'm putting $3 today, you put
in $5, and she borrows $7.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.710
So somebody has to keep track
of all those numbers.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:51.710
And that's much harder if you're
not really comfortable

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:52.980
with reading and writing.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:58.580
So in a sense, a ROSCA is a
very specific, very simple

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.410
form of a self-help group, and
it's simplicity is a huge

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:04.570
advantage, because it's
something that

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.420
makes it quite clear.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.260
Nobody needs to know accounting
to run a ROSCA,

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.080
whereas to run a self-help
group, typically you need to

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.360
know some accounting.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:14.650
Yeah?

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:17.112
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:17.112 --> 00:46:19.920
self-help group without
the same [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.330
ASCA [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:21.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.150
An ASCA is a broader category.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:27.760
Yeah.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:33.110
Self-help group is an example of
something where there is--

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.360
so the trade-off between--

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.525
so I already answered
the question.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.250
A savings collector typically
charges money for it.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.700
It's somebody who comes
into your place,

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.850
collects the money.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.380
She keeps accounts for it.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.140
She's a professional.

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.620
She charges money for it.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:47:01.380
People to pay up to 5% per
month, negative interest to

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.160
get these things.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.830
So huge.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:05.370
So you might get might
actually pay

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:07.880
someone quite a lot.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.730
Typically, a self-help group is
one where you don't have to

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.090
pay anybody.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:19.930
It's like a ROSCA, where the
loss is relatively limited.

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:24.150
The constraint is accounting.

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:27.720
So saving collector
is someone who can

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.450
typically keep good accounts.

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:32.290
She, or even a money
guard, is someone

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:33.370
who keeps good accounts.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.800
You go and give her the money,
she can show a book where she

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.330
keeps exact records of
how much you put it.

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:42.080
It's not easy to find someone in
your neighborhood if you're

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.490
poor who has good accounting
skills.

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:50.205
Whereas if you think a ROSCA,
for example, is beautiful in

00:47:50.205 --> 00:47:52.630
that it doesn't require
a lot of accounting.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:59.210
So the trade-off between these
come on how much accounting

00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.920
they require.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.085
So self-help groups are
intensive in accounting.

00:48:02.085 --> 00:48:06.920
They require that somebody keeps
track of who's putting

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.820
in money, who's taking
out money.

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:16.260
So if that's not being done
by a professional, then it

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.550
depends very much on the
quality of the group.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:22.460
If there's no one in the group
that can do the account well,

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.890
the group will collapse.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:27.760
If you compare that with like,
say, a savings collectors--

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.940
saving collectors typically
are someone who is good at

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:33.870
accounting, and therefore can be
relied on to do that job on

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:34.570
their own--

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:35.750
gets paid for it.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.800
So that sort of the trade-off
between these things, is that

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.150
if you have someone around who
is a good accountant who is

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:48.955
part of your group, you can
have a self-help group.

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.200
If you're willing to pay
someone a lot to do the

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.530
accounting for you, you can
have a savings collector.

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:01.580
And if you have neither,
you can have a ROSCA.

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.670
So ROSCA is the simplest
product.

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.140
It's the least flexible
product.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:10.700
But it's the one that doesn't
require any skilled person to

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.010
do the job for you.

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:15.110
So that's the big trade off
between these things is that

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.930
some of them rely on having
skilled people around to do

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.530
the job, other don't.

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:27.160
Microcredit is another possible
savings instrument.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.230
How could that be?

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:30.190
How could microcredit be
a savings instrument?

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:37.690
AUDIENCE: It's like
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:38.940
savings [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.690
your fixed savings
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:47.190
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:50.630
So in a sense, it's a funny
way to save, but a lot of

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:51.860
people to save that way.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.310
So you want a television.

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:56.430
You can either save--
let's say a color

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.160
television costs $200.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.250
You can save $2 a week
for 100 weeks.

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.060
That's very difficult.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:08.050
$2 a week, you forget, you
spend some of the money.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:10.070
You're keeping a lot
of money at home.

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:13.290
The alternative is somebody
gives you $200.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:16.970
You buy the television, and then
you pay them $2 a week,

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:18.500
but then they charge
you some interest.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.155
You pay $2.50 a week.

00:50:21.155 --> 00:50:23.800
But because you're paying $2.50
a week, they're willing

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.280
to give you the money early.

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.630
And then it is their job
to make sure you pay.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.890
They come and pester you
if you don't pay.

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:36.602
So you transfer the burden of
repayment, and in instead you

00:50:36.602 --> 00:50:39.830
having to do the saving,
somebody else forces you to do

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:41.550
the saving.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:43.570
It's expensive.

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:49.550
You're paying 24% a year
to get save, basically.

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:57.630
It's like giving up 24% of your
money, but it has this

00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:02.770
advantage that you don't
have to wait.

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:05.340
OK, so some little math.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:14.965
So all of this we've
been discussing.

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:23.110
We've been sort of going back
and forth, and saying, well,

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:25.960
it's difficult for
the poor to save.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.940
Maybe they don't want to save.

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.560
Maybe there's some good reason
why they don't save.

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.520
So we haven't shown any smoking
gun that there really

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.720
is an efficiency in savings.

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.850
So I wanted to give you an
example of how you would make

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:44.040
the reason that is actually
people actually under-save.

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:47.470
So how would you make the case
that people under-save?

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:51.310
So to me this case, we'll have
to do a little bit of algebra.

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:55.550
So let's think about
it carefully, OK?

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:58.990
The first line in that
slide is what's

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.250
called the Euler equation.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:06.650
The Euler equation is a
condition for savings

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:09.500
optimality over time.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:14.660
What it says is the marginal
utility of consumption today--

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.330
how much consumption is
worth to you today--

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:18.810
should be equal to--

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:25.230
so something times
[? marginal ?]

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:26.730
consumption tomorrow.

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:28.250
What's the question
being asked?

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.972
It's asking the question,
imagine I saved one more

00:52:31.972 --> 00:52:33.222
dollar today.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.470
What would it be
worth tomorrow?

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:40.360
Well, one thing that's going
to work is [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.720
So it's going to be
worth 1 plus r.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.930
If the interest is r, I'm going
to get 1 plus r for it.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.360
Yeah?

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:53.590
But then, utility tomorrow isn't
worth as much as it's

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:54.460
work today.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.270
It's like tomorrow
is in the future.

00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:59.080
I want it now.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.100
So that's delta.

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.170
Delta is a number less than 1.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:05.470
So it says that utility tomorrow
is worth only a

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:08.350
fraction delta of
utility today.

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:10.160
And then the last is
[? marginal ?]

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.550
consumption tomorrow.

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:17.200
So basically, imagine that the
right-hand side of that is

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.480
less than the left-hand
side, OK?

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.820
Then, what should I do?

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:25.330
Well, I should [INAUDIBLE]
says the [? module ?]

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:28.230
utility today is higher
than what it

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:29.480
will be worth tomorrow.

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.690
Or actually, let's do it the
other way If [? module ?]

00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:44.140
utility today is less than delta
times 1 plus r times U

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:49.410
prime [? c ?] plus 1, that means
that $1 today saved will

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:53.700
give me more utility than I
would get it today, right?

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.960
Today I will get $1 will give
me U prime [? c ?].

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.750
If I saved it, I would
get 1 plus r.

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.870
That's going to be worth
delta U prime [? c ?]

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:04.040
times 1 plus r.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:08.080
So basically, I'm getting more
utility by putting money into

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.330
the future.

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.920
So that's the standard condition
for consumption

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.170
optimality.

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:22.560
The next line says, imagine the
utility function that's a

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.460
standard form of the utility
function is that it has that

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.580
form, consumption
to the power of

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.060
something divided by something.

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.805
It's a fairly standard form
of utility function.

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:40.610
Actually, you should notice
that even when sigma is

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:45.180
greater than one, that works.

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:45.450
Why?

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:52.240
Because c to the [? r1 ?] minus
sigma is then decreasing

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.990
in c, but is divided by
a negative number.

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:56.610
So it's again increasing by c.

00:54:56.610 --> 00:55:00.120
So it works even for that.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:03.640
So if I did that, then I
substituted U of c into both

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.610
sides I would get that the
question in the third line.

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:14.620
The third lines comes from the
second line, U of c equals c

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:19.425
to the power 1 minus sigma
divided by 1 minus sigma, U

00:55:19.425 --> 00:55:22.150
prime is then what?

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:23.400
What's U prime?

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.890
Take the derivative.

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:27.820
What do you get?

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:28.595
It's MIT.

00:55:28.595 --> 00:55:31.570
You know the answer.

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:32.820
Come on.

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.220
All too superior to answer?

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.040
You all feel like, how
could you ask me

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.300
such an inane question?

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:42.280
Tell me what it is.

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.280
AUDIENCE: c to the
negative sigma.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah, c to the
negative sigma is U prime.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.080
I put that into the
first equation, I

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.410
get c to the power.

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:57.795
And then you can see that I'm
gonna get the third line out

00:55:57.795 --> 00:56:01.930
of that if I substitute U prime
into that equation.

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:06.280
And then I invert that to
get the fourth line.

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.440
Now reasonable values
of delta, standard

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.440
values are, like, 0.9.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.410
People use that number
0.9, 0.95.

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:18.680
I'm taking a low number.

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:22.140
You'll see that a low number
is going to make it less.

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.810
If I do the higher number,
then my case

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:29.060
will be even stronger.

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.230
Sigma, people think it's a
number like two, three, four.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:35.980
That's the kind of number
of people usually find.

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.290
Sigma is a measure of risk
aversion, and when they

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:40.620
measure that, they find
something like that.

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:42.590
So take those numbers.

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:44.600
Trust me, they are
standard numbers.

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.430
And then the last thing
is, what is r?

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:51.520
And I want to say that we looked
at data last time where

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:58.450
it said that people were
borrowing at 80% a year.

00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:02.760
If you're borrowing at 80%
a year, you're an asset.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:07.400
That's exactly like having an
asset which pays 80% a year.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:15.570
Because if I borrowed $1 less,
I would pay $1.80 less on it.

00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:19.570
So anybody who had an asset
which has an interest rate of

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:22.870
80% is sitting on an
asset with an 80%

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:24.760
interest rate on it.

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.000
It's exactly the same thing.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.830
I just borrow $1 less.

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:34.360
So anybody who has a loan which
is paying 80% is exactly

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.470
like having an asset
which is 80% on it.

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:40.940
So now, I plug that in.

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:44.190
So think of somebody who has a
loan, who is borrowing at 80%.

00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:48.600
67% of the people-- yeah, we saw
that actually last time,

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.700
were borrowing, had loans,
and the average

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:53.710
interest rate was 80%.

00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:55.740
So this is not an unreasonable,
these numbers.

00:57:55.740 --> 00:58:01.750
So let's take those numbers,
plug them in, and you get

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:05.740
consumption growth will
be 17% per year.

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:10.260
That's a huge growth rate.

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:15.250
That I would say poverty would
vanish in five years, because

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:19.490
17% per year is a very,
very fast growth rate.

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:21.110
What's the logic here?

00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:26.080
Say, these guys have an
investment opportunity which

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.850
pays 80% a year.

00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:31.080
They're not using it.

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.460
So there must be, only reason
you don't use an investment

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.890
opportunity that's paying that
much is that you're going to

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:41.570
be much richer in the future,
so you don't want to invest.

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:43.340
Otherwise, you should use
this opportunity.

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:45.750
So people who are forward
looking, and they have an

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:49.030
investment opportunity which
paid them 80% a year, they

00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:53.140
should be pumping all their
money into the future.

00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:56.280
80% a year is a great investment
opportunity.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.980
Only people who will do it are
people who are getting rich

00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:02.610
very fast, because if you're
getting rich very fast, then

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:06.330
you don't want consumption
in the future.

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:16.010
So that says that if we take
assume people are rational,

00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:19.370
then the fact that people are
persistently borrowing-- and

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:22.090
I'll show you this
in a minute.

00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:24.260
I'm not making this
example up.

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.620
So I'll show you the problem
in a minute.

00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:31.450
The fact that people are
persistently borrowing at 80%

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:39.240
a year means that they must
be getting rich very fast.

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:43.470
But in other words, since
they're not getting rich very

00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:46.620
fast, the poor seem
to remain poor.

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:49.210
Something is wrong with this
calculation, so we're going to

00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:51.670
try to figure out what's
wrong with it.

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:55.410
But if I take the model
seriously, and say, this is

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:58.620
how people save, it is clear
that this implication is that

00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.580
the poverty should be the
vanishing phenomenon, because

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:05.310
basically these guys have such
a wonderful investment

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:06.180
opportunity.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:12.050
You an just save at 80% a year
and get a lot richer.

01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:13.350
So that's--

01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:14.237
yeah?

01:00:14.237 --> 01:00:17.870
AUDIENCE: What's the logic to
why sigma is equal to 3?

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.120
PROFESSOR: Sigma
is equal to 3?

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.460
So sigma is the coefficient
of risk aversion.

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:32.550
If you look at the utility
function, and you look at--

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:34.310
given that utility function,
how would

01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:36.660
people react to risk?

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:37.870
That will be measured
by sigma.

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:39.590
So you can actually
look at how people

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:41.500
actually react to risks.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:49.150
I offer you $10 for sure, or
$4 with probability 1/3 and

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:53.610
$15 with probability 2/3, and
I see whether you want then

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:54.550
bet are not.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:57.130
And from that, people back
out of risk aversion.

01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:58.740
And to do that, they get
a number like 3.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:06.580
So this is sort of a hint
at what's going on.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:13.150
And I want to show you kind of
something more worrying.

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:18.860
So here's an experiment which is
kind of a different way of

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.930
getting at the same point.

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:22.860
I showed it to you kind
of theoretically.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.120
Now I want to show it to
you as an experiment.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:25.970
Here's an experiment.

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:28.700
It's an experiment with fruit
vendors and vegetable vendors

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.980
in India and the Philippines.

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:32.780
Two separate experiments
doing identical things.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.920
So fruit vending is a very,
very simple production

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.110
function, OK?

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:47.060
Very, very simple, meaning you
buy fruits in the morning, you

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:53.500
sell all day, you get money in
the evening, you go home.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.710
Next morning, you come back,
and you buy fruit again.

01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:59.050
You sell it.

01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:04.560
It's very predictable, very
continuous, daily production.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.920
Not very high risk, actually.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.250
It's mostly you know what you
can sell, you can see the

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:12.770
price, et cetera.

01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:18.800
So here's a table which kind
of summarizes a bit about

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.930
these people.

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:25.880
So most of these people make one
trip a day to the market.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:29.300
This one's for the Indian
experiment.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:39.850
They buy fruits worth about
1,000 rupees in the morning.

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:42.780
They sell it, and they get
profits of over 100 rupees.

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.600
That's the 10% profits
during the day.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.200
Not bad, actually.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.770
How do they run the business?

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:57.160
70% take a loan every day.

01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:04.310
Every month--

01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:06.860
26 days-- somebody
takes a loan.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:10.530
So this is to buy fruit.

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:16.100
The interest rate on the
loan per day is 5%.

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.850
Basically, the way it works is
you go to the fruit seller,

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:22.470
and he says, you want to
buy cash or credit?

01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:25.350
Cash price is this, credit
price is that.

01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:26.600
Which one's higher?

01:03:29.382 --> 01:03:29.840
AUDIENCE: Credit.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.220
PROFESSOR: Credit price
is higher, right?

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.810
Basically, you get the same
fruit, so you pay more if you

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:38.330
buy it in credit.

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:40.395
But the advantage of credit is
you don't have to pay for it

01:03:40.395 --> 01:03:42.040
in the morning, you paid
it in the night.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.620
You go back in the evening,
and you pay for it.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.870
5% per day.

01:03:57.150 --> 01:04:00.150
So most of these people
have been in--

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:02.770
no, I'm missing one table.

01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:06.260
Most of these people have been
in business for nine years.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.960
They do this day after day.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.260
Nine years they've
been in business.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:17.450
Every day, they borrow at 5%,
meaning that they come in the

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:21.700
morning, they take, let's say,
1,000 rupees worth of fruits,

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:24.650
but they actually get 950 rupees
worth of fruits, and

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:27.590
then they go sell it.

01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:31.650
They say this is 1,000 rupees,
but in fact get 950 rupees at

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:34.070
first first, and then
go sell it.

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:37.760
Remember that daily income
is about 100 rupees.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.410
They pay 50 rupees out
of 1,000 as interest.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:44.900
So if they didn't pay interest,
they're earnings

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.590
every day would be 50% higher.

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:51.570
It would go from 100
to 150, roughly.

01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:53.920
So that's a huge
interest cost.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:59.460
Now here's a way to think about
5% a day, what it means.

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:05.075
Suppose I took the following
strategy.

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:14.090
Drink one less couple
of tea every day.

01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:17.550
A cup of tea costs,
in this same

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:19.310
currency, 2 and 1/2 rupees.

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:24.870
So let me take one less cup
every day, and I reinvest that

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:25.900
in the business.

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:31.740
So what I do is I drink one less
cup of tea, so I borrow.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:35.620
2 and 1/2 rupees less today.

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.240
That means I don't pay interest
on the 2 and 1/2

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.250
rupees, so I get a little
bit extra money.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.520
I reinvest that.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.410
I do that for 30 days.

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:51.425
Every day, I drink one less
cup of tea for 30 days.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.290
At 5% a day--

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:57.070
you should do this
calculation.

01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:58.370
It's stunning.

01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:01.310
Compound interest really
is impressive.

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:09.160
So once you do this for 30 days,
you would have doubled

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.970
your capital.

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:15.530
So these women could double
their capital by simply having

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:21.560
one less cup of tea every
day for 30 days.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.455
They've been in this business
for nine years.

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.850
Their earnings would be 50%
more if they did this.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.470
They could pay down their entire
1,000 rupees debt by

01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:39.120
doing that for 30
days, basically.

01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:51.090
So your 1,000 rupees are
essentially just the price of

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.430
30 days worth of tea.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:04.010
So that's sort of stunning,
if you think about it.

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:07.970
So this goes back to the same
point I was trying to make,

01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:10.160
which is that there's some
reason to get worried that

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.030
these people are somehow--

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.280
they're not managing.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.050
What they're trying to do in
this experiment is they offer

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:19.250
two treatments.

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:24.290
They basically think that two
possible ways in which we

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:29.510
could-- maybe one possibility is
that these people are now--

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:33.900
they need 1,000 rupees to
survive, 100 rupees to eat

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:37.780
every day, so they can't save.

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:41.130
And so they're stuck.

01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:45.410
So it's not clear why
they couldn't have

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:46.665
one cup of tea less.

01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:55.350
So they say, well, maybe if
we just pay their debt.

01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.110
So let's say they owe
1,000 rupees, we'll

01:07:57.110 --> 01:08:02.010
give them 1,000 rupees.

01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:04.410
Imagine that there's some reason
they can't get out it.

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:09.940
Do they stay out of debt if
I pay them 1,000 rupees?

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:14.440
Second possibility is that I
teach them what compound

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.359
interest is.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:22.080
I explain to them that if you
just did this, you could save

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.470
yourself a lot of money.

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:25.790
So there are two treatments.

01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:29.579
They're experimental, so some of
them get one, some of them

01:08:29.579 --> 01:08:33.069
get the other, some
of them get both.

01:08:33.069 --> 01:08:35.029
So do you see what the
experiment is?

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:38.870
I either go to someone and say,
you owe the food seller

01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:40.010
1,000 rupees.

01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:41.930
Here's 1,000 rupees.

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:42.700
You're done.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.609
Now from now on, you
start from scratch.

01:08:45.609 --> 01:08:47.920
Or I go to them, and I
say, come to a class.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.370
I'll explain to you
compound interest.

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:53.044
Or, I offer them both.

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.460
So what happens?

01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:00.029
So that's the question.

01:09:00.029 --> 01:09:05.170
So some of these people, for
some reason, they had

01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:06.180
got into this debt.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.300
Let's say they were liberated
from the debt.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.899
Some people were educated on
the arithmetic component of

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:13.149
compound interest.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:19.180
So training was half a day
training, where they were

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.689
explained how much they spent
on interest, all these

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:24.420
illustrations.

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:28.330
If you save just one cup
of tea a day, it will

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:29.250
be enough, et cetera.

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:30.500
So all of that.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:34.529
Skip.

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.240
So here's the result.

01:09:48.463 --> 01:09:51.140
This one's from the--

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:51.770
[INAUDIBLE]

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.945
let's see which country
this is.

01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:59.650
Philippines.

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:00.900
From the Philippines.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.940
Here's the basic result.

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:12.180
[? Force ?] times payoff
says if you--

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:15.440
ignore everything else
that says, but just

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.730
look at what it says.

01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:19.180
Do you have a debt?

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:22.500
The question is, do you have
a debt from a money

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:26.085
lender after two weeks?

01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:33.800
That number says you are 33%
less and less likely to have a

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.280
debt from a money lender
after two weeks.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:41.640
So two weeks after I pay your
entire 1,000 rupees down,

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:46.980
you're back to having
a loan for 5% a day.

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:55.660
So 33% don't have a loan,
so 67% have a

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.010
loan after two weeks.

01:10:58.010 --> 01:11:01.740
After six weeks, 60%
have a loan.

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.780
After 10 weeks, 80%
have a loan.

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.840
So basically, after 10 weeks,
that 1,000 that they had been

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.190
given just vanishes.

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:16.620
They don't seem to be able
to stay out of debt.

01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:22.110
The same results
are true for--

01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:24.910
this is the India study.

01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:32.035
So debt payoff after--

01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:35.850
first, follow up.

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:50.300
After three months, so this
negative 10% don't have a

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.390
loan, so 90% after three months
have got back a loan.

01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:59.190
So even though these the loan
was paid down, that went away

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:01.515
within three months.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:11.870
And the training, just
2% had nothing.

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:13.450
There was no effect
of training.

01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:17.210
OK, you can see, people
were trained.

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:20.970
If you look at the training
row, that row says nothing

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:22.670
significant in that row.

01:12:22.670 --> 01:12:26.320
That's just saying that
force times training

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.040
is the effect of--

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.550
if you had had a training,
what's the

01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:33.900
probability you have loan?

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.760
It's positive, meaning you're
more likely to have a loan,

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.180
but it's suddenly not
significance.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.803
So it's basically no effect
on whether you

01:12:41.803 --> 01:12:44.560
have a loan or not.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.860
So the fact they would explain
compound interest seems to

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:52.120
have no effect on whether
you get a loan or not.

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.460
It's kind of stunning, actually,
these results.

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:05.360
How are people slipping?

01:13:08.170 --> 01:13:10.160
Why are they getting
back into?

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:17.910
So one thing that you
find is that when

01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:19.160
they get any shocks--

01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:24.750
like somebody gets sick--

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:33.900
if your debt was paid off so
that you were given the money,

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:38.950
you are much more likely to deal
with the shock with your

01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:41.180
own money rather than
by borrowing.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.870
So what these people are doing
is they seem to be using the

01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:46.420
money to deal with shocks.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.730
So basically, there's so much
uncertainty in these people's

01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:54.230
lives that there's always
something that comes up.

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:58.240
And when that comes up,
you use the money to

01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.360
deal with the problem.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.550
And then you're back borrowing,
basically.

01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:14.910
We'll start to think about what
these results mean on

01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:15.810
Tuesday, OK?

01:14:15.810 --> 01:14:19.730
So think about them.

01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:20.770
Do the reading.

01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:22.350
We'll talk more about
it on Tuesday.
