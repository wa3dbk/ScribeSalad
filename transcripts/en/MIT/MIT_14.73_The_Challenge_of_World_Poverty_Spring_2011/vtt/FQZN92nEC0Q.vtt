00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.840
PROFESSOR: So today, we're
going to be talking about

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.470
today and on Thursday, we're
going to be trying to answer

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.720
this question.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.690
We're going to give a slightly
different answer

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.520
today than on Thursday.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.480
Just to give you a road map of
where we are going, today is

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.400
more going to be about the
poverty trap in the sense that

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.680
Pak Solhin described
it to us in--

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.390
I think it was our first
lecture together.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.330
We started from Pak Solhin
description of a poverty trap,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.170
which was really based on the
immediate impact of the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.010
calories on your productivity
that very day.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.590
And then that's what we're going
to look at today, which

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.740
is try to answer
[? Daiquiri's ?]

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.930
question which I've been putting
off until now, which

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.340
is to say well, can we really
believe his story?

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.460
And then on Thursday, we are
going to further our inquiry

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.010
into nutrition based poverty
trap by looking at things a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.130
little bit more subtle than the
impact of calories on your

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.320
productivity the very next day
by looking at things like

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.720
micro nutrients and by looking
at things like feeding your

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.520
children or feeding pregnant
mother so that the kids that

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.220
they bear grow up as different
people, et cetera.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.040
So that's kind of the road
map for our work

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.960
today and on Thursday.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.680
At the end of last lecture,
we discussed the important

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.385
observation by Amartya Sen
that maybe there are no

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:17.500
famines in today's democracies,
that the large

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.960
big famines are gone or at least
that when we observe

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.330
them, they are due to some
really extraordinary

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.580
circumstances like a
war or a civil war.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.370
So there is a paper that I
didn't ask you to read because

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.860
it's a little long.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.880
But the title is Is
Famine History?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.720
And it sort of concludes that
it might be outside of

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.170
specific circumstances.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.240
I should say that it's history
that might come back because

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.580
we have no idea what global
warming is going to do to the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.620
productivity of agriculture,
and it may or may not be

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.470
sufficiently bad that
it might come back.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.240
But in the short term, we may be
in a situation where people

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.940
are not starving to death in
very large number like they

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.640
did in West Mongol outside
of some big

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.236
serious political crisis.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:21.140
However, malnutrition and
under nutrition is not.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.085
You can see the food and
agriculture organization

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:33.890
that's based in Rome is in
charge of trying to monitor

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:34.790
people's situation.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.540
They try to estimate how many
people are, they call, hungry.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.410
So they give periodically a
number of the number of hungry

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.030
people in the world.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.530
And not long ago, they came
up with one billion.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.810
And that number, if you've seen,
has been all about the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.990
newspaper, one billion hungry
people in the world.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.590
To be completely honest, I am
not fully understood how they

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.805
compute the number of hungry
people in the world, because I

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:08.960
suppose you could ask them.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.150
But I don't think this is
what they are doing.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.190
I think they are trying to
estimate the calorie

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.500
requirement that people
might need to fit.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.070
And the question is do we really
know what's a calorie

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.360
requirement?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.839
And the answer to that is no.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.730
We don't really exactly know
what's a calorie requirement.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.425
So maybe this notion of what's
a hungry person is a little

00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:31.470
bit more hazy than we'd
like it to be.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.980
But there is not really
a lot of people

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.010
who look very skinny.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.400
So do you know what the
bodymass index?

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.710
The bodymass index is your--

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.610
sorry, go ahead.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.023
AUDIENCE: 730 times your
height divided

00:04:46.023 --> 00:04:47.910
by your weight squared.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.210
PROFESSOR: 730?

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.920
I didn't know that that's 730.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.670
I think it's your weight
divided by your

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.460
height squared in meter.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.820
That's maybe the 730
coming from.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.620
It's your weight in kilograms
divided by your height in

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.870
meter squared.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.120
So sometimes I'm trying to think
that this means that

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.855
we're trying to elongate the
person over a square meter and

00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:19.450
see how fat that rectangle
would be.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.070
So that's the BMI.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.914
Do you know what the threshold
for the BMI is.

00:05:25.914 --> 00:05:26.790
AUDIENCE: 18.5.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.390
PROFESSOR: 18.5.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.500
So 18.5 is undernourished.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.960
And there is a large number
of people we know who are

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.390
undernourished by
this standard.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.720
Also there is about 2 billion
people in the

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.630
world who are anemic.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.780
That means they don't
have enough

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.850
hemoglobin in their blood.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.460
Now all of anemia is due to
poor nutrition, but it's

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.960
estimated that maybe half
of this is due to

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.930
iron deficiency anemia.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.660
So it's a deficiency
in one particular

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.010
micronutrient which is iron.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.090
So that's about one billion
people who are anemic due to

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.760
some deficiency in iron
in their diet.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.970
Is there deficiency in
iron or difficulty in

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.350
absorbing the iron?

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.090
A lot of these anemic
people is in India.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.030
And sadly, Indians combine the
fact that many of them are

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:26.760
vegetarian and their diet is
rich in rice which is rich in

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.140
phytates, which is an inhibitant
for the absorption

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.180
of iron, which is one reason
why the rate of anemia is

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.140
particularly high in India, is
that on the one hand, they get

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.460
less iron in their diet than
other people at comparable

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.770
level of calorie intake
just because those

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.500
come less from meat.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.190
Then on the other hand, they
are less good at absorbing

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.440
them due to the rice.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.010
There was a large increase
in food prices in 2006.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.580
And then again, they collapsed
during the crisis.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.960
And they increased again
in 2010 to be

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.900
almost at 2008 level.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.640
And there are two consequences
of an increase in food prices

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.540
on those of the poor who are net
consumer of food, that is

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.670
those who produce less
than they consume.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.590
Those are, for example,
the urban poor.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.400
And those are on the one hand,
a large proportion of the

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.320
budget of the poor.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.730
A larger proportion of the
budget of the poor is spent on

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.980
food, so an increase in the
price of food affect the

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.063
poorest more than
proportionally, compared to

00:07:38.063 --> 00:07:40.350
any other source of inflation.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.900
So if the source of inflation is
sort of a general increase

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.780
in priced or it's driven by
the price of housing, then

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.620
that affects everybody the
same or that might

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.160
affect the rich more.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.670
But if the inflation is as
it is today, driven by an

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.510
increase in the price of food,
then it affects more the

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.550
people who are relying the
most, of course, on food.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.180
And that's the first story.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.490
That's one reason why
organizations like the World

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.060
Bank, the UN, they FAO are
practically worried about an

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.500
increase in food prices,
because that's

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.400
disproportionately affecting
the poor.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.700
And it's also disproportionately
affecting

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.670
the urban poor, which may be one
of the many reasons that

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.557
have led to the unrest that
you observe today in the

00:08:24.557 --> 00:08:25.990
Middle East.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.030
The reason why I'm mentioning
that is that in 2008, at the

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:35.155
height of the previous increase
in food prices, there

00:08:35.155 --> 00:08:40.200
were food riots in Egypt that
never had achieved the kind of

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.320
intensity of what we saw in the
last few weeks, but were

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.520
clearly and very directly
prompted by the price of food.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:54.220
And here, the whole rhetoric
of the revolt was framed

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.910
around political reform, but it
is not impossible that part

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.910
of the reason why so many
people, in particular in urban

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:06.260
centers, were willing to
spending so much time outside

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.380
protesting is because they were
profoundly unhappy with

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.860
the increase in the
price of food.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.130
The second reason why we might
be worried about an increase

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.620
in the price of food is if we
take Pak Solhin's story

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.190
seriously and we are wondering
that this increase in hunger

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.415
is going to lead to some
vicious circle.

00:09:25.415 --> 00:09:28.864
So If you read the World
Bank document about--

00:09:28.864 --> 00:09:33.630
the World Bank's job, in a
sense, is to raise money for

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.010
developing countries.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.220
So part of the World Bank's
communication department job

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.840
is to be slightly alarmist, so
we need to take everything

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.930
they say with a pinch of salt.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.680
But one of the thing that they
would very frequently say is

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.190
the price of food increase--

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.790
that makes the poor poorer.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.480
That makes them more difficult
for them to get enough

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.090
calories, which means they
can't work as hard, which

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.370
means they will be plunged
back into poverty.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:04.810
And so this is the story that
Pak Solhin told us in our

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:05.430
first lecture.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.580
And that's what I want to
investigate with you today,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.620
whether we have reasons to be
worried about this kind of

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.060
immediate vicious circle.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.707
So I want to give us a quick
refresher of what's Pak

00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:23.970
Solhin's story.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.230
So with your daily wage, it's
a short term nutrition, a

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.010
nutrition based poverty trap.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.930
With your wage, you buy food.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.890
That gives you strength, and
allows you to get some more

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.070
wages at the end.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.960
So you buy more food, and
that gives you strength.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.130
And you have more wages,
et cetera.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.790
And that's how you survive
maybe on a daily basis.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.410
So that means that it creates
a relationship between how

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.530
much you start from one fine
evening and what is your

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.610
income tomorrow.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.100
And that also means that it
creates a relationship with

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.930
the wage level and your ability
to do any work at all.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.880
So Pak Solhin's story was that
the wage had dropped because

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.280
of the increase in input prices
and the uncertainty

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.520
that the farmer had about
whether they were going to be

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.590
able to raise their output
prices corresponding.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.280
That had led to a decrease in
the wage at the same time as

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.775
there was an increase in the
food prices, so big decrease

00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:23.340
in the real wage in term of the
food entitlement of a day

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.650
of work as Amartya Sen would
say, which means that if you

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.510
took this food entitlement and
you had nothing else to

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.815
supplement it with, this just
was not enough to give you the

00:11:32.815 --> 00:11:35.710
strength to do the work
to earn that wage.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.580
So that means that someone like
Pak Solhin that had no

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.330
extra resources was not
able to work at all.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.376
So that creates an inequality
among people.

00:11:47.376 --> 00:11:50.840
Take Pak Solhin and imagine
that, in fact, he also had a

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.550
little piece of land.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.240
Then what could he have done
with this little piece of land

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.490
once the wages had gone down?

00:11:59.624 --> 00:12:00.580
Ben?

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.690
AUDIENCE: Sell some of it.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.660
PROFESSOR: So he could have sold
some of it to get money.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.695
Or he could have rented some
of it and get money.

00:12:10.695 --> 00:12:13.470
So suppose he rents some
of it and gets money?

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:18.170
So he starts the morning with
1000 rupee he has from the

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.110
rent of his field.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.980
And that can be complimented
with whatever wage he's earned

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.550
yesterday for his work.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.140
And that might be enough to give
him the strength to do a

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.500
day of work.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.400
So if you compare Pak Solhin to
his brother, for example--

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.010
he has a brother in
the story, right?

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.880
If you compare Pak Solhin with
his brother, who had a piece

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.980
of land, they might be exactly
similar in term of their

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.620
underlying body and their
strength, et cetera.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.460
But the fact that one of them
has a piece of land allow them

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.160
to work, and therefore they
start with a little bit more

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.650
non-labor income, which gives
them much more labor income.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.380
So the existing inequality
in non-labor income is

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.040
strengthened by the inequality
in labor income, which is very

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.900
different from what we would
see in our standard models

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.940
where the richer people would be
less likely to work because

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.490
they already have the non
labor income money.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.540
So the labor market would serve
to make people more

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.590
similar rather than
less similar.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.460
So that's the story
he told us.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.020
And as we saw last time, the
necessary condition for such a

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.050
poverty trap is that the
capacity curve, which relates

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.325
your income to that, your
income tomorrow via the

00:13:34.325 --> 00:13:37.780
biology of the body, has this
S shape curve that we

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.670
discussed that intersects below
the 45 degree line, then

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.180
at some point crosses it
and then comes back.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.520
So we are not going to go back
to that, because we saw it in

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.770
detail last time.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.175
That was supposed to
be the shape again.

00:13:52.175 --> 00:13:54.210
It doesn't want to come back.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.760
So the S shape is made
of two relations.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.650
The S shape is the relationship
between income

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.930
today and income tomorrow,
midrow since I can't have it

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.180
on the slide.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:25.535
So this is income today
and income tomorrow.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.370
And so the S shape is actually
not one function, it's the

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.510
product of two functions.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:41.140
One is given how much income you
have, how much calories do

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.080
you decide to eat?

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.400
And then the calorie
that you eat--

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.960
how much productive
do that make you?

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.590
So if we write it in math, it's
like there is income,

00:14:54.590 --> 00:15:01.290
nutrition is equal to g,
function g of income today.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.600
Because you get your wages and
then you eat some good meal.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:16.440
And then income tomorrow is
a function f of nutrition.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.010
That means that income
tomorrow is f

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.970
of g of income today.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.770
So this is what makes
this S shape.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.150
So what we can do today is to
look separately at these two

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.990
relationships.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.980
What's the strength of the
relationship between income

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.140
tomorrow and nutrition today?

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.290
And what's the relationship
between nutrition today and

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.610
income today?

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.940
And here, when I mean today and
tomorrow, I really mean

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.900
today and tomorrow.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.950
This is a short run phenomenon
that we are talking about.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.080
Maybe next week, but
not a matter of

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.340
generations or years.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.180
So suppose that there is indeed
that this particular

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.030
relationship, income tomorrow
and nutrition, is indeed S

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:09.030
shape, and suppose that you were
a very poor person, so

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:14.020
you are in a low part of the S,
and suppose that you happen

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.570
onto a bit of money, what would
you do with this money?

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:26.065
If this relationship between
income and nutrition was S

00:16:26.065 --> 00:16:30.200
shape and you were a very poor
person, but you find a pile of

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.720
money on the ground, what would
you do with the money?

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.791
AUDIENCE: Well, if that
holds true, then you

00:16:38.791 --> 00:16:40.420
would want to eat more.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.396
PROFESSOR: If that holds
true, then I know you

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:42.360
would want to eat more.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.490
So that means that if there is
indeed an S shape between

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.070
income tomorrow and nutrition,
then we should see a very

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.560
strong relationship between
nutrition and income for the

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.940
very poor, because it is like
for an excellent investment.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.370
If you find yourself here, there
is no better investment

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.140
you can do than eating
some more.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.030
So a first thing you can do is
we can see whether poor people

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.530
are really trying to
put all of the

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.752
possible money into food.

00:17:12.752 --> 00:17:15.640
Now the question is the possible
money, so that means

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.089
that we would find the share of
food in the budget should

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:20.640
be very high for the poor.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.530
And the second thing it would
mean is that it would increase

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.410
quite fast with income.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.010
And possibly, it would again
have a form of S shape for the

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.740
following reason.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.560
Suppose that you have some
unavoidable expense to solve.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.070
For example, you need a house
and you need some clothes.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.180
So unless you live in a very
hot country where you don't

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.790
really need much clothes, you
need a house, you need a piece

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.620
of land to put the house on,
and you need some clothes.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.270
So someone who was a budget of
20 rupees will spend, say,

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.470
five rupees on clothing
and house.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.070
They can't do anything
more than that.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.990
And 15 rupees on food.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.620
So that's the poorest person.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.000
And then if there is really this
S shape here, this person

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.595
would be somewhere here.

00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:13.430
So they would remain
quite poor.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:18.170
And now another person,
comparable in other aspect,

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.830
but has a total budget of 30
rupees, let's say because they

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.400
have some non labor income or
because they have a bit more

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:29.290
weight, than they would still
spend unavoidable expenses on

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.270
clothing and houses, but they
would not do any more.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.980
They will still do
just the minimum.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.710
And they would spend all
the rest on food.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.660
That means that by how much did
I increase the income of

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.910
this person?

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.434
Sorry?

00:18:49.434 --> 00:18:50.210
AUDIENCE: By 10.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.565
PROFESSOR: Yeah, 10 out of
20, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:53.850
AUDIENCE: 50%

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:59.900
PROFESSOR: 50%, and this is
how much of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.120
PROFESSOR: It's 25 out of 15.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.595
An increase from 15 to 25.

00:19:07.595 --> 00:19:09.750
It's 10 on the basis of 15.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:11.710
PROFESSOR: I trust you.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.600
You are the MA student.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.840
So whatever it is, that's
going to be on video.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.070
66?

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.590
Let's go with 66.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:25.632
That means that when I increase
your income by 50%,

00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:28.155
your expenditure on food
increases by 66%.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.080
So if I divide by one
of the other, what

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.140
concept is it called?

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.760
An elasticity.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:44.640
So this means the elasticity
of food expenditure with

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.390
respect to overall expenditure
is more than one for the

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.740
extremely poor.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.975
Because you start by
taking care of

00:19:52.975 --> 00:19:54.580
your essentially needs.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.170
And after that you're putting
all of the money into food

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.010
because you think this
is highly valuable.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.610
So this is one thing.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:07.160
And the second thing is now you
go from someone who gets

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.490
30 rupees to someone
who gets 45 rupees.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.450
So I've rigged this so
that it's nicely

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.700
another increase of 50%.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.245
And now this person who
makes 45 rupees--

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.050
they're already kind of over
here somewhere, so the

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.500
marginal value of one
more rupees into

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.950
food is not that high.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:30.050
So they are still going to spend
a bit more on food, but

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.900
only five rupees more.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.120
Going to spend a bit more
to have a nicer

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.920
clothing and some houses.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.590
And now they can bring in
entertainment, because now

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.620
they are basically just
taken care of.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.160
The marginal value of extra
is not that high.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.970
So they can get into
doing other things.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:52.660
So now the elasticity is
going to be 0.25 to 30.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.456
That's out of 25.

00:20:54.456 --> 00:20:55.884
Sorry?

00:20:55.884 --> 00:20:56.840
AUDIENCE: 20%

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.600
PROFESSOR: 20%, is that?

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.230
Yes, 20%.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.480
20% out of an increase in 50%.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.260
Now the elasticity is
much less than 1.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.340
So what we would see is a group
of people, the poorest

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.810
people, where we have very
high elasticity.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.350
And then for anybody who
is somewhat richer, the

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.520
elasticity of food consumption
with overall budget would be

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.185
less than 1, which is what
people refer to as the Engel

00:21:21.185 --> 00:21:26.020
curve, which is the share of
food of the budget increases

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.050
less than proportionately.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:32.750
So the Engel curve refers to
this phenomenon, which is the

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.910
share of food increases less
than proportionately as you

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.452
become richer, but it's worth
pointing out that in an S

00:21:38.452 --> 00:21:42.140
shaped world, we would probably
have and reverse

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.030
Engel curve phenomenon, where
the share of food of the

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.610
budget first increases
and then decreases.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:53.560
So the question is, do we see
this, that the poor spend as

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.920
much money as they
can on food?

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.950
And the second question is, do
we see this, which is do we

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.400
see anybody who's elasticity
of food consumption with

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.760
respect to budget
is more than 1?

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.205
So that's kind of where
I want to go next.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.460
So first, let's look at the
food share in the budget

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.870
around the world.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.950
And this comes from
a data set that--

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.792
the World Bank collect data set
in many countries called

00:22:27.792 --> 00:22:30.480
the Living Standard Measurement
Surveys.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.290
And they very nicely put
them on the website--

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.730
not all of their surveys,
because in some case, they

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.590
have agreement with governments
that doesn't allow

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.250
them to do that.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.270
But a lot of their surveys
are on the web.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.320
You can actually download
them and play with them.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.880
You're welcome to do that.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.310
And we did that.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.860
So we took the overall
expenditure to compute

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:59.520
people's budget transferred
into PPP dollars.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.670
So this is people who live
under a dollar a day, at

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:07.150
pressures in power poverty,
so in US prices.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.350
And look at the share
of their budget.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.000
So this is what we find for a
bunch of people living in the

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.240
rural areas.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.760
And this is food, alcohol,
tobacco, education and health.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:25.040
So what are your remarks when
you see these numbers?

00:23:29.495 --> 00:23:31.475
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the education

00:23:31.475 --> 00:23:33.455
percentages.

00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:35.682
Do those mean that we'd be
paying for tuition or

00:23:35.682 --> 00:23:39.400
educational [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.150
PROFESSOR: So this is only
education expenditure.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.740
So this is tuition if the child
is in a private school

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.900
or if they get extra tuition,
which a lot of people in

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.260
developing countries do.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.820
They get extra help at home.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.850
This could be school uniform,
school books, boarding school

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.220
for kids who are in
boarding school.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.500
Any education related
expenditure would be in there.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.310
Yeah, Ben.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.130
AUDIENCE: I guess a couple
confusions, [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:26.990
PROFESSOR: So in 2.1, Mexico
is spending more on alcohol

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.030
and tobacco than on education.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.350
Spends very, very little
on health.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.200
That doesn't mean people
are totally unhealthy.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.810
But actually, Mexico has an
excellent health care system,

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.940
but basically is free
for most people.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.020
And in all of the countries,
the share on alcohol and

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:47.650
tobacco tends to be at least
comparable to what we see for

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:48.622
education and health.

00:24:48.622 --> 00:24:49.830
Yeah.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.470
AUDIENCE: Why don't the numbers
add up to 100%?

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.590
PROFESSOR: Because there are
other things you do with your

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.682
money other than food, alcohol,
education or health.

00:24:58.984 --> 00:24:59.940
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.890
PROFESSOR: Going to the movies,
putting some cloth on

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.330
your back, that kind of stuff.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:10.130
If it adds up to more than 100,
we're in trouble, which

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.960
is quite possible.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.770
But I hope not, I hope not.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.210
I don't guarantee it, but
I hope that that kind of

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.220
mistakes would not always
send scrutiny.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.505
Any other observation
on this table?

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:41.180
Let me ask one question then.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.510
Do you think the share of the
budget on food is high or low?

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.590
AUDIENCE: High.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.990
PROFESSOR: High, you think the
share of food is high?

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.950
Yes.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:02.534 --> 00:26:03.518
Ben?

00:26:03.518 --> 00:26:07.946
AUDIENCE: I mean, [INAUDIBLE],
I don't think you'd have much

00:26:07.946 --> 00:26:10.898
wiggle room to spend your money
on other [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.802
PROFESSOR: It's about right.

00:26:16.802 --> 00:26:19.850
Yeah, so the question is whether
it's high or low.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.525
So one thing I should say is
that it's kind of viability.

00:26:22.525 --> 00:26:28.290
It goes from pretty low in
India, 56%, to pretty high in

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.230
Timor, 77%.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.170
Remember, this is all people who
are equally poor in term

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.340
of their ability to consume
things, because they're all

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.570
below a dollar a day at PPP.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.650
They make very different
choices.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.370
They are quite viable.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.422
Whether it's high or low,
I think it's in

00:26:46.422 --> 00:26:47.790
the eye of the beholder.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.470
On the one hand, it's certainly
a high part of the

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.890
budget, compared to what
people spend, for

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.370
example, in the US.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.040
On the other hand, if you
compare it with, for example,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.280
what they spent on tobacco, even
on education, given that

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:07.780
a lot of these countries have
a free education system, the

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:12.230
education expenditure they are
making are extras, I'm sure

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.685
surely value extras.

00:27:13.685 --> 00:27:18.710
But that means that there seems
to be actually some

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:23.060
wiggle room, that you could do
something about your food

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.320
budget and increase it without
sacrificing anything else

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.230
that's vital for the house.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:31.154
Yes.

00:27:31.154 --> 00:27:31.554
AUDIENCE: I just
have a question

00:27:31.554 --> 00:27:32.597
about what you presented.

00:27:32.597 --> 00:27:34.761
The people who spend
more on food, is

00:27:34.761 --> 00:27:35.483
their nutrition better?

00:27:35.483 --> 00:27:36.733
Or is it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:40.770
PROFESSOR: So that's an
excellent question.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.660
We're going to look into that,
which is when you spend more

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:47.540
money on food, it could
be on more nutritious

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.420
food or more calories.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.050
It could be on not so much
more nutritious food.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.100
It could be on better
tasting food.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:00.060
And the short answer is that
the two are happening.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.600
I don't know whether it's true
at the country level.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.825
For example, India is a country
that spends very

00:28:04.825 --> 00:28:07.200
little on food and which has
probably the worst nutritional

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.290
stages for this group of people
within the world.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.880
But at the individual level,
we're going to see that very

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.610
soon when people increase how
much money they spend on food,

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.610
they both get more food and
they get better food, more

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.050
expensive food for the calories
and the nutrition

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:24.590
they are getting.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.360
So both things happen
together.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.810
AUDIENCE: What is the
requirement for the

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.260
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.510
children and [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.320
PROFESSOR: No, this
is everyone.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.860
This is everyone who lives
on less than a

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.680
dollar a day per capita.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.720
So if there are five of
them, they are entire

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.300
budget divided by 5.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.790
And if no one has any children,
then they won't

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.100
spend anything on education.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.786
AUDIENCE: They migh have spent
quite a bit more on education.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.770
PROFESSOR: This means that per
child, they spend a fair

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.020
amount on education.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.349
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:04.349 --> 00:29:08.293
is more expensive in South
Africa or Timor, so

00:29:08.293 --> 00:29:11.004
[INAUDIBLE] basically be buying
the same quantity of

00:29:11.004 --> 00:29:12.260
food to be spending more.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.930
PROFESSOR: Right, so that's
an excellent point.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:19.310
The point is in answer to the
unstated question, which is

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:23.160
what explains this variation
across countries, our first

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.160
possible explanation
is the relative

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.790
price of food is different.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:32.750
So food could be relatively more
expensive in Timor Leste,

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.010
which is why people are spending
more money to get the

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.250
same thing.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:41.150
What is interesting is that the
opposite seems to be true,

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:48.405
which is because India is a
very large economy that is

00:29:48.405 --> 00:29:52.640
able to produce very many things
in India, the relative

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:58.280
price of things like toothbrush,
even DVDs,

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.350
cellphones--

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.740
that kind of things
relative to food--

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.790
is lower in India.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:08.645
So one of the reasons why people
seem to be spending, or

00:30:08.645 --> 00:30:09.670
one possible reason--

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.650
I'm not saying this
is a tirant.

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:14.160
But this is a conjecture, let's
say-- is one of the

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.040
reasons why people in India
spend much less on food and

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.410
more on other things compared to
people in Papua New Guinea,

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.790
is that there is nothing
to get in Papua New

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.930
Guinea except food.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:28.720
So if you are poor, like
what can you buy?

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.150
Well, in India, you can buy
shampoo of this kind, and

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.170
everything is produced locally,
hence the relative

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.330
prices are lower.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:40.780
So that's a possible explanation
for this pattern.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.280
Yeah.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.030
AUDIENCE: In terms of the
different prices across

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.280
countries for food, I thought
that the one dollar a day

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.780
standard was in terms of
purchasing power, so

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.100
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.270
PROFESSOR: For your
entire budget.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.740
So the one dollar a day standard
takes a basket of

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:56.560
consumption good.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.175
Of course, food is an important
part o it, but there

00:30:59.175 --> 00:31:01.520
is also other things that
people consume.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:07.390
So one dollar a day takes
the basket of goods.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:10.730
In fact, the way it's computed
here, it's 16

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.240
rupees a day, actually--

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.895
takes the basket of good that is
consumed by the poor rather

00:31:16.895 --> 00:31:21.915
than your basket of good or my
basket of good, and price it

00:31:21.915 --> 00:31:24.210
in the different places
and adjust with that.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:25.940
So good plays an
important part.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.130
But other things play as well.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.890
And then within a single dollar
a day, it could be

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:34.750
that, say in India, for example,
food is relatively

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.370
expensive relative to other
things just because the other

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.270
things are so cheap
and available.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.964
Yes, Eve.

00:31:41.964 --> 00:31:45.310
AUDIENCE: Could it be that it's
hotter in India than the

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.700
other places, so in other places
people need to eat more

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.120
food to have more fat to
preserve heat, whereas in

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.008
India, they don't need to eat as
much food because it's hot

00:31:54.008 --> 00:31:54.320
all the time?

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.006
PROFESSOR: So it could be.

00:31:56.006 --> 00:31:57.150
It's a very interesting point,
and we are going

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:57.500
to make this point.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.830
We are going to see this
point coming up in

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.770
another guide very soon.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:06.940
The point is that we don't
know what's the calorie

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.270
requirement for a human being,
partly because it depends on

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.600
the climate and it depends
on what you are doing.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.100
And it depends on how much
calories you are losing to

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.100
illnesses and other
things like that.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.730
One piece of evidence that
suggests it's not the entire

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:27.270
story is that if it were the
case, if I looked at the size

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.820
of the Indian people compared
to the size of anyone else,

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.070
what should I see?

00:32:34.404 --> 00:32:36.734
Sorry?

00:32:36.734 --> 00:32:37.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.420
PROFESSOR: Well, in your
hypothesis where the

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.330
difference is due to the fact
that they need less calories

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:47.900
because it's warm, if everything
was explained here

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.520
by the fact that Indian people
don't need that much calorie

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.840
compare to--

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.840
see, all these countries
are warm.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.590
But compared to South Africa,
South Africa is a bit more

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:01.260
temperate, so poor people in
South Africa need to eat a lot

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.130
because it's cold when it's
the winter there.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:10.970
Then if all the differences in
calorie consumption were to be

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.760
explained by these needs, we
would find people whose

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.890
nutrition status would
be comparable.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.060
So their height would be the
same and their weight

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.680
would be the same.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.480
And in fact, Indian people are
very, very short and they are

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.200
very, very skinny.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.560
Now you might say, yes,
but that's genetic.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.720
It's just, like, Indian
people are short.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:40.160
But that's actually not true,
because the children, when

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.780
Indian migrants come to the US,
they start eating US food,

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.570
their children are
still smaller.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.640
But the children of
their children--

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.910
some of you might be that--

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.700
are exactly as tall
as anybody else.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.580
So it suggests that the genetic
potential of Indian

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.390
people in term of height and
body size is no different than

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.990
that of anybody else.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:12.690
But it's their nutritional
status that is different.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:14.380
And that affects them directly,
and that affects

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.830
their children just because
of when you're in utero in

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:19.830
someone who doesn't eat enough,

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.300
you'll also be smaller.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.870
For the longest time,
people said

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.690
Japanese people were short.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.969
But it turns out that the height
in Japan are converging

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:32.260
to the height of everybody
else in the world.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.889
So this is more of a nutrition
thing than all this cereal and

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:39.518
maize that we are consuming,
than a

00:34:39.518 --> 00:34:42.889
genetic potential probably.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:46.360
So going back to sort of the
two punch lines here--

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:51.149
one is that this is moving a
lot, which suggests that there

00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:54.755
is some margin of choices, at
least in India, for example.

00:34:54.755 --> 00:34:57.860
Second is we have this alcohol
and tobacco that we could, in

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.480
principle, get rid of.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.400
And then all of that would
be extra calories.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.280
So that suggests that this is
high, this is important.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.300
But there seems to be some
amount of wiggle room take

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.110
Ben's word.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:13.340
There is some amount of
wiggle room here.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.390
And to look at other form of
wiggle room, so another way to

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:23.000
look at it is to look at this
question, which is what is the

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.220
elasticity of calorie
consumption with respect to

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.730
your income?

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:36.140
So this log per capita outlay
is some fancy way of saying

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.570
log per capita expenditure,
which is a good measure of

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.270
your wealth.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.800
And what you can see
is that this is the

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.130
log per capita calorie.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:47.980
This is looking at Maharashtra
in 1993.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.380
India has grown a lot since
1993, but Maharashtra in 1993

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.300
was a pretty poor place.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.650
And what you find is that as
people become richer, they do

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:58.880
consume more.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.100
The slope of this line
is about 0.3.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.400
And the slope of this line when
I run a regression of log

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.430
per capita calorie on log per
capita outlay, what is the

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.150
slope giving me?

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.330
The elasticity.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.410
So whenever I go log log
regression, I get the

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:15.270
elasticity.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:17.640
Interestingly, this is
not a regression.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.540
I mean, this is a regression,
but not a linear regression.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.050
This is a non parametric
regression, which means that

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:27.640
if the shape had been what I
told you it could be, which is

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:32.370
very high elasticity early on,
and then a lower one, so

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:36.060
something we would expect if we
were in the S shape world

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.790
of the elasticity being above
one for the poor and then

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.105
less, the way they have
estimated this regression

00:36:42.105 --> 00:36:44.500
allows for this to
be the case.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.010
But that's not what they find.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:50.910
They find the elasticity of
1.5 pretty much constant

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.920
across the range in the data.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.650
Now no one here is very rich, so
it's quite possible that it

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.390
starts going down here.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.700
But the point is that even for
the very poorest, that

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:05.090
elasticity is not above one, so
even the very poorest have

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.950
an Engel curve phenomenon,
which is as they become

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:11.470
richer, they don't start eating
as much as possible,

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:13.760
eating the extra calories up.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.570
They're eating, in terms of
calories, if I increase your

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:19.450
income by 10%, you increase
your calorie

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.820
consumption by 30%.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.450
So these two first things
suggest that maybe this is

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:30.290
somewhat unlikely that there
would be this very strong S

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:33.200
shape, because otherwise people
would be behaving in a

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.450
very bizarre way.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.990
So we've seen that.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:53.260
So I think we've covered this.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:58.470
So the calories increased with
overall consumption, but not

00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.610
one for one.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.850
When total expenditure
increased by 10%, the

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:05.250
consumption of calorie
increased by 3.5%.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.840
So we have an Engel curve.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.800
That is true for everyone.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.550
So why is the slope of the Engel
curve less than one?

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:19.280
So what happens is what was
suggested earlier, which is

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:24.330
when people get a bit more
money, they do increase the

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:26.940
share of the budget going
to other things.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.960
So the elasticity of overall
food expenditure

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.760
is less than one.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.260
It's about 0.7.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:36.300
So if I increase your budget by
10%, you increase your food

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.170
consumption by 7%.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:40.240
And then it means you increase
something else more than

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.350
proportionally.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:45.020
So maybe you start spending
money on the movies, which you

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.920
were not doing before.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.320
So that's the first thing.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:54.520
So 7% is not 3, though.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.270
So what is the difference
between 7 and 3?

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:01.690
When I increase your budget by
10%, you increase your food

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.530
budget by 7%.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:06.550
But your calories only
increase by 3.5.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.846
So what happened in
the meantime?

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:10.830
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.310
AUDIENCE: Maybe all your food
wasn't as high in calories.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:15.320
PROFESSOR: They bought more
expensive food anyway.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.980
Maybe because that food was
yummier, maybe because it was

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.760
more nutritious, but certainly
more expensive food.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.650
So what happens is that when
you spend more on food, you

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:29.310
start buying more expensive
calories and you do that in

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:30.820
various ways.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.505
You start eating meat instead
of eating cereals, and you

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:37.185
start eating more expensive
cereals instead of the course

00:39:37.185 --> 00:39:40.730
cereals you were
eating before.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.650
And even within the more
expensive cereals, rice for

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.860
example, you buy more
expensive rice.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.900
So all of this margin happens.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.390
And we can see it here
in the table.

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:54.450
We can see this is Maharashtra,
1983.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:58.420
These are the poorest
10% and the top 10%.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.720
We can see that the poorest 10%
spent 46% of their budget

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.760
on cereals, and the
top 10%, 31%.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:12.290
And if we look at meat, meat
is 8.5% for the poorest and

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:14.460
12% for the richest.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.130
Things like are constant,
however, in terms of fraction

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.230
of the budget is sugar.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:24.160
And the sugar actually goes
down 7.425%, and oil.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.530
That remains about the same.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:29.250
The fraction of the budget spent
on oil is 9% for both.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:34.130
But you get cereal going down,
and you get meat going up.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:37.690
And the price per calorie of
cereal is much cheaper

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.950
compared to the price
per calorie of meat.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:46.090
And now within cereal, people
who are poor spend 9% of their

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.220
budget on the rice.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.700
And the rich are spending
almost 11% of

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.500
their budget on rice.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:59.360
And then the price of rice is
also cheaper than the price of

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.850
other things.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:03.030
Price is more expensive, sorry,
than other things like

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.650
the course cereal.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:07.300
And even within rice, the
poor are buying cheaper

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.840
rice than the rich.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:15.070
The poor are spending 18 paise
per calorie for the rice, and

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:18.650
one rupee per calorie for
the richer people.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:22.800
So all of this margin happen,
which again suggests that

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.930
there is some amount
of flexibility.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.255
Because otherwise, what you
would do is to, within the

00:41:29.255 --> 00:41:32.520
same budget, continue to eat
the same thing, but more of

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.880
the same thing.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:38.560
So if you were at subsistence
level, the share of your

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.440
calories that comes from
the staple food

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.740
would remain constant.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.890
And it's only after you've
reached some level of

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.250
subsistence that you would
say, now I can

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:49.680
start eating more meat.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.180
It's more expensive,
but it's yummier.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.270
And so the fact that even for
these relatively poor people

00:41:55.270 --> 00:42:00.770
who see that the share of
calories that comes from rice

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:07.270
declines is an indication that
they probably see themselves

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:08.820
having some margin of choice.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.730
So even among the very poor
people, an increase in

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.430
economic well being has
positive, but not a huge,

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.500
impact on calories consumed.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.750
So you take the poorest person
here and you increase their

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.220
budget by 10%, they will
increase their calories by

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.550
3.5%, partly because there are
other things they like to do,

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.043
partly because within
food, they also like

00:42:48.043 --> 00:42:50.710
to eat better food.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:55.330
So that brings us to this Jensen
and Miller idea, which

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.630
is the idea of a Giffen good.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.880
So what's a Giffen good?

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:06.180
AUDIENCE: It's a good that
when the price increases,

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.670
there's an increase in demand.

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.195
PROFESSOR: When the price
increase, there is

00:43:10.195 --> 00:43:12.175
an increase in demand.

00:43:12.175 --> 00:43:12.670
That's right.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.135
Why is that surprising?

00:43:16.135 --> 00:43:19.255
AUDIENCE: Because generally
the demand curves--

00:43:19.255 --> 00:43:20.614
PROFESSOR: Yeah, go ahead.

00:43:20.614 --> 00:43:24.408
AUDIENCE: Generally as the price
increases, there's a

00:43:24.408 --> 00:43:26.050
decrease in the demand
for the quantity.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:27.253
PROFESSOR: Generally, we
think of the demand

00:43:27.253 --> 00:43:28.320
curve as looking down.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.070
So if there is an increase
in the price, you

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.320
decrease your demand.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.520
So why is it not a violation
of everything

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.770
we know about economics?

00:43:42.153 --> 00:43:47.510
AUDIENCE: Because if the price
of some good increases, then

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.945
you wouldn't be able to
substitute out [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:49.945 --> 00:43:50.919
pretty easily.

00:43:50.919 --> 00:43:52.950
So the example of rice and
meat-- if the price of rice

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:56.649
increases, then in order to get
the calories you need, you

00:43:56.649 --> 00:43:59.740
might have to buy more rice
and just stop buying meat.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:05.220
PROFESSOR: Right, Mr. Giffen is
referred to by who for the

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.275
first time?

00:44:07.275 --> 00:44:11.306
Are there some writings
by Mr. Giffen?

00:44:11.306 --> 00:44:13.590
AUDIENCE: Indiana Jones.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:14.600
PROFESSOR: Indiana Jones--

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.062
but before that.

00:44:16.062 --> 00:44:18.980
So Mr. Giffen-- we have no
writing from him directly, but

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.710
he was referred to
by Adam Smith.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.100
And Adam Smith gives
the example

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:27.010
of potatoes in Ireland.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:30.210
The price of potatoes goes up,
but potatoes is such an

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:32.830
important part of the budget
that when the price of

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.750
potatoes goes up, it does an
income effect, so that is

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:36.260
always true.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.860
When the price of a good goes
up, it has an income effect

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.620
and it has a substitution
effect.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.070
What do we know about the
substitution effect?

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:50.375
Yeah.

00:44:50.375 --> 00:44:53.770
AUDIENCE: Generally when the
price of one good goes up,

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:56.680
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.360
PROFESSOR: Right, so when the
price of a good goes up, you

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.580
substitute to another good.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.700
So the substitution effect
is always negative.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.820
But the income effect can be
either positive or negative.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.390
So the income effect--

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:14.640
in what case is it positive?

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:29.100
So for example, if you look at
iPod consumption, would that

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.710
tend to have a positive
income effect or a

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:31.960
negative income effect?

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:42.818
So the goods that are more like
luxury goods, that are a

00:45:42.818 --> 00:45:44.770
bit expensive, will have
positive income effect,

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:48.540
meaning as you become richer,
you will consume more of them.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.380
The goods that are cheaper and
that are not particularly

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.990
desirable will have negative
income effect.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:56.850
For example, think about
your own budget.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:59.505
As you become richer, maybe
you are going to buy more

00:45:59.505 --> 00:46:00.480
orange juice.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.050
That is a positive
income effect.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.460
Maybe you are going to get
fewer macaroni and cheese

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:06.640
pre-packed.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.180
That has a negative
income effect.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.260
So the income effect could be
positive or could be negative.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.050
It's positive if it's
a normal good.

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:16.420
It's negative if it's
an inferior good.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.940
So now something like potato is

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.400
presumably an inferior good.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.400
That's not something
people love.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.042
It's something that as they
become richer, they will try

00:46:24.042 --> 00:46:26.870
and substitute to
another thing.

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:30.620
So the question is whether the
income effect of an inferior

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.030
good like potato is so large--

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:37.640
not only it's negative, but it
is so large that it out does

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.190
the substitution effect.

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.180
So if the income effect is so
large that it more than

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:46.780
compensates for the substitution
effect, then you

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.170
might be getting a
different good.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:53.180
So that is the story of the
potato famine, which is

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.720
possibly apocryphal,
the story being the

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.050
price of potato increases.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.245
But that makes people poorer,
so that actually increases

00:47:02.245 --> 00:47:04.900
their consumption of potatoes,
because they stop eating meat,

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.680
and they eat only potatoes
because they have no money

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.590
left to buy any meat.

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.840
So this is a different good.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.840
So until this paper, I think
there was a strong suspicion

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.120
among economists that
different goods--

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.410
actually, they didn't exist,
but they were a nice

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.850
theoretical possibility, but
that in practice, you don't

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:25.830
see a good where the income
effect is so large that it

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:29.990
outdoes the substitution effect,
so that if you become

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.040
richer, you eat fewer
potatoes.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.170
But if the price of
potatoes declines,

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:37.150
you eat more potatoes.

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:41.790
So this is the story.

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:45.590
So a staple food that
constitutes a large part of

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:48.400
the budget, like potatoes for
Irish famine or the example

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.650
they have in China are what?

00:47:53.834 --> 00:47:56.750
AUDIENCE: These were two
provinces in the North

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.000
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.740
PROFESSOR: Wheat and rice.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:09.340
So these are foods which are a
fairly large part of the food

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.720
budget and a fairly large part
of the overall budget.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.060
So this is a good confident
for a different good.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.620
Because for the income effect to
have any chance to be large

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.340
enough, it has to be something
that takes a large part of

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.660
your budget.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.980
So that's why they decided
on this thing.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.690
So the first thing they've done
is they looked at these

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:32.260
two provinces and they observed
that, for example, in

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:36.260
a rice consuming region, they
observed that in cities where

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:40.450
the price of rice is higher,
people consume more rice.

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.480
And first, they are very happy,
and they said oh, we

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.020
have found our Giffen good.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.120
But then they get depressed and
they realize maybe it is

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.320
not a Giffen good.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.420
So why do they conclude
that it doesn't give

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.560
them a Giffen good?

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.528
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:55.528 --> 00:48:58.726
is it because the price is
higher that people consume

00:48:58.726 --> 00:49:01.333
more rice, which would make it
an incident? or is it that

00:49:01.333 --> 00:49:02.930
people consume more rice, so
the price becomes higher?

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:03.880
PROFESSOR: Right,
we don't know.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.830
We are trying to trace
a demand curve.

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:09.860
But if we only observe prices
and quantity, we might be

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.900
tracing the supply curve.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:15.230
So we don't know whether we have
traced the demand curve

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:16.470
or the supply curve.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:21.100
And this would be the normal
shape for a supply curve.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:25.070
So this is exactly the same type
of problems that we were

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:28.890
facing when we were trying to
look at the effect of malaria

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:34.080
prices on bednets, which is if
we just look at the variation

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.710
in the world, there is the
effect that we are trying to

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:40.330
identify, and there is a
possible of a reverse

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:42.960
causality, in this case, very
clear, which is we also have a

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.550
supply curve that we are
trying to trace.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.800
So that's why they decided
that's not working.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.080
So what did they decide to do?

00:49:54.558 --> 00:49:57.048
AUDIENCE: They subsidized
rice and wheat.

00:49:57.048 --> 00:49:58.930
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.870
PROFESSOR: Exactly, what they
decided to do is to run the

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.490
maize experiment where they
subsidized the price of rice

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:06.370
in the rice consuming region
and wheat in the wheat

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:09.310
consuming region at
various levels.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.370
I think there are three
levels of subsidies.

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:14.620
So they take a sample
of households.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.735
They distribute a voucher for
the reduced price of rice in

00:50:17.735 --> 00:50:22.840
Hunan and reduced price of wheat
in Gangsu to a random

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:28.470
sub sample for more than a
month's supply every month.

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:30.330
They made sure that
the household

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.560
wouldn't extend them.

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:37.620
Otherwise, what would be a
problem if households started

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:38.870
trading them?

00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:45.575
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:48.950
PROFESSOR: Exactly, in
particular you try

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:49.690
to reduce the price.

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:53.020
But if you give voucher and
people start exchanging them,

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.200
think of food stamps when people
sell their food stamps.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.710
When they sell their food
stamps, they are getting

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:03.900
money, which is--

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:04.980
I mean, it's not bad.

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:09.420
But why do we think
it's an issue?

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.600
And why would there
be a theoretical

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.530
issue in their cases?

00:51:17.442 --> 00:51:20.870
AUDIENCE: Essentially, the price
of the rice would need

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:22.510
to be changed.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:23.760
PROFESSOR: It wouldn't
be changing.

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:29.660
So the people would get their
voucher, and then they would

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.430
sell it to someone.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:32.150
So they would get
money instead.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.330
And then they would, with that
many, perhaps buy some rice

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:36.920
and wheat and buy some
other things as well.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:41.320
So their experiment where they
tried to change the price of

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.940
rice or wheat would end up just
changing their income

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.710
without changing the price.

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:47.790
Because the marginal price that
they are facing once they

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:50.690
have sold their voucher is the
same, except they now have

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:51.840
more money.

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.800
So now all they would identify
is the income effect.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.420
And of course, the income
effect would be negative

00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.990
because that's an
inferior good.

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.510
So they would be finding
a Giffen good.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:02.770
But that would not
be a real one.

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:05.590
That would be a fake one due to
the fact that their price

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:08.480
experiment would be transformed
into an income

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.080
experiment.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.180
So it's very important for
them to keep the price

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.490
experiment in tact.

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:18.160
So they tried to do that and
they tried to argue in the

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.535
paper and in the post that you
read in Freakonomics that

00:52:20.535 --> 00:52:23.250
they've done this properly.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:25.380
And after six months, they came
back, and then they asked

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.100
detailed questions about the
consumption of rice, wheat and

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.490
other things.

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:32.040
So what do they find?

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.010
So I'm going to show you the
regression table which gives

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:37.520
us the results directly and
explain to you what's in the

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.000
regression table.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:39.640
So it's a long table.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.450
But for now, focus on
the first column.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:46.480
So what they regress is the
percent increase in rice

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.880
consumption over the
percent subsidy.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.370
There are three groups
of subsidies.

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:55.055
I was looking everywhere in the
paper for you to have the

00:52:55.055 --> 00:52:59.144
three prices and the three
reductions so that I could

00:52:59.144 --> 00:53:01.170
plot them, but they
were not there.

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:04.490
So this is the overall result.

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:06.185
So basically, the way you
read this graph--

00:53:06.185 --> 00:53:11.780
it's saying that your
consumption of rice reduces by

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:21.050
23.5% when the subsidy
increases by 100%.

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:23.920
It's directly a percentage
of a percentage.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:31.770
So your consumption of rice
reduces in percentage about a

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:34.550
quarter of the reduction
in price.

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:36.160
So the important thing
here is, of

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.210
course, that it's negative.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:40.410
And below the coefficient
here, you get

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.600
the standard error.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.900
So the coefficient is 0.235.

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.840
The standard error 0.14.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.500
If you divide by one the other,
you get the familiar T

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.590
statistics.

00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:55.920
This one is above 1.7, so this
means this is significant at

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.860
10% level, which tells
you that this is not

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.620
entirely due to chance.

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.880
This negative is
not some fluke.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.070
It is something which is
indeed significantly

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:07.980
different from 0.

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.770
So that's what they
find for Hunan.

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:16.110
And then they find the opposite
for seafood, where

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:19.670
the elasticity of seafood
consumption with respect to

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:23.590
the price of rice is
very positive.

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:25.980
So what happened in
their experiment--

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:29.040
this is your typical Giffen
good behavior--

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.130
is the price of rice increases,
but increases

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:34.420
because rice is such an
important part of your budget.

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.780
It amounts to increasing
your income.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.990
And because of this increase in
your income, you feel that

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:42.600
you can now get more of your
calories from shrimps and

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.810
fewer from food.

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:47.060
So that's for Hunan.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.240
So this is the explanation.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:02.380
And for Gansu, we have a
positive elasticity.

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.470
So it means that wheat doesn't
appear to be a

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:05.810
Giffen good in Gansu.

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:07.650
It appears to be an
inferior good.

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:12.340
It increased less than one for
one, but in fact, it's not

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:14.240
significantly positive.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.510
But it's certainly
not negative.

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:20.650
And they explain why they find
a different result in a

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:22.340
different place.

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.250
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.297
AUDIENCE: What prevented then
from just [INAUDIBLE] rice

00:55:25.297 --> 00:55:29.420
they got to give more money
by substituting goods?

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:32.646
PROFESSOR: Right, so they
tried to stop that.

00:55:32.646 --> 00:55:38.940
But we don't know for sure
that they succeeded.

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:40.660
What they were very worried
about is the

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.990
resale of the voucher.

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:45.675
And their view then is once you
had resold the voucher,

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:48.400
then you wouldn't have
resold the rice.

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.070
And what they did after that
is they did a survey.

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:57.950
So the data here doesn't come
from the administrative data

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:59.760
of what was sold in the shop.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.560
The survey comes from what
people consumed at

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.260
the end of the day.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.670
So to the extent that people
didn't lie to them, this is

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:09.220
the actually consumption.

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:13.250
So it could still be the case
that they bought the rice.

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:14.200
They sold the rice.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.160
They bought the rice with the
voucher because they couldn't

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.360
exchange the voucher.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.920
But then, they went to the
trouble of selling the rice.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.080
And that's why it's just an
income effect that we are

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.950
estimating, which is
why it's negative.

00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:30.250
They tried to argue that it
didn't happen, but that's, of

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:32.300
course, a key concept.

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:36.220
So what do they say about wheat,
that why did the wheat

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.206
show them a different good for
the wheat, but they have one

00:56:38.206 --> 00:56:39.820
for the rice?

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.170
AUDIENCE: Because people aren't
eating wheat itself.

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:45.940
They're eating wheat products,
like noodles.

00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:47.552
PROFESSOR: Exactly, you are
saying that it's not their own

00:56:47.552 --> 00:56:48.765
group, that people rice.

00:56:48.765 --> 00:56:52.030
They don't buy big packets of
wheat, so that it was kind of

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:53.280
the wrong idea.

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:02.300
This, of course, has implication
for nutrition, and

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.980
in particular for a very
frequent policy that we find

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:09.620
in developing world, which is
food price's subsidy for

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.290
greater nutrition.

00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:15.170
So for example, in Indonesia,
we have the ration program.

00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:16.990
If you remember, in Pak Solhin's
stories, he got some

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:19.300
free rice from the
ration program.

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:25.020
In India, India just introduced
the Right to Food

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.900
Act and a subsidy scheme
for rice in

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.430
rice consuming regions.

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:33.090
So India has something called
a public distribution system

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:37.140
where they distribute food to
households at reduced prices,

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.000
to poor households at
reduced prices.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:46.110
Egypt spent something like 3% of
its GDP on food subsidies.

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:51.330
So food subsidies is a very
important part of help to the

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:53.010
poor in developing countries.

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:55.350
It's also a very important
part of our--

00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:56.740
our meaning the US--

00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:01.420
aid to poor countries is in the
form of food aid, directly

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:04.830
food which we send to
poor countries.

00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:07.080
Why are we spending a lot of our
aid in terms of food aid?

00:58:11.336 --> 00:58:12.827
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:12.827 --> 00:58:14.815
lot of food [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:14.815 --> 00:58:17.797
It's easier for us to just
take that [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:17.797 --> 00:58:20.212
PROFESSOR: Yes, so part of the
reason why a lot of our aid is

00:58:20.212 --> 00:58:21.440
in the form of food aid
is that it's also

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.010
aid for our own farmers.

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:26.130
And it's a way of kind of
buying the [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:28.110
and sending them out.

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:31.280
So when the weather has been
good in the US and the harvest

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.980
is very big, a lot more food
aid is being spent

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.510
all over the world.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:40.830
But with that aside, this is a
policy that many countries

00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:44.430
have to try to subsidize
the price of food.

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:49.840
But if we have something like
the Giffen good, what may

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:56.710
happen if you make the price
of the staple less high, if

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:58.370
you make the price of
the staple lower?

00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:00.250
Yes.

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:02.791
AUDIENCE: Then they'll spend
their income on other sorts of

00:59:02.791 --> 00:59:04.870
stuff, not on the [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:06.560
PROFESSOR: Yes, we might find
that something like this

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:11.990
happens, which is the price
of rice has now gone down.

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:13.930
Instead of eating more rice,
you ate less rice and more

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:17.540
shrimps and maybe also
more cellphones.

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:23.490
So if rice is indeed a Giffen
good, the increase in the

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:26.640
calories you are getting from a
decline in the price of rice

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.770
might actually not
be very high.

00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:32.150
In fact, it might even
be negative.

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:35.810
Because if the income effect is
sufficiently large, it made

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:38.005
outdo, again, the
price effect.

00:59:38.005 --> 00:59:40.860
And we might find that as we
make food cheaper, people eat

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.710
less instead of eating more.

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:46.920
And that's exactly what they
found in Hunan where rice was

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.480
a Giffen good.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:57.000
They find that as you decrease
the price of rice, people eat

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.790
fewer calories, not more.

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:09.230
So this would be the very
standard poor price policy in

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:12.390
your average developing
countries, to try to subsidize

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:13.810
the staple.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:20.240
And the justification of this
policy will typically be in

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.110
the form of we need to
increase the calorie

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:26.140
consumption because people are
trapped in poverty trap like

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.580
our friend, Pak Solhin.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.370
But in fact, if you look at this
for this urban household

01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:34.310
in China, you find the opposite,
which is subsidizing

01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:36.570
the price of rice actually
leads to

01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:38.640
fewer calories consumed.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.572
And it's not because people gain
in terms of other micro

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:43.926
nutrients, though we
don't have all

01:00:43.926 --> 01:00:45.420
the other micro nutrient.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:50.850
But we get fewer portions
being consumed as well.

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:52.850
So this is what they find
in Hunan, but they

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.550
don't have it in Gansu.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.830
So it's not to say that
it happens necessarily

01:00:56.830 --> 01:01:00.950
everywhere, but it is something
that might happen.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:04.070
So it is not a total given that
a reduction in the price

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:08.310
of food will lead to an
increase in nutrition.

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:10.615
On the bright side, it also
means that it's not

01:01:10.615 --> 01:01:13.025
necessarily a given that the
current increase in the food

01:01:13.025 --> 01:01:15.720
prices that we are observing
will lead to people eating

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.220
fewer calories.

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:21.440
Because it might have this
progress effect of making them

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.286
poorer and therefore leading
them to eat more of calories.

01:01:26.286 --> 01:01:30.678
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
one way [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:30.678 --> 01:01:32.142
food [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:32.142 --> 01:01:35.558
Because, for example, if you eat
shrimps, shrimps may not

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:36.534
be very calorie rich.

01:01:36.534 --> 01:01:39.462
In India, people eat
a lot of lentils.

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:43.632
And the next thing that they eat
to rice is durum, which is

01:01:43.632 --> 01:01:46.648
actually full of protein.

01:01:46.648 --> 01:01:50.995
So eating less rice, and if they
spend more on protein,

01:01:50.995 --> 01:01:52.927
[INAUDIBLE].

01:01:52.927 --> 01:01:55.580
PROFESSOR: Right, so this is,
of course, completely

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:59.290
dependent on what you
substitute with.

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:01.530
If you substitute rice with
lentils, actually it might be

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:04.220
more nutrition, and more iron,
more nutrition, et cetera.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:07.490
So we might find an increase in
nutrition due to subsidy in

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:08.700
the price the rice.

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:11.100
So the only point here was
not to say that it

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:11.930
has to be the case.

01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:14.780
It was to say that it doesn't
have to be the case that

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.470
subsidizing the price the rice
will lead to more rice and

01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:19.440
more calories being consumed.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.960
Now let's look at India,
precisely.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.910
So before that, there is
something that should surprise

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:33.360
you in when you put together
this Jenson and Miller result

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.390
and what we had before
in India.

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:42.430
We found that a household that
are 10% richer eat about 3.5

01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:44.180
more calories.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.830
But the Jenson and
Miller result--

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:47.940
what does it suggest about
the income effect?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.780
We are finding that when the
price of rice decreases, you

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.460
eat less, not more.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.573
What the income effect
has to be?

01:02:58.573 --> 01:02:59.300
AUDIENCE: It's negative.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:01.935
PROFESSOR: It has
to be negative.

01:03:01.935 --> 01:03:04.280
So on the one hand, I showed you
positive income effect--

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.290
maybe not very large, but
certainly positive for India.

01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:10.510
On the other hand, I'm showing
you price effect in China

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:15.230
which suggest that the income
effect has to be negative, and

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:16.610
in fact, very negative.

01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:18.120
So how can this be?

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.080
How can we have the two
things together?

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.170
So the first thing is that in
India, we were comparing

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:26.170
different households.

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:28.100
We were not comparing the
same household to

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:32.340
which I give more money.

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.950
And different households
are different.

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:36.750
Maybe they're households
that are a bit richer.

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:39.280
They are also more educated and
they understand the value

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.110
of nutrition, and that's
why they eat more.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:45.193
So the idea in experiment would
be to give people a

01:03:45.193 --> 01:03:48.270
little bit more money, really
literally do that and see

01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:50.560
whether they spend this
money on food or not.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.060
And that would allow us to
estimate the income effect.

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.250
To my knowledge, no
one has done that.

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:58.630
It's a little bit difficult
to parachute [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:00.600
drops of money on people--

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.550
not impossible, but it's not
been done, I don't think.

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:08.050
So what we have when we looked
at the India curve, we find

01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:10.930
that people who have more
money eat more.

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:13.580
But it may be because they have
different tastes or it

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.490
might be because they eat more,
and therefore they're

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:18.480
more productive, therefore they
have more money, so the

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.780
opposite relationship.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:24.700
So that may be an
underestimate.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.400
That positive estimate, which
was already not that high of

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.690
the income effect, might have
been an over estimate.

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:32.830
And one thing that's
suggested--

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:35.330
and it goes back to
[? Swati's ?] point earlier--

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:40.000
is when we plug the Engel curve
over time in India, we

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.250
see two interesting things.

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:48.700
Number one, all of the Engel
curve for the rural areas are

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:51.230
above the Engel curve
for the urban areas.

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:52.850
Why do you think that
would be the case?

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:58.534
AUDIENCE: The work in the rural
area is much more labor

01:04:58.534 --> 01:05:00.363
intensive, so you need
to eat more to

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:01.630
have physical strength.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.430
PROFESSOR: Exactly, the work
in rural area is more

01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:06.060
intensive, and so they
need more calories.

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.480
So this is interesting that
you are making this point,

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.560
because this is the point you
were making earlier about

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.640
maybe the needs of calorie in
South Africa are bigger

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.410
because it's colder.

01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:17.920
So that's the first
things we notice.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.530
So this we can explain.

01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:21.740
And what's the other interesting
trend in this

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:29.460
picture is that over time, the
Engel curves are falling down.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:34.360
People are eating less, and
less, and less for the same

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.520
level of income.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.860
So what happened in India over
time is that, of course,

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.880
people got richer.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.480
So if the Engel curves had been
stable, they would have

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.430
eaten more.

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:47.750
But because the Engel curves are
also falling down at the

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:53.100
same time, what happened over
time is that people are moving

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.990
first across to another Engel
curve and then up along an

01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:57.100
Engel curve.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:01.590
So take someone who would
be at a log income of 5.

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:05.810
15 years later, they have a log
income maybe of 5.5, but

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:07.060
the Engel curve have
also moved.

01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:18.630
Take someone who is at 5, and
then 15 years later, they

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:20.410
would be, let's say, at 6.

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:24.520
But now we need to find the 6 on
the much lower Engel curve.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.790
So instead of eating more, as
they would have if the Engel

01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:30.490
curve had become stable, we find
that people in India eat

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:32.680
less and less.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:36.140
So over time, the poor in India
are eating less and less

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:40.010
instead of eating more and more,
which does suggest some

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:42.690
negative income elasticity for
the country as a whole.

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:45.410
The country is becoming richer
and those people are becoming

01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:48.570
richer, but they are eating
less and less.

01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:52.890
So this now starts to make sense
with the two results,

01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:55.570
where maybe the income
elasticity of food

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:56.530
consumption--

01:06:56.530 --> 01:07:00.361
not only it's not above one,
which is what we would have in

01:07:00.361 --> 01:07:02.900
a poverty trap kind of a
world, but it might be

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:06.252
negative, which is as people
become richer, they-- a funny

01:07:06.252 --> 01:07:07.525
thing-- eat fewer calories.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.330
So if we look at nutrition in
India, we have a pretty

01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:22.900
interesting phenomenon, which is
this is the share of people

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:27.840
who are eating below 2,100
in urban areas and

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.900
2,400 in rural areas.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.600
This is the number of calories
they consume per head.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.760
Why are these interesting
thresholds?

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.010
Yeah.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.845
You had a question or you
were just moving?

01:07:42.845 --> 01:07:43.338
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was going
to ask [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:43.338 --> 01:07:43.831
PROFESSOR: Go ahead, go ahead.

01:07:43.831 --> 01:07:47.257
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if that couldn't just be

01:07:47.257 --> 01:07:50.682
explained because of inflation
and not necessarily for a

01:07:50.682 --> 01:07:52.630
negative effect.

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:54.841
PROFESSOR: Very good,
I could be that the

01:07:54.841 --> 01:07:57.090
price of food has changed.

01:07:57.090 --> 01:08:01.090
People have become richer, but
food is now more expensive.

01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:03.370
Remember, it has to be relative
prices, because

01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:04.640
people have become richer
in real term.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.140
Even corrected for inflation,
India is richer now.

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.770
And there are also fewer
poor people.

01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:16.460
But it could be that food prices
increase relative to

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:17.810
other things.

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:21.540
And that's actually not
the case until 2005.

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.630
And then it became very much
the case after 2005.

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:28.870
But these results are until
2005, where the relative price

01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:30.899
of food were relatively
stable.

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:33.790
That's a very good point.

01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:35.050
2,100, 2,400.

01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:36.028
Yeah.

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:37.495
AUDIENCE: So I was just
wondering the calculation that

01:08:37.495 --> 01:08:40.918
was done for people who are
doing sort of intensive labor,

01:08:40.918 --> 01:08:43.689
how many calories they would
need as a bare minimum to be

01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:46.050
able to succeed in that?

01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:48.060
PROFESSOR: Again, we don't
really know how many calories

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.460
we need, but this is
what the Indian

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.750
government says you need.

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:55.000
And maybe they get it a bit
wrong, because this is the

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.290
fraction of people in rural
area who are getting

01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:58.930
less than they need.

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:00.750
So it's very high.

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:04.790
Yet these people are
still all alive.

01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:08.429
But what is striking is that
this is increasing both in

01:09:08.429 --> 01:09:12.970
rural area and in urban area,
but even more in rural area.

01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:15.939
So one first explanation was
yours, is maybe it's the

01:09:15.939 --> 01:09:17.535
relative price of food.

01:09:17.535 --> 01:09:22.160
That would be true after 2005,
but not until 2005.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.029
What could be other
explanation?

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:27.202
AUDIENCE: Maybe a lot of poor
people have come from rural

01:09:27.202 --> 01:09:30.825
areas, and very poor
[INAUDIBLE]

01:09:30.825 --> 01:09:33.723
rural areas and then sort of
broke up into rural areas

01:09:33.723 --> 01:09:36.665
[INAUDIBLE].

01:09:36.665 --> 01:09:37.920
PROFESSOR: So that's a
very good suggestion.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.160
Maybe that the people who are
in rural area now are the

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.260
very, very poor, so they are
relatively poorer, so we get

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.090
more of them who are
eating less.

01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:49.790
And the urban area also getting
poorer, because the

01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:51.790
people from the rural
area move to them.

01:09:51.790 --> 01:09:55.940
That's a very good suggestion,
a composition effect.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.230
That probably doesn't explain
it, because if you look at

01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:02.420
that overall consumption per
capita of these people, are

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.990
the function of people who live
below a dollar a day,

01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:08.190
that is going down here
and down here.

01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:09.440
So that's probably not--

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.206
AUDIENCE: There has been
more technology.

01:10:15.206 --> 01:10:19.150
They're going to spend other
money on other stuff.

01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:21.710
PROFESSOR: Right, so this would
be another explanation,

01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:24.040
which is the similar explanation
from what we are

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.050
seeing on the wall, which
is there are more

01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:27.085
and more things available.

01:10:27.085 --> 01:10:30.810
In particular, one thing that
has clearly happened is the

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.020
advent of cell phone.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.530
And so now cell phones weren't
there, and now they are there.

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:39.640
In India, you can get a cell
phone and airtime everywhere.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.880
And so that's one thing.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.296
So more things become available,
very good.

01:10:44.296 --> 01:10:45.108
Yeah.

01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:47.130
AUDIENCE: I think this might
be what you meant, but

01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:49.680
technology that might make the
work easier, so you require

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.420
fewer calories because the
work is not as difficult.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.760
PROFESSOR: Right, this is not
what she meant just now, but

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.660
that's what she meant earlier.

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.070
So I was surprised she is not
making this point again.

01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:01.280
But that's exactly a very good
point, which is maybe these

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.890
are what the Indian government
says, but who

01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:06.360
knows what they know.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.890
And maybe the calorie
requirements have changed.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:11.195
One of the reasons would be that
you're less likely to do

01:11:11.195 --> 01:11:14.220
back breaking work, or maybe
because there is more

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.880
irrigation, there is more
mechanisation of agriculture.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.030
People are less likely
to be in agriculture,

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:21.030
even in rural areas.

01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:23.360
What would be another reason
why the calorie requirement

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.610
would have gone down?

01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:31.080
So one is clearly, you are
less likely to work.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.760
What competes with calories
with you?

01:11:37.284 --> 01:11:39.740
AUDIENCE: Are you talking
about worms and health?

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:43.670
PROFESSOR: Worms, and health and
diarrhea, and other nice

01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:45.030
things like that.

01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:48.800
Generally being sick consumes
a lot of calories.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.820
And so one thing that has
happened in India is drinking

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:55.890
water has become more available
and cleaner, so

01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:58.130
people are much less
likely to be sick.

01:11:58.130 --> 01:12:01.680
Another thing that uses a lot of
calories is being pregnant,

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.090
and you have many fewer
children being born.

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:08.440
So that's also compete
less for calories.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.730
So one possible reason for all
of these, for these changes,

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:16.400
is that the calorie requirements
have just changed

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.260
and people are staying at the
same level as before.

01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:20.880
They spend less.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.800
And they are used to a
particular level, so they just

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.900
stay there, and it costs them
less money than before.

01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:37.390
So this leads us to a
possibility for why people are

01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:38.870
not easy more generally.

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:40.870
Maybe they're not eating because
that's not such a

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:43.250
great investment.

01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:47.370
And so when we went through
out little theory section

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:51.020
here, we said that if you happen
to be right here in the

01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:54.660
capacity curve, it's very
valuable for you to eat.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.240
But if, in the real world,
the effect of calories on

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.430
productivity is not that loud,
then you might as well do

01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:04.690
something else with
your money.

01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:10.070
And in fact, what we find when
we look at the effect is that

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:14.500
this is the effect of calories
consumed on your productivity

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.950
if you're a farmer
in Sierra Leone.

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:20.710
And it's hard to find a job that
requires less strength

01:13:20.710 --> 01:13:22.565
than being a farmer
in Sierra Leone.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:25.800
And what you find is that
while it is increasing,

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.300
certainly, people
who eat more--

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:31.830
this is your calorie
consumption, and this is how

01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:33.250
productive you are--

01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:36.130
people are more productive
when they eat more.

01:13:36.130 --> 01:13:38.702
But what's the shape
of the curve?

01:13:38.702 --> 01:13:40.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:43.260
PROFESSOR: It's our inverted
L shape, and it's not

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.710
greater than one.

01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:46.630
So now we finally can answer
the question that

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:48.880
you asked ages ago.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:49.990
There is no real sign.

01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:53.273
This is probably the most
favorable case, which is why I

01:13:53.273 --> 01:13:54.960
put it on the board.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.270
There is no real sign that this
phenomenon that you need

01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:01.570
to eat enough calories,
otherwise you can't be

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:04.900
productive enough to do anything
is really there.

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:08.270
So in the very short run,
everything starts to fit,

01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:11.640
which is people don't really
need the extra calories that

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.820
much, because the extra
calories makes them

01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:16.260
productive, but not that
much more productive.

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.090
Hence, they are not
eating them.

01:14:18.090 --> 01:14:20.787
And in fact, we see over time
that they are eating less and

01:14:20.787 --> 01:14:22.240
less of the calories
because they need

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.510
less and less of them.

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:25.900
And they have a level of
strength that allows them to

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.560
do their day to day work, and
with the rest of their money,

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.450
they do other things, and that
makes now perfect sense.

01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:35.030
So in terms of policies,
what does it mean?

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:37.260
Well in term of policies, it
means that policies that are

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:41.790
going to insist that the big
problem is starvation in terms

01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:44.610
of not eating enough grain
are probably going to be

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:47.370
misleading, and are probably
going to lead to a

01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:51.630
fair amount of waste.

01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:01.930
So in summary, at the maximum
when your income today

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:06.150
increases by 10%, your calorie
consumption increase by 3.5%.

01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:08.455
That's what we saw in India,
and that's almost surely a

01:15:08.455 --> 01:15:10.130
wild over estimate.

01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:13.400
But let's say that it's
a maximum possible.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:14.650
And then your productivity--

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.250
you multiply that by another
4%, so when your income

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:26.850
increases by 10%, your income
increases by 1.4% tomorrow.

01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:29.720
That would be the S shape,
except it's not S, because

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:34.320
there is no point where it would
cause the 45 degree line

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:38.630
from below, because the
elasticity is much, much less

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:41.050
than one instead of
being above one.

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:44.040
So we don't have a place where
the curve is crossing the 45

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.420
degree line from below.

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:49.235
The curve is just not steep
enough to create a poverty

01:15:49.235 --> 01:15:52.440
trap from this phenomenon.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.690
Just to be sure that you don't
go away thinking everything is

01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:58.670
well, this may be very different
from other things

01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:01.510
than calories, for
example iron.

01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:04.490
And this may be very different
for children, because the

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:07.990
investment in a child, the
investment you're making at

01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:10.590
one specific time is going to
help them for their entire

01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:13.490
life instead of just
for tomorrow.

01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:16.510
So what we are going to do on
Thursday is look at what I

01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:19.100
call the hidden trap, which
is that there might be a

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:23.760
nutrition productivity poverty
trap, but it's not in the

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.870
usual sense where we
were looking for.

01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:30.110
It's in these more subtle
things, nutrients,

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:32.260
micronutrients, children's
nutrition,

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.510
pregnant women's nutrition.
