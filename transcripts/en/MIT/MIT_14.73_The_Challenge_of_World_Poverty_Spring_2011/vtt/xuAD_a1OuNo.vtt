00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.720
PROFESSOR: We're going to talk
about something we've sort of

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.050
touched on, in many different
contexts, but more head on

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.700
this time, and that's
entrepreneurship.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:53.610
And sort of the starting point
of that, I think, there's a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.750
story that somebody once told
me, which, I thought, kind of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.810
frames one side of the
debate very well.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.060
I was on the plane with a man,
who was clearly sort of a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.030
rich, Indian businessman.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.010
And he was quizzing me
about what I did.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.440
And I said, I study economics
and poor people.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.020
And he was very much
of the view.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.450
He said, look, you know, there's
all this stuff about

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.720
poor people.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.000
You guys don't understand
poor people.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.790
They have an entrepreneurial
genius in them.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.990
You think I'm a successful
entrepreneur.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.200
The way I learned
entrepreneurship

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.820
was from the poor.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.570
So I was kind of saying, yeah,
yeah, yeah, right.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.520
Well then he told me a story
that was actually quite

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.140
compelling.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.180
And mostly people--

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.860
whatever this means, it's
never clear to me.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.610
So I was being slightly
skeptical.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.820
But then he told me a story
that was very compelling.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.389
So he said that he had
an MBA from the US.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.820
I think from Kellogg.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.750
And he went back to India
after doing his MBA.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.540
And when he arrived in India,
his uncle, who was a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.190
businessman in Bombay, said
look, you want to be an

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.510
entrepreneur.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.910
Let me show you what
entrepreneurship is.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.360
So basically, they got
in his uncle's car.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.790
The uncle drove him
all the way to the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.250
Bombay stock exchange.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.220
The Bombay stock exchange, well,
he thought that they

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.640
would just go inside
the stock exchange.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.030
But in fact, he parked his car
in front of the exchange and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.470
pointed to four women who were
sitting on the side of the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.090
street that goes in front
of the exchange.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.620
And he said, you know, can you
figure out what those women's

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.870
business model is?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.180
So he says, well, I
looked and looked.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.310
And they would just get
up, from time to time.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.000
They'll scrape something off the
street, then they'll come

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.620
and sit down.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.030
And then they'll be sitting
and talking to each other.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.210
It's early in the morning, like
8:30 in the morning or

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.560
9:00 in the morning.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.770
Cars were driving by.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.740
People were showing up to work
at the stock exchange.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.710
But what does it have anything
to do with entrepreneurship?

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:53.080
So he kind of tried to come up
with some answer, completely

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.790
didn't manage, and finally
told his uncle,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.800
look, I have no idea.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.550
Why don't you tell me?

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.680
His uncle said, these women get
up at 5:30 in the morning.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.930
They go to the beach.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.990
In the morning, the tide has
receded, so there's wet sand

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.149
on the beach.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:23.630
They collect the wet sand and
then they put it in a bag.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.150
They come to the
stock exchange.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.710
This is one place where
lots of cars go by.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.810
And there's a nice
sidewalk to sit.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.550
Before the traffic starts,
they lay the

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.250
sand out on the street.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.110
And then they sit there.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.960
And as people drive on the
stand, the heat from the tires

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.780
dries the sand.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:00.140
So the sand gets heated and
eventually dried by the tires.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.970
Once the sand is fully dry, they
scrape off the sand and

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.670
put it in a bag and take
it back to the

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.230
slums where they live.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.510
Women use this dry sand
as like a scrubber.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.890
To clean dishes, you use
this dry sand as a

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.710
scrubber for that.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.920
And so they use this
dry sand to scrub

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.650
off their dirty dishes.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.800
And that's all dirty--

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.990
I don't know, whatever--

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.280
cook pot and pans.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.600
And that's how these people
make a living.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.860
They dry the sand,
and they sell it.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.700
So this was his example of how
infinitely creative poor

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.840
people are.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:03.930
And my reaction to that was,
you know, isn't that saying

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.570
much more about how creative
you have to be to make a

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.760
living if you are poor then
how creative the poor are?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.880
So it's the same proposition,
in a sense.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.310
You could say that this
shows that the

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.350
poor are very creative.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.520
Or you could show that the
poor have no business

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.470
opportunities so they have to
do this completely bizarre

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.450
thing to make a living.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.200
And those are just two sides
of the same coin.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.240
And I don't know.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.810
So what I want to talk about
today is a bit on this

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.130
implicit and often
explicit debate--

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.750
So before we get there--

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.450
on whether the poor are
entrepreneurial in some

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.370
meaningful sense of
the word or not.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.200
So let's start at
the beginning.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.170
Who's an entrepreneur?

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.587
How do you define
an entrepreneur?

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:18.684
AUDIENCE: I guess I would define
an entrepreneur as

00:07:18.684 --> 00:07:24.244
someone who goes about creating
a new venture that

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:28.640
often involves a greater than
average amount of risk.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:43.040
PROFESSOR: So if I am someone
who works for Toyota and

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.250
designs a slightly different
car, am I an entrepreneur?

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.922
AUDIENCE: I would say not.

00:07:47.922 --> 00:07:49.360
PROFESSOR: Why not?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.350
It's risk.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.590
I could fail.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.970
I would look really, really
stupid to my bosses.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.425
AUDIENCE: But it creates
a new venture.

00:07:57.425 --> 00:08:00.200
I mean, right there, you're
developing a product inside.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.870
PROFESSOR: New venture?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.750
So it has to be a new,
separate company.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.780
Is that the definition?

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.260
AUDIENCE: No, but I'd say a
venture not a design, right?

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.300
PROFESSOR: But I haven't
got what that means.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.780
AUDIENCE: Like a venture in
the sense that it doesn't

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.400
necessarily have to be entirely
its own company, but

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.740
it's more than just a design.

00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:24.292
In the sense of a design, but
then you're not taking into

00:08:24.292 --> 00:08:26.377
account the other things that
would actually go into making

00:08:26.377 --> 00:08:27.640
it a car and then
selling that.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.102
Like let's say Toyota decides
to launch a new line, where

00:08:31.102 --> 00:08:33.559
they're going to do a new
dealership agreement, new

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.229
factory, all that, then that
would be a new venture.

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:38.568
If I was running that, then I
could be classified, under my

00:08:38.568 --> 00:08:39.530
definition, as an
entrepreneur.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:39.990
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.280
So you would--

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.440
OK, go ahead.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.713
No, you should go ahead.

00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:49.164
AUDIENCE: I think the term, that
we'd have to go into the

00:08:49.164 --> 00:08:50.150
definition.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.360
Besides just creating a new
venture, it would be create a

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.600
new venture that is, somehow,
innovative and

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.470
unique in it's own.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.830
So I think, whether not,
necessarily, the business idea

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.950
or the business strategy of the
product, but maybe even in

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.028
how the person operates the
company, they can be

00:09:12.028 --> 00:09:13.330
entrepreneurs in that way.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.905
PROFESSOR: So you don't think
that if I have a set of taxis

00:09:17.905 --> 00:09:19.155
I'm an entrepreneur?

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.070
I just bought a set of taxis.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.616
I rent them out.

00:09:27.616 --> 00:09:32.382
AUDIENCE: I would imagine if you
were the person who took

00:09:32.382 --> 00:09:34.120
the initiative to--

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.560
PROFESSOR: But this was after
there had been 500,000 taxi

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.760
companies in the world.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.400
If I go tomorrow, quit my job,
and I start a taxi company, I

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.030
would not be an entrepreneur?

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.157
AUDIENCE: Well, to some
degree, you could

00:09:47.157 --> 00:09:48.766
that's still unique.

00:09:48.766 --> 00:09:50.694
You're starting a taxi company,
in a particular city,

00:09:50.694 --> 00:09:52.480
with a particular
set of drivers.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.830
PROFESSOR: But then everything's
unique.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.210
Once I go down that road, I
don's see how anything.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.570
I can't have a taxi company
which has the same set of

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.000
drivers as theirs,
everybody else.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.750
So this is unique
by definition.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.250
Somebody else from
that side, yeah?

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.090
AUDIENCE: I think someone was
actually saying before that

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.840
created a normal
amount of risk.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.680
But it's like the financial
risk, as well, absorbing that

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.036
yourself, as opposed to being
responsible for it underneath

00:10:21.036 --> 00:10:21.530
an organization.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:21.840
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.690
I think that's actually one
key piece of what I would

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.080
consider the definition.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.110
The fact that you a lot
of the risk comes

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.620
from raising capital.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.580
The risk is a significant
part of the reason why.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.560
If I work for Toyota
there would not be.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.460
It could be career
risk for me.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.000
But it would not be risk that
is driven by my having to

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.900
raise capital.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:52.250
So I think you're making one of
the key points, which is, I

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.640
think, exactly as you said.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.780
Risk is a big piece of it.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.990
The next piece of it
is the risk comes

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.100
from raising capital.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.920
I would not say that it has to
be a new product, because I

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.820
think that's too narrow
a definition.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.790
I mean you could define it.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.830
But I think that would mean no
poor people are, essentially,

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.240
entrepreneurs.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.540
But I think raising capital,
the financing side of it.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.490
So do you take the risk?

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:25.440
And a lot of the risk comes from
owning the asset that's

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.100
generating the output.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.790
That, I think, is a key part
of being an entrepreneur.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.600
The risk comes from putting
money or your own

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.910
assets on the line.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.250
It's not just that you're
putting your career or your

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.930
name on the line.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.310
When I write a book, I also
take a risk in that sense.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.880
People could say, my god,
what a stupid book.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.590
That's a risk, but I wouldn't
call myself an entrepreneur.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.820
So I think that I want to
emphasize that I think the

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.540
poor are entrepreneurial.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.570
When we talk about somebody who
is an entrepreneur, I'm

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:06.330
going to emphasize the fact that
they bear a lot of the

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:12.100
risk, from production, and that
risk is closely tied to

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.000
the ownership of the asset.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.540
So it is that they have to
finance the asset and hold on

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.240
to the risk generated
by that asset.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.490
So they could be a farmer.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.100
They must have to own
the land and then

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.746
take the farming risk.

00:12:31.746 --> 00:12:33.204
Yeah?

00:12:33.204 --> 00:12:35.342
AUDIENCE: But in the US, don't
a lot of the people, who we

00:12:35.342 --> 00:12:38.220
think of as entrepreneurs, they
get venture capital or

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.510
somebody else to take on
the financial risk.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.818
AUDIENCE: But it kind of defers
the financial risk.

00:12:42.818 --> 00:12:45.750
They're still taking on
financial risk of their own.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.780
PROFESSOR: But first, I think,
nobody gets 100% venture

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.030
capital funding.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.730
Even to get to the venture
capital stage, you typically

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.720
spend a fair amount of money.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.550
And nobody gets 100%
funding even then.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:07.730
And second, in some ways, you
still take financial risk, in

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:14.730
the sense that the upside on
the venture capital is

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.830
precisely your earnings
in the future.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.300
So you, basically, dock
your earnings.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.730
You are an owner.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.930
You have arranged a particular
form of financing, which says

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.520
that I don't make any payments
for the time

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.090
being, on this financing.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.960
But it's exactly like any
other form of financing.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.610
I have an obligation
to pay you.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.870
That obligation, in venture
capital, is

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.360
maybe in five years.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.390
If the company goes public,
then I will

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.680
pay you $100 million.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.230
That's a venture capital
contract.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:54.520
It's still, basically,
a sharing of risk.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.320
And I'm taking ownership
of the asset.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.124
It's just a different
contract.

00:14:02.124 --> 00:14:02.598
Yeah.

00:14:02.598 --> 00:14:04.731
AUDIENCE: It's also the
opportunity cost of actually

00:14:04.731 --> 00:14:07.575
putting all of your energy into
this venture to see it

00:14:07.575 --> 00:14:10.040
come to fruition, like all the
earnings that you could have

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.230
earned in that time working
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.290
PROFESSOR: But that's a bit
like I could have spent my

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.500
time consulting or I
could write a book.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.000
I mean that's not
that different.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.790
I think the key is that my
earnings are significantly

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.678
connected to the outcome
of the project.

00:14:30.678 --> 00:14:33.486
I was just adding to the cost of
what of entrepreneur takes

00:14:33.486 --> 00:14:34.890
on [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.070
AUDIENCE: I mean, if you wrote
a book that sold 10 million

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.018
copies or something, then your
future earnings would be

00:14:41.018 --> 00:14:42.300
significantly.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but mostly, I
think the first order risk,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.050
sadly, for me is that people
will just think I'm stupid.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.020
I think the risk, in my case.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.750
You could imagine everybody has
a small chance of being an

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.050
entrepreneur, but I think that
mostly, most of my risk has

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.180
something to do with my ability
to convince other

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.100
people that I have not lost my
marbles and very little of my

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.690
risk comes from money.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but at the same
time, there's some people

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.020
who are like full-time
authors.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.190
And they take out loans.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:15.985
And they write this book.

00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:17.570
PROFESSOR: Oh, they are
entrepreneurial.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.600
I'm not saying they are
not entrepreneurs.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.770
I think I am not an
entrepreneur, to first

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.100
approximation, because my risk
is mostly reputational risk,

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.970
very little of it is
financial risk.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.650
AUDIENCE: Even though you're
sort of doing a similar thing?

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.790
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.790
My lifetime earnings are,
essentially, with a 99%

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.350
probability, are unaffected by
this decision, or almost

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.600
unaffected.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.780
So who is and isn't
an entrepreneur?

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.090
So we've sort of been
talking about that.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.780
I'm not, but who is?

00:15:53.780 --> 00:16:02.660
So clearly, Larry Page and
Sergey Brin are entrepreneurs.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.980
Now let's take something
less obvious.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.790
What are other forms of
entrepreneurship, like in the

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:16.860
US, less obvious ones then
starting a software company?

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.660
AUDIENCE: I mean someone who
owns and rents a foodtruck.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.540
So

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.200
PROFESSOR: That's an
entrepreneur, sure.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.730
AUDIENCE: Someone who
starts a laundromat.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.980
PROFESSOR: That's
an entrepreneur.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.870
AUDIENCE: So I kind of disagree
with the fact that

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.665
you've got to have some
sort of earnings

00:16:32.665 --> 00:16:35.660
attached to your venture.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.385
I think if somebody starts a
business that focused on

00:16:39.385 --> 00:16:42.710
community service but is very
unique, entrepreneurial, I

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.050
think that is still.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.712
If it is innovative in some way,
I still think it should

00:16:47.712 --> 00:16:49.280
be considered as
entrepreneurship.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.900
PROFESSOR: I think they say,
sometimes, somebody is a

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.190
political entrepreneur.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.470
But I think that gets the term
to be a little bit too hard to

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:03.180
understand.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.849
I mean, I think you could make
the case that you're making.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.280
I'm going to sort of resist
that a little bit.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.030
Because I think, then,
I don't know what

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.359
the limits are anymore.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.079
Who's not a political
entrepreneur?

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:19.410
If I go and claim that President
Obama was born in

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.180
Kenya, am I a political
entrepreneur or not?

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.700
Is that entrepreneurial?

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.050
Yes, it's entrepreneurial.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.300
It's innovative.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:36.575
I feel like that's making
it too easy.

00:17:36.575 --> 00:17:39.950
AUDIENCE: So were the people
collecting sand entrepreneurs?

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.200
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.800
They owned this enterprise.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.880
Their entire earnings
was subject to that.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.900
They had financed whatever
needed to be financed.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.940
They had paid for the
plastic bucket.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.790
They collected the
sand, the spade.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:10.370
They had paid the bus fare to
get from the beach to the

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:12.540
Bombay stock exchange.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.650
They had done all
of the financial

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.820
investment that was involved.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.640
It just happens to a small
amount of money.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.560
But that doesn't mean that
they hadn't done--

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.120
they had put in 100% of
the capital in there.

00:18:25.365 --> 00:18:29.260
But another example, just to
not get too stuck on it.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.240
Lawyers, for example, most
lawyers are, effectively,

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.030
entrepreneurs.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:42.040
Because most lawyers actually
have a two-person,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.470
three-person partnership.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.650
They're bearing a lot of risk.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.000
They pay for the staff.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.020
They pay for the office.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:52.440
They pay for the whatever,
the furniture.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.160
And so, in that sense, they
would, under this definition,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.435
also count.

00:18:57.435 --> 00:18:59.682
AUDIENCE: I was going to say
you could also say that for

00:18:59.682 --> 00:19:00.630
doctors as well.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.430
PROFESSOR: Doctors the same,
a lot of doctors.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:08.690
I think that's relevant, because
the typical way--

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.610
there's no measurement of
entrepreneurship in the data.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.380
Because nobody knows who's an
entrepreneur, for the same

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.540
reason as we were having
trouble with it.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.840
What is measured in the data
is whether you describe

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.240
yourself as self-employed.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.220
That's described in the data.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.520
So if you look at most
countries, one of the

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.890
employment categories
is self-employed.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.320
And that number, which includes
lawyers, doctors,

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.880
consultants, many other such
people, and not just

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.060
laundromat owners and Google
owners, but lots of other

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.430
people, that category turns
out to be about 12% of the

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.160
population.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.620
So 12% of the population,
under a very generous

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.450
definition of entrepreneur,
which is self-employed, are

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.540
entrepreneurs.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.530
That's for the OECD.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.390
The OECD is like all the rich
countries in the world.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.870
In the rich countries, roughly
12% of the population would

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.070
call themselves self-employed.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.100
That number is much
higher among the

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.720
poor in poor countries.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.970
And I'm going to show
you some numbers.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.120
So here's some numbers.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:29.770
So self-employed in agriculture,
rural population,

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:34.310
you can see that, in many
countries, over 75 to even

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:39.840
100%, nearly, are self-employed
in agriculture.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:46.470
Take Panama or Pakistan, like
70% of these people are

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.830
self-employed in agriculture.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:54.940
Meaning that they, basically,
exactly using the equivalent

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.180
definition to the one that's
used in the OECD, which is

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.480
that they describe themselves
as self-employed.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.980
Meaning that, typically, they
are putting up the capital,

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.630
usually the land and the inputs,
and they're getting

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:08.270
the returns.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.660
So they are risk taking.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:17.740
And they're betting a lot of
risk, and they own the assets

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.210
that are generating that risk.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.225
So that's a number
that's high.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.050
As you will see, that number
is, in a sense, an

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.490
underestimate of how
many people are

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.910
self-employed overall.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:37.250
So this is just in
agriculture.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.020
This is how many people who
have somebody who's

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.960
self-employed in
non-agricultural work.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.290
In Brazil, rural Brazil,
60-something-percent are

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.530
self-employed in
non-agricultural work.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.285
So who are these people?

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:09.520
They're like somebody who
provides any services, a

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:16.615
barber, carpenters, somebody
who builds, a bricklayer.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.670
Instead of a working as a part
of a company, most of these

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.130
people just work as
single-person enterprises.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.380
So bricklayers are
bricklayers.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.530
They have a brick laying
company, which is themselves.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:38.920
And they, typically, will do the
brick laying for somebody.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:52.180
In many ways, this is another.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:58.190
So if you have to take the
fraction of people who are

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:02.440
self-employed, either in
agricultural or not, or

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.320
somebody in their family is
self-employed in either

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.110
agriculture or outside
agriculture, that's and even

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.020
higher fraction.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:18.050
That's like 70% of most poor
people have somebody in the

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.660
family who is self-employed.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.540
So this is a combination of
these two sets of numbers.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.010
And some of them are both.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.310
Some of them have one family
member who is self-employed in

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.105
agriculture, one family member
who is self-employed outside

00:23:32.105 --> 00:23:33.020
agriculture.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.270
But even if you take
the average, it's

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:36.180
quite a high number.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:41.660
So most poor people, in our
definition, are at least

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.910
self-employed.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.030
Well, why is this?

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:49.250
Yeah?

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.166
AUDIENCE: What would we consider
sharecroppers, who

00:23:51.166 --> 00:23:54.040
have to bear a lot
of the risk?

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.920
PROFESSOR: I think, here, they
are considered self-employed.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.595
But that's a good question.

00:23:59.595 --> 00:24:05.205
I don't know the answer to
whether they should be or not.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.040
So why should we think
there is anything

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.290
interesting about this?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.850
Why would it be at all
surprising if a lot of poor

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.350
people were entrepreneurs?

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.440
Why would it be even worth
commenting on?

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.440
AUDIENCE: I don't understand
the question?

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.180
PROFESSOR: I said that 12% of
the people in rich countries

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:43.785
are entrepreneurs.

00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:49.072
Maybe 70% of the poor, in poor
countries, are entrepreneurs.

00:24:49.072 --> 00:24:52.390
Is that something that
has anything

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.880
interesting about that fact?

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.080
And there I want to get you
to these two questions.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.110
Is it the case that the poor
have specific advantages being

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.300
an entrepreneur?

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.690
Do they have specific
disadvantages in being

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:06.636
entrepreneurs?

00:25:06.636 --> 00:25:08.810
So let's start with
the disadvantages.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.336
Is that clear?

00:25:11.336 --> 00:25:14.689
AUDIENCE: The risk is higher,
because the overall capital

00:25:14.689 --> 00:25:18.910
they have is less.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.880
PROFESSOR: So risk is at least
relatively higher, because

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.800
they have--

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.660
I don't know where this came
from, but I kind of know where

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.910
it should go.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.890
So one thing that's
clear is that

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.140
entrepreneurship is risky.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:50.210
If you're at the margin of not
having enough money for

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.480
something really essential,
then the same

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.120
risk hurts you more.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.120
Because you're really
in danger of

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.140
something awful happening.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.040
Like you couldn't pay for your
mother's hospital stay if your

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.870
business collapses.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.640
So the risk is much
more important.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.600
We talked about this
some few weeks ago.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.280
Other reasons, other
disadvantages?

00:26:26.315 --> 00:26:28.740
AUDIENCE: It's harder
to raise capital.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.100
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.330
It's harder to raise capital.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:35.330
If you don't have a bank
account, if you don't have

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:39.690
assets that you can pledge, if
you don't have contact among

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.840
financials, it's harder to
raise capital, surely.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.010
Yeah?

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.950
AUDIENCE: You have to rely on
your business more, because

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.073
it's harder for you to get a
steady paying job at some

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:50.850
other company.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.810
PROFESSOR: Is that a
disadvantage or an advantage?

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.260
AUDIENCE: I think it's a
disadvantage, because then you

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.200
bear a lot of the risk
of the business.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:58.710
PROFESSOR: I see.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.100
So you may not have skills
that you would get you an

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.925
alternative job, so if your
business fails, then it

00:27:05.925 --> 00:27:07.175
really hurts you.

00:27:07.175 --> 00:27:08.510
I see.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.888
Yeah.

00:27:09.888 --> 00:27:11.864
AUDIENCE: Particularly, if
you're really poor, in a rural

00:27:11.864 --> 00:27:15.850
area or a slum, it's really
hard to get the resources.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.672
I mean, I feel like in America
today, we have a whole lot of

00:27:18.672 --> 00:27:20.332
resources to encourage
entrepreneurship and help

00:27:20.332 --> 00:27:20.830
entrepreneurs.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.822
I would imagine, based on what
I've read, that that really

00:27:22.822 --> 00:27:24.820
doesn't exist.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.830
PROFESSOR: So you may not have
the know-how to be an

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:29.300
entrepreneur.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.490
You may not know what market
opportunities are available,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.910
because you're not that well
connected to the media.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:40.370
You may not know, even, what the
best prices are for what

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.350
you will buy and the best prices
are for what you will

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.340
sell, where to sell, all the
information that you need.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.050
Presumably, that's correlated
with being educated.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.780
And so if you are poor in a
poor country, you are less

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:58.855
likely to have all
that information.

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:09.336
AUDIENCE: This is something
that applies to all

00:28:09.336 --> 00:28:10.569
entreprenuers.

00:28:10.569 --> 00:28:15.030
But I think it would affect the
poor more, specifically.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.790
I was thinking about the
benefits you get from working

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.960
for a corporation.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.545
Sometimes you get health
care, things like that.

00:28:23.545 --> 00:28:26.697
And so being an entrepreneur
is like taking a risk with

00:28:26.697 --> 00:28:27.425
respect to that.

00:28:27.425 --> 00:28:30.335
And then for the poor, depending
on where they live,

00:28:30.335 --> 00:28:33.245
or what atmosphere is around,
it might disproportionately

00:28:33.245 --> 00:28:35.200
affect them.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's also
possible that there's some

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.710
additional benefits to
having a steady job.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.380
That's particularly important
if you have no

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.750
other source of support.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:49.975
Yeah?

00:28:49.975 --> 00:28:52.320
AUDIENCE: On the advantages
side, couldn't you say--

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.360
PROFESSOR: Let's do
the disadvantages.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.690
Hold that.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.570
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't your
income not be regular.

00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.920
It would be really uncertain.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:05.002
So that's related to, I think,
the first point that was made.

00:29:14.388 --> 00:29:15.460
AUDIENCE: Chances are,
you're not going to

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.475
have an original idea.

00:29:16.475 --> 00:29:19.670
You're going to be copying what
other people are doing.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:20.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.414
But why would it be less true
of the poor than the rich.

00:29:23.414 --> 00:29:25.406
AUDIENCE: The rich might have
access to educational

00:29:25.406 --> 00:29:29.390
resources that will allow them
to come up with better ideas.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.382
AUDIENCE: You could also make
the converse argument that

00:29:31.382 --> 00:29:33.124
since the rich have access to
more stuff, they're more

00:29:33.124 --> 00:29:35.366
likely to copy other ideas.

00:29:35.366 --> 00:29:35.864
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:29:35.864 --> 00:29:38.105
AUDIENCE: But that would also
mean they might not be as

00:29:38.105 --> 00:29:39.848
likely to make a lot of money.

00:29:39.848 --> 00:29:42.338
So those would be the bad,
rich entrepreneurs.

00:29:42.338 --> 00:29:43.334
AUDIENCE: Not necessarily.

00:29:43.334 --> 00:29:46.322
Microsoft copied Apple's
architecture [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:46.322 --> 00:29:47.572
AUDIENCE: Well, that's
a different story.

00:30:00.764 --> 00:30:03.752
AUDIENCE: I mean this was
already said before.

00:30:03.752 --> 00:30:07.479
But just thinking about like,
if you're poor, you're going

00:30:07.479 --> 00:30:08.694
to have to use--

00:30:08.694 --> 00:30:12.217
an entrepreneur, let's say you
had some savings or you had

00:30:12.217 --> 00:30:13.068
family that was helping
support you.

00:30:13.068 --> 00:30:15.984
You have support system that has
some sort of capital, even

00:30:15.984 --> 00:30:16.956
if it's not that much.

00:30:16.956 --> 00:30:20.034
But when you're poor, you have
to use everything that you

00:30:20.034 --> 00:30:21.330
have to put into
that business.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:25.370
And that takes away from just
living, even things like that.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:35.060
PROFESSOR: So the risk is
higher, and your ability to

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.310
self-finance is lower.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.290
Anything else?

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:19.720
Yeah?

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.316
AUDIENCE: You could say, if
other people copied your idea,

00:31:22.316 --> 00:31:25.384
it would hurt you more, because
then they'd just

00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:28.230
increase the supply and decrease
your overall--

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.570
PROFESSOR: But why would
it be any different

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:32.790
from anybody else?

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:36.620
If I'm rich and you copy my
idea, that still hurts me.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:41.630
It is not clear, especially in
the sense if the poor use

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.330
ideas that are particularly--

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.210
they've already copied
from somebody.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.508
They're less hurt by copying.

00:31:48.508 --> 00:31:50.002
Yeah?

00:31:50.002 --> 00:31:53.488
AUDIENCE: Perhaps, if you
think about the social

00:31:53.488 --> 00:31:58.257
infrastructure, people are
more able to copy ideas,

00:31:58.257 --> 00:32:02.249
because of the lack of legal
support or an ability to check

00:32:02.249 --> 00:32:04.930
or to enforce that people are
not copying your ideas.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.960
PROFESSOR: Right, so you might
thing that they have less

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.360
access to lawyers
and things like.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.560
They may not understand
the law well.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.820
So they may not be able to use
the legal system to protect

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.210
themselves as effectively.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:30.520
What's another thing that helps
an entrepreneurs other

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.560
than money and ideas?

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.683
What's the third thing that?

00:32:36.683 --> 00:32:39.138
AUDIENCE: Sort of broadly
speaking, a social safety net.

00:32:39.138 --> 00:32:42.450
In the sense that, let's say,
in American, you're

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.287
entrepreneur and you absolutely
fail, there's still

00:32:44.287 --> 00:32:48.787
a social safety net that you
could at least rely upon.

00:32:48.787 --> 00:32:51.210
And that doesn't
exist in poor--

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:51.610
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.235
That's true of poor countries,
but not necessarily more of

00:32:55.235 --> 00:32:56.485
poor people.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.250
That's a point about
poor countries,

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.920
less about poor people.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.520
One other thing that I think
matters a lot is contacts.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:15.850
I think that, if you know
somebody, if your uncle is the

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:18.200
CEO of a company, they
may be more willing

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.550
to give you a try.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:24.770
If you're starting up, you're
making widgets, somebody has

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:25.910
to buy them.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.850
It's much easier if you know
somebody than if you don't.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.710
I mean, why would anybody
trust you?

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:35.110
So you often get your first
breaks by having some

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.980
connection to somebody else,
who will do the buying.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.290
And I think that's a very big
piece of what makes it very

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.790
difficult for the poor to be
effective entrepreneurs is

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.290
that they actually don't
know anybody.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.620
And so it's much harder
for them to

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.770
break in with a products.

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:54.380
So I think contacts are a
very big piece of it.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:34:01.380
The other part of it is that it
might be that, in order to

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.790
be in business, for example--

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.870
take the venture capital
example.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:12.440
Typically, the way a lot of
start-ups work is that you

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.050
know that you're going to
lose money for a while.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:17.929
Because you have to build
a reputation.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.230
And the way you build a
reputation is by going to

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:24.540
someone and saying, look, you're
buying from him for $5.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.159
I'll sell it to you for $3.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:31.310
And you know you lose money at
$3, but you're willing to lose

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:34.980
money for a while, because that
way he'll see that you're

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.360
really good at doing it.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.889
And then, maybe, you could
charge $4 and get the market.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:44.270
So a lot of way new businesses
start is by actually

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.190
undercutting other businesses
and losing money.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.560
So if you can't lose money,
effectively--

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.699
so if you're poor and you can't
afford to lose money,

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:56.570
it's often very difficult
to enter a new product.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:01.450
Because part of the way you
enter the new product is by

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.890
actually selling
it very cheap.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:08.870
And it's very difficult to
sell it very cheap if you

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:11.590
can't afford to lose money.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.720
So those are all the
disadvantages.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.100
Are there advantages?

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.560
So I don't know how many of you
know, but there's a very

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.785
famous book called The Fortune
at the Bottom of the Pyramid.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.740
If you've read that book, it
makes the case that there's

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.500
actually lots of entrepreneurial
opportunities

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.030
for the poor.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.680
And that, in some sense, they
might have an advantage.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.060
What are potential advantages?

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.001
Yeah?

00:35:44.001 --> 00:35:46.210
AUDIENCE: Because you have
access to a unique market that

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.174
the rich don't even know
about, like the

00:35:48.174 --> 00:35:51.790
women who sell sand.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:53.930
PROFESSOR: So they might know
about things which are

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:54.970
underserved.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:58.480
So maybe the way capitalism has
developed, it's better at

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.740
serving the demands of
the middle classes.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.060
The poor might demand certain
products which are not

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.190
supplied by the market.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:11.890
So at this point, it might be
easier to find a new product

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.520
to supply if you know
what the poor want .

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.260
That's one of the cases
that's being made.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.850
We'll see to what extent
that's true.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.120
Any others?

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.783
You were going to mention
something?

00:36:41.629 --> 00:36:43.847
AUDIENCE: Maybe it's easier to
make use of some resources

00:36:43.847 --> 00:36:46.805
than it would be if you were a
richer person trying to start

00:36:46.805 --> 00:36:47.545
a [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:47.545 --> 00:36:51.242
Like, for example, the women
with the sand, they can go to

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:53.461
the beach and dig up some
sand and carry it away.

00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:54.940
No one's going to say
anything to them.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.569
But if someone was trying to do
this on larger scale, then

00:36:57.569 --> 00:36:58.400
there would be issues.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.080
PROFESSOR: That's
exactly right.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:07.860
So it may well be that, if I'm
the person who comes and--

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.950
imagine that I'm rich.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:20.650
Let's say, I can either take
a job or I can be an

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:21.540
entrepreneur.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.430
To compensate me for my job, I
would need to be able to do

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:28.900
the business at a particular
scale.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.520
Imagine I'm in the business of
sorting through garbage and

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.900
finding things which
are sellable.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:44.360
Just doing that, physically, if
I started to use that much

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.010
garbage, I'll need
a lot of space.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:50.530
Whereas a poor person may be
able to cover her daily wage,

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:54.810
which is very low, by just
sorting through the garbage

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.970
she finds in the neighborhood
or something.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:02.940
Another advantage of being poor
might be that you may be

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:09.880
less considered or less easily
monitored, so you may be able

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.030
to bend the rules more
effectively.

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:18.590
So you might be able to make
products, which somebody else

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.110
would not want to do, because
it would too easy to

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.470
scrutinize.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.870
So you may be involved in--

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.350
I'm not saying illegal products,
but you might use

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:34.330
techniques which are possibly
less hygienic or something.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:43.570
So if I setup a big factory
dyeing garments, that pollutes

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:44.570
the water supply.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:46.440
And the city will
shut me down.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.840
If I have a very small operation
inside my house,

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.370
dyeing garments, nobody
will notice.

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:56.570
And I could use the city's water
supply and pollute it.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:58.790
This doesn't mean that I'm
doing a good thing.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:01.390
But it means that it might
be easier for me to be an

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:06.080
entrepreneur, the producing
and dyeing garments than

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.470
somebody who's richer than me.

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:11.870
So there's some potential
advantages.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:15.490
Still, I think my sense is that
everybody would think

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:18.720
that, basically, it's easier
for the rich to be

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.620
entrepreneurs than the poor.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.560
So that's on balance.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.390
And we'll look at this
a little bit, in

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:27.200
the data, in a bit.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.450
So then why are the poor
entrepreneurs?

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:31.220
That's the question
that comes back.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:34.860
If we say it's easier for the
rich to be entrepreneurs, but

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.350
the rich are less likely to be
entrepreneurs than the poor,

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:39.950
then we have a kind
of a puzzle.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:41.480
Why are the poor
entrepreneurs?

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.350
What is it that?

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:48.920
So one view of this is sort
of Muhammad Yunus's view.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.040
Muhammad Yunus is the guy who
started Grameen Bank.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.990
And he's on record saying that
the poor are natural born

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.450
entrepreneurs.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:58.820
So there's one view, which is
to say that something about

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:04.380
the poor, which, by being
poor, they learn to be

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.500
entrepreneurial.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.250
They can't really survive on
anything else, so they become

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.720
like these women we were talking
about. they become

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.720
very clever at finding
opportunities.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.560
They are natural
entrepreneurs.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.910
That's one way to think about it
is that, when you are poor,

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:21.920
you're just better at thinking
about opportunities.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:29.720
Now, one way we can kind of
address this is by looking at

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.370
the businesses of the poor.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:32.830
What do you know about
these businesses?

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.770
So these are people who
are under $1 a day.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:50.550
And if you take the business of
people, who live under $1 a

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:56.650
day, I think the striking fact
is that, in most countries for

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:06.010
which we have data, let's say,
10%, so the average number of

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:11.750
employees in a business
is 0.15.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:14.150
It's one in seven businesses
have an

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:18.180
employee, a paid employee.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.420
They took two countries where
it's different, but even in

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.260
those countries, they don't
have one employee.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.260
They have 0.6 employees.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.120
So these are very small
businesses.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.310
The first thing to note is that
the businesses of the

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:35.115
poor are kind of very, very
small businesses.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:50.020
This includes your unpaid
employees, which is like your

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.040
son or your wife or
you, yourself.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:42:00.450
And that number is
just over one.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:05.500
So the average number of
employees is just over one,

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:12.050
meaning that it's you plus
somebody who works, maybe,

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:13.010
part of the time.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:20.840
Or alternatively, it's you and
no one or you plus one person,

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.500
but not much more than that,
so very few employees.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:30.102
Second, what fraction of the
businesses own a vehicle?

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:38.190
Just to measure some other
measure of the size of the

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.710
business, it's only a vehicle.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.150
And Pakistan is the
one country where

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.645
many people own cycles.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.780
They might be delivering stuff,
but then, all the other

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:54.220
countries, it's really,
really small, like 5%.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.510
If you look at an even more
obvious question, what

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.910
fraction own machines,
any machine?

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.810
The answer is not
100% even there.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:18.100
60% in the Ivory Coast
own any machine.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:21.010
What's the average machine
that they own?

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:35.996
They own a weighing scale or
sort of a piece of metal for

00:43:35.996 --> 00:43:38.980
digging something, but
no more than that.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:43.590
So it's really like these
businesses have no assets

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:44.560
whatsoever.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.900
So the first point about the
businesses of the poor, they

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.440
are very small, by all
of these measures.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.880
They have no employees, no
machines, no vehicles.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:10.630
The second, related point, I
wanted to make is that the

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.270
fact that they don't have any
machines is telling you

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.870
something quite important, which
is that these are not

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:19.050
very sophisticated businesses.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:20.470
You're not surprised
to hear that.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:24.830
But it is very, very clear that
the average business has

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.820
very little skill involved.

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:34.330
And to be honest, there's
not a lot of diversity.

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:39.820
If we look at the top five
businesses, they are things

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:47.140
like tailoring, a small corner
store, selling snacks on the

00:44:47.140 --> 00:45:01.570
street, embroidering or
stitching clothes and selling

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:07.500
them as a retail sale, not a
tailor, but someone who retail

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.410
sells garments.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.375
And I think the last one is--

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:17.230
I forget-- carpentry, I think.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.980
It's like none of these
businesses, except, I think,

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.790
carpentry, possibly, require
huge amounts of skill.

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:28.040
So they tend to be very low
skilled businesses.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.220
And this is most businesses.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:33.730
So these are not people
who are creating

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.760
very original ideas.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.520
Indeed, the usual problem that
people write about is most

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.710
people, in the same
neighborhood,

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:44.550
have the same business.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.870
They're also selling snacks.

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:49.640
They're all delivering loads.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.430
They're all tailors, rather
than a lot of innovation.

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:57.650
There's no evidence that they're
very creative in what

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:58.900
business they go into.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:06.020
On the other hand, many, many
people own multiple

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.270
businesses.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.470
That's the other very,
very common fact.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:21.950
This is the fraction of
people who get incomes

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.710
from multiple sectors.

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:29.080
So that's like somebody who was
has farming business but

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:35.840
also has income from, let's say,
he does some bricklaying

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.150
on the side.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:41.320
That's somebody who has
multiple sources.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:46.020
And the striking fact
is how common it is.

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:51.150
In most countries, it's close to
50% of the population have

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:52.770
income from multiple sources.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:58.190
So in other words, they're not
putting all their time,

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:00.105
available time, into
their own business.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.220
Why would they not do that?

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.600
If you have a business, in
your family, why aren't

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.250
putting all of your
effort into it?

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:21.060
Why would we observe this fact,
that most people, many

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.730
people, have multiple business
or multiple occupations?

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:27.055
AUDIENCE: It might be
comparable, then, to

00:47:27.055 --> 00:47:28.305
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:30.775 --> 00:47:31.240
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.810
So, for example, you might
be only able to

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.480
sell one kind of snack.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:43.540
And people might want snacks
only, maybe, in

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.060
the evening or something.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.770
In the morning, you
go to work.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.250
There's no demand for snacks.

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:54.090
Or you might sell breakfast,
and you can only sell

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:56.820
breakfast till 10:00 AM.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.780
After that, breakfast is over.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.310
And so you have to find
something to do.

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.060
So one thing could be there's a
natural capacity constraint.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.480
There's not much demand
for the product.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.300
And so you can do it for two
hours a day but not for eight

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.163
hours a day.

00:48:10.163 --> 00:48:10.604
Yeah?

00:48:10.604 --> 00:48:12.060
AUDIENCE: There might be
seasonal variations.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.590
You might be able to a certain
type of business only during

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.130
certain times of the
year, [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:17.850
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:20.990
So agriculture is one classic
business, where you can work a

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.430
few months of the year, but the
then the rest of the time,

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:24.100
you don't have irrigation.

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.490
There's nothing to do.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:26.740
So you work on something else.

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:36.880
Yeah?

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.310
AUDIENCE: You might diversify
your portfolio as part of

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:40.770
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:41.130
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:45.110
So you may bear less risk by
having multiple businesses.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:46.066
Yeah?

00:48:46.066 --> 00:48:48.934
AUDIENCE: It might be the return
for business is so low,

00:48:48.934 --> 00:48:52.997
that even if you invested more
time and energy into it, it

00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:54.210
wouldn't be worth it.

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:55.470
PROFESSOR: But why don't you
take the one which is the

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:58.876
highest return and put all
your time into it?

00:48:58.876 --> 00:49:00.810
AUDIENCE: Maybe I don't
want to [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:01.400
PROFESSOR: Why?

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.694
AUDIENCE: Because even if that
was the highest return,

00:49:03.694 --> 00:49:06.580
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.560
PROFESSOR: But why would you
ever start a second, even

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.770
lower return business?

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.390
If there's one business that
has the highest return, why

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:16.025
won't you put all your eggs
into that basket?

00:49:16.025 --> 00:49:17.300
AUDIENCE: Diversity.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that's what
she said, which is that

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.130
want to diversify risk.

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.195
What other reason could
you imagine?

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.317
AUDIENCE: It could also be
that you might have one

00:49:27.317 --> 00:49:29.568
business that's really
profitable, let's say, you're

00:49:29.568 --> 00:49:32.120
selling something in the morning
for breakfast, but it

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.984
might be the time--

00:49:33.984 --> 00:49:35.870
PROFESSOR: Right, that's,
I think, also

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:37.120
someone brought up.

00:49:47.582 --> 00:49:49.534
AUDIENCE: I think there are like
some businesses which are

00:49:49.534 --> 00:49:53.390
like needlepoint, which
physically hurt you if you do

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.950
it too much.

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.860
People like become blind.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.652
PROFESSOR: Right, so maybe, just
you don't want to do it

00:49:59.652 --> 00:50:01.480
for too long?

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.858
Another obvious reason.

00:50:04.858 --> 00:50:07.058
AUDIENCE: Didn't they say in the
book that a lot of people

00:50:07.058 --> 00:50:09.196
don't like running their own
businesses, and so they don't

00:50:09.196 --> 00:50:12.580
want to put time into it.

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.142
PROFESSOR: But why would you
do three different ones?

00:50:15.142 --> 00:50:18.090
I'm Asking a simpler question
than the one you're answering,

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:21.290
which is people seem to do
two or three different

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:22.030
occupations.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.110
Why would do two or
three rather than?

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.180
Say I want to work
eight hours.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.810
Why wouldn't I put all
eight hours into one?

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:32.463
We've gone through a bunch
of reasons for that.

00:50:32.463 --> 00:50:38.235
AUDIENCE: Is that the marginal
returns decline, especially

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:40.650
for this type of a business?

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:43.810
PROFESSOR: So it could be that
the marginal returns on the

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:46.360
extra piece of effort is low.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.650
Another possibility that
I think is even more

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:51.610
straightforward.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.160
Maybe some businesses
require capital

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.420
and others less capital.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.180
So you have a certain
amount of capital.

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.290
You put into the capital
intensive business.

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:04.120
And then use still don't
have some time left.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.160
So you work in the other one.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.970
For example, to do needlepoint,
you'll have to

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:10.010
buy fabric first.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:14.120
And you can only afford fabric
that covers half your day.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.990
And you buy fabric for
half your day.

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:17.540
You work half your day
on needlepoint.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.040
The rest of the half of your
day, you have to find

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.580
something else to do.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:24.830
So it may just be that you don't
have enough capital to

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:29.324
make it possible to spend your
whole day working on it.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:38.000
So in any case, we do see this
evidence that people don't

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.090
seem to be excessively
committed

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:42.330
to any single business.

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:48.380
That has the cost, obviously,
that they're not getting a lot

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.513
of benefits from
specialization.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.900
They're not learning or
improving very fast, because

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.310
they're doing many, many
things at the same.

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:14.430
What is striking about this
picture is says, in even rural

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:18.790
households, a lot of them have
a non-agricultural business.

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:22.270
So they'll actually, if you look
at how many people have a

00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:27.960
non-agricultural business, like
about a third of them

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.710
have a non-agricultural
business,

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:30.970
even if they're rural.

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:35.810
So these are people who
live in rural areas.

00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:38.610
They do farming as one of their
businesses, probably.

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:40.730
But they also have a second
business, which is

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:42.090
non-agricultural.

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:43.750
And that's sort of striking.

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:47.750
We think of, often, rural areas
in developing countries

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:51.960
as farmers kind of living
in isolation.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.590
In fact, most of these
people are in a

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:56.010
second business as well.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:05.020
So the next fact about
businesses of the poor is that

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:06.390
these businesses are
very fragile.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:16.010
So if you look at Mexico, in
85% of the people, the poor

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:19.190
didn't have a business
in 2002.

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:21.870
15% had a business.

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:28.680
By 2005, out of those 15%, only
6% still had a business.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:32.880
So 60% of all businesses
just closed.

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.730
So the they're also going
in and out of

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:36.570
business all the time.

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:42.080
On the other hand, many other
people started new businesses.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:45.580
And you look at the fraction
of the people who retained

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.230
their existing labor force.

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.560
They're just 1.8%.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:54.290
So most people either grow their
business or shrink it or

00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:55.280
shut it down.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.260
So businesses are very,
very fragile.

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:04.290
It's not that you set up a
business and it lasts forever.

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:08.590
It's quite a high
risk outcome.

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:15.360
And this is sort of the answer
to the question, do the poor

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.496
feel entrepreneurial?

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.590
And this is a survey we've done
in many countries, now.

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:24.390
We always find the say answer.

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:31.660
You ask people, you have a
child, what occupation do you

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.950
hope for your child to be?

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:35.270
And we ask it two ways.

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.500
One, we ask them, what
occupation do you hope for

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.060
your child?

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.140
Then you might worry if
you ask that question.

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:49.270
They might be conditioning
on their condition.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:51.980
And so they'd look, you know,
my child he'll never be able

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:55.040
to do the right kind of
business, because he doesn't

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.070
have enough money
or something.

00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:01.440
So we asked them, if you won a
lottery and you would invest

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.950
in something, what occupation
would your

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:08.030
child want to be in?

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:09.490
It doesn't make a difference.

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:12.200
They always give you the same
answer, which is that they

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.880
don't want to be in business.

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.530
The answer is very,
very clear.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:21.160
18% want them to be a private
firm employee, 41% to be a

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.220
non-teaching government
job, and 34% to be

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.650
a government teacher.

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:31.140
So that's 93% don't want them
to be an entrepreneur.

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:35.460
So basically, the poor don't
like the idea, at least, of

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.850
their children being
entrepreneurs.

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:47.200
And it's consistent with
everything else we see, which

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.160
is that they don't seem to
invest all their time in a

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.000
single business.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.300
Even if they have a business,
they'll put only a part of

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.550
their time into it.

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:02.100
We saw, earlier, that they don't
try very hard to save

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.420
their way out of debt.

00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:08.405
We saw that when we looked at
the fruit vendors, that they

00:56:08.405 --> 00:56:11.540
were not saving a lot and tried
to get out of debt.

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:16.780
So it seems like they don't seem
to be hugely committed to

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.020
growing their business.

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:19.530
There's no evidence.

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:21.650
And we see the businesses
don't grow.

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:24.220
Many of them shrink
or shut down.

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.060
Very few of them actually
add an employee.

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:31.850
At best, these business
are always small.

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:33.760
They stay small or
they shutdown.

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.290
They rarely grow.

00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:41.660
So there is no evidence that the
poor are actually dynamic

00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:45.230
entrepreneurs, in the sense
that they are looking for

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:47.850
opportunities to grow their
business all the time.

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:50.860
Now, that doesn't mean that
there are not a million

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.120
dynamic entrepreneurs
among the poor.

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.910
One should not confuse the
statement that the average

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:59.100
poor person is not a dynamic
entrepreneur with the

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:02.310
statement that there
are no dynamic

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:03.400
entrepreneurs among the poor.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.080
There may be exactly the same
fraction of dynamic

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.560
entrepreneurs among the poor
as there are among MIT

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.020
students, for all I know.

00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:12.880
It's just most people are
not cut out to dynamic

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.130
entrepreneurs.

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.090
And the poor, maybe, just
like everybody else,

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:21.040
they don't like risk.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.570
They don't like the idea of
worrying about all of the

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:27.270
problems that running
business has.

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:29.450
They like a steady job.

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:32.640
And then a few people really
like being an entrepreneur.

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.040
I don't know that this makes
them any different from

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:35.800
anybody else.

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.780
It just says that they're not.

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:42.600
You see a huge
over-representation of the

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:46.230
poor among entrepreneurs.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:49.430
That doesn't mean that this is
what the poor want to be.

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.200
It's not that they're
entrepreneurial in some

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.340
natural sense.

00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:57.970
They're not that they want
to be an entrepreneur.

00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:01.126
They're an entrepreneur for some
other reason we'll come

00:58:01.126 --> 00:58:02.376
to in a minute.

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:08.810
None of this evidence seems to
suggest that they're dying to

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:13.500
be entrepreneurs and to
grow their businesses.

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.860
That doesn't mean that there
aren't some who are.

00:58:18.982 --> 00:58:24.400
There's this story that you saw
in the microfinance movie

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:29.350
of some woman who started
as hair collector.

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:31.230
Remember this person?

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:33.400
And she's now a hair tycoon.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:39.360
And they exist, people like
that, everywhere in the world.

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:44.540
I'm even willing to believe
that there are as many

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:48.320
genuinely entrepreneurial people
among the poor as there

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.150
are among anybody else.

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:55.400
But that's a very different
sentence from saying that most

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:58.750
poor people have businesses
because they're

00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:00.540
entrepreneurial.

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.990
Because they're so massively
overrepresented.

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:12.450
They're really unlikely people
to be entrepreneurs.

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:14.730
So if they are entrepreneurs,
it's not because

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:17.830
they want to be.

00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:22.270
This is all consistent with the
fact that, if you look at

00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:25.010
these businesses, they're
not really attractive

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:26.390
economically.

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:30.800
So one place where we have
detailed data, we could

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:34.420
actually calculate how much
revenues these businesses were

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:37.910
making, calculate profits.

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:40.120
Now a key part of the
profit calculation--

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:44.790
remember, almost none of these
firms have employees.

00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:50.330
So you have to evaluate the
time spent by the owner in

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:51.500
running the business.

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.130
Somehow, how do you
price that?

00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:56.480
So you price that
at minimum wage.

00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.000
These businesses lose money.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.480
So if I went out and worked at
minimum wage, I would make

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:12.610
more money than if I did this
business and spent all the

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.060
time I'm spending
in the business.

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.540
Now, I'm not necessarily
working as hard in the

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.600
business as I would be working
in other things.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.770
But it isn't the case that
I'm making lots of money.

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:26.500
I think this is a pattern that
people have noticed.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:30.830
Now, here's a puzzle.

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:32.710
I just said they don't
make a lot of money.

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:35.180
They're not very profitable,
these business.

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.640
Before, I've also told
you that they

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.370
pay very high interest.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:43.290
So they must be generating
an extra $1.

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:45.860
They must be generating
at least that much.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.630
So if I'm paying 60% interest,
$1 must be generating more

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:51.030
than $0.60.

01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:54.980
If I'm investing $1 and then
paying 60% interest, that $1

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.810
must be generating
more than $0.60.

01:00:57.810 --> 01:01:02.120
How do those two facts
fit with each other?

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.230
I said, A, they're not
very profitable.

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:16.280
B, the marginal $1 must be
making a high return, because

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.760
otherwise they wouldn't be
investing their marginal $1.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:25.440
You won't borrow money at 60%
unless you can cover 60%.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.181
So we know that they're
making lots of money.

01:01:28.181 --> 01:01:28.642
Yeah?

01:01:28.642 --> 01:01:30.810
AUDIENCE: This talked a
lot about in the book.

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:33.368
But basically, there's two
different types of return.

01:01:33.368 --> 01:01:35.480
One is marginal returns,
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.536
where an extra $1 spent,
what's their return.

01:01:37.536 --> 01:01:39.570
The other's the total return.

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:43.558
For a lot of these businesses,
there is a point, early on,

01:01:43.558 --> 01:01:46.246
with this very high, marginal
return, and then it really

01:01:46.246 --> 01:01:46.694
levels off.

01:01:46.694 --> 01:01:50.415
So that's what you run into,
where it's possible that, if

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:52.234
you have a very small
business, like the

01:01:52.234 --> 01:01:53.226
example in the book.

01:01:53.226 --> 01:01:55.375
Let's say you have a shop, but
you really can't put anything

01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:56.202
on the shelves.

01:01:56.202 --> 01:01:59.674
If you spend an extra $20, you
can actually have some candy

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:01.162
on the shelves, then that
will produce very

01:02:01.162 --> 01:02:02.660
high marginal returns.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.810
But if you spend $300 and have
a lot of inventory, you might

01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:06.690
have to hire another employee.

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:07.898
There's risk of stuff spoiling,

01:02:07.898 --> 01:02:09.890
et cetera, et cetera.

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:11.890
PROFESSOR: So I think that's
absolutely right.

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:15.260
But I was making an even simpler
point, here, which is

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.410
that think of that business.

01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:19.690
The person who set up a shop.

01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:29.030
You invest your time
into the shop.

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:31.430
And you invest the space.

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:33.560
You invest the shelves.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.200
You invest the inventory.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.950
Then you start selling.

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:42.340
So in particular, your time
is a fixed investment.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.860
Because you have now decided
that instead of working

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:48.870
outside, I'm going to
stay in the shop.

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:51.040
So you need to cover.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.210
To become profitable, you need
to cover your own daily wage.

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:59.410
Let's say you make $2 a day.

01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:05.090
Then even if you made a total
of $2 a day by selling, you

01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:07.230
would have just covered
your wage.

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:09.050
Then you recover your
inventory, your

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:11.060
capital cost, et cetera.

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:17.550
So unless you operate at a high
enough scale, you're not

01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:21.360
going to cover your time.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.240
And so one of the problems
is these people are often

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.250
operating at a very
small scale.

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:29.140
So they rarely manage
to cover their cost.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.440
But then why don't these
people just grow their

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.130
businesses?

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:45.360
Maybe if they're not making a
lot of money, because they

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.840
have to cover their fixed cost,
then why not just keep

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.650
investing till you make
a lot of money.

01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:58.330
Your marginal returns are high,
so you could invest more

01:03:58.330 --> 01:03:59.890
and make more money.

01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:03.280
And then the answer is, your
marginal are high, but not

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.820
high for a very wide range.

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:09.090
So they start falling
fast as well.

01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:11.730
So this is the picture
that is in the book.

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:16.610
And it's worth, probably,
understanding that picture.

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:26.390
So that picture, it tells a
story of two technologies.

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:30.540
There's one technology which is
gives you a high return but

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.900
quickly flattens off.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.360
And if that was the only
technology in the world, then

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.630
we would not observe
any large funds.

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:41.170
Because that's a technology
which stops becoming

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:43.700
profitable after a point,
very quickly.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:47.680
But there's another technology,
which starts way

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.330
to the right of that.

01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:53.880
And that technology is only
profitable if you invest.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.320
So what that curve says
is that there is two

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.570
technologies.

01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:03.700
Production from technology two
is lower than production for

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:08.892
technology one until you cross
a particular point.

01:05:08.892 --> 01:05:11.960
So you need to make enough
investment to make that

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.590
profitable.

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:16.640
So you're going to buy a machine
which produces a lot

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.760
of garments.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.630
But if you can't buy the cloth
that goes with the machine,

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.250
there's no point in buying
the machine.

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:26.550
You're going to lose money for
sure, because you have nothing

01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:28.020
to use the machine with.

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.130
Garments need a machine
and they need cloth.

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:34.660
And you have only money for the
machine, then you should

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.960
not buy the machine.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.540
You should buy the machine
only if you can buy the

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.330
machine and buy the cloth.

01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:43.070
So there that are more
profitable technologies and

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.850
less profitable technologies.

01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:48.660
But the disadvantage of the
more profitable technology

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:54.390
turns out to be that you need
to invest enough in them to

01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:55.790
make money.

01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:58.800
So the problem is that the poor
are caught between a kind

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.240
of a rock and a hard place,
which is that they can't

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.980
really get up to the
level at which they

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.470
would make real money.

01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:09.940
Because that technology is just
too expensive for them.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.200
They don't have that
much money.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.940
The technology that they can
access has very fast

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.540
diminishing returns.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.350
So that one also is not
worth growing a lot.

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:24.480
So that's the sense in which
they're between a rock and a

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.130
hard place.

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:28.380
They can't grow the technology
fast enough.

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.540
The one that they have,
they can't grow.

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:33.172
And the one that can grow,
they can't have.

01:06:33.172 --> 01:06:36.610
And that's what this
picture is about.

01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:39.850
If this is what the world looks
like, then the poor are

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:42.960
stuck at a point, like M, and
the rich are stuck at point

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.730
like that second
ball up there.

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:53.940
So the poor are stuck, because
the technology that has growth

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.370
is not available to them.

01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:57.080
And the one that's available
to them does not

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.940
have growth in it.

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:02.080
So there's no point in their
putting a lot of effort into

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.470
growing their technology,
because they're really not

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:06.440
going to make a lot of
money either way.

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:13.950
That would explain why they
don't really want to be

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:18.320
entrepreneurs, because they know
that they're never going

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.770
to get very far in
this process.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:25.770
So then that leaves us with
the last slide, well,

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:28.690
actually, one slide
that suggests that

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:31.880
this picture is right.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:36.020
There was this experiment in Sri
Lanka, where people were

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:42.820
given, randomly, either $250
or $500 for investing.

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.570
And this was just a gift.

01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:47.470
The World Bank, basically, did
this experiment, where it went

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:51.060
to people and said,
here's $250.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.020
These were all small
businessmen.

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:57.050
Use it in your business or
do something with it.

01:07:57.050 --> 01:08:00.570
And some people, they
offered $500.

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:03.140
It's kind of nice experiment
to do, because you can find

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.580
out what's the effect on getting
money on people's

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:08.040
investment.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.880
And strikingly, if you
give $250, you get

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.900
high marginal returns.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.470
So these people who get $250,
they invest $250, and they

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:21.550
make about 60% a year on that.

01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:24.310
So that's pretty good returns.

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:29.990
On the other hand, if you give
them $500, they don't invest

01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:31.840
the second $250.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.960
They just use it for repairing
their home.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.490
So they don't believe that the
second $500 are going to grow

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:40.189
their business that much more.

01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:42.550
They believe that there's
diminishing returns.

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:44.729
That's why they don't
invest it.

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:49.380
So basically, the poor seem to
be acting as if they also

01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:52.939
believe exactly that picture,
that they have high returns on

01:08:52.939 --> 01:08:56.130
the first $250 but not
on the second $250.

01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:57.092
Yeah?

01:08:57.092 --> 01:08:58.342
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:09.344
they just save up enough money
or take a loan out so that you

01:09:09.344 --> 01:09:10.989
can achieve or you can jump
the curve and buy the

01:09:10.989 --> 01:09:11.460
technology.

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.740
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.394
AUDIENCE: So it's like,
technically, giving loans to

01:09:15.394 --> 01:09:19.160
small businesses should work.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.470
PROFESSOR: Well, it depends
on how big the loan is.

01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:26.260
I think the problem is that
the jump is not at $500.

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:29.880
The jump is at $10,000.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.439
So none of the loans they are
being offered allow them to

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:34.140
make that jump.

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.090
That's the problem.

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:37.623
AUDIENCE: And they're
still too small to

01:09:37.623 --> 01:09:38.720
go to a normal bank?

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:48.750
that then brings us to the final
question, which is, if

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.490
this is all not such
a great deal,

01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:51.740
why are they in business?

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.160
Yeah, go ahead.

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:55.935
AUDIENCE: Because
they have to be.

01:09:55.935 --> 01:09:56.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:57.560
One is that they have to be.

01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:02.520
There's a vicious cycle, here.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:07.460
Suppose no one can create a
business that's big enough to

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.895
hire employees.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.390
Then I can never be
an employee in

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:15.660
somebody else's firm.

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:16.620
What else can I do?

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:20.170
I can start my own business,
which can't hire anybody.

01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:24.470
So if nobody is creating
businesses which have

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:29.320
employees, then, in a
sense, I'm stuck.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.140
I can't get a job, because
nobody else is

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.540
creating those jobs.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:36.220
But if nobody else is creating
those jobs, then I can't

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:38.400
really work for anybody else.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.150
But I still have to earn a
living, so I go and find my

01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:45.370
own thing to do.

01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:49.410
So I think the primary reason
why you have a lot of

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:52.470
entrepreneurs is because no
entrepreneur is big enough to

01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:53.710
hire the others.

01:10:53.710 --> 01:10:55.350
So everybody's an
entrepreneur, a

01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:56.640
mini-entrepreneur.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.110
Nobody gets to the scale where
they can hire others.

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.600
And therefore, everybody's
kind of stuck.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:09.310
So if I start a business that
hires 10 people, then that

01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:13.130
stops 9 other people from
being an entrepreneur.

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:14.390
That's one reason.

01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:17.650
A second reason has to
do with flexibility.

01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:20.430
I think a lot of poor
people don't have

01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:22.470
access to social services.

01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:30.850
So if I have to have childcare,
pay for childcare,

01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:33.790
I'm never going to able to
afford my business, because

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.040
childcare is too expensive.

01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:43.820
So if I have to go out and get
a job, which is 9-to-5, and I

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.990
have to work all
the time, who's

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:48.580
going to provide childcare?

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:52.420
So often, they choose businesses
which are designed

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.990
to work well with childcare.

01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:57.990
Like I took a snack
making business.

01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.390
Why?

01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:59.640
Because I can do it at home.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.160
I make the snacks at home.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.230
And then I go out to
sell for two hours.

01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:05.290
At that time, I take
my child with me.

01:12:05.290 --> 01:12:07.290
And then I bring
the child back.

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:10.040
And that way, I don't ever
have to deal with the

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.140
childcare issue.

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:13.630
So flexibility is
a second one.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:16.840
The third and most
worrying one--

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.150
and microcredit makes me
worry about this most--

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:27.180
is whether or not a lot of men
are very enthusiastic for the

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:28.840
wives to work even harder.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.770
So they feel that, you know,
I'm working at a job.

01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:35.530
I would like my wife
to work harder.

01:12:35.530 --> 01:12:37.920
And the way they get their wives
to work harder is by

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.330
making them start a business.

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:43.170
So I don't know whether
microcredit is necessarily

01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:44.980
wonderful for all
of these women.

01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:51.690
I think that, historically, men
have found it difficult to

01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:54.545
understand that women, even
though they don't go out to

01:12:54.545 --> 01:12:55.870
work, actually have to work.

01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:57.340
They have like cooking
and cleaning

01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:59.510
dishes and washing up.

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:01.010
They're all hard work.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:06.320
And if you think that that's a
problem in the US, now, then

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.600
you can imagine in a lot of
developing countries, it's

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.070
even more of a problem.

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:14.110
So it may well be that a lot of
men are under the illusion

01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:16.150
that their wives are idle.

01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:18.470
And that they are very willing,
therefore, to start a

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:21.930
business for them, so they can
work a little harder and add

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.420
to the family pie.

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.880
So I don't know how much of
these businesses are a result

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.240
of that, rather than any desire
to start a business.

01:13:35.931 --> 01:13:37.181
Comments, questions?

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:52.120
So just to close this whole
thing, I think the key policy

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:58.120
question, that we don't know the
answer to, is how to not

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.400
get more businesses,
but more businesses

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.940
that hire other people.

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:05.150
That's the key policy
question we haven't

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:06.730
managed to solve yet.

01:14:06.730 --> 01:14:10.060
And it's an absolutely central
policy question for most

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:16.670
developing countries to figure
out how to get not

01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:20.415
micro-businesses but
small businesses.

01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:27.320
And this is often called the
missing middle problem.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.900
In many countries, in poor
countries, you'll find that

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.650
there are many micro-businesses
and some

01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:35.110
large businesses, but not
enough middle-sized

01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:36.130
businesses.

01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:39.370
So that's the policy problem
that many, many countries are

01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:40.370
wrestling with.

01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:44.255
And it's one that, I think,
we haven't yet got a

01:14:44.255 --> 01:14:46.170
very good handle on.

01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:48.560
But it's something to think
about is how to

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.950
generate those jobs.

01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:50.448
Yeah?

01:14:50.448 --> 01:14:53.934
AUDIENCE: So specifically in
developed countries, then,

01:14:53.934 --> 01:14:56.430
what provides the capital for
the middle businesses?

01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:58.820
PROFESSOR: So for one,
the state does a lot.

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:01.250
Like in the US, for example,
there's a Community

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:08.240
Reinvestment Act, which means
that banks are required to

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:11.190
provide a certain fraction of
their loans to the community

01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:14.440
where they are raising
the savings.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.560
So the CRA forces them, then,
to finance local businesses.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.790
And so there is a lot of
intervention, even in a

01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:28.000
country as uninterventionist
as the US, to help small

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.040
businesses set up.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.730
This CRA is a very
good example.

01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:34.580
The Small Business
Administration is huge in the

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:35.340
US, by the way.

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:39.000
And they provide all kinds of
help to small businesses,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.690
including capital, including
guarantees.

01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:42.970
They give a lot of
loan guarantees.

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.140
Even the US, which is one
of the world's least

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.580
interventionist countries,
tends to be very

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:53.265
interventionist when it comes to
promoting small businesses.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.510
That's probably the direction
that policy needs to go in

01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:01.290
developing countries.

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:03.587
But it's something we
know less about.
