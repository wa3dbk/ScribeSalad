00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:33.350
PROFESSOR: So I guess maybe the
lecture today is the one

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.860
that is going to have the
findings which in a sense are

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:47.110
the most surprising to me and
probably the most, let's say,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.580
unconventional or that would
upset the most people.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.580
None of these studies
are mine.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.900
They're all studies
by other people.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.880
But I think that together
they paint a

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.585
somewhat surprising picture.

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:05.920
A small family is
a happy family.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.590
This is actually a bag of rice
that someone took a picture of

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.220
with the slogan, "A Small Family
is a Happy Family"

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.320
painted on it.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.120
That's a picture from
someone's travel.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.720
So most international public
policy has been predicated on

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.535
this idea that large families
are bad, and particularly bad

00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:30.730
for children.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.100
And the second one is this
one, that poor people are

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.910
unable to control
their fertility.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.200
So that's kind of some of this
maybe slightly despising view

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.230
about what the poor can do.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.970
Here you have the social worker
coming to the very

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.340
poor, dilapidated house with a
large number of children and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.590
the mom saying, but I take the
pill every time and become

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.810
pregnant, and it doesn't help.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.990
So that seems to me like a
pretty good summary of where a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.660
lot of people are explicitly
or implicitly.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.830
And what I'm going to argue
today, and not on the basis of

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.430
what I've done but on the basis
of a lot of work that

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.960
I've accumulated, is that both
of these statements are

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.485
actually wrong, not
mostly wrong.

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:22.895
But let's start with
the beginning.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.800
Why does it matter?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.520
Why do we spend time
on this issue?

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.750
And why is it important that
people get it wrong and to try

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.530
and get it right instead?

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.690
It's because these
kind of views

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.970
actually influence policies.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.500
So the first example is the
sterilization policy during

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.540
the emergency period in India.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.120
So what happened during
this period?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.461
What was the story?

00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:54.409
AUDIENCE: There was this huge
campaign for sterilization.

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.279
And basically there were lots
of incentives or hand

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.983
[INAUDIBLE] provided
to ensure that

00:03:00.983 --> 00:03:03.920
people met certain quotas.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.824
Like, various policies, Muslim
people were taken into jail

00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:09.570
and then forced to
be sterilized.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.010
It was just a very harsh
technique to achieve a quota.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.440
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.820
There was a huge, very fast
campaign for sterilization,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.292
which was very much delivered
from the top.

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:24.200
7 million people got sterilized
in a very short

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.130
period of time.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.350
If you're interested in reading
an account of the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.260
emergency period in India,
there's actually a novel

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.860
called The Fine Balance
by Rohinton Mistry.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.640
It's a whole kind of full
spectrum novel about the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.030
emergency period, has some
horrific descriptions of those

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.510
camps which are based on some
of the accounts that people

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.280
have given.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.170
So some of this, of course, is
people were given incentives

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.030
to be sterilized.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.710
But people were also sometimes
given offers that they could

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.410
not reject.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.600
So there was sterilization
that was not voluntary.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.620
And, for example, people
traveling on trains without

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.190
tickets, which was a widely
accepted practice at the time,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.130
were all rounded up
and say you get

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.519
sterilized now or else.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.420
Widely unpopular policy,
as you can imagine.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.640
Then when Indira Gandhi called
an election towards the end of

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.320
emergency, she was convinced
she would win the election

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.450
partly because that's the
problem of being all alone in

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.700
power, that you don't
understand.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.840
No one gives you the real view
of what is going on.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.200
And she did lose the election
pretty badly.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.280
And it is, of course, hard to
tell but it is widely believed

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.570
that sterilization policy was
part of the reason why she

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.160
lost the election.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.030
And, in fact, there was this
slogan which was based on a

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.490
pun in India, kick down or kick
out Indira and save your

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.860
penis, which is based
on the phonic

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.040
analogy between the two.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.660
So that was a success in very
immediate terms and a very big

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.260
failure in a longer sense
because people in the rural

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.750
areas are pretty reluctant of
having anything to do with

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.180
family planning.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.210
For example, there is this very
safe way of providing

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.410
family planning, which
is an injection that

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.350
is valid for 3 months.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.910
And that's very convenient
because then you can

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.690
forget about it.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.120
You don't have to remember to
take your pill every day.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.300
It's not very healthy, which is
why people don't prescribe

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.350
it so much.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.760
But it does have the convenience
of being

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.000
very easy to use.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.480
And people are really not a big
fan of it in India partly

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.240
because they are wondering if
it's some roundabout way to

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.640
actually sterilize them.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.630
Worse than that, and we
discussed that in the context

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.075
of immunization, people feel
that other things could also

00:06:08.075 --> 00:06:10.240
be some roundabout way to
try to sterilize them.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.670
And in particular because
Muslims were certainly a group

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.145
that was particularly targeted
during the sterilization wave

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:22.780
in the emergency, Muslims
sometimes refuse to take even

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.540
things like the Pulse Polio
drops on the ground, that what

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.970
do we know whether it's
something like sterilization?

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.930
So that's one example.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.520
Another very famous example is
the one child policy in China.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.840
So the one child policy
started in 1978, 1979.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.640
Very brutally because before
that Mao was actually in favor

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.130
of Chinese people having many
children because that would

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.650
constitute a large army of
people to construct the

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.200
country and to be strong
and all that.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.865
But then they realized that, oh,
we have too many people or

00:06:59.865 --> 00:07:02.730
they believed we have too many
people and started the one

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:03.890
child policy.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.550
The one-child policy, at the
beginning, was very strict.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.210
So basically you can only
have one child.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.170
The second child, not only the
parents get heavily fined, but

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.280
in addition the second child
has no rights, can't go to

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.880
school, can't get health care,
can't get housing, can't get a

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.920
permit to live somewhere.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.400
So basically you don't want
to be a second child.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.260
So it was very effective
in terms have not

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.240
having a second child.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.190
But they had one consequence,
which you probably have heard

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.960
of, which is the ratio of boys
to girls in China is

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.940
completely skewed in
the favor of boys.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.240
As of 1986, when Amartya Sen
wrote his famous paper on

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.690
missing women, it was 94 women
for 100 men in China.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.470
And since then it's only gone
down and down, especially as

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.770
abortion became available and
in particular ultrasound

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.820
technology to figure out
the sex of the fetus.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.830
So nowadays less infanticide
but more abortion.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.940
So they've relaxed the policies
in a way that I'm

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.500
going to describe a little bit
later to allow in some places

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.770
people are to have a
second child if the

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.150
first child was a girl.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.180
So what is interesting about
that is it means that actually

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.510
in those places the gender ratio
at first birth actually

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:32.380
reverse where people were more
likely to keep a girl than to

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.429
keep a boy because that give
them a kind of second ticket

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.309
for the second child and they
could always abort the second

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.110
child if she was a girl.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:44.500
So that's, again, another pretty
drastic policy which is

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.340
not popular at all and had
a lot of consequences.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.360
So those are pretty extreme
examples, one of them.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.210
But most of the poor people in
the world live in countries

00:08:54.210 --> 00:09:00.300
where at some level or another
the government thinks that the

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.850
population is too big and
needs to be controlled.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.670
And usually it's done in a more
civilized way of trying

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.600
to make contraceptives available
to people, convince

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.090
them to use them, et cetera.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.320
And an example of an incentive
program of this kind is the

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.650
ICDDR, B in Bangladesh, which
was initially a big site where

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.790
they provided control of
diarrhea diseases--

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.300
so actually it's ICDDR,B because
diarrhea diseases,

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.320
Institute for the Control
of Diarrhea Diseases--

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.310
in one region called Matlab
in Bangladesh.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.520
And then at some point they
started in about half the

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.000
villages in the region to
provide a lot of counseling.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.650
There was a woman who was coming
to every house once a

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.870
week or twice a month to provide
advice and deliver

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.920
contraceptives and deliver
injectable contraceptives, et

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.230
cetera, to both make
contraception available and

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.350
try to change people's view.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.150
So this one is a more usual form
of what intensive, or a

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.310
more benign form of what
intensive family planning

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.560
policy can do.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:16.340
So why is policy so worried
about the number of children?

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.950
It really comes from this very
basic idea that if you have a

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.780
pie and you have more people
who want to share the pie,

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.970
there's going to be less
pie for every person.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.570
And if you really have too many
people around the pie,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.820
you're going to have very small
slices for each person.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.920
So it's a pretty basic idea.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.900
This was, maybe not first, but
at least famously expressed by

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.720
Malthus, who basically explained
that there are fixed

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.590
factors in the world.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.430
For example, there is
only so much land.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.040
So because there is only so
much land, we can only

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.480
grow so much food.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.810
So if we have large population,
we are fighting

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.000
for this restricted food.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.950
Eventually we will starve.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.570
Now, the advantage is that this
is a stabilizing force

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.160
because when everybody starves,
everybody dies.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.580
And when everybody dies, there
is again fewer people.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.870
So the remaining people
can again eat

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.690
whatever food is left.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:15.380
And he cited as an example the
black death, which was a

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.540
plague epidemic.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:25.330
So here's a poor person who
is affected by the plague.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.380
It was a huge epidemic
in Europe.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.520
If you have not seen The Seventh
Seal by Bergman, you

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.360
should see it.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.320
It's about the plague in the
North and in Sweden.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.350
It was believed to have killed
half of the British population

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.930
between 1348 and 1377.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.460
And Malthus explained
that this happened.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.570
Half the people died.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.950
And in the following century
wages kept rising.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:59.760
So that was, for him, an example
of what was going on.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.050
In the book we discussed the
more recent incarnation of

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.480
Malthus' view and in particular
some analogous of

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.090
the black death.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.125
What is it?

00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:14.079
Suzanna.

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:15.510
AUDIENCE: HIV and AIDS.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.464
PROFESSOR: HIV and AIDS.

00:12:16.464 --> 00:12:20.910
So there is this professor at
the LSE, interestingly,

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:21.510
[? Avignon ?]

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.300
was also in England, who makes
the same argument saying HIV

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.700
and AIDS, of course, it's
bad because people die.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.470
But people dying, in the end,
will free up productive

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.790
resources both because
people are dying so

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.680
that's fewer people.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.910
That's not great because the
people who are dying of HIV,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.310
AIDS are mostly the
active generation.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.010
So it's not great to
lose those guys.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.240
But the remaining people also
have fewer children.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.460
That should be good for
GDP per capita.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.100
That's a bit galling
as an idea.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.380
And the question is whether
it's true or not.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.240
So what is potentially wrong
in Malthus' argument about

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.550
this idea that we have a fixed
pie, there is only so much

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.735
land, we can only produce so
much food, and if we have more

00:13:09.735 --> 00:13:13.420
people, there'll be less
food for everyone?

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.740
What's problematic
with this idea?

00:13:19.676 --> 00:13:21.644
AUDIENCE: He doesn't leave
room for innovation.

00:13:21.644 --> 00:13:24.596
So in the green revolution,
population pressures actually

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:28.040
spurred technological innovation
that boosted green

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.040
production.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.510
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.100
It doesn't leave room
for innovation.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.100
So the first thing is when we
write down a production

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.060
function, we tend to write down
the production function

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.965
with a big A that multiplies how
much capital there is in

00:13:43.965 --> 00:13:46.670
the economy, which multiplies
how much labor

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.300
there is in the economy.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.250
So that's how production
functions.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:54.370
The big A is these unknown
things that we discussed last

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.610
time when we talked
about education.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.960
It's like the productivity,
the innovation,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.310
et cetera, of people.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:07.900
Usually we consider this A to be
non rival, which means that

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:14.090
if you come up with a great
idea, your great idea can be

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.190
used not only by you but
by anybody else.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.540
So, for example, if I come up
with a new thing in the Green

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.740
Revolution then everyone
can use it.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.410
So the mechanically, if there
are more people around and if

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.326
ideas tend to come in this kind
of random way, you know,

00:14:30.326 --> 00:14:32.320
every morning during your
shower you have some

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.450
probability to come up with
the new seed for the Green

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.650
Revolution or to come up with
the concept of iPad or to come

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:44.060
up with a Facebook, then the
more people we are, the more

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.010
chances there is that one of
us comes back with an idea.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.070
So this is a feature of all of
those models of technological

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:57.680
progress, that the more people
we have, the more likely we

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.960
are we have a good idea that's
going to benefit everyone.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.520
That's a feature of
models that people

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.690
generally don't like.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.640
They think it's a bit strange.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.220
But why not?

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.860
At the end of the
day that's true.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.360
And then there is the argument
that reinforces this effect

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.970
furthermore, which is the
argument you had which is in

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.090
addition, if we are about to
starve because there is so

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.250
much population pressure then
that puts pressure on us to

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.820
have more ideas.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.950
So that gives us all the
right incentive to try

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.530
and figure it out.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.280
For these two reasons, what we
should expect is when there

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.020
are more people around, people
have more ideas, and therefore

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.800
growth is also faster.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.720
So there is a very interesting
paper by Micheal Kramer which

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:49.340
looks at that in the world.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.470
So this is population growth
five million BC to 1990.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.920
As you can imagine, the quality
of the data improved a

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.960
little bit between 5 million
BC and 1990.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.910
And the data points in
five million BC are

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.150
a little bit scanty.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:17.880
However, what he does here is
that he has periods of data.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.030
So his first point is from
five million BC.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.290
It's estimated, obviously.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.760
Then the second might
be one million BC.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.180
So that's a very long
period of time.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:32.405
And then he may have annual data
between 1960 and 1990.

00:16:32.405 --> 00:16:35.210
But what he does is for each
period he has, he calculates

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:39.610
the annual growth rate of
population in between one year

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.240
and the next year and regresses
here or plots it

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.010
against how much population
there was at the time.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.670
This is done world wide.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.790
So this is population growth
rate on population billion.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.770
And what we see is the exact
opposite as the Malthusian

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.260
graph, which is particularly the
more people there are, the

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.190
faster the population growth.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.180
And that's about linear.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.940
So the more people we are, the
more our population grows,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.720
which suggests that this idea
for fixed land is wrong

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.470
because that would go the other
way, that there's no

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.680
stabilizing force that brings
the population back to zero,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.460
and instead it's the opposite
that happens.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:24.339
So far, there has not been
really any evidence that the

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:26.319
Malthusian theory was right.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.250
In fact, we have many, many more
people than we were in

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.620
Malthus' time.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.550
And people are by and large much
richer than they were in

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.310
Malthus' time and eating much
more and healthier and having

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.420
longer lives.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.920
So it doesn't seem that if you
look at the very short history

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:51.420
of the world you get so scared
by what's going on here.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.890
And yet these Malthusian
arguments in a form or another

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.240
somehow never dies.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.430
It always keeps coming back.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.950
And interestingly where it
mostly recently came back or

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:08.675
more permanently came back is in
Jeff Sachs' new book-- not

00:18:08.675 --> 00:18:11.280
the End of Poverty book that
we discussed before.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.290
But he has a book called
Common Wealth.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:17.100
And the subtitle is Economics
for a Crowded Planet.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.370
So that pretty much
said it all.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.270
The planet is crowded,
too crowded.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.100
One of the main challenges
is population.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.400
This, I took from his website
where he kind of

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.550
advertises the book.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.970
"Stabilizing the world's
population is crucial to

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.100
ensuring peace and prosperity
on this

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.800
already crowded planet.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.590
If we ignore this issue, we risk
a massive and unsettling

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.260
youth bulge, unbearable
environmental pressures, and

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.280
unchecked global migration."

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.280
So the "unbearable environmental
pressure," that

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.820
refers to exactly the type of
limited resource argument that

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:57.780
we can have in the
Malthusian world.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.720
So what are the environmental
pressure that

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.970
he's worried about?

00:19:07.065 --> 00:19:09.005
AUDIENCE: The more people you
have, the more green house

00:19:09.005 --> 00:19:10.600
gasses we emit.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:10.710
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.614
Say it again.

00:19:12.614 --> 00:19:14.566
AUDIENCE: The more people you
have, the more green house

00:19:14.566 --> 00:19:15.550
gasses you can emit.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:15.620
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.250
So climate is one, that maybe
more people generate more

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.966
greenhouse emission.

00:19:23.966 --> 00:19:25.962
AUDIENCE: Water because we
have a fixed amount of

00:19:25.962 --> 00:19:27.459
freshwater that we can access.

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:30.453
But the more people there are,
we have to grow more food.

00:19:30.453 --> 00:19:31.451
We have to irrigate
all of that.

00:19:31.451 --> 00:19:33.946
And it's important that we
have access to clean

00:19:33.946 --> 00:19:36.940
water for daily use.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:37.440
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.660
Water is one.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.810
There is big pressure
on fresh water.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.900
And what's the last?

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.684
Yeah.

00:19:47.684 --> 00:19:48.910
AUDIENCE: Energy.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:49.260
PROFESSOR: Energy.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.080
And particularly there
is only so much oil.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.500
So until we figure out
something else--

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.860
and certainly nuclear energy
is probably going

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.110
to be one of them--

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.460
there is also going
to be eventually a

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.480
pressure for that.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.890
And what's the last one that
we discussed in one of the

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.480
first lectures that
people also have

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.730
brought up this year?

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.610
AUDIENCE: Food.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:23.870
PROFESSOR: Food.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:24.550
Exactly.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.150
In the end, food is back.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.730
Can I ask you guys to not
do something else?

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.640
It's a bit unsettling.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.360
There are too many people who
are doing something else.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.730
I am pretty tolerant
with that.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.730
But that's just too much.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:41.430
Like, there's half the class
with computers open.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.590
I'm assuming that about 90% of
you are checking some other

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.840
website or whatever.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.230
That doesn't help my focus.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.720
So if you are doing something
else, just shut your computer.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.970
Thanks.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:07.080
And so is there reason
to worry about that?

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.560
Indeed, what we do find that is
something pretty striking

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.050
is that the countries that have
higher fertility rate are

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.530
much poorer.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.210
So here it's plotted in
the other direction.

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.790
We have the wealth of
the country and

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.160
the fertility rate.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.730
It's a nice log relationship.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.260
If we were plotting it in log,
that would be log linear.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.272
Yep.

00:21:30.272 --> 00:21:32.045
AUDIENCE: Is there any
investigation about why Saudi

00:21:32.045 --> 00:21:34.298
Arabia and Israel are
so noticeably

00:21:34.298 --> 00:21:37.770
removed from the trend?

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:38.740
PROFESSOR: So what
do you think?

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.020
So the first thing,
why are they both

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.040
removed from the trend?

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.590
AUDIENCE: They have higher
fertility rates than you'd

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.900
expect for their GDP.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.200
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.550
They are richer than you'd
expect given how

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.770
populous they are.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.933
So how about Saudi Arabia?

00:21:55.933 --> 00:21:58.200
AUDIENCE: Oil.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.100
PROFESSOR: They have oil,
so they are pretty rich.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:00.710
Israel?

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.660
AUDIENCE: They have
an existential

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.610
threat to their existence.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.510
They want to populate more?

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.860
That's a very good
way to set it.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.090
They have an existential threat
to their existence.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.680
On the other hand, it's an

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.460
intellectually very rich country.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.590
They also get a lot
of support.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.280
And it's also very small,
so that might

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.470
eventually create issues.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.310
In fact, that does
create issues.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:29.040
But that's probably the reason
why Israel is so much richer

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.800
compared to their income.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.850
And the Israel case kind of
illustrates well the problem

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.070
with this graph which is you
could read from this graph

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:44.060
that, oh, having a large
population makes you poor.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.210
Or you could read from this
graph that poor countries have

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.540
more kids or richer countries
have fewer kids in the

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.180
opposite direction.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.470
That is, the lack of wealth that
makes people have a lot

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:57.930
of children maybe because
of people's choices.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.840
Because when we explain Isreal,
we don't want to

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.640
explain why Israel is rich
despite having many children.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.820
We want to explain why Israel
has high fertility rate

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.600
despite being rich.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.600
So we explain here what are
the reasons why people in

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.940
Israel would like kids.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.190
That's not the case in
other countries.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.470
So that's kind of what
I'm saying here.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:24.290
As usual, the correlation
could go either way.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.910
We could find that poor
countries could be poor

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.055
because they are too crowded.

00:23:29.055 --> 00:23:31.010
A rich country could have
lower fertility

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.140
because they are rich.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:37.320
Maybe as people become richer,
the opportunity cost of their

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.350
time is higher.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:44.170
As a country becomes richer,
women are more likely to find

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.850
things that they can do
in the labor market.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.560
And therefore women are more
likely to participate in the

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.140
labor market.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.170
And therefore, having a kid, you
know, you don't want to be

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.370
taking off a year of your life
every other year because you

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.780
are bearing or nursing
a very small child.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.930
So it's kind of difficult
to answer this question.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.630
It's not going to be solvable by
looking at other countries.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.600
And it's even harder to ask what
population increase would

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.900
do to the planet.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.410
It might be right even
if Malthus was wrong.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.040
The [INAUDIBLE] might
still be right.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.520
It might be right that we will
never find a solution to get

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.130
clean water access to everyone,
especially if it's a

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:28.050
much larger group of people.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:29.000
It might also be wrong.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.970
But it's difficult to know.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:31.910
Yep.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.320
AUDIENCE: Is there a correlation
with religion in

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.150
fertility at all?

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.270
PROFESSOR: I would assume so.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.560
I don't know which
way it is though.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.090
It used to be that Catholic
country would

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.030
have a lot of children.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.040
And now it's not true anymore.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.510
The countries that have the
fewer children in Europe are

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.910
the traditionally Catholic
countries

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.440
like Italy and Spain.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.860
So actually I think there is a
correlation, and I don't even

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:54.710
know what it is.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.900
Like, for example,
what are the--

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.600
but you're right.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.810
That brings to the number of
children you decide to have,

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:06.043
et cetera, depends on
your culture as

00:25:06.043 --> 00:25:08.920
well as other things.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.090
So it's difficult to say
anything about countries.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.700
It's even harder to say anything
about the world.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.190
So we can go back to our
traditional refuge and start

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:22.200
looking at the family and ask
whether it is true that a

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.930
small family is a
happy family.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:28.845
And, of course, that's not
necessarily the answer of what

00:25:28.845 --> 00:25:31.530
it would be for a country or
let alone for the world

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.620
because there are externalities
of a large

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.060
population in a country or in
a community or in the world

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.370
that the family might
not internalize

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.210
or take into account.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:46.045
For example, having more kids,
the kids may still be as

00:25:46.045 --> 00:25:49.230
educated and you may have
as much water to

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.090
feed the kids today.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.760
But the fact that you have just
one more kid puts more

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.990
pressure on water resources
for everyone in the world.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:03.670
So we are not fully answering
the question were we answering

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:07.600
this particular question on
what happened to family.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.090
However, it's still an important
question because, in

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:17.490
fact, even if you where
convinced that family or that

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.680
large population is a problem
for the world as a whole and

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.980
you really want to deal with
it, even if you were that

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.670
convinced you would have
to find a way to do it.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:31.480
And the issue is an effective
way to do it would certainly

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.670
depend on whether having a
large family is something

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.100
that's immediate costly
to people.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.490
And therefore you need to make
them realize that, and then

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.950
they'll have fewer children on
their own or whether it's

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.110
something that's beneficial
to people.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.590
So we need to answer this
question even if we are

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:50.030
interested just in the external
world wide effect of

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.710
large population.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.910
Moreover, if you find out, for
example, that it's very bad

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.640
for children to live in a large
family then you could

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.950
want to design a population
family that would increase the

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:10.060
cost of having children by ideas
ranging from I'm going

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.510
to reduce the cost of not having
them by reducing the

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.290
cost of contraception to I'm
going to make it illegal to

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.350
have more than one
child in China.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:22.920
So if we consider that parents
are not fully maximizing the

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.890
welfare of their children and of
the second generation then

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:33.600
we might be even more concerned
about a population

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.460
policy for the sake of the
children, even if we weren't

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.790
sure of what it would do to the
world as a whole to have

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.540
fewer or more kids.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.260
So these reasons, that's a
question which is pretty much

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.430
immediately important.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.680
And if you read Sachs' book,
Common Wealth, he's going to

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.500
tell you very assertively,
very authoritatively.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.480
He's going to tell you that
large families are bad for

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.770
kids, that there is plenty of
evidence that large families

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.200
are bad for kids.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.790
And that's not really
the subject I study.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:07.750
So when I went into this to
review the evidence when we

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.775
were preparing the book, I
assumed that I would find a

00:28:11.775 --> 00:28:15.630
number of studies finding
exactly this.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:20.180
And, of course, when you look at
the reason we assume that,

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.750
well, that seems, again, pretty
much intuitive that if

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:27.630
you have a larger family, that's
more people on one

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.610
single pie.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.370
That's fewer to eat
for everyone.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:34.080
There's also a very, very famous
paper by Gary Becker

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.070
who won the Nobel Prize for his
work on the economics of

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.740
the family, which coined
the term the quality

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.170
quantity trade off.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.090
And the quality quantity trade
off is exactly that.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:49.460
Siblings compete for resources,
parental attention,

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.280
money, time, et cetera.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.030
So if you have more siblings,
they will compete for this.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.610
And, therefore, it's bad
for all of them.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.720
So the paper starts from this as
an assumption and then from

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.620
this assumption builds a model
which shows that suppose that

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.500
the quality is a normal good.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.030
So you want more quality
children

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.730
when you become richer.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.920
Then as people become richer,
they will move on the quality

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.340
quantity trade off towards fewer
kids of higher quality.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.280
So the paper's argument
was not--

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.380
the first one with the second
one which is given the quality

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.050
quantity trade off, we should
see that richer family have

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.930
fewer children of
higher quality.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.215
So I sort of assumed that it was
a given that this quality

00:29:30.215 --> 00:29:31.650
quantity trade off existed.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.460
Now, another thing that if you
look at the data you do find,

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:45.020
as [? West ?] pointed out
earlier, that in general it's

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.870
true that children are of lower

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.880
quality in larger families.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:56.115
They tend to have less
education, to be smaller, et

00:29:56.115 --> 00:29:57.470
cetera, when they have
more siblings.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.020
It's not even always true.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.620
But it tends to be true.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.720
The problem, of course, is we
can't look at that because

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.710
even in Baker's model he just
explained to us that because

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.720
there is this trade off between
quality and quantity,

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.905
the families where we are going
to see many children are

00:30:14.905 --> 00:30:16.690
precisely the families
which don't care

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.020
so much about quality.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.500
So even if we manage to force
them not too have many

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.205
children, they would still want
lower quality children

00:30:27.205 --> 00:30:29.360
and would spend their money
on other things

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.740
than quality children.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:37.420
That goes back to the first
concepts we saw when we looked

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.820
at program evaluation and this
idea of potential outcome.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:45.510
The potential outcome, the
potential quality of the

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.110
children born in large families,
is lower than the

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:53.670
potential quality of the
children born in small

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:58.320
families, keeping the family
size constant just because the

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.910
people who have large families
in Baker and Tomms' world are

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:04.060
people who care less about the
quality of the children.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.930
I don't know if that is right.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.840
But under this model that
we are trying to

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.180
test I would be right.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:13.640
That means we cannot look
at just the correlation.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.870
More specifically, we
know that poorer

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:17.660
families are larger.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.070
And therefore it is likely
that large family is

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.270
correlated with poverty, which
would make children less

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.690
educated for all sorts
of reasons.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.360
So what can we look at?

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.200
We need to look at things that
somehow have forced families

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.890
to be larger or smaller than
people wanted them to be.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:43.920
Or we need to look at policies
that made it easier or harder

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.540
for people to control
their family.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.580
So what is a thing that makes
your family bigger than you

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.012
may have planned it to be?

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:55.860
AUDIENCE: Having twins was
one of these, I guess.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.182
PROFESSOR: Having twins, yes.

00:31:58.182 --> 00:32:00.146
And what is another one?

00:32:00.146 --> 00:32:03.583
AUDIENCE: In some families, in
some countries that consider

00:32:03.583 --> 00:32:05.056
that they really want
to have a boy.

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:07.511
Let's say their first
child is a girl.

00:32:07.511 --> 00:32:10.702
They're more likely to have
more children because they

00:32:10.702 --> 00:32:11.950
want [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.170
PROFESSOR: Exactly, the
gender of the family.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:20.250
So, specifically, before sex
selection was available,

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.240
gender was more or
less exogenous.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.795
Or in places where people
don't do sex selective

00:32:24.795 --> 00:32:27.660
abortion, gender is more
or less exogenous.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.400
So if you really want a boy
and you have a girl then

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.990
you're going to have
one more child.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:34.250
This means, by the way, that
girls tend to live in large

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.690
families, which could be one
reason why girls do worse in

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.820
life than boys, not because
people treat them worse once

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.950
they are born but because they
live in large families.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:51.170
Now, another thing related to
the gender of the children is

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.720
that in a lot of cases people
want to have a mix

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.440
composition.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.710
So for example in the US, you
are more likely to have a

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:02.680
third child if your first two
children were of the same

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.380
gender, say, two boys
or two girls.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.955
You are about 8% more likely
to have a third one.

00:33:08.955 --> 00:33:11.287
And that, again, conditional
on the gender

00:33:11.287 --> 00:33:11.865
of the first child.

00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:16.740
The gender of the second one is
random in the US, assuming

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:21.390
people don't abort kids
based on their gender.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:26.060
Then therefore we can use that
to look at the effect of a

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.425
larger family size than you
would otherwise have had

00:33:29.425 --> 00:33:32.940
because now we have two families
that are all exactly

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.640
the same, except one of them end
up with three kids and one

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.750
of them ends up with two kids,
either because of a twin in

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:42.005
the second birth or because
of this gender selection.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:48.130
So of course with the twins,
we cannot look at the twins

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.620
themselves.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.620
Why looking at the twins
themselves would be

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:54.870
problematic?

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.820
AUDIENCE: Because at the point
when the twins arrive,

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.520
there's, like, nothing to
compare it to, right?

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.280
So wouldn't it be more useful
to look at situations where

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.154
there was a single kid and then
the second child ended up

00:34:10.154 --> 00:34:11.330
being twins?

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:11.840
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.230
So you could say let me compare
at first births the

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.980
families which have
twins versus

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.830
families which have one.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:20.861
You would compare two to one.

00:34:20.861 --> 00:34:22.855
And why wouldn't we want
to do that comparison?

00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:31.429
AUDIENCE: Can you repeat
the question?

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:34.820
PROFESSOR: So suppose that
I want to use twins.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.164
And I'm saying let me focus
on first birth.

00:34:37.164 --> 00:34:40.471
And I am going to compare all
of the kids that are born as

00:34:40.471 --> 00:34:44.280
single children and all of the
kids that are born as twins.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.929
So the twins are two, and the
singles children as one.

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:50.260
Is this comparison valid?

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.989
AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:52.963
PROFESSOR: So why?

00:34:52.963 --> 00:34:56.544
AUDIENCE: Because isn't it the
case that we just talked about

00:34:56.544 --> 00:34:57.409
the fact that it's safe.

00:34:57.409 --> 00:35:00.373
If you get a kid, then
you want another kid.

00:35:00.373 --> 00:35:03.337
Then you can say if I get twins,
then I'll have one more

00:35:03.337 --> 00:35:05.313
than I actually intended to.

00:35:05.313 --> 00:35:11.510
But if you want a kid and
then you get twins--

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.410
I don't know what the
expression is.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.810
PROFESSOR: You mean you are
saying that the kid who is

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.230
single birth eventually
will have a brother.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.160
So maybe twins at first birth
might not change the total

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:21.956
family size?

00:35:21.956 --> 00:35:22.650
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.810
PROFESSOR: So that's true, which
is there might not be an

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.400
effect on total family size or
the effect might be very small

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.540
because almost everyone wants at
least two, in which case if

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.570
we go with [? Deck's ?]

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.870
idea of saying let's look at the
second birth and you move

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:40.970
from two to three, and maybe
there are fewer kids who would

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:43.660
want three, that creates a
bigger impact on family size.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.460
That's right.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:50.075
And there is another problem
with twins, pretty obvious,

00:35:50.075 --> 00:35:53.366
like, direct.

00:35:53.366 --> 00:35:55.466
You guys are over thinking it.

00:35:55.466 --> 00:35:55.952
Yeah.

00:35:55.952 --> 00:35:56.924
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if this is it.

00:35:56.924 --> 00:35:59.840
But the reason I think you
couldn't hurt the kids who

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.784
weren't twins because if you're
a twin you'd probably

00:36:01.784 --> 00:36:03.242
get fewer nutrients.

00:36:03.242 --> 00:36:06.644
So you're less likely,
especially in countries with

00:36:06.644 --> 00:36:09.236
poor families, they're
less likely to

00:36:09.236 --> 00:36:10.060
have the same potential.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:10.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:11.720
That's the problem.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.800
Twins are fragile.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.850
Even here they are born
with lower weight.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:22.300
They are more easily premature
children and even more so in

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.840
places where the health care
might not be so good.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.980
So twins are, in general,
weaker.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.780
So if we go back to your point
and say, well, maybe the

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.230
family size is the same at the
end between a family that has

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:37.390
twins at first birth and a
single child at first birth,

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.760
you end up with three
regardless, say, or two

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:45.560
regardless, but there might
still be a difference between

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.100
the twins and the non twins just
because the twins were

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.275
born weaker.

00:36:49.275 --> 00:36:50.990
AUDIENCE: Can't you
account for that?

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:52.454
PROFESSOR: How?

00:36:52.454 --> 00:36:52.946
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:36:52.946 --> 00:36:57.866
If you have, like, data on the
average wealth of twins versus

00:36:57.866 --> 00:36:58.750
the average wealth--

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.450
PROFESSOR: So it's not
only the wealth.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:02.550
The wealth would be the same.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.300
So you could adjust looking at
birth weight, for example.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.370
So some people have done that,
to look at the difference

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:10.950
between twins and non twins
comparing for birth weight and

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:14.410
assuming that birth weight
completely captured the fact

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:18.950
that twins were in a more
adverse in utero environment.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:23.230
But another thing you can do
is to do what was suggested

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:28.500
before which is to say, let's
look at that kid who was born,

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.870
the first one, and then at the
second birth it gets either

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.310
one sibling or two.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:38.070
And that's a shock
for him or her.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.960
And he or she is no different.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.300
It's the same child and the
first few years were in the

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.020
same environment.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.810
But certainly there are these
two kids who are coming

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:48.745
instead of one.

00:37:48.745 --> 00:37:50.240
So that gives you a shock.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.222
Yeah, Ben.

00:37:51.222 --> 00:37:52.695
AUDIENCE: Isn't it also
difficult to look at the

00:37:52.695 --> 00:37:56.132
relative treatment of the
children because there is no

00:37:56.132 --> 00:37:57.605
prior child to look at?

00:37:57.605 --> 00:38:01.777
But if we have twins in the
first trial, they're born at

00:38:01.777 --> 00:38:03.497
the same time, they're
the same age.

00:38:03.497 --> 00:38:06.443
You can't say one education--

00:38:06.443 --> 00:38:08.570
the parents did something
completely different than they

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:10.410
would have done otherwise--

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.250
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.970
So knowing what they would have
done is looking at the

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.180
single child in other family
and saying that

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.330
getting twins is random.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.350
So they would have treated them
like people generally

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:24.100
treat their single children.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.600
But the problem is that probably
they wouldn't because

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.360
they are twins and they're very
fragile, whereas if I

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.030
look at the first child, the
first child is the same.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:38.690
But then he is in a family of
three or in the family of two.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:43.300
So there is a paper--

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.000
so we went over gender--

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.143
a paper by George Angrist,
Victor Lavy, and Eliot

00:38:50.143 --> 00:38:56.390
Schlosser looking at exploiting
the twinning and

00:38:56.390 --> 00:39:00.980
the gender differences, both the
sex mix and the fact that

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:04.200
people prefer boys in Israel.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.790
Now, you might think Israel
is a rich country.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.930
Why do we care?

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.130
Or we might care about Israel in
general, but why do we care

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:11.880
in this class?

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.170
Well, Israel is a rich country
but it also has poor people.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:18.400
And they are using pretty
much all of Israel.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.110
So it's very large samples,
including a large sample of

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.750
poor people because they also
look at the Israeli Arabs

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:30.620
which are getting to be as poor
as some of the people we

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.010
look at in other countries.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:37.360
So they are looking at that in a
lot of detail, comparing the

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:42.290
siblings of twins, first born,
when the second birth is a

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:47.900
twin, comparing the children
born in different gender mix,

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.040
and then putting all
of this together.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.000
And they find no effect at all
of larger family size.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.220
They find absolutely no adverse
impact of being born

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.390
in a larger family.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.640
That is a bit surprising since,
again, I think most

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.700
people would have expected
large effect.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.790
So you can think, OK, maybe it's
Israel and even Israeli

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:20.370
Arabs live in an environment
where they are poor but they

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:21.670
can go to school for free.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.570
They can get good health care.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.160
So maybe we don't see the
quality quantity trade off in

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.932
this context because these
are Israeli Arabs.

00:40:29.932 --> 00:40:33.605
So let's look at other places.

00:40:33.605 --> 00:40:38.300
Well, in obvious other places
the one-child policy where the

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:43.560
state forces you to
have fewer kids.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.230
So here there is a paper by
Nancy Chen, who interestingly

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:51.490
is a student of George Angrist,
former student, who

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.980
looks at the one child policy.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.780
So that's pretty clear,
the one child policy.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.790
Either you can have a second
child or you cannot.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:06.410
And I mentioned that since the
mid 1980s, some areas allow

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:10.600
you to have a second child if
your first one was a girl,

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.830
which means that if you want a
girl in an area that relaxed

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:19.620
the policy, after the relaxation
policy was put in

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.920
place then you're more likely
to have a sibling than if

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.060
you're born a girl in a non
relaxed area or if you are

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.030
born a boy in a relaxed area.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.480
So she exploits that.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.670
And you're very much more likely
because pretty much

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:34.560
everyone who had a chance to
have a second child did.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.360
A lot of people did.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.630
So what do we find?

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:45.740
This is a graph that tells you
the number of siblings that

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:52.810
the child has as a function of
whether they were born and

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:56.590
whether they were born
in a relaxed area.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:01.960
So this is the difference
between the family size.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:07.370
This is the difference between
the number of siblings that

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:11.490
the girl has in a relaxed area
versus non relaxed area.

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.250
So not all the areas relaxed.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:19.610
And the areas that relaxed,
the 1978, 1970s, because

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.350
before they didn't have
a one-child policy.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:26.110
So what you find is that before
the one-child policy,

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.720
there is not much difference
between the number of siblings

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.500
that the girls have in area that
eventually will relax the

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.440
policy because there is no such
policy in other area.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.560
So those places are
not fully random.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:47.050
But girls have an average of
maybe 0.50 more sibling in the

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:50.620
relaxed areas before
the policy.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:55.740
And boys have 0.50 areas as
well, which shows us that they

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.380
tended to allow people to relax
the policy in places

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.760
which like children more.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.620
But what is interesting and
what's happening after, the

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.850
relaxation of the policy
only affect the girls.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:12.750
So after the one-child policy,
you start seeing bigger and

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.780
bigger difference between the
number of siblings that the

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:20.440
girls have in a relaxed area
versus non relaxed area.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:27.920
And towards the end of the
period where most places

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.060
passed the laws, a girl had an
average of about half more

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:36.540
sibling in places that
did pass such a law.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:39.290
That means that every second
family who had a chance to

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:43.720
have a another kid after
a girl had it.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.460
Zach.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.720
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't you expect
there to be a gap?

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.070
In the places that relaxed the
policies, didn't they only

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:54.267
relax the policies to have a
second child if the first one

00:43:54.267 --> 00:43:54.880
was a girl?

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.580
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.050
So it's exactly what
you would expect.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:05.570
So this is telling you that in
places which had relaxed area,

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.130
that did have an effect, that
people took advantage.

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:12.250
And if they had a girl as the
first born, they had a second

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:15.580
child, whereas for the boys,
since that doesn't allow them

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.920
to have when a policy, there
is no difference.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.610
So you're exactly right.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:19.800
This is exactly what
you would expect.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.540
It's not an interesting fact.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.180
It's just showing you that
the policy worked

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.610
as you would expect.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:28.580
Now we're going to exploit that
to say is it the case

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:32.260
that this first girl, who has
more siblings, is she less

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.930
educated compared to what would
have been the case if

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:35.900
she were a boy?

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.590
So we are looking here at the
first stage, if you want.

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:39.290
Yeah.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:40.830
AUDIENCE: So is this all looking
at the first borns and

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:41.320
showing their--

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.824
PROFESSOR: This is looking at
the number of siblings of the

00:44:43.824 --> 00:44:44.400
first born.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.990
So it's telling you that if
you're a girl, you're more

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.770
likely to have a sibling if
you're born relaxed than non

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.080
relaxed towards the
end of the period.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.650
But that's not the case for
boys, which is exactly what we

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:54.728
would expect.

00:44:54.728 --> 00:44:56.680
Yep.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.120
AUDIENCE: Is all this data
from areas eventually

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.590
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:06.125
PROFESSOR: So each of these
points is the difference

00:45:06.125 --> 00:45:09.090
between all the places that will
eventually be relaxed and

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:11.880
all the places that will
never be relaxed.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.910
So all these points are
already differences.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:19.930
But the reason why it keeps
increasing is that it's the

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.340
difference between places that
will eventually be relaxed.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.780
And some of them got relaxed
only towards the end.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.330
And that's why the difference
keeps increasing.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:29.700
Does that make sense?

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.160
So each of these is
a difference.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:35.000
And it's telling you that if you
look just at this point in

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.100
1981, if you were a girl born
in a relaxed area, you had

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.980
about half a sibling more than
if you were a girl born in a

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.280
non relaxed area.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.640
But for boys, you had only a
tenth of a sibling more, like,

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.340
strictly speaking, zero.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.320
So that is exactly right.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.410
There's nothing particularly
interesting there.

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:58.840
That's just the basic fact that
we are going to rely on

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.580
to now show we're going to run
the exact same analysis for

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.130
the first born, not looking at
their number of siblings but

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.240
looking at their education.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.980
So if having more siblings is
bad for your education, what

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.520
would you expect the shape
of the equivalent

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.280
of these red lines?

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.960
It would be decreasing, because
the later you were

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:24.580
born, the more likely that
you have one more kid.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.290
And, in fact, what do we find?

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:31.040
We find that it's increasing,
and moreover it's increasing

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.890
for girls but not for boys.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:37.620
So towards the end of the
period, girls born in relaxed

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:42.610
area are actually more educated
than boys born in a

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.750
relaxed area, compared
to what happened in

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.010
a non relaxed area.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:46.470
Yeah.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.240
AUDIENCE: Can you help me
understand what the y-axis is?

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.540
PROFESSOR: The y-axis here is
the difference in the years of

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.970
education between the relaxed
and the non relaxed area.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:59.055
So it's saying that the relaxed
area, probably we are

00:46:59.055 --> 00:47:03.620
poor because the kids at the
beginning of the period tended

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.990
to be less educated in a relaxed
and non relaxed area.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:10.324
And at the end of the period
it's towards zero.

00:47:10.324 --> 00:47:11.740
AUDIENCE: So the more kids
you have, the more

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.820
education you have.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:13.950
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:18.300
The more siblings you have, the
more education you get.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.710
Remember, it's not going
from one to eight.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:24.874
It's going from zero siblings to
half a chance of a sibling.

00:47:24.874 --> 00:47:25.862
Yeah.

00:47:25.862 --> 00:47:27.097
AUDIENCE: So how much
more education does

00:47:27.097 --> 00:47:27.838
that translate into?

00:47:27.838 --> 00:47:31.296
Because if, for instance, you
have a first child that is a

00:47:31.296 --> 00:47:35.576
girl and then you wait, say, six
years, so the child has a

00:47:35.576 --> 00:47:37.718
year of school, which
[INAUDIBLE] haven't gotten,

00:47:37.718 --> 00:47:40.682
and then you have a second
child, then you're still not

00:47:40.682 --> 00:47:42.658
actually trying to educate
your child anymore.

00:47:42.658 --> 00:47:47.310
You're just still investing in
the children that you have.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:48.621
PROFESSOR: Can you repeat
the question?

00:47:48.621 --> 00:47:51.101
AUDIENCE: I mean, if you have
two children, can't you say

00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:52.680
your [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.350
goes to school?

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:57.671
Whereas if you just were
stuck with one child--

00:47:57.671 --> 00:47:59.603
how do I explain this?

00:47:59.603 --> 00:48:02.946
And really does this show at all
that there was the intent

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:05.386
to educate these girls
who were first born?

00:48:05.386 --> 00:48:09.778
Or does it just show that they
were investigating whether

00:48:09.778 --> 00:48:11.242
they'd have while they had it.

00:48:11.242 --> 00:48:12.706
And then once they got a second
boy, they started

00:48:12.706 --> 00:48:15.170
investing in the boy?

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:17.340
PROFESSOR: So if this were in
the model then we would find

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:20.900
the girls to be less educated
because once the boy comes--

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.280
or at least as much-- because
once the boy comes then they

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.930
start, you know, sharing the
resources or giving everything

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:27.960
to the boy.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.790
It's good pointing out that
mostly the second kid is a boy

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:35.060
because selective abortion of
the second child is horrible.

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.820
Like, most of these second
kids are boys.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:37.788
Yep.

00:48:37.788 --> 00:48:42.144
AUDIENCE: So you were saying
that if you get another child

00:48:42.144 --> 00:48:44.564
[INAUDIBLE] schools that they
actually get more schooling,

00:48:44.564 --> 00:48:47.480
but with this school is that
they get just as much.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.520
PROFESSOR: Oh, well, this is the
idea of starting from the

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.440
differences.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.080
So the idea is that those
regions were regions where

00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:00.320
before girls tended to
be less educated.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.200
And even the boys tended
to be less educated.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.760
And nothing really changed
for the boys.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.720
But for the girls it went up.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.180
So the point is these regions
that relaxed, they are not the

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:14.480
same as the regions
that didn't relax.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.050
Those were poor or more
backwater regions where the

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.150
problem of infanticide was
bigger or accepted

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.780
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:21.740
That's why they relaxed.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:26.160
So that's why we are more
interested in the slope and

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.070
how it looks at the end compared
to the beginning than

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:30.610
the levels.

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:32.370
So the levels are wherever
they are.

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.000
And in particular what is very
interesting is that the girls

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.660
tend to do better than the boys
in the relaxed areas,

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.455
relatively better in the relaxed
area than the boys,

00:49:42.455 --> 00:49:49.850
which is saying that if you
have to be a girl, it is

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:52.530
better to be a girl in the
relaxed area compared to being

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:54.344
a boy in the relaxed area.

00:49:54.344 --> 00:49:55.320
AUDIENCE: I mean, it mean--

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.760
[INAUDIBLE] anything about
Chinese culture-- it might

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:03.128
mean that the parents that are
in these relaxed areas which

00:50:03.128 --> 00:50:06.300
might be in more rural areas,
they want to educate their

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.569
girls more because they want to
then send them so that they

00:50:09.569 --> 00:50:10.448
can find a husband.

00:50:10.448 --> 00:50:14.832
If they have more education,
maybe they have more chance of

00:50:14.832 --> 00:50:17.230
getting a good husband.

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.960
PROFESSOR: I think you're right,
except that this is

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.130
what it's trying to account for,
which is, let's say from

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:29.410
1973 to 1977 is when
the areas--

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:32.440
there is no relaxation because
there is no policy yet.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.010
So this is saying that those
places, before the relaxation,

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:40.420
girls tended to do much worse,
whereas after the relaxation

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.870
they do somewhat better.

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:44.625
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:49.080
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
whether this can be considered

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:55.630
a good refutation of the quality
quantity credo because

00:50:55.630 --> 00:51:00.233
firstly when these people with
large family and position of

00:51:00.233 --> 00:51:01.478
birth [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:01.478 --> 00:51:04.964
is not quite the same as
having two children.

00:51:04.964 --> 00:51:09.230
And, number two, we also need
to know whether there was a

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.660
cultural and infrastructural
change.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.690
[INAUDIBLE] changing attitude
towards girl's education and

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:19.572
more schools perhaps in rural
areas, for which, you know,

00:51:19.572 --> 00:51:23.448
girls always tend to pick up
any opportunity much better

00:51:23.448 --> 00:51:25.250
than boys do.

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:26.452
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:51:26.452 --> 00:51:28.250
So that's an excellent point.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:31.430
Let me start with the second
point, whether things changed.

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:34.150
That's the advantage of
comparing the relaxed versus

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.640
non relaxed.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.252
Things probably would
have changed in

00:51:36.252 --> 00:51:38.170
parallel in the two places.

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:42.082
The first point is
quite important.

00:51:42.082 --> 00:51:43.820
Yeah, that's a bit late.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.506
You can't show up at 2:00.

00:51:45.506 --> 00:51:47.298
Sorry.

00:51:47.298 --> 00:51:49.790
The first point is very
important, which is it's not

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:51.090
going from six to seven.

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:53.500
It's really going
from one to two.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:57.240
And so there are two things
that are relevant here,

00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.310
something which you also kind
of alluded to earlier.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:04.040
One is we know that being
a single child is

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.390
not that much fun.

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:08.130
And maybe going from one to two
is good, but going from

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:09.500
four to five is bad.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.070
So maybe we are not learning
about what we're really

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:15.540
interested, which is whether
families would reduce from

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:22.980
five to three by looking at
the one to two phenomenon.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.540
So that's very, very true.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:30.210
The second thing is all of these
children are girls who

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:33.120
are acquiring a brother.

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.650
And in a culture which is not
very favorable to girls, it

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:39.870
might be very good to have a
brother for a girl because

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:42.070
then the family is going
to send the kid--

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:43.270
I think that's kind
of related to what

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:44.580
you were saying anyway.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.930
The family's going to send
the little boy to school.

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:51.490
Well, I might as well send the
girl with the boy anyway.

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:54.250
You know, instead of competing
for the resources, people

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:55.650
actually drag themselves.

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:58.330
You need someone to bring the
boy to school and there you

00:52:58.330 --> 00:52:59.330
have the older sister.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:00.930
That's kind of convenient.

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:04.400
So what we're learning from
this may not be actually--

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:09.620
I think we are learning that
having second child, for girls

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:12.940
in China, having a brother
was actually a good deal.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.710
But whether this is telling us
about the quality quantity

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:18.480
trade off more generally, I
think you're right to be

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.332
suspicious.

00:53:20.332 --> 00:53:22.276
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
if there's selection bias.

00:53:22.276 --> 00:53:26.650
So for families that have the
boy first time around, is it

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:28.594
possible [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:28.594 --> 00:53:31.024
going on?

00:53:31.024 --> 00:53:34.440
So if there are two children,
it sort of shows that you

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:38.002
value girls and would be more
likely to send them to school.

00:53:38.002 --> 00:53:39.330
Does that make sense at all?

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:39.730
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:39.910
Yes.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:41.590
You might have this problem.

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:45.700
And it would become problem if
the selection bias changed

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:48.070
over time, which is at the
beginning you have no

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:50.450
selection bias because
there is no abortion.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:52.740
Towards the end you have more
and more abortion so the

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:56.420
families that still have a girl
are the ones who care

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.020
more about girls.

00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.670
And that could be different.

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.350
So the thing is that it should
be different in a relaxed and

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:04.660
non relaxed area to
create a problem.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.910
But if we are thinking that
the relaxed areas are the

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:13.710
areas where the bias was the
worse to start with then this

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:17.670
bias gets more and more chances
to express itself over

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:20.080
time because the abortion
becomes available.

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.900
And so that might also
create a bias.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.020
So these two points are
both excellent points.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.060
But they are different points.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:30.950
One is that these might be a
bias in estimating the effect.

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:34.420
And yours is a point about the
interpretation, which I think

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.510
is quite valid.

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:38.323
[INAUDIBLE].

00:54:38.323 --> 00:54:40.041
AUDIENCE: This doesn't tell us
anything about average levels

00:54:40.041 --> 00:54:41.680
of education again,
though, right?.

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.060
PROFESSOR: No.

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:42.980
This is all in differences.

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:43.265
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:43.265 --> 00:54:48.082
So if girls get, say, a year
of education now where they

00:54:48.082 --> 00:54:52.491
got zero years of education
before, the difference is made

00:54:52.491 --> 00:54:54.800
up, whereas boys get, say,
10 years of education.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.070
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:56.510
This tells you nothing
about the difference

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:57.910
between girls and boys.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:01.830
This tells you that whatever
this difference was and

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:03.150
whatever this difference--

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.480
it used to be bigger.

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.380
Girls used to be more
disadvantaged in the relaxed

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.774
areas before the relaxation
happened and after.

00:55:12.774 --> 00:55:14.619
AUDIENCE: I was just thinking,
if for boys there was no

00:55:14.619 --> 00:55:16.710
change but boys were still
getting a high level of

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:19.662
education, this doesn't
really say anything.

00:55:19.662 --> 00:55:22.614
But also if girls who were
getting zero education now are

00:55:22.614 --> 00:55:25.580
getting one year, that also
doesn't seem that significant.

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:26.680
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.440
That is always like whatever
the outcome versus the-- it

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.730
turns out, I think, that in
China once they're born, it's

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:38.450
not that girls get very
different level of education.

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:42.570
So in that sense, I don't know
what the levels are.

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:44.730
But I don't think they're quite
different to start with.

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:46.540
So those are all excellent
points.

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:52.180
So all that to say that
maybe this is--

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.560
I agree with you.

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.200
In fact, I put [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.460
point on the slide.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.100
Your other points were
also well taken.

00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.520
Maybe that's not the
end of the world.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.100
That's not the end
of the story.

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.070
This is definitely probably
the opposite of what would

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:04.800
have been expected.

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.110
I'm sure it's quite the
opposite of what

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:08.490
she expected to find.

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:11.980
So here is one more normal
example where it's not the one

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.270
child policy.

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:16.580
We are not forcing you to abort
the child that you don't

00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.420
like the gender of, et cetera.

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:24.140
That's the ICDDR,B program in
Bangladesh where they provided

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:27.370
women in treatment areas
with regular access to

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:30.040
contraceptives, a community
health worker that visits

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.450
women at home regularly,
et cetera.

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:35.280
And they did this program
pretty constantly

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.125
since the late '70s.

00:56:37.125 --> 00:56:41.160
It went on and on and on and
it's still going on today.

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:44.730
And that program was effective
after really insisting, very

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:47.440
effective in reducing the
number of children.

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:51.070
At the beginning it was
the most effective.

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:55.540
And then this effectiveness
went down, not because the

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.980
number of birth increased a lot
in the program area, but

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.620
because the number of birth
declined everywhere and

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.650
everywhere in Bangladesh very
fast during the period.

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:07.040
So at the end of the day the
effectiveness of this program

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.370
is a bit contested in that it
might just have accelerated a

00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:11.150
trend that would have
happened anyway.

00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:15.450
But regardless, it provides us a
good window into what is the

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:20.380
effect of a smaller family
because by 1996 women in

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:25.130
treatment area had 1.2 fewer
children than women in the

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:27.750
control area, out
of an average of

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:30.450
perhaps four or five.

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:32.800
So that's not an insignificant
change.

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:36.650
And there we are very much
closer to the type of

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:40.070
evaluation that you wanted to
see, which is if I reduce from

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:45.100
five to four, do I see a
difference in the outcomes?

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:48.310
Another thing the program did
is to provide very good

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:51.120
prenatal and postnatal
care to the kids.

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.100
Immunization, oral rehydration
solution,

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.720
et cetera, et cetera.

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:59.080
So one outcome that you don't
get is that kids are much more

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.160
likely to die in infancy.

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.440
That's fine.

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:06.120
But that may not be an effect
of having fewer families

00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.640
because all these external
inputs were

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.780
given at the same time.

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:14.730
In 1996, a group of researchers
led by [? RAND ?]

00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:18.470
went back to the area and did
a very detailed survey of

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:20.310
everybody living in both
treatment and control

00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:23.830
villages, which is available
on the web.

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:26.420
So that is something
which people can--

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.610
if we want to do, like,
undergraduate projects or

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.670
whatever involving data, that
should be a good source of

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:32.670
data, very rich.

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:35.880
And first they look, of course,
is to look at whether

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:39.450
you find any affect on the
quality of the children who

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:42.600
were born during this period
in treatment area and in

00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.090
control area, given that in
treatment they lived in a much

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:46.790
smaller family.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.600
And what they find is no
difference, no difference in

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.900
height, no difference in weight,
no difference in

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.770
school enrollment, no difference
in years of

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.470
education, nothing.

00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:01.900
So, again, here it's your most,
like, kind of classical

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:07.640
example of effective population
control of family.

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.240
A lot of the argument that you
guys discussed in the context

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.970
of the one child policy
can't really be made.

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:14.930
It's not Israel.

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:16.860
We can't say it's a rich
country that is able to

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.080
educate all these kids.

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.870
And, again, we find no effect.

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:20.830
Yeah.

00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:22.750
AUDIENCE: I thought this was
really interesting because it

00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:24.190
kind of ties into what
we've discussed

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:26.920
throughout the class.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.385
I thought there has to be more
inputs into this equation.

00:59:30.385 --> 00:59:34.345
So if students or parents are
more educated on the effects

00:59:34.345 --> 00:59:38.800
of how their children could
potentially benefit from more

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:42.760
years of education then you
would expect if they reduce

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.575
the number of children, the
children would get more years

00:59:44.575 --> 00:59:45.235
of education.

00:59:45.235 --> 00:59:47.710
But if the parents weren't
necessarily educated on that

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.937
and didn't see the benefits
of it, then they just may

00:59:49.937 --> 00:59:54.310
substitute away from the
research they would expend on

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:57.170
an additional child
[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.570
or--

00:59:57.570 --> 00:59:58.370
I don't know.

00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:01.810
Something other than the things
we're looking at here.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:01.980
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.980
So one possibility is that
that's going back to the

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.820
argument we are making about
Malthus is maybe the pie is

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.860
actually not fixed because as
you have more children, well,

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.720
you're going to spend more
money on the children.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.650
And as you have fewer children,
you're spending less

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:21.090
money on the children so that
what determines how much you

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:25.090
decide to invest in the child is
less the number of children

01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:28.080
you have total but what you
think the returns to this

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.550
investment is going to be.

01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:34.470
And another thing is that in a
lot of cases the investment

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:38.070
that we are talking about, they
are not so much money

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:42.540
because even in Bangladesh
school is largely free.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.875
Maybe keeping a child, you know,
nourishing your child

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:45.940
is, of course, not free.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.140
But it's not very, very
expensive compared to other

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.290
things you could do.

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:55.710
So maybe what we see is that
there is not so much of a

01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:58.280
fixed budget constraint for
how much you can afford to

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.500
spend on your children.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.070
But it's a whole family
constraint.

01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:07.010
And what is determined in
children investment is less

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:09.950
how much money do you have or
how much time do you have, but

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:12.260
how you decide to allocate this
budget, which corresponds

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:16.580
more to the perception of cost
and benefits as we've seen in

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.580
all of our previous lectures.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.440
So maybe you're right and maybe
we should have expected

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.530
that, and it just didn't
tie into things.

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:24.005
Yeah.

01:01:24.005 --> 01:01:26.380
AUDIENCE: Maybe one way to look
at it is to look at the

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.068
effect on everyone else in the
family, like the parents.

01:01:30.068 --> 01:01:33.175
Because, I guess, maybe a mom
would feed her children the

01:01:33.175 --> 01:01:34.848
same as how many children
she has.

01:01:34.848 --> 01:01:37.716
But, it would affect, like you
said, that overall budget

01:01:37.716 --> 01:01:38.690
[INAUDIBLE].

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:42.112
PROFESSOR: So that is discussed
a little bit in the

01:01:42.112 --> 01:01:42.390
chapter you read.

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:48.110
So what did people find when
they looked at the mothers?

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:49.700
AUDIENCE: The women in the
treatment areas ended

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.390
up with more jobs.

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.358
I don't remember if they
had [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:55.358 --> 01:01:55.860
or not.

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:58.370
PROFESSOR: So in Matlab, what
you find is the mother in the

01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:00.610
treatment areas are more
likely to work and

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:04.810
their BMI is higher.

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:09.180
And then there was this other
study from Colombia, which we

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:12.200
are going to see in a minute,
which showed a modest

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:17.050
reduction in the number of
children but also a lot of

01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:18.900
effect on the timing of children
where people are

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.820
having children later.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:25.140
And you find large effect on
women's education and woman's

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.330
job market participation.

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:31.680
So I think that's where you do
find it's exactly what you're

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.640
saying is happening, which is
that the pie expands and

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.750
contracts with the number
of children.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.690
And, of course, something
else gives in.

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:43.169
But that's maybe the
mom for example.

01:02:43.169 --> 01:02:46.620
AUDIENCE: One of the things that
was brought was the idea

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.071
that children are kind of used
like pension plans in a way.

01:02:50.071 --> 01:02:54.508
And if you have less children
you save more [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:54.508 --> 01:03:02.396
Has there been any studies
looking at difference in

01:03:02.396 --> 01:03:05.600
governments, if it's more of a
socialist government and how

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.819
much social security
they give and then

01:03:07.819 --> 01:03:09.820
relate that to fertility?

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.650
PROFESSOR: So it's
a great question.

01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:15.240
And the quick answer to that
question is, surprisingly, no.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.070
So if you've read the book
carefully, you notice that we

01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:22.230
talked about the effect of
family planning and we talk

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:26.040
about the effect of culture or
social norms and stuff like

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.790
that, which I'm going
to do in a minute.

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:30.670
And then when we want to talk
about economics, we start

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:33.380
looking at the opposite research
is people who have

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.960
more children save less, or
people who have fewer

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.850
children save more.

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:40.660
So we switch the equation
suddenly, and therefore we

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:46.100
don't provide evidence that if
there is a Social Security

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.810
introduced or better insurance,
essentially people

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:51.150
have to fewer children.

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:56.410
We make the argument, but we
actually have no study that

01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:57.380
directly supports
this argument.

01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:00.070
We only have the opposite
studies, that people who have

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.940
fewer children save more.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.160
And so that is likely.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.230
That, I think, actually would
be a very nice study to do.

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:19.300
So that was for the first part
of the argument that large

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.120
families are bad.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:27.340
And so by the end of whatever
literature there is right now,

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.590
we are yet to see any smoking
gun for that one.

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:34.750
The second part of the argument
is people cannot

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:37.850
control their fertility.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:41.930
The not so nice version is the
cartoon I showed you where

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:44.040
basically they can't control
their fertility because they

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.310
are idiots.

01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:48.420
And the nicer version, at least
the more politically

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:51.130
correct version, is they can't
control their fertility

01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:54.160
because access to contraception
is difficult.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.590
So let's test that.

01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:58.900
What's the impact of making
contraceptive available on

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:01.450
reducing family size?

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:03.310
I mentioned that program
a moment ago.

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:05.680
It's a program that was
introduced by Colombia by a

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.450
young doctor.

01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:07.780
Well, eventually he aged.

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.070
But in the beginning
he was young.

01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:11.550
There was nothing before him.

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:14.950
And there was a big reduction
in fertility in Colombia

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:19.070
between the time that he
introduced his program and

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:21.150
when it was fully expended.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.275
Fertility in Colombia
reduced from about--

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.450
you must remember that I showed
it yesterday-- seven

01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:34.240
children per woman to about
three children per woman

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.190
between the 1960s
and the 1990s.

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:38.900
Now, fertility declined
in all of the

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.490
Latin American countries.

01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:42.780
But it declined much
faster in Colombia.

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.040
Colombia used to be the country
in Latin America with

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.410
the highest number of
children per woman.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.180
And it switched to being the one
with the lowest number of

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.290
children per woman.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:55.110
I think it was the second
highest, and went to become

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:56.550
the second lowest.

01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:59.560
So is it due to the program?

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.850
Of course, many other
things happened in

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:01.810
Colombia at that time.

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:04.730
So it may or may not be
due to the program.

01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:11.270
So to look at the effect, young
professor in Stanford

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:15.305
named Grant Miller looked at the
way the program expanded.

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:20.140
And what he argued is that the
doctor had limited resources

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.210
and he didn't have a strong view
about where the program

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:24.320
should be put in place because
he wanted the program to be

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.730
put in place everywhere
anyway.

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:29.920
So whenever he had a chance
somewhere, he would go.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.910
So what he argues is that we
can compare women who had

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:36.510
access to women who didn't have
access at various periods

01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:38.100
in their life.

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:42.190
And then because maybe you don't
want to fully believe

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:44.420
this argument, he says,
well, that's fine.

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:49.060
Let's also look at how has
this changed over time.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:56.160
So let's compare a woman who was
born later in the places

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.650
that got the family program
later to a woman who was born

01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:02.560
earlier in a place that got
the family program later.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.020
So the second woman didn't get
to benefit from the program,

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.035
and the first did.

01:07:06.035 --> 01:07:09.300
And if you combine the two
sources of variation, you get

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.950
some idea of what was the effect
of the family planning

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:16.840
program, very much like the same
kind of strategy that we

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.350
used for the one child
policy in China.

01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:25.970
So here you have the results,
first in log number of births,

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:31.620
which telling you it's 11% fewer
children per woman who

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.410
got family planning access.

01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:36.170
Maybe it's easier to look at
this one, which is a number of

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:39.880
birth of kids born to a woman.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.090
This is when you just
assume that the

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:42.690
program is randomly assigned.

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:46.962
So compare places which got the
program early to places

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:48.150
that got the program later.

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:51.960
This is controlling for inherent
differences by using

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.105
the expansion.

01:07:53.105 --> 01:07:56.880
Now, it's also very similar, so
we can focus on this one.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.650
And that tells you that having
access to the program when you

01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:01.920
were young does have an effect,

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.330
very significant effect.

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:08.690
That's the t-statistic,
6.4% divided by 0.004.

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:11.010
The t-statistic is
through the roof.

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:12.810
That's extremely significant.

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:17.000
Shows you that a woman who had
access to the family planning

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:24.550
when she was 15 to 19 had about
6.4% fewer children.

01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:26.390
So that's very significant.

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:29.420
But is it very large?

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.279
It's very, very small.

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:34.380
It's less than one tenths
of a child per woman.

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.750
So it's like that much.

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:37.330
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:39.490
PROFESSOR: That's not a
big part of a child.

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:41.700
So it's not a very big effect,
even though it's very

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.350
precisely estimated.

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:46.910
The biggest effect are obtained
for teen, people who

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:49.500
got the program when they were
a teen and then a few when

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:54.270
they were 20 to 24 and 25 to
29 and then, of course, the

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:59.300
effect become lower because
after 35 most people are

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:02.140
finished, have completed
their fertility.

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:05.390
So what this tells us is, yes,
there is an effect of getting

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:06.550
access to contraception.

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:08.346
But it's tiny.

01:09:08.346 --> 01:09:09.479
It's tiny, tiny.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:13.120
It's like 5% of a child.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.979
That's not a big
effect at all.

01:09:15.979 --> 01:09:19.670
And, in fact, that corresponds
to a very small part of the

01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:23.420
overall trend in fertility
reduction in Colombia at the

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:27.130
time, about 1/10,
maximum 1/10.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:31.130
So this wasn't a
very big deal.

01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.340
So was this unique?

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.290
It was not very unique.

01:09:35.290 --> 01:09:38.760
Other program was submitted in
Indonesia which varies the

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.109
same type of idea, found
no effect at all.

01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:45.109
But I already spoke to you about
the Matlab the ICDDR,B

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:47.020
program in Bangladesh.

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:51.029
Matlab is not only a software
program, it's also a place,

01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:55.510
which is the place where
they did this program.

01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:59.740
And in Matlab I just told you
that the fertility got reduced

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.670
by the program.

01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:04.800
But there's two points
to make about Matlab.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:12.240
Number one, it was a very
intensive program where

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.640
someone came to the house
every other week.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.260
It's also a place where a lot of
women were in [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:22.010
So they were not allowed to
get outside of the home.

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:24.230
So it was harder for them to
access the contraception or

01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:27.010
even to know that it
was available.

01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:30.680
And this community health worker
was very dynamic, very

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.700
forward young women that were
going to everybody's family

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.310
and really trying to
convince them.

01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:39.090
So you would think that the
Matlab program is something

01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:40.560
else than access.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.390
It's also changing people's
preferences.

01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:44.880
That's point number one.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.155
Point number two, as I was
saying a minute ago, initially

01:10:49.155 --> 01:10:50.960
the effects were very large.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.985
But then the effect in
differences between treatment

01:10:53.985 --> 01:10:57.150
and control decline and decline
and decline because

01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:00.580
everywhere in Bangladesh,
including in the control area,

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.530
fertility declined anyway.

01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:06.050
So this is an extremely
expensive program, which by

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:09.280
the end of the day just
accelerated a trend that

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.020
happened in Bangladesh where the
reduction in fertility was

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.875
huge over the period and seemed
to have very little to

01:11:14.875 --> 01:11:16.920
do with this program but
everything to do with other

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.560
things that were happening
in Bangladesh.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:29.050
So it seems that contraception
plays a role but not a very

01:11:29.050 --> 01:11:33.620
big one, maybe an acceleration
role, maybe a small reduction

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.740
in fertility, maybe
a timing role.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.840
Of course, that doesn't mean
that you don't want to have

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.390
contraception available because
it is much nicer to

01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:45.750
control your fertility with
contraception than without.

01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:47.610
And the timing is
also important.

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:51.340
So I'm not here advocating we
should stop spending any

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.240
effort trying to make
contraception available.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:57.440
Just to say that as a population
control policy,

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.330
paradoxically it's pretty
ineffective, which means that

01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:04.010
if you wanted to control family
planning policy, you

01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:07.160
would have to understand why
people make the decision they

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.240
make because it seems that they
are able to make their

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.290
decision and then they
will stick to them.

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:14.230
And if you make contraception
available, they'll use the

01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:15.660
contraception to
stick to them.

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:18.190
And if you don't, they'll
anyway find a way.

01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:21.170
So we need to go further in
understanding the decision,

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.980
which we'll do next time.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.198
You.

01:12:26.198 --> 01:12:29.120
AUDIENCE: Just a small thought
that maybe it's possible that

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.392
as long as the program's in
place, everyone heard about

01:12:31.392 --> 01:12:35.938
it, and this brought the subject
of not having as many

01:12:35.938 --> 01:12:40.471
children closer to mind, and
that helped anyway despite not

01:12:40.471 --> 01:12:41.710
directly helping.

01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:41.990
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.120
So we'll discuss that.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:47.300
Except that I don't think the
discussion went much further.

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.620
In fact, there is a paper I will
discuss briefly next time

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.530
where the discussion
is very narrow.

01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:55.400
It's like people from
you compound and you

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.320
discuss with them.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.110
Even within treatment villages
we see the differences.

01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:00.481
Yep.

01:13:00.481 --> 01:13:01.699
AUDIENCE: I was
[? really flustered ?] in the

01:13:01.699 --> 01:13:03.223
same thing.

01:13:03.223 --> 01:13:05.845
Is that the kind of acceleration
that you're

01:13:05.845 --> 01:13:06.835
talking about?

01:13:06.835 --> 01:13:08.815
That, like, having this program
in place caused the

01:13:08.815 --> 01:13:10.300
rest of the country to have--

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.470
PROFESSOR: No.

01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:15.900
What I'm claiming is that if no
one had done any program in

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:19.610
Matlab, fertility in
Bangladesh would be

01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:21.080
today what it is.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.570
Matlab is a very small place
that technically didn't effect

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:24.930
the rest of Bangladesh.

01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:27.610
But what happened is that
it was faster in

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:30.260
Matlab because of the--

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.840
that said, both of you make a
good point about social norms

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.300
that may have shifted in part.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:37.210
I think Matlab was too small to
make any big impact on the

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:38.370
rest of Bangladesh.

01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:42.750
So what it did is that people
were running a race in the

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:43.370
family reduction.

01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:46.970
And the Matlab people arrived
a little bit earlier.

01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:48.730
But they didn't arrive
much faster.

01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:53.604
You had a point?

01:13:53.604 --> 01:13:54.572
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:54.572 --> 01:13:55.056
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:13:55.056 --> 01:13:58.120
So we'll stop here and pick up
again on decisions next time.
