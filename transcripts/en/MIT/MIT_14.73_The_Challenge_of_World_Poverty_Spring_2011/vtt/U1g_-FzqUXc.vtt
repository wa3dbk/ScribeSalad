00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.330
PROFESSOR: So I think we have
a bit of background in mind.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.570
So now I'm going to summarize
this discussion, and start

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.580
asking about how do we go about
answering some of the

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.450
questions that have
come about?

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.910
So at the end of last lecture,
we were left with our S-shaped

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.560
curve, and saying that whether
or not there would be a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.190
poverty trap was really
dependent on the shape of the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.910
curve that relates income today
to income tomorrow.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.340
And we gave sent out examples
where it could go one way or

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.400
the other, or it could be that
its S shape, it could be that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.160
it's increasing but
inverted L-shape.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.220
And then one of you asked
the question,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.860
well, how do we know?

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.830
How do we even get about--

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.560
how do we get to know the
shape of the curve?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.440
This is not a question that
is going to be solved

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.280
theoretically.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.310
The debate we just had a moment
ago suggested it won't

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.680
be solved theoretically.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.760
Because, for example, take the
question of whether if I give

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.930
you a bed net for free today,
you're less likely to buy the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.190
next one tomorrow.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.350
It depends on whether the
entitlement effect is more

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.660
important than the
loaning effect.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.720
And how will I know that?

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.200
There is no way for me
to know it without

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.160
looking at the data.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.500
And the question is, what's a
good way to look at the data?

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.410
And today, we're going to look
at one such way, which is a

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.230
way which is increasingly often
used by development

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.370
economists, by policy makers,
and which is the main approach

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.290
that we are using in the Poverty
Action Lab, which is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.390
the idea of on randomized
evaluation.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.690
So we'll start with our
malaria example.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.550
I'm going to use the malaria
example, because we had the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.410
debate, so we know the question
we're asking.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.580
I'm going to use that
as our example.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.080
But, of course, the point I'm
making now are important

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.200
methodological points as well.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.560
So what are we talking about?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.230
We're talking about a pretty
important thing.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.700
Almost 900,000 people die of
malaria every year, give and

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.370
take, most of them in Africa,
most of them under five.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.240
That's the biggest cause
of under-five

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.780
mortality in the world.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.730
Incidentally, you want to take
every single statistic with a

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.080
big pinch of salt, because it's
not that all the malaria

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.750
cases are recorded--

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.000
a lot of people who are not
really diagnosed of malaria

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.040
and are told to be dead of
malaria, so it could be a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.930
gross overestimate or a
gross underestimate.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.042
But I think it's fair to say
it's a lot of people, one way

00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:13.292
or the other.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.250
As we discussed, malaria is
transmitted by mosquitoes who

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.280
carry the parasite from an
infected person to an

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.810
uninfected person,
mainly at dusk.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.130
So sleeping under a bed net,
particularly a bed net which

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.550
has insecticide woven into the
fiber of the bed net is an

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.490
effective way to prevent
mosquito bites, and therefore

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.150
to prevent the transmission
of malaria.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.450
And one thing that no one said,
which was important, is

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.660
that there is two effects of
sleeping under a bed net.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.410
If you already don't have
malaria, you're less likely to

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.600
catch it, because the mosquitoes
can't bite you.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.690
So this is a direct benefit
that benefits you.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.650
So when making the decision to
buy or not buy a bed net when

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.510
making the decision to use the
bed net or not to use it, you

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.920
are going to take this direct
benefit into account, right?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.529
But then there is another
benefit which is the

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.810
externality, which is an
indirect effect, which is, if

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.880
you already have malaria,
someone else is less likely to

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.605
get it because they don't
first bite you

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:31.310
and then bite them.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.480
And this benefit, unless
you're an incredibly

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.520
socially-minded person, is a
benefit you don't take into

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.420
account when buying
your bed net.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.300
Because you don't care.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.660
It's not you.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.830
It's someone else.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.810
But as society, we are trying to
maybe adjust the individual

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.350
behavior to the social
benefit.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.180
There's one more thing which is
important for us to keep in

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.600
mind, which is this externality
is not linear.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.830
So it could be that the
externality is linear, which

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.460
is one more person who sleeps
under a bed net, say half a

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.410
fewer percent is infected.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.870
So it could be like the more
bed nets you have, the less

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.010
malaria you have, but in
a disproportional way.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.736
But it turns out that it's
not proportional.

00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:22.050
The reason why it's not
proportionally is because once

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.290
about half the population sleeps
under the bed net, you

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.050
have something called hard
immunity, which is that the

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.280
mosquitoes don't have time to
bite someone else before

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.140
either the mosquito or
the parasite dies.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.450
So if you manage to cover about
half of your population,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.710
you don't even need to
carry the other half.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.020
I mean, it's better,
but they already

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.300
benefit almost as much.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.320
So the externality benefits are
like this, if you want.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.220
They're like, first they're
linear, and then at some

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.770
point, they have a big jump in
the externality benefits.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.560
And then again, going from
80% to 85%, maybe less.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.230
So that means that this would
need to be reminding you of

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.920
the S-shaped thing, which is
there will be a distinct

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.100
advantage in terms of cost per
malaria averted, the benefit

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.380
of going from a coverage of 25%
to 30% of the population

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.720
are going to be lower than the
benefit of going, say, from

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.950
45% to 50%.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.540
Because when you go from 45%
to 50%, you're in the zone

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.360
where every extra bed net is
really helping a huge deal.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.990
So that is going to
be relevant when

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.240
we do the cost benefit.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.650
So that's the case
for bed nets.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.380
So now, if we were traditional
economists, we would make a

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.140
traditional economic argument,
which is to say, there is an

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.570
externality.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.920
Whenever there is an
externality, we want to try to

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.460
do use prices or taxes to align
the private incentive

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.330
with the public incentive.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.170
That's why, for example,
we would like to have a

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.440
congestion charge in London, or
we have a congestion charge

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.080
in London to make it expensive
to drive your car in London,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.530
in the center of London, because
when you drive your

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.535
car in the center of London,
that's a pain

00:07:22.535 --> 00:07:23.785
for everybody else.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.120
That could be one of the reasons
why we have taxes on

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.710
cigarettes, that smokers impose
an externality on the

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.900
rest of the people, here both
because of secondhand smoking,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.110
and because they
get sick a lot.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.250
So you would think that society
has a right to impose

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:50.750
a tax on them to try and
discourage them from smoking.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:56.550
So by using prices and taxes is
where you can try and align

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.260
the private incentive to
the social benefit.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:07:59.610
Yes?

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.005
AUDIENCE: Can you do community
incentives, like you tell the

00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:04.879
community if everyone uses their
bed nets as bed nets,

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:07.760
you'll give the community a
certain number of fishing nets

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.168
so that people will encourage
or force other

00:08:10.168 --> 00:08:11.500
people to use bed nets?

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.150
ESTHER DUFLO: Right.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.860
So one way is the prices, but
another way could be to have

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.110
community incentives.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.670
Indonesia has a program where
they are trying to give

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:30.170
community incentive so if, say
90% percent of the community

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.000
is immunized, and x percent to
the community is in school,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.770
then they get some amount of
money to build a road, or an

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.140
irrigation project, or
something like that.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:41.420
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.930
How much is given in foreign
aid to fight malaria?

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.800
ESTHER DUFLO: That's an
excellent-- how much is given

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.870
in foreign aid to
fight malaria.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.990
It's an excellent question, the
answer to which I don't

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.728
know off the top of my head,
but it's findable.

00:08:54.728 --> 00:08:57.540
AUDIENCE: Because I was going
to ask if the cost of

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.112
providing a country with bed
nets is significantly less

00:09:01.112 --> 00:09:04.840
than the cost of giving
[INAUDIBLE] money to fight

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.816
malaria, then I don't even
see why it's as big of a

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:10.307
debate as it is.

00:09:10.307 --> 00:09:12.626
Clearly, they should figure out
what's the most effective

00:09:12.626 --> 00:09:16.768
way to distribute the bed nets,
make sure [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:16.768 --> 00:09:20.247
But the option of not giving
them just wouldn't make as

00:09:20.247 --> 00:09:22.235
much sense, in terms of
cost [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.120
ESTHER DUFLO: Oh, I see.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.240
So providing bed nets
would be part of the

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.490
budget of fighting malaria.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.450
So your question is that, if
we're already spending so much

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.380
money on medicine against
malaria, we would really be

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.440
willing to spend a lot
of money on bed nets.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.660
You're exactly right.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:46.050
And I don't think the debate
is that we want to try and

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.660
save money on the bed nets.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.770
I think the debate is always
about what's the best way to

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.080
get the money out.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.420
So this would argue, so the
fact that the private

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.350
incentive to get your bed net
is low, would argue for

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:08.530
subsidizing the bed net, but
only if the private incentives

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.760
are not large enough that people
are already not buying

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.860
your bed net.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.330
So suppose, for example, that
people hated being sick,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.700
which, presumably, they do.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.910
Then, they would get
the bed net anyway.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.770
You would not need to subsidize
the bed net.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.020
So there would not be an effect
of the price, because

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.430
the demand would be very
high at any price.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.030
So the fact that there is
an externality justifies

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.120
subsidizing, to the extent that
the private incentives

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:44.890
are too small for people to want
to get them themselves.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:50.060
Another traditional economics
argument would be the learning

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.960
argument that was made earlier,
which is that trying

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.300
your bed net once might give you
the experience of it, and

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.260
once you knew how it works,
and you know how well it

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.530
protects your children, you
might be more likely to get

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.950
the next one.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.970
And then there is an argument
that mixes the two, which is

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.820
another externality argument,
which is, if try a bed net,

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.520
and I realize that it protects
my children and it's really

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.030
not so unpleasant, then maybe my
neighbors will also see my

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.730
bed net, and say, oh,
isn't this cool.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.350
We want also a bed net.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.060
So there is an externality in
my trying, potentially.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.050
Yeah?

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.772
AUDIENCE: But if you were
charged for bed nets and the

00:11:30.772 --> 00:11:34.485
borrower that could, again, come
in to have the bed nets

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:35.735
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.950
ESTHER DUFLO: Yes.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:49.200
So eventually, since there are
those contingent benefits,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.470
someone who is very rational
might feel, already more than

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.620
50% bed nets in this
community.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.780
I don't need to get
the next one.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.520
So the private incentives
diminish as the coverage

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.260
increases, which makes it more
necessary either to subsidize

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:10.510
it even more, or to tax people
if they don't get a bed net.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.090
So this is an argument that
is made for immunization.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:19.360
So in this country, immunization
is compulsory for

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.990
a range of diseases.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.630
Except if you really don't want
to do it because you have

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:29.940
some religious or whatever
reasons for not wanting to be

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.080
immunized, then you can say,
sorry, I refuse the

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.890
immunization.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:44.600
And people worry that as
diseases such as polio, or

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.450
diphtheria, or pertussis, these
types of diseases become

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.980
less frequent, people don't have
the fear of getting those

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.750
diseases anymore, and they want
to free ride on the rest

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.800
of the community.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.780
And that's, of course, bad,
because being 100% immunized

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.440
ensures that the disease
goes away.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.480
As soon as a few people
are not immunized,

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.930
it could come back.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:13.820
And so there is this tension
between once almost everyone's

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.670
immunized, your private
incentive to do

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.080
it are almost zero.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:23.180
So you might need powerful
inducement to get to do it.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.080
So those are the traditional
economic arguments.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.620
These are your traditional
public finance--

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.960
let's use the prices.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.870
That indicates that we should
subsidize the bed nets.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.390
And by the way, there
is no reason to

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.740
stop at zero in principle.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.480
We could pay people to use bed
nets, for that matter, if this

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.250
was the way to get the optimal
coverage in the community.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.228
Yeah?

00:13:46.228 --> 00:13:49.406
AUDIENCE: So one consideration
that comes to mind is if

00:13:49.406 --> 00:13:51.607
there's a segment of the
population that is really,

00:13:51.607 --> 00:13:54.378
really poor and cannot afford to
pay any amount for the bed

00:13:54.378 --> 00:13:56.110
nets, whether they're subsidized
or not, those

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.830
people are also the least likely
to be able to pay for

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.244
health care should
they get malaria.

00:14:00.244 --> 00:14:02.940
So they would have the greatest
risk for everyone

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.235
else and for themselves.

00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:06.760
So wouldn't you want to try to
provide free bed nets for that

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.320
set of people, no matter what?

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.450
ESTHER DUFLO: Right, so that's
another consideration that you

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.730
might want to include, a
redistribution consideration,

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:24.540
which you might feel that people
who are particularly

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.435
poor might have a very high
private evaluation of the bed

00:14:27.435 --> 00:14:30.320
nets, but might be credit
constrained and not be able to

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.440
get the bed net.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.880
And those are the same people
who will also not be able to

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.530
cure themselves of malaria.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.420
So here, that gives you
another argument for

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.580
subsidizing bed nets, which is
not an argument in terms of

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.380
disease eradication, but
an argument in terms of

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.560
redistribution between people.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.400
So those are traditional
arguments.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.450
They are taken, say, by Jeff
Sachs, or by the WHO, and say,

00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:00.350
we should subsidize bed net
to a large extent, or

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.870
potentially, up to giving
them away for free.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.210
And then we have the less
conventional economics, which

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:13.070
we discussed, which has the
argument that goes in the

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.630
opposite direction, or the
psychological sunk cost

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.410
effect, which is, you have to
pay for something to really

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.780
appreciate its value.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.350
There is a selection effect
which is, if you give things

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.650
away for free, even people who
don't want it or who don't

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.630
want it for its legitimate use
are going to come and get it.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.950
They're going to waste
a lot of bed nets.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.190
And finally, the entitlement
effect, which counters the

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.390
learning effect, which is, once
you get something for

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.160
free, then you expect to get
it for free in the future.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.960
And it might even have
contingent things, which is

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.400
you're not going to want to get
chlorine to purify your

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.690
water, unless someone
is giving it to you.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:59.380
You're not going to want to
send your kids to school

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.750
unless they get a school meal,
other things like that, which

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.210
find that you become
dependent.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:06.710
Yeah?

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:07.710
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.710
Couldn't you argue that it's not
sustainable, [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:15.210
long-term policy and exit
strategies, because if you're

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.210
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.710
subsidizing and giving away bed
nets, you might crowd out

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.710
the private sector.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:25.460
And you won't [INAUDIBLE] your
desired outcome, which is for

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.710
people to be using bed nets.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.840
ESTHER DUFLO: So in the
traditional public finance

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.140
argument, why would you
ever want to stop to

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.154
subsidize the bed net?

00:16:37.154 --> 00:16:38.480
AUDIENCE: Want to
not subsidize--

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:38.650
ESTHER DUFLO: Yeah.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:43.105
Why would you ever want to stop,
given those arguments?

00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:44.570
AUDIENCE: To create a market?

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.750
ESTHER DUFLO: Why would you?

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.360
Take, for example, immunization
in the US.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.830
Immunization is subsidized
and compulsory.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:56.450
Is there any plan to make
immunization not subsidized or

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.225
compulsory?

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:57.690
AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.290
ESTHER DUFLO: There's
no such plan.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.270
This kind of argument would
tell you that you want to

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:07.510
subsidize forever, because the
private gains and the social

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.970
gains are not aligned for a
fundamental reason, which is

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.670
my being protected by a bed net
protects you as well, and

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.660
that's never going to change.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.780
So in that sense, you're
not doing a policy

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.579
for the short run.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.450
You're doing this policy
for the long run.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.420
Now, again, we had this
discussion earlier, which is

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.079
the questions of who provides
the bed net, whether they can

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.630
be provided locally instead
of imported, are all very

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.770
legitimate questions, but in a
sense, unrelated to the price

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.040
you're going to charge.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.360
So that's an excellent question,
because it comes

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.280
back all the time, which
is to say, oh, but

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.720
don't we want to exit?

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.380
Just think, whenever you want to
ask yourself this question

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.680
about sustainability,
ask yourself, why

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.560
would I want to exit?

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.520
Maybe I don't.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.890
Maybe it is actually socially
efficient to subsidize

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:59.180
something for eternity, because
as Ben was saying, you

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:06.020
save on the cost of curing
people from malaria.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:11.100
So the argument that goes
against giving people for free

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.760
are these arguments that giving
bed nets for free or

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.240
even subsidizing them is
counterproductive, in terms of

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.940
distributing bed nets.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.860
It's counterproductive because
of the sunk cost effect,

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.140
because of the selection
effect, or because this

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.460
entitlement effect that then
nobody is ever going to want

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.004
to buy anything, either a bed
net or something else.

00:18:34.004 --> 00:18:40.970
And these elements are
very reasonable.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.300
Both sides of the arguments
are, in principle, very

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.480
reasonable.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.530
And they might apply here.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.250
We just don't know.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.140
It's a very heated
policy debate.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.520
The laws that are involved in
bed nets are nowhere near the

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.900
laws that are involved in oil or
anything, but it's still a

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.640
fair amount of dollars,
so people like those.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.270
So there is a lot of debate.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.650
So Jeff Sachs of the WHO relies
on the convention

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.330
economics argument to say
you should give the

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.080
bed nets for free.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.900
Then you have people like Bill
Easterly or Dambisa Moyo, who

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:18.820
are making the argument based
on this entitlement effect,

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.690
sunk cost effect, the
development of market, to say

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.540
we shouldn't give
them for free.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.790
And both arguments tell you,
in a sense, we know the

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.960
economics, and the answer
is obvious.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.360
There is no reason
to find out.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.070
And I think there is value in
both type of arguments that

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.670
they are making.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.380
But there is no value
in this last one.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.360
Because since there is value
in both arguments, we don't

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.010
know the answer.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:53.530
The answer depends on the
balance of how they turn out

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.505
in the specific application
of bed nets.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.810
So the true question we want to
ask is the extent to which

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.770
we should subsidize bed nets.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.080
And for that, what do
we need to know?

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.480
Well, first we need to know
whether or not bed nets are

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.490
really price elastic.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.230
So are we losing a lot of
coverage in terms of people

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:20.380
acquiring bed nets, if we start
selling them instead of

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.810
giving them for free.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.620
Second question we need
to ask is the

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.120
immediate effect on use.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.087
So is it the case that people
who pay for bed nets are more

00:20:31.087 --> 00:20:34.920
likely to use it than people
who got it for free?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.570
Third question is the
longer-term effect.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.610
Will it wreck markets?

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.050
And for that, that's the
entitlement effect.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.680
For people who get it for free,
in the future, are they

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.930
more or less likely
to buy one?

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.560
And for people who are around
them in the community--

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.870
this is something we didn't
discuss much, but if I'm

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.410
around you in the community,
and I see you having a free

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:02.210
bed net, it could affect
me in one of two ways.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:06.280
I could say, first of all,
oh, she has a bed net.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.170
That's really nice.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.160
Her kids are doing well.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.160
I'm going to get one too.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.070
I could say, oh, she
got a free bed net.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.510
Let me wait until I get--

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.730
I was going to buy a bed net,
but now I'm going to wait

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.550
until I get a free bed net.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.170
And so I wasn't going to sell
a bed net, and now I'm going

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.740
to have give it for free.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.190
So that's wasted money.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.380
So again, we don't know
which way it cuts.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.190
We have to look in practice.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.650
And those questions are pretty
well-defined questions.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.930
They are empirical questions
we could principally

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.280
bring an answer to.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.070
There are a lot of anecdotes.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:44.180
They are this one, which is bed
nets used as fishing nets.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.280
That's a picture that was in the
Malaria Journal, so it's

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.470
all peer reviewed
and all that.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:55.670
So this is the Easterly Dambisa
Moyo argument, that

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:59.300
you are going to see the used
as a fishing net, or wedding

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.020
veils, or what have you.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.880
And then this is the other
argument, of the other

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.750
anecdote of the bed net being
nicely hanged in the room, and

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.570
the child, the healthy child
who slept in there

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.500
under the bed net.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.910
So that's not too helpful.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.350
So we want to go further
that the anecdote.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.690
There are many anecdotes,
and they cut both ways.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.270
How do we go further
than the anecdote?

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.065
So the first thing we could
do-- so suppose you

00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:38.680
were given this job.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.816
I tell you, find out for me
whether people who get their

00:22:42.816 --> 00:22:45.470
bed nets for free are more
likely to use it as fishing

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:49.830
nets or more likely to
use them as bed nets.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.670
And also, find out whether if I
distribute the bed nets for

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.230
free, I distribute many more
of them or I distribute the

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.100
same amount.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.280
What would your first
response to what you

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.530
should go out and do?

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah?

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.070
I would find two similar
communities, and then

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.950
give bed nets would be one, and
maybe help someone start a

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.070
small business of selling
bed nets in the other.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.370
ESTHER DUFLO: So you would take
two similar communities,

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:27.870
and in once case, give bed
nets for free, and in one

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:32.340
case, start to sell them,
maybe by finding a small

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.010
business, or maybe importing
them to the village.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.320
What would be an even---

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.080
we'll go back to that.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.510
What would be an even easier,
even more immediate way to do

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:47.190
it that we could think of to
start with, if we needed to do

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.276
this quickly?

00:23:49.276 --> 00:23:49.748
Yes?

00:23:49.748 --> 00:23:50.456
AUDIENCE: Just look at the

00:23:50.456 --> 00:23:53.524
communities where it is already.

00:23:53.524 --> 00:23:53.996
ESTHER DUFLO: Right.

00:23:53.996 --> 00:23:56.270
You would look at a community
where this is already in

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.090
place, and you would say, well,
in this community, the

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.365
bed nets are given for free, and
in this community, the bed

00:24:02.365 --> 00:24:04.070
nets are sold.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.590
Let me try my thing.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.780
Yeah.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.800
In this community, the bed
nets are given for free.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.240
In this community, the
bed nets are sold.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.960
First question, do I see more
bed nets where the bed nets

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.230
are not given for free?

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.140
Second question, do I see the
bed nets more likely to be

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.790
used as fishing nets in
those communities?

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:27.150
So that's, I think, what
most people would--

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.260
that would be your
initial instinct.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.230
The problem you would have if
you did that, as opposed to--

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.870
sorry, can you remind
of your name?

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:36.820
AUDIENCE: [? Sif. ?]

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:36.960
ESTHER DUFLO: [? Sif. ?]

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.160
The problem to do that, as
opposed to do what [? Sif ?]

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:46.740
suggested, is to know why some
community happened to be the

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.110
one that got them for free and
some community happened not to

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.270
have the free distribution.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.540
So let's think of one reason
why there might be a free--

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.190
if you were to start a free bed
net distribution program

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.240
somewhere, where would
you start it?

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.730
You have a country and you want
to start a free bed net

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.330
distribution, what
would you pick?

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:07.610
Yes?

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:08.951
AUDIENCE: If there was
a particularly bad

00:25:08.951 --> 00:25:10.740
increase, or something.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.140
ESTHER DUFLO: Right.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.010
You would try to pick a place
where there is a lot of

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.030
malaria, presumably, or
maybe a place where

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.770
people are very poor.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:25.580
So let's work with the example
where you would pick, to start

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.080
your free bed net distribution,
the region where

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.790
there is a lot of malaria.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.040
It would make sense.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.720
So if that's the case that free
bed nets are distributed

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.400
where malaria is a huge problem,
then in these places,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.660
even if they had to pay for the
bed net, they might have

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.780
purchased them more willingly
than in places where malaria

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.490
is not such a big
problem anyway.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.180
Because the private benefits of
having a bed net is higher

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.110
in those [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.810
So this is what we call the
counter-factual, which is what

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.190
would have happened in the place
where the bed net got

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:08.280
distributed for free if they
had actually been sold.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.010
So let's look at it in the
form of a simple graph.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.100
So suppose we have two--

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.800
we are going to do the argument
for purchase, and the

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.500
same kind of discussion
we could have for use.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.970
So suppose we have two regions,
a high-malaria region

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.040
and a low-malaria region.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:31.000
And suppose that God told us
this is how many people would

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.750
buy a bed net, the fraction of
people who would buy a bed net

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:39.380
in the high-malaria region and
the low-malaria region, if the

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.130
bed net was not subsidized.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:48.570
And this dot is higher, because
since malaria is more

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.620
of a problems, people are more
willing to buy bed nets.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.100
OK?

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.500
So that's what we would have
if bed nets were expensive.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:03.550
And if bed nets were free,
we would have those ones.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:06.310
So compared to the previous
dots, they are higher.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.730
Why are they higher
in both regions?

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.550
AUDIENCE: It's because
they're free.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.270
ESTHER DUFLO: Because they're
free, so you're more likely to

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.285
get something free than
to have to pay for it.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.230
But they are still higher in
the high-malaria region,

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.270
because why would you get a
bed net in a region where

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.430
malaria is not a problem?

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.880
You really don't need it.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.080
If you don't have a fishing
boat, you don't need a fishing

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.260
net either.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.695
So they are still higher in a
high-malaria region then in a

00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:36.220
low-malaria region when
bed nets are free.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.100
So this is what God would
have given you.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.690
But sadly, God didn't
give you that.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:49.680
God gave you either this
point or that point.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.330
What you observe is the purchase
of bed nets in the

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:58.790
area where they are given for
free, and the purchase of bed

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.690
nets in the area where
they are expensive.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.982
And those regions are different
because one is a

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:07.550
high-malaria region and one
is a low-malaria region.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.400
So what you observe is the
demand for bed nets when they

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.215
are free in a high-malaria
region, and the demand for bed

00:28:14.215 --> 00:28:17.590
nets when they're expense in
the low-malaria region.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.590
And what you don't see
is those guys.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.630
What you see is this and this.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:27.440
What is the true effect of
price on purchase in the

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.390
high-malaria region?

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.392
Where do I find it
on the graph?

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.880
That's the vertical thing.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.120
That's the true effect of free
versus expensive in the

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.030
high-malaria region.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:45.090
And this is the true effect of
free versus expensive in the

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.790
low-malaria region.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.050
So this is the true effect.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.740
That's what I'm looking for.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.110
Sadly, I don't have this,
and I don't have this.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.080
I'm not in very good shape.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.670
What I do have is
this and this.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:04.480
So if I just did to comparison
that we started with, we would

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.450
compare the high-malaria region
purchase when it's free

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.510
to the low-malaria purchase
region when it's expensive.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.250
Take the difference.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.070
That would be our effect.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.780
So is that the true effect?

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.250
Is it biased upwards, or
is it biased downwards?

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.336
Is that too big, too small,
or the right size?

00:29:25.336 --> 00:29:26.150
AUDIENCE: Too big.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:27.090
ESTHER DUFLO: Too big.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.890
And we can see it here,
which we can re-put.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:34.512
We can say, well, suppose we had
what God would have given

00:29:34.512 --> 00:29:36.990
all the numbers.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.170
In the low-malaria region, this
is the effect of price

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:41.790
and purchase.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.030
And the rest is the best.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.120
In the high-malaria region,
this is the true effect of

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.940
price and purchase, and
the rest is the bias.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.420
So if we knew this and this, we
could calculate the effect,

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.230
and we calculate the bias that
we would get if we compare

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.890
this to this.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:04.370
But suddenly, we don't
have those.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:07.000
So what this is saying, in other
words, is that when we

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.670
compare purchase when it's free
to purchase when it's

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:20.980
expensive, in the high- and
low-malaria region, we combine

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.730
two effects.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:25.220
We combine the effect that even
at the same price, the

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.260
purchase would have
been different.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.580
So the counter-factual would
have been different--

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.450
those are this versus this,
and this versus this--

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.430
and the fact that there
is actually an effect.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:41.450
So that's why it's not a very
good answer for the question

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:42.770
we're asking.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.710
This we did for only two points,
but we would have the

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.710
same thing if we had
many price points.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.370
So suppose this is the observed

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:53.260
demand at various prices--

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.580
when it's free, when it's 10
shilling, when it's 20

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.310
shilling, when it's
30 shilling.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.800
That's the observed demand.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.550
So someone could say, well,
I'm going to trace a line

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:06.930
here, and that's going to give
you my elasticity of purchase

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.250
with respect to the
price of the good.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:17.840
Now, let's say if God had given
us the observed demand,

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.375
the demand we would observe in
the region with the free bed

00:31:21.375 --> 00:31:24.610
net if the bed net were not
free, that's the demand we

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:30.470
would observe in this
highest-malaria region.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.690
It also decreases with
price, but less

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.930
than we see in reality.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:42.660
And why does it decrease less
than we see in the data, the

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.910
yellow dots?

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:52.780
So the yellow dots are
what we would see in

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.030
the high-price region--

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.252
so in the free region, what we
would see in the zero price

00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:04.740
region, if the price were
in fact 10, 20, 30, 40.

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.590
So why is it flatter than
the observed curve?

00:32:12.006 --> 00:32:12.494
Yes?

00:32:12.494 --> 00:32:16.410
AUDIENCE: Because it was
free, [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.700
ESTHER DUFLO: So this
is what is free?

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.680
This is a bit more.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.400
This is the demand
when it's free.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.840
It's very high.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.410
This is in the next region,
where it costs 10 shilling.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.090
It's a bit lower.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:34.660
This point is telling us, this
is how many bed nets the

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.610
people in this region would
purchase if the price was, in

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.880
fact, 10 shilling instead
of being free.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.120
So this and this and this,
we don't observe.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.580
But we just say, let's say I'm
telling you this is God told

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.390
you what it would be.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:54.300
The reason why it is higher is
because the region where it is

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.750
free is a region where people
need the malaria nets a lot.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.000
So even if they had pay
10 shilling, they

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.880
would still buy them.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.950
And even if they had pay
20 shilling, they

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.740
would still buy them.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.550
And even if they had to pay 30
shilling, they would still buy

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:11.700
them, although less, because of
course they are sensitive

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.490
to the price.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:17.190
But the difference between the
yellow point and the red point

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:21.000
is the yellow point is just
the effect of the price,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.120
whereas the red point also has
the effect of the fact that

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.330
you're more likely to have to
pay for bed nets in places

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:32.770
where the malaria is not
such a big problem.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:37.970
So the red dot, which is what
we observe in reality,

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:41.360
combines the effect of the price
and the fact that the

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.090
regions where people have
to pay are different.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:45.580
Yeah, Ben?

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.750
AUDIENCE: The x-axis is price?

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:48.790
ESTHER DUFLO: The
x-axis is price.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:49.540
Yeah, sorry.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:50.810
I should have--

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:54.462
it's like this, 0, 10, 20, 30.

00:33:54.462 --> 00:33:57.382
AUDIENCE: It's still not obvious
to me why if it's

00:33:57.382 --> 00:34:00.975
free, if you go from zero to,
let's say, a million, why the

00:34:00.975 --> 00:34:05.725
demand for free bed nets would
change [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:05.725 --> 00:34:09.444
ESTHER DUFLO: No, it's not the
demand for free bed nets.

00:34:09.444 --> 00:34:12.739
This is always going to be the
demand at this price--

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:14.120
0, 10, 20.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.940
So it's still declining,
you see?

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.670
AUDIENCE: No, I'm saying
for free bed nets.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:17.916
ESTHER DUFLO: Oh.

00:34:17.916 --> 00:34:18.530
For free, it's pretty high.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.407
AUDIENCE: Why does it change
at all, if you go

00:34:21.407 --> 00:34:22.719
from price 0 to 30--

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:24.530
ESTHER DUFLO: Oh, you're
wondering about this one.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.370
You're wondering about
this point.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:32.429
You're wondering, in the
low-malaria region, if I give

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.744
you a bed net for free,
why don't you get it?

00:34:34.744 --> 00:34:35.966
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

00:34:35.966 --> 00:34:39.017
Because the x-axis is high
instances of malaria, low

00:34:39.017 --> 00:34:41.090
instances of malaria.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.610
ESTHER DUFLO: Yeah.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:43.514
AUDIENCE: You switched
the price.

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:47.516
I'm confused why changing how
much a free bed nets costs

00:34:47.516 --> 00:34:51.260
would decrease the amount of
purchases for free bed nets.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.370
ESTHER DUFLO: So what is a
little tricky is that there

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.166
are two things in the axis.

00:34:55.166 --> 00:34:58.900
There is the fact that this is a
high-malaria region, and the

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.950
fact that it's a low-malaria
region.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.500
And it turns out-- but this is
what is very important--

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.190
it turns out that the price
is related to the

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.020
incidence of malaria.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.260
So here, for example, in the
two-region case, I have given

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.220
the bed net for free
in the region where

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.410
the malaria was high.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.420
And the reason is because if I'm
a good policy maker and I

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.700
don't have that much money,
that's what I will do.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.350
I will first give the bed net
for free in the region where

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:25.980
malaria is high.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.680
And I will ask people to pay for
the bed net in the region

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.910
where malaria is low.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:35.220
So what I observe in reality
is the demand for free bed

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.360
nets in the high-malaria region
and the demand for

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.180
expensive bed nets in the
low-malaria region.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.910
So if I compare the difference
between the two,

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.510
and if I call this--

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.560
I'm combining two effects.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.700
I'm combining the effect of the
price, which is, given the

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.005
same region, people are more
likely to get a bed net for

00:35:58.005 --> 00:36:04.790
free than to pay for it, and
the fact that people, given

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:08.670
that bed nets are more useful
in a region where there is a

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.090
lot of malaria than
in a region where

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:12.670
there is little malaria.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.580
People are more likely to get
bed nets at any price--

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:20.240
the red dots are for
the same price--

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:24.010
at any price, people will be
more likely to get bed nets in

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:27.110
the high-malaria region than
in the low-malaria region.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:31.340
So if you compare within a line
the yellow to the red

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.080
dot, you get the effect
of the price.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:39.000
If you compare across columns
within the same color, you get

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.240
the effect of being in high-
versus low-malaria region.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.870
And you see they tend to go in
the same direction, which is

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.180
what creates your bias.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.820
All right, do you get the

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.150
two-region, two-prices example?

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:58.640
If you get the two-region,
two-prices example, then this

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.510
one is the same, but
with four prices.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.200
Now we have four regions--

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.330
a region where we give them for
free, a region where we

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.000
give them for 10 shilling, a
region where we give them for

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.720
20 shilling, a region where we
give them for 30 shilling.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.400
And this is what I observe in
reality, a very steep slope.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.060
At 30, almost no one buys it.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.330
But this is due, again,
to two things.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.060
One is that that's expensive.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.470
So even if malaria was a real
problem, people would be less

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:30.540
likely to buy them for 30.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.470
And, in addition, those regions
where people had to

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.660
pay a lot of money for malaria
is precisely because malaria

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.310
is not such a big problem
in those regions.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:45.280
So in order to decompose those
two effects, what I'm doing is

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:49.080
that I'm playing God and I'm
telling you, this is what the

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.860
demand at various prices would
have been in this first

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.090
region, in the zero region, in
the high-malaria region.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.390
So this I don't see
in reality.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.880
In the world, I don't see that,
but this is what it

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.630
would have been.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:10.045
And it's a little flatter
than this one because

00:38:10.045 --> 00:38:11.310
this is like the bias.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:19.400
This is saying, these are places
which don't really need

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.640
malaria, and this is the
effect of prices.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.020
The yellow one is a true effect
of prices, and the

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.830
vertical lines are the bias
that are added by the fact

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:33.670
that prices are expensive in
places where a bed net is not

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.734
very useful because malaria is
not so much of a problem.

00:38:36.734 --> 00:38:37.228
Yeah?

00:38:37.228 --> 00:38:38.710
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.906
Why is there not a bias based
on your environment and how

00:38:42.906 --> 00:38:45.850
much malaria there is when
they're for free?

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.560
ESTHER DUFLO: Well, when they're
for free, we observe

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.110
the true demand at free.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:54.820
So that happens to be the same
point, which is, I'm giving

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.340
you what I observe.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.640
And the free region is the
demand when it's free.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.320
What I would like to know, then,
is what would the demand

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:08.060
in the free region be if, in
fact, it had been 10 shilling?

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.093
So this is this counter-factual,
which is,

00:39:10.093 --> 00:39:12.500
there is something we don't
observe, which is precisely

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.370
what we need to compare
to the region where,

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:19.450
in fact, it is free.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.020
Ask as many questions
as you have.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.130
The more questions, the better.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.847
Yeah?

00:39:22.847 --> 00:39:25.829
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
why [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:29.308
more likely to go from
zero to 10 shillings.

00:39:29.308 --> 00:39:31.793
Do you see that the [INAUDIBLE]
decrease in the

00:39:31.793 --> 00:39:33.043
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.900
ESTHER DUFLO: So you have--
so what is your name?

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.130
AUDIENCE: Katja.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:47.540
ESTHER DUFLO: Again?

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.360
AUDIENCE: Katja.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:48.920
ESTHER DUFLO: Katja.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.225
Katja has a question, which is,
she doesn't believe that

00:39:53.225 --> 00:39:55.250
the elasticity is the
way I drew it.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:58.475
You think that it's more like
steep and then flatter?

00:39:58.475 --> 00:39:58.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:39:59.630
ESTHER DUFLO: Possibly.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.971
That's the way I made that up.

00:40:01.971 --> 00:40:05.570
I consider that zero and 10 is
kind of similar, but that has

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.780
no reason to be true.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.870
And substantially, you're
absolutely right.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:13.500
It could be that, in fact, there
is a big drop in demand.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.580
But then the red point would
probably be even lower.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.690
Yeah?

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:23.458
AUDIENCE: Why were the
experiments conducted so that

00:40:23.458 --> 00:40:26.284
you only get the orange
data points?

00:40:26.284 --> 00:40:29.300
Why did you not mix up different
communities that

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.071
have had malaria and
[INAUDIBLE] malaria

00:40:31.071 --> 00:40:32.037
[? for each-- ?]

00:40:32.037 --> 00:40:33.490
ESTHER DUFLO: That's
an excellent point.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:38.650
So this is not supposed to have
come from an experiment.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:39.650
This is the real world.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:40.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.490
a real world outside
of an experiment.

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:45.520
And outside of an experiment
in the real

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.250
world, it is likely--

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.510
it doesn't have to be the case,
but it's likely that

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:53.080
policy maker will make the bed
net available for free in

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.530
high-malaria region, because
it makes sense for them.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.500
But your question exactly brings
to what the answer to

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.320
the problem is.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:07.100
So we have a problem, which is
that we observe the low prices

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.870
in places where the need is
high, and high prices in the

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.710
regions where they need
is low, so that

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:14.670
leads to this bias.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:18.180
And the solution is exactly what
you suggested, which is,

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.680
let's have variation in prices
in regions where

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.090
the need is the same.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.584
Yes?

00:41:24.584 --> 00:41:27.572
AUDIENCE: So on the x-axis, are
you exactly correlating

00:41:27.572 --> 00:41:32.440
the price of the bed nets with
the incidence of malaria, or--

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.040
ESTHER DUFLO: So what I'm
assuming, I'm telling you this

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.110
doesn't have to be true.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:39.600
And the problem is we'll never
know, because we won't observe

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.060
both in the real world.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.910
But I'm telling you this happens
to be like that in

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.590
this particular fictional world
that I constructed,

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.177
where this was like that.

00:41:50.177 --> 00:41:52.278
AUDIENCE: But if you go along
the x-axis to the right, you

00:41:52.278 --> 00:41:54.847
mean that bed nets get more
expensive and malaria

00:41:54.847 --> 00:41:56.250
incidence goes up?

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.600
ESTHER DUFLO: Goes down.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.610
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry,
goes down?

00:41:58.610 --> 00:41:59.120
ESTHER DUFLO: Exactly.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.060
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.310
ESTHER DUFLO: I constructed
it that way.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.220
You could construct the opposite
example, and you

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:10.920
could make up a story where the
richer regions have more

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.470
political power, and they
also have less malaria.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.780
So the richer region will get
the free bed nets, and they

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.560
will also have less malaria.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.550
In that case, where would the
observed compared to the true

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.580
elasticity, where would the red
dot be, if, in fact, the

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.890
correlation was the other way?

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.830
AUDIENCE: They would
go the other way?

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.070
ESTHER DUFLO: They would
go the other way.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:44.020
So the red dot would be above,
because the bed nets are more

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.660
expensive where they
are more needed.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:50.140
And your question brings in an
essential question, which is,

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.880
sadly, we can't know.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.510
We can know some stuff, which
is we can, for example,

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:57.360
measure malaria prevalence.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:04.050
But we never observe the
counter-factual.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:07.890
So either we observe the demand,
where the price is

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:14.010
high, in the places where it's
high, or we observe the demand

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.570
where the price is low in the
places where it's low.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:20.950
And we never get to see the
demand where the price is low

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.730
in the places where it's high.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.840
That's the missing data point.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.270
That's why this is what
we are missing.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.000
In other words, we don't see
those yellow points.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.410
We don't see what the demand
would have been in a zero

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:38.440
price region if the price, in
fact, had been 10, 20, 30.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.690
We just don't know.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:48.840
So the solution is what you
suggested, which is to say,

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:52.950
why don't we take one region and
try to vary the prices in

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:53.520
those regions?

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.385
Or in fact, we could take two
regions, a high-malaria region

00:43:56.385 --> 00:43:59.190
and a low-malaria region,
and vary the prices

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:01.080
in those two regions.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.070
And this is where the word
experiment comes up.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:07.160
This is where the experiment is,
which is the way you would

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.910
do it to be completely sure that
there is no difference

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.690
between the places or the people
which got the bed net

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.780
for free, and the places or
people which had to pay for

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.385
it, is you would randomly assign
the price of the bed

00:44:23.385 --> 00:44:27.470
net to different regions or
two different people.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:32.200
So this is what is done, for
example, in medicine when you

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.100
want when you want
to find out the

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.010
effectiveness of a new drug.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:41.020
You don't give the new drug to
people who need it the most.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.620
Otherwise, you would
find that the drug

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.810
killed a lot of people.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:48.800
You take some part of people
who need the drug, and you

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.680
randomly assign some people to
take the drug and some people

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.090
to get the placebo.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.810
You might also take a sample
of people who need the drug

00:44:55.810 --> 00:45:00.020
less, and randomly assign the
drug within them, to find out

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.240
side effect if you
misprescribe.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.530
But you wouldn't give the drug
to people who need it, and not

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:08.085
the drug to people who don't
need it, otherwise all of the

00:45:08.085 --> 00:45:10.790
drugs would be sure to
kill a lot of people.

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:17.380
So most evaluation of social
policy is trying to estimate

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:23.030
the effect of policies by
doing these kind of

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:26.530
comparisons, this point
to this point.

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:30.215
And that creates this
bias situation.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.130
And in fact, you can try and
make more progress on this

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:40.620
question by creating experiments
where you fix the

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.570
region, or you fix the
environment, and you randomly

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:45.000
assign the prices.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.740
The randomization ensures
that there is nothing

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.450
systematically different between
the people who got the

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:54.130
free bed net and people
who didn't get it.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.970
In other words, there is no--

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:01.790
if we go back to this graph, for
example, the places that

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:04.900
got the free bed net and the
places that had to pay for the

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.170
bed net, if they had gotten it
for free, they would be at the

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:09.460
same level.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.300
And if they had pay
for it, they would

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.530
be at the same level.

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:14.990
There is now no difference
between the region who paid

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:19.430
for the net and the region who
didn't pay for the net.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:25.170
One point before going into the
results of what Cohen, and

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:31.170
then Pascaline Dupas found for
the bed net is that of course,

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:34.260
this is not true if it's just
one village and another

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.080
village, like Steve suggested.

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.310
Why is it, if we took only one
village, and in one case we

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:42.640
make free, one case we make not
free-- we can flip a coin,

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.560
and then we compare--

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.200
why is that problematic?

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:47.900
Two villages--

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:51.516
why is two villages
not enough?

00:46:51.516 --> 00:46:53.262
AUDIENCE: Because you can't make
sure that everything is

00:46:53.262 --> 00:46:56.007
the same [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:56.007 --> 00:46:59.999
like one village might
have more [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:59.999 --> 00:47:03.492
actually care about each other,
or one village might

00:47:03.492 --> 00:47:07.458
end up having a really rainy
season, so all the mosquitoes

00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:09.930
happen to swamp around it.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:10.540
ESTHER DUFLO: Exactly.

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.500
Two villages, even if there
is nothing systematically

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.510
different, because you've thrown
a coin, so you didn't

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.730
choose one village rather
than the other for their

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.670
characteristic to give the bed
net for free or to ask people

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:24.090
to pay for them.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.860
Even in that case, there are
things that are different

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:29.170
across villages that you
can't fully control.

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:32.220
So you need the samples to be
large enough such that all the

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:35.230
other differences between people
or between regions

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:39.670
average out, so that even though
you do not observe what

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:43.910
the demand for bed net would
have been in the free region

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:46.460
when actually you ask people to
pay for it, you would not

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.340
observe that.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:51.060
But you can be confident that
what the demand you observe in

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:56.010
the other region where it was
free gives you the right

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:57.090
counter-factual.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:59.580
And for that, the sample needs
to be large enough so that all

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:02.940
the noise and the idiosyncrasies
get swamped.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:10.180
So let's look at two sets
of experiments.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:16.210
Both were Pascaline Dupas, who
is a professor at UCLA, was is

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.900
involved in both of them.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.670
The first one was conducted
with Jessica Cohen.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.330
In and around this
place, which is

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:27.500
called Busia in Kenya.

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:30.560
This hotel, you can see that the
beginning of the hotel is

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:36.440
called "Blue York," where
I spent a lot of time.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.190
And so what did they do?

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:43.640
They randomly chose clinics,
prenatal clinics, they gave

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.070
them nets to give to people who
come for their prenatal

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:51.770
exam, either at zero or
20 shilling or 30

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:53.240
shilling or 40 shilling.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.840
So the unit of randomization
is the clinic.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:02.150
And then they compare how many
bed nets they sold, and

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.950
whether the bed net got used,
and therefore the effective

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:07.570
coverage in those clinics.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:09.560
And this is what they find.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.180
So the little vertical
line here is

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:13.840
the confidence interval.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.800
So it's taking into account
all the noise that

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.010
exists in the data.

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:21.910
And so what is the conclusion
from this graph, at free, 10

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:23.390
shilling, 20 shilling,
40 shilling?

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:34.225
This is the number of nets
sold per week, I think.

00:49:34.225 --> 00:49:37.195
AUDIENCE: Does that indicate if
the customers actually use

00:49:37.195 --> 00:49:38.190
the bed net?

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:39.410
ESTHER DUFLO: No.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:44.840
So far, this is the first look
at, which is just how many bed

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.906
nets were given out.

00:49:47.906 --> 00:49:48.358
Yeah?

00:49:48.358 --> 00:49:49.262
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:49.262 --> 00:49:51.070
the demand curves downward.

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:52.740
ESTHER DUFLO: The demand curves
downward, and it's

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.420
quite steep, right?

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:56.840
Basically, at 40 shilling,
which is still heavily

00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:02.086
subsidized, because the full
price of a bed net is more

00:50:02.086 --> 00:50:07.680
like 80 shilling, you distribute
only about 10 bed

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.310
nets per week, versus 40
per week, when you

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:13.170
give them for free.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:16.580
So it goes down quite steeply.

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.470
And I remember, because they
were randomly selected, we

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:23.300
know that it is due to the
price, and not due to

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:24.970
differences across
those regions.

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:25.463
Yeah?

00:50:25.463 --> 00:50:25.956
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:29.407
That's funny, because the error
bars are pretty big.

00:50:29.407 --> 00:50:31.379
Like, if you if you looked at
the lower error, versus the

00:50:31.379 --> 00:50:33.850
higher error, it's
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:39.240
ESTHER DUFLO: So you take this
one compared to this one.

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.340
That's the confidence
interval.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:45.150
So we are 95% confident that
the truth is somewhere in

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:46.610
between there.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.400
That the 95 confidence interval,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:53.590
Right?

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:55.535
So you can know that this
is systematically

00:50:55.535 --> 00:50:56.785
different from this.

00:50:59.626 --> 00:51:02.500
You're right that this
and this, the

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.590
confidence interval overlaps.

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:06.620
And in fact, the numbers
are quite similar.

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.140
This is why I don't answer
someone who was asking why

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.770
didn't I draw the elasticity
that way I'd drawn it that

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:14.740
way, because I already knew the
answer to the question.

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.290
I was ahead of the
game, slightly.

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:19.370
So zero to 10 is not such
a big difference.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.500
Maybe 10 is not that
expensive.

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.315
But 40 is definitely different
from free.

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:25.970
You're right.

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.060
Certainly we would like those
bars to be smaller.

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:30.142
If we had more observations,
they would be.

00:51:30.142 --> 00:51:31.910
They would be even
more precise.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:32.552
Yes?

00:51:32.552 --> 00:51:35.996
AUDIENCE: Were the clinics far
apart from each other?

00:51:35.996 --> 00:51:39.276
It could be, say, I'd go to the
clinic where I'd have to

00:51:39.276 --> 00:51:40.916
pay 20 shillings [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:44.590
ESTHER DUFLO: Right.

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:45.710
That's a very good point.

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:48.150
The people shift from one
clinic to the other.

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:50.020
So they couldn't really do that,
because the clinics were

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.200
quite far away.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.610
On the other hand, what they did
find is a lot more people

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:57.430
coming to the clinic, presumably
to get the bed net,

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:00.680
which is a good thing, because
it cost subsidizes other

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.810
services that you get
in the clinic, in

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:06.930
particular a test for HIV.

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:10.350
And if the mother is HIV
positive, then you can give

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:13.400
them Nevirapine just before the
delivery to prevent the

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.380
transmission to the
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:20.990
So that's another story, which
is a reason why you might want

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:23.240
to distribute bed nets
if people like them.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.130
Now, this was your question,
which is, but are people are

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:28.610
using them?

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:31.680
And so far, the usage, you can
ask people what they tell you.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.085
But they could lie.

00:52:33.085 --> 00:52:35.900
Or you can try and go to their
home and see whether you see

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.050
the bed net.

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:39.440
And here, what's
the conclusion?

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.670
So this is conditional, having
gotten a bed net.

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:45.150
So what they did that they
took the register.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.340
They saw who got a bed net, and
they went to their home

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:49.940
and said, what are you doing
with the bed net?

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.510
Is it a fishing net or are you
using it for a bed net?

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:55.382
And what do they find?

00:52:55.382 --> 00:52:58.090
AUDIENCE: What's the y-axis?

00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:01.750
ESTHER DUFLO: So it's percentage
divided by 10.

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:07.728
So it's 0%, 20%, 40%,
60%, 80%, 100%.

00:53:07.728 --> 00:53:08.724
Ben?

00:53:08.724 --> 00:53:10.716
AUDIENCE: I'm a little confused
about the why.

00:53:10.716 --> 00:53:15.198
So 10 is interesting to me, like
why 50% of the people who

00:53:15.198 --> 00:53:18.200
purchase the bed nets actually
use the bed nets.

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.620
ESTHER DUFLO: So a bit more,
it's more like 60%.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.440
AUDIENCE: For 10?

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.270
ESTHER DUFLO: Yeah,
for 10 shilling.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:27.540
It's about 60%.

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:28.750
AUDIENCE: Can you help
me understand

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.370
why that trend happens?

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:32.092
ESTHER DUFLO: Oh, why
is it going down?

00:53:32.092 --> 00:53:33.300
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:33.950
ESTHER DUFLO: It's not--

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.350
I mean, going back to the
question earlier, it's not

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:37.600
significantly different.

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:42.000
So it's kind of all similar.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.030
So overall, about the trend,
what do you have to say?

00:53:49.105 --> 00:53:49.955
This is pretty similar.

00:53:49.955 --> 00:53:51.030
It seems pretty flat.

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:54.870
So there is no very big evidence
that how much of paid

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:56.936
for a bed net influenced whether
or not you're going to

00:53:56.936 --> 00:53:59.400
use it or not.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.575
And it's not 100%.

00:54:01.575 --> 00:54:04.970
It's more like towards 60%
to 70%, so not everybody

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:06.760
uses the bed net.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:11.580
But how much they pay for it
doesn't affect whether or not

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:13.150
they use it or not.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:16.020
Interestingly, when they went
back six months to a year

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.700
later, more people are
likely to use them.

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.380
So some people just took them
because they were free, maybe,

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.660
or they were not very expensive,
and decided to

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.030
store them for future
usage, which is also

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:29.630
something you can do.

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:33.580
So people do not seem to not use
the bed net because they

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.306
got them for free.

00:54:35.306 --> 00:54:37.910
And the result is that if you
look at the effective

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:41.290
coverage, the effective coverage
is very strongly

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:44.190
declining with price.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:48.630
So the conclusion from their
study is that you should give

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:51.570
the bed nets for free, because
you get many more bed nets

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:54.020
out, you're much more
likely to go--

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.600
if you get them for free,
you're going to

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.350
be above 60% coverage.

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:03.730
And once you go above 60%
coverage, you're more likely

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:06.000
to buy them.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.770
But before you go, I want
to give you the

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:11.680
epilogue, which is--

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.390
so this is the reading I asked
you to see, which is people--

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:18.310
so this got posted on Daniel
Roderick's blog, under the

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:22.180
title "Jeff Sachs Vindicated,"
which is to say, oh, yeah, we

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.140
should give bed nets for free.

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.120
This experiment showed that.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.610
And then people complained,
and said, this is only

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:33.010
pregnant women, and pregnant
women all need the bed net, so

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:34.860
they are going to use
it at any price.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.990
The sunk cost effect won't be
there for pregnant women.

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:41.690
And secondly, it's Kenya, where
bed nets are still quite

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:43.060
well-known.

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:52.870
So what are people objecting?

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:55.740
People are objecting to saying,
the experiment gives

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.460
you a lot of internal
validity.

00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:01.300
We know now that in the specific
context of clinics in

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:09.050
western Kenya with pregnant
mothers, there is no effect of

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:11.170
the price you pay on
whether you use.

00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:15.360
But maybe this doesn't apply
to Uganda, Maybe it doesn't

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.490
affect non-pregnant women,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:21.360
So this is a question of
external validity.

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.610
So what's the solution?

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:27.440
When these kind of questions
are raised, what's the

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.840
solution to make progress?

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.080
You've can't ignore
these questions.

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:33.870
They are very good questions.

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:36.270
What's the solution
to make progress?

00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.560
Yes?

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.170
AUDIENCE: Try it
in other areas.

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:40.130
ESTHER DUFLO: You want to
try it in other areas.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.630
So in fact, in bed nets,
this got done.

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:45.740
So this got tried first in
different countries, so in

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.550
Uganda, in Madagascar.

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:52.830
And secondly, it got tried in
Kenya, but as I was going to

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:56.810
say, real people, not pregnant
women, but people from the

00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:58.740
market, men and women.

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:03.070
And here, vouchers got given
at various prices to

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:09.490
individuals for them to pick
them up in the shop.

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:13.110
So now this is an environment
where have you would have

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:17.140
expected to be more likely to
find a sunk cost effect.

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:20.080
Moreover, the experiment was
also done to look at these

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.470
longer-term consequences.

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:26.640
So after six months, they went
back again to the same people,

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:31.960
and tried to sell them a bed net
for 100 shillings, so not

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.700
the lowest price, and not
the highest price.

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:38.080
And so the question is, the
people who got the first bed

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:42.290
net for free, are they more
likely to buy the second one

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:44.670
for 100 shilling, or are they
less likely to buy the second

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:46.990
one for 100 shilling?

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:50.160
So I'll run you to the
result quickly.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:57.930
So they find the same effect of
price on purchase, that the

00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:01.580
more you pay, the less you
get, quite steeply.

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.430
They find the same lack
of effect of price

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:05.800
on whether you use.

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.240
And so this is not pregnant
woman anymore.

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.090
So this kind of generalizes
a bit the result.

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:16.890
And this is the effect on
future approaches, the

00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:19.510
confidence bar, a
little bit high.

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:23.910
But if anything, what you find
is that people are more likely

00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:29.195
to buy a second bed net when
they got it for free or almost

00:58:29.195 --> 00:58:33.030
free than when they
were offered the

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:34.940
option to pay for one.

00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:37.470
And this is despite the fact
that at that time, they

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:39.180
already had a bed net.

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:42.770
So presumably, their need for
a second bed net is less so.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:46.460
So it seems that the learning
effect dominates the

00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:48.220
entitlement effect.

00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.210
So if we go back to the
wrecking market story,

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:55.100
sustainability question you
could say, well actually,

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:58.580
giving a sweep of bed nets for
free might be a good way to

00:58:58.580 --> 00:58:59.930
create a market.

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:03.310
Because you create a demand
among people who start

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:05.390
learning and say, actually,
it's kind of nice,

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:07.490
that bed nets idea.

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:10.120
The last way in which you create
a demand is by creating

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.170
this first user of a bed net.

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:16.490
So this is the last card that
I'm going to show you.

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:20.260
This is the purchase of a bed
net if you have to pay for it

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:24.100
if none of your neighbors
got it for free.

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:29.250
And this is a purchase of a bed
net, if you had to pay for

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:32.950
it, if all of your neighbors
got it for free.

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:37.975
And that is randomly assigned,
because depending on who your

00:59:37.975 --> 00:59:40.050
neighbors are, where they are
located, what kind of voucher

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:43.680
they get, this is just random
whether they get this one.

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.920
And what you see is that if your
neighbor got bed nets for

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:49.990
free, you're more likely
to get one.

00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:53.470
So there is actually a positive
social effect.

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:56.830
So the reason why I wanted
detail into this experiment is

00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:01.380
that that's an experiment that
shows us how we can use

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.630
experiments not only to evaluate
the impact of a

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:07.910
policy, but the answer those
questions that help us

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:13.530
understand how people decide
whether the entitlement effect

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.580
is bigger or smaller than the
learning effect, whether the

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:20.460
sunk cost fallacy exists,
whether how the big the price

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.170
elasticities are, et cetera.

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:24.210
And we need to design
the experiment to

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:25.720
answer all those questions.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.820
And then we can start informing
the policy debate.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.070
Sorry for running over.
