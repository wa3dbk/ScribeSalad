00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.980
PROFESSOR: So I want to
do two things today.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
One is wrap up what I
was doing last time.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.990
And the rest of the time, or a
part of the rest of the time,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.140
I want to spend kind of going
back to the questions of what

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.960
have we learned, or what do
we think we have learned?

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.320
So this is mostly
continuation.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.960
So let me just remind you
what I'm continuing.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.910
The basic point I was trying
to make last time is that

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:15.390
there are always many things
you can do to make even bad

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.670
systems allow for relatively
wide range of possible

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.820
interventions.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.220
And in reverse, even in good
systems, if you have bad

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.430
interventions, they're bad.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.840
The fact that the system is good
has no guarantee that the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.690
interventions that get
chosen are bad.

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:44.690
If you like, in that sequence of
arguments, this is the last

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:52.780
one, which is can you actually
turn bad politics--

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.240
is it really prior to policy?

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.280
So does it exist outside
politics?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.160
And we sort of made the case
that that's not entirely true

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.120
already because we've been
saying things like if people

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.070
have some idea of who they
should vote for then they vote

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.760
more discriminatively.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.220
Part of the reason why they
don't necessarily use a lot of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.600
discrimination is because
they're not necessarily that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.930
interested in the election.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.370
And that's partly because they
don't have much information.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.320
Here's a nice experiment which
sort of emphasizes that point

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.380
on how policies can
mold politics.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:49.680
This has to do with attitudes
toward women leaders in India.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.550
In India there's a rule which
says that panchayats are the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.560
lowest level of government in
India, these are village

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.160
governments essentially.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:09.690
And India has a rule which says
that 1/3 of all seats of

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.220
leader of panchayat, the role of
the boss of the panchayat,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.920
have to be filled by women.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.770
And it turns out that partly
for political reasons they

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.770
decided that which of them will
be reserved for women

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.040
will be decided by a lottery.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:38.400
So there was a lottery to decide
out of the 3,000 or how

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.530
many thousand villages in this
particular state, how many of

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.330
them will have a woman
lead at this time.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.140
And then in principle the
idea is that next time

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.360
there will a rotation.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.750
And so the places that are
reserved this time will not be

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.160
reserved the next time
and vice versa.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.470
And that didn't actually
happen entirely.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.660
And I'll tell you something
about that in a minute.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.970
But right now think of
it as a lottery and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.550
then we see what happens.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.910
So the advantage of it being a
lottery is that the government

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.760
in a sense performed an
experiment for us because they

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.220
chose these places
by a lottery.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.519
So we kind of know that they're

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.860
identical to start with.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.700
So there was a bunch of
places which had to

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.890
have a woman leader.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.210
These places were not a
priori any different

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.690
from any other places.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.920
They ended up with
a woman leader.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:46.480
Now, in terms of outcomes,
there's data that therefore

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.620
allows you to compare the
villages that had a woman

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.530
leader with places
that didn't.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.710
And there's an outcome that
seems clear that woman leaders

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.520
are not obviously worse
than men leaders.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.115
They seem to spend about the
same amount of money.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.140
And when you ask villagers their
view of corruption in

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.550
government, they're less likely
to say the government

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.100
is corrupt.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.190
So overall if you look at just
the numbers, women seem to be

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.270
just as effective as men.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.160
Now, this is not obvious.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.770
Indeed, it's quite surprising
because the women are actually

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.020
less experienced.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.780
Often this is the first time
they've had a political job.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.360
Many of them, this is not just
the first time they've had a

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.790
political job.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.520
This is the first time they've
ever had a job.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.440
They're less educated than the
men, and they're less likely

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.010
to have had run a business
than the men.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.960
That's not surprising.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.930
But given all that, that's often
all of those things that

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.420
often are seen as
being attributes

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.450
of successful leaders.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.930
It's not surprising maybe that
people still sort of feel that

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.920
they should not be able to lead
because people only have

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.350
a theory, which is often kind
of a common theory, which is

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.870
that if you have been a business
leader or you've had

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.730
a business you might be better
at running government.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.110
And so this is a theory you
encounter in the press here

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.750
all the time.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.680
So maybe people might very
well believe that.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:42.070
So the question that's being
asked in this experiment--

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:48.790
so the first round of kind of
this lottery, people observed

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.430
what happened.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:57.280
And, as I said, the answer was
that the women did no worse

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.720
than the men.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:15.710
However, there were still some
hitches in the system.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:23.480
So on the next round what was
supposed to have happened was

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.250
that now there would
be no lottery.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.580
People would just reverse.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.580
And so let's say you had a woman
leader before, now you

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.110
wouldn't have one
and vice versa.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.970
That was what supposed
to happen.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.680
In fact, that didn't happen.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.780
What happened was that there
was some political

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.720
negotiation.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.950
And they had a second lottery.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.040
So there were places that were
randomly chosen again.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.330
And because there was a second
lottery, some places had women

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.750
leaders twice just because they
happened to kind of win

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.920
the lottery twice.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.230
Some of them had a lose,
depending on

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.610
your point of view.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.040
Some of them had women
leaders once.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.100
And some of them
had zero times.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.840
So this data is after
10 years.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.250
So the data we're going to look
at is at least after more

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.100
than five years.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.950
So these are places which
have had a women

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.050
leader for several years.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.880
So they've had her first for
five years and then possibly

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.170
for another couple of years.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.370
Or they've had men leaders.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.429
So this is sort of data after a
fairly long period of time.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.200
And, as I said, there are three
different groups here.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.870
There are people who've had
women leaders for two terms or

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.020
at least one and one plus term,
people who have had

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.910
women leaders for one term, and
people who have had women

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.510
leaders for zero terms.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.970
So that's the comparison we're
going to be interested in.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:57.340
So the way the comparison will
be done is interesting.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:06.110
So they took a real speech that
was given by a leader, a

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.810
man leader in this case.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:13.220
And then they had a woman sort
of speak out the same speech.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.250
So they had two recordings of
the same speech, identical

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.930
speech, one in a woman's voice
and one in a man's voice.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.170
And then what they did was they
took these two speeches

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:29.110
to the villagers and asked them
to, you know, and took,

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.380
like, a random sample of
villagers and asked them to

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.930
say which of the speeches they
thought reflected leader's

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.180
competence.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.120
They were hearing a man
speak, a woman speak.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.420
They were hearing exactly
the same speech.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.180
And you're asking them which
one sounds more competent.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.610
So some people were asked about
men, others were asked

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.210
about women.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:57.270
And the idea was precisely to
see if it is the case that the

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.760
same speech gets graded
differently, so if people are

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.800
bringing something to
the speech which

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.380
is not in the speech.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.400
The speech is just a voice
saying the same words.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.280
Are you bringing something
different to it?

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.350
You're bringing some
prejudice to it?

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.770
You think that women are better,
women are worse,

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.670
whatever it is.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.920
This is an attempt to
measure prejudice.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.564
Yeah.

00:10:22.564 --> 00:10:24.016
AUDIENCE: I have a
quick question.

00:10:24.016 --> 00:10:25.952
If a woman's a leader do people
in the community think

00:10:25.952 --> 00:10:28.380
she does whatever her husband
tells her to do?

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:28.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.770
For example, that's an
interesting question.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:39.030
So when this was implemented,
people basically said this is

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.920
not going to change anything.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.410
Women leaders are going to
be just like men leaders.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:43.800
Why?

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.780
Because men will lead
in any case.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.420
The women just will
be decorative.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.520
They'll be on the ballot but
not actually leading.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:57.280
And indeed in many villages
there is somebody who people

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.910
talk about quite casually as
the husband of the leader.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.240
They have a word for it in
Hindi, which is the husband of

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.180
the leader.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.780
And that's kind of like First
Lad or something.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.330
So people thought this
will have no effect.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.490
In fact, when you look at the
data, it's clear that places

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.740
that were randomly assigned a
woman leader are much more

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:32.330
likely to have investments in
things women care about.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.580
So women mostly care
about water.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.690
And places where women
are leader have more

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.320
investment in water.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.450
Water's a big woman issue
because women have to find

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.600
drinking water.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.100
Let's say drinking water
is a huge woman issue.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:52.480
And so when you look at the
village meetings, women ask

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.500
questions about water,
drinking water.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.750
And then you look at what
happens if a woman is the head

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.190
of the village, you see exactly
that, which is you see

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.730
women leaders generate more.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.780
So going back to this
experiment, they were

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.900
basically asked to
grade the speech.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.870
And the speech was, as
I said, identical.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.210
So if you thought the man was
more competent, the woman was

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.270
more competent, you're bringing
some data to it that

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.010
was not in the speech itself.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.886
The speech was word for
word identical.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:19.430
So this is the comparison
mostly of never reserved

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:20.870
versus twice reserved.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.170
OK, that's the simplest
comparison, one that had a

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.350
woman leader twice with
one where it's

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.250
never had a woman leader.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:36.470
The first set of columns, set of
bars, I guess, are for men.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.290
The second set of bars
are for women.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.480
So when it says reserved, male,
that means a man in the

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.080
village that has been
reserved twice.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.330
What does the man say?

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:57.480
And the difference is woman's
speech versus

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.740
man speech, the rating.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.460
And the result is
quite dramatic.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.820
Men, in general, if you're
never reserved, think the

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.890
woman's speech is much worse.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.456
That's the blue bar.

00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:14.760
It's negative.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.400
Nonetheless, if you see what
happens after it's reserved

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.530
twice, the men change
their mind.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.520
Now the woman's speech
is better.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:30.320
For women, the original
prejudice was smaller and the

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.660
swing is smaller.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.380
That's not maybe surprising
because women start with less

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.970
prejudice and then they don't
react as much as well.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:15:00.350
On the other hand, they also
ask a different question.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.560
This was kind of a measure
of competence, right?

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.360
This was actually asking
them does the

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.580
person sound competent?

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.380
If you'd actually asked them the
question should a woman be

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.520
a leader, they still say no.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.370
So it's not that they
changed their mind.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.680
It's that objective judgment
has changed.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.710
They feel less negative
about women.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.860
The test is still
against women.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.070
But somehow once you've been
exposed to women leaders, you

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.850
realize that they're just
as good as men.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:39.070
You might feel that they're
really not a good idea.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.750
Women should not
be in this job.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.070
But when you look at who does
the job, you figure that

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.050
they're just as good
as others.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.910
There's a similar experiment
that was done in--

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.810
so this is sort of continuing
that same data.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.410
This is actually election
outcome.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:09.070
So this is comparing how what
fraction of women get elected.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.400
Now, in unreserved seats--

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.920
so these were seats in 2008 that
had been reserved once,

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.970
twice, or zero times.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.570
That's what you're comparing.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.085
You're taking seats in 2008
that are not reserved.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.840
Now, some of these seats in '98
and 2003 were reserved.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.170
Some were reserved once.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.260
Some were reserved twice.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.270
This is the third election.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.770
So do you understand?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:43.370
So instead of asking what is
your preferences, this is

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:47.560
asking what did you observe?

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.080
How did you vote actually?

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.950
Did you support women?

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.350
And, here, again you see
the same pattern.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.750
These are two different jobs.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.170
So the greens are
different jobs.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.950
So the Pradhan is
the top leader.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.780
The ward councillor is the
next level leader.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.050
And if you look at both,
you just see that they

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.180
just keep going up.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.050
So if you reserve more, you
vote more for women.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.060
These are unreserved seats.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.200
So right now you're not required
to vote for women.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.079
And if you start with the
ones which are never

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.609
reserved, you get 9%.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.619
The ones who you reserved twice,
you get twice as much.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:34.510
So basically people's political
judgments are

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:39.915
substantially shifted by
being reserved twice.

00:17:39.915 --> 00:17:40.865
Yeah.

00:17:40.865 --> 00:17:43.715
AUDIENCE: Is there any data on
the quality of leadership

00:17:43.715 --> 00:17:48.270
between women who run in the non
reserved village versus in

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.520
a reserved village?

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.280
PROFESSOR: There's certainly
data on--

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.680
I don't know the answer
to that question.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.280
My guess is that if women who
won the unreserved villages

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.720
are better.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.100
And that's what you'd expect.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.580
And I remember somebody saying
that they're more educated

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.850
definitely.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:16.420
So if you have the confidence to
run without any reservation

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.860
then you are probably better
situated in any case.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.750
And that seems to be true.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.930
I don't remember.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.900
The same data that is used to
say that women leaders are

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.190
less corrupt than men leaders
must also say something about

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.520
reserved versus unreserved
women.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.980
I just don't know the answer.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.940
Yeah.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.780
AUDIENCE: Could this just be
because more women are running

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.190
in areas [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.166
PROFESSOR: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:43.166 --> 00:18:45.040
But that's an outcome, right?

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.230
Women are running.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.060
And so part of it is that
they're more incumbent.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.560
But the fact is that, for
whatever reason, once you

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.870
expose people to the possibility
that they can vote

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.410
for women, they vote
for women.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.090
So in other words, policies
change politics.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:10.130
That's the point I wanted to
make, which was sort of

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.540
something I've been pushing
for a while, but just to

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.050
understand this we
talked about.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:23.480
And so basically to summarize
it's not that political

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.610
constraints are not important.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.570
And lots of political events
have huge consequences.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.990
But that shouldn't stop us.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:34.030
The main point we're making here
is that that shouldn't

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.920
stop us in the fight for looking
for better policies

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:43.620
because, A, better policies are
implementable even when

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.860
the politics is often bad.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.250
You often still get some
good policies.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.230
And second, if you have got a
chance to have a good policy,

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.890
you better have one ready.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.350
So imagine the politics shifted
and somebody asked

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.410
you, this is what
I want to do.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.030
What would you do?

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:06.930
You would do something very,
very, very, different if you

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.710
knew or if you thought
about it.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:20.280
And, moreover, if you do
undertake better policies,

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.540
voters react.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:31.000
So there's no fixed prejudice
that makes voters completely

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.330
unresponsive to performance.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.800
If you show performance,
voters seem to react.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.810
And especially if there's
strong evidence that the

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:47.640
policy is working, people
react even more.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.020
So the one story that I think is
on this slide and is worth

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:58.880
mentioning is the story of a
program called Progresa, which

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.750
is a Mexican program which has
now been imitated in many,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.810
many countries, including,
briefly, by Mayor Bloomberg in

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:07.910
New York City.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.500
This is a program called a
conditional cash transfer,

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.080
basically a program which told
parents that if their children

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.960
were immunized and sent to
school, they'll get a little

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.150
bit of money or quite a bit
of money, actually.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.385
So they were paying parents to
make sure that the parents

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.680
send their children to school.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.650
So when this program was
launched, the person who

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.580
launched it realized that in
Mexico every six years the

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.990
president changes and all
the policies change.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.760
And so the policy would die in
six years even if it was a

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.770
great policy.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.470
So what he did is he actually
got a bunch of people from

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.380
University of Pennsylvania,
University of California

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.950
involved in evaluating
the program.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.450
And it was introduced in a
random way so you could

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.677
compare the places where the
policies was implemented to

00:21:59.677 --> 00:22:01.250
the places that were not.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.530
And there was a bunch of well
known scholars from all over

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.370
the world who were
evaluating it.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.620
Their results came out
very positive.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:14.950
So as the guy who had
implemented it expected, the

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.440
party that was in power then
lost the elections.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.250
So a new president came in
from a different party.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.780
And he immediately said we have
to shut down Progresa

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.420
because Progresa is a previous
government's program.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.030
We don't like it.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.420
So it was shut down.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.630
But immediately he replaced it
with a slightly different

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.620
program which was essentially
identical to it called

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.070
Oportunidades.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.730
So basically the fact that there
was all this evidence

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.790
out there made it very difficult
for them to actually

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.850
shut it down.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.590
And so the program actually
survived and now has spread to

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.870
many countries.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:23:02.560
So the general point to be made
here is that I think it's

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.850
too easy to assume that,
well, the political

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.180
system is very powerful.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.180
We just cannot change
anything.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.050
And, therefore, we shouldn't
intervene.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.690
But, in fact, when you actually
are strategic about

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.840
playing that game, you do
get lots of leverage.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.150
This Progresa example is an
excellent example of how you

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.760
need to be strategic about
the user information.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.840
But if you are strategic then
you might be capable of

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.410
generating lots of change.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.500
So that's sort of one general
point I wanted to make.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:49.430
But I have a set of slides
which are an attempt to

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.780
summarize all the general points
we wanted to make.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.760
So let me just go
through them.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:03.640
So what I want to do is
this is the heading.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.070
The end of our book is called
"in place of a sweeping

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.460
conclusion." And you can imagine
why we don't want a

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.240
sweeping conclusion since our
whole point is that there is

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.490
not one conclusion.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.960
There's not one solution
that will solve all the

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.880
problems in the world.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.200
There's no sense in claiming
that there is one answer.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.080
However it's sort of useful
to illustrate some general

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.170
principles.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.910
And so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go through a few

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:40.060
of, I think, the five key
principles that we think are

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.480
useful to keep in mind whenever
you're thinking about

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.640
these issues.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.730
So this is the first one.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.870
So do you remember any
examples of this?

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.450
Yeah.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.125
AUDIENCE: I think it was they
believe, for health and

00:25:01.125 --> 00:25:05.780
disease stuff, they believe
that the suggestions the

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.985
religious leaders were giving
were better than

00:25:07.985 --> 00:25:09.790
the medicines that--

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.150
PROFESSOR: For example.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.790
Others?

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.040
There were many.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.885
Sorry?

00:25:16.885 --> 00:25:18.135
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.640
PROFESSOR: What about examples
of situations where the poor

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.710
seem to act as if they don't
have key pieces of information

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.710
or they have beliefs which are
sort of maybe misplaced?

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.694
We went over many during
the-- yeah.

00:25:37.694 --> 00:25:40.786
AUDIENCE: Education has an
S-shaved curve to it.

00:25:40.786 --> 00:25:41.200
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.260
That education has very high
returns at the top and almost

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.678
no returns at the bottom.

00:25:52.486 --> 00:25:52.970
Yeah.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.390
AUDIENCE: Probably make more
sense to invest in education

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.340
for women [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.600
We talked about, for example,
the belief that you should get

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.820
a shot rather than a tablet
whenever you get sick.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.820
Typically a tablet is much safer
than a shot and does

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.070
exactly the same thing.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.500
What's another example?

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.540
The other examples that we
discussed a lot are examples

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:14.060
not so much of the wrong belief
as much as the lack of

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.820
belief, that people often don't
seem to believe that

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:24.730
different technologies are
as effective as we think.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.590
So one of the reasons why people
don't want bed nets is

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.380
they don't seem to believe
that bed nets will work.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:35.360
And when you give people bed
nets and they use them, a year

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.050
later they're willing to
buy it at full price.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.520
A lot more of them are willing
to buy it at full price

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.300
because they see that they're
useful and usable.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.050
The fact that you go and tell
them this is great for you is

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:48.850
not enough.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:49.710
They don't believe you.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.300
So when they use it, they
start believing you.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:28:02.340
Or another example of rather
weak beliefs is immunization.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.590
People sort of think that
immunization, maybe it works,

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.770
maybe it doesn't.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.840
It's not that they don't go to
get immunized, but they don't

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.550
really make sure that their
children get all the

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.240
immunizations.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:13.704
Yeah.

00:28:13.704 --> 00:28:17.416
AUDIENCE: Well, fertilizer is
kind of a counter example in

00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:20.710
that they know it works, but
then they try [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:21.350
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.620
So the converse was
not being claimed.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.520
It's not that the poor
only believe

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.770
things which are false.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:36.210
AUDIENCE: That was just a lack
of information [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.800
You're right.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.410
It's a good example.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.710
But it is something where that's
certainly not what we

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:46.960
were claiming.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:57.800
The second one is we say that
the poor bear responsibility

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.270
for far too much
of their lives.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:06.610
And what do we mean here?

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:07.860
What are examples?

00:29:10.376 --> 00:29:12.340
AUDIENCE: There are examples
in health.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.268
For instance, they have to
decide every time about

00:29:16.268 --> 00:29:18.723
purification of water.

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:22.160
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.410
many examples.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:28.740
AUDIENCE: I was going to
mention those, too.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.720
But also maybe education.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.712
You have a system
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:32.712 --> 00:29:36.664
school systems working well in
poor villages [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:36.664 --> 00:29:40.780
no idea that there's children
not learning anything actually

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.086
at school [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:43.086 --> 00:29:43.580
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.960
That's a nice example.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.470
Water's a very good example.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.490
Typically I think lots of people
have said why don't

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:56.480
poor people use, like,
water purification?

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.980
And it's true that they
should use it.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.140
But think of what it means.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.680
It means every time you use
water, you have to make sure

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.920
it's purified.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.020
Whereas for us, we just don't
even worry about it.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.090
We run the tap.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.920
So in some sense we
have it so easy.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.910
So think about pensions.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:20.360
If you work at MIT, somebody
deducts pension money from

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.600
your salary, puts it into an
account, and somebody else

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.130
invests it for you.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.500
And you have no choice
over it.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.360
But on the other hand, you know
that something's being

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.320
done about it.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.260
If you're poor, you have to
invest the money all by

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.430
yourself and make sure that,
you know, it's getting the

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.670
right returns or finding
a place that's safe.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.250
We don't solve any of
those problems.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:46.060
Education's a great
one actually.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.610
I think we can take
as given that the

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.400
school systems are rated.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.520
We have the ability to
evaluate what our

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.720
children are learning.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.050
If you're poor then you
really don't know.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.170
If you want to actually make
sure your child is learning,

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:04.270
you have to go and find somebody
else who does know

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:13.090
how to read and write and get
him to intervene and make sure

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.580
that the child is learning.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.830
Do you want--

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.190
yeah?

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.944
AUDIENCE: I don't know if this
falls under what [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:22.944 --> 00:31:23.932
It probably does.

00:31:23.932 --> 00:31:29.366
But insurance because I think
bearing responsibility for

00:31:29.366 --> 00:31:33.812
major things that are external
to their future [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:33.812 --> 00:31:37.770
whereas if you bring
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:38.110
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.590
So that's absolutely right.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:48.170
In the US, if there's a big
storm then FEMA steps in.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.330
And sometimes it doesn't work
so well like in New Orleans.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:56.130
But it's on average that there's
a huge number of

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:01.050
federal agencies that are there
to guarantee you some

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:04.760
minimum living and to help you
rebuild your houses and all

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.480
that disaster relief.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:13.480
If the same storm happens in
some less well run country

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.870
then in some sense
you know that is

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:16.840
going to be your problem.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.040
So you spend all your time
worrying about what will you

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.200
have to do about it.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.400
In the US, you basically know
that if it's something that's

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.480
really out of control then it
will be taken care of mostly.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.730
And that's even more true
in other countries.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:41.036
Among rich countries, the US is
particularly laissez faire.

00:32:41.036 --> 00:32:42.964
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you're
saying [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:42.964 --> 00:32:44.892
poor people than
poor countries.

00:32:44.892 --> 00:32:47.662
Because I think that a lot of
this stuff, this also does

00:32:47.662 --> 00:32:50.200
apply [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:50.420
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.950
So I think poor people in rich
countries have many of the

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.810
same issues.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:00.720
For example, if you don't have
a regular job, you don't get

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.580
health insurance.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.830
You don't get pensions.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.240
So you have to then decide to
do your savings on your own.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:15.522
You have to find a way to fund
your health problems on your

00:33:15.522 --> 00:33:17.380
own, et cetera.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.310
You bear much more response--
for an MIT professor, so many

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.010
things are taken care of, which
if you were poor, they

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:23.600
wouldn't be.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.850
So that's absolutely right.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:32.740
This is also true, as Melissa
said, of poor people all over

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.380
the world, including the US.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.830
Markets will work less
well for poor people.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.430
And the corollary of that is
therefore you should not

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:49.130
always pin your fate on
markets delivering.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:53.380
So what's an example of markets
working less well for

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:58.360
people and why would they
work less well?

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.285
Yeah.

00:33:59.285 --> 00:34:01.265
AUDIENCE: The insurance market,
performing [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:01.265 --> 00:34:03.740
just because the information
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.195
to form institutions in some of,
I guess, the [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:08.195 --> 00:34:10.670
So that's why they form more
informal insurance markets

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:14.465
where family members and
community members try to

00:34:14.465 --> 00:34:16.610
insure against a bad shock.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:17.179
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.429
That's a great example.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:23.830
You don't really have access
to formal insurance because

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.030
maybe you are just not valuable
enough and you're too

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.619
far away from the insurance
company.

00:34:40.673 --> 00:34:41.655
Yeah.

00:34:41.655 --> 00:34:44.601
AUDIENCE: I guess the mosquito
net market because they don't

00:34:44.601 --> 00:34:46.319
see the importance
or the value of

00:34:46.319 --> 00:34:48.038
buying a mosquito net.

00:34:48.038 --> 00:34:51.475
So you have to give it away
first to convince them of its

00:34:51.475 --> 00:34:51.966
importance.

00:34:51.966 --> 00:34:56.400
But you also have to make sure
to give it away [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.950
PROFESSOR: They don't mostly.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.500
I think we talked about the
evidence [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:06.346 --> 00:35:07.324
Yep.

00:35:07.324 --> 00:35:09.606
AUDIENCE: There's talk about the
fertilizer market and how

00:35:09.606 --> 00:35:11.236
people might have had money
at the right time when

00:35:11.236 --> 00:35:13.920
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.880
PROFESSOR: If you have
no place to sort of--

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.875
one thing that makes life very
difficult for people in

00:35:21.875 --> 00:35:24.500
agriculture it that they
get their entire

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.822
salary all at once.

00:35:25.822 --> 00:35:28.840
And then they have to figure out
a way to spend it smoothly

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.010
over a period of time because
they're going to get no money

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.550
for a long time.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.000
We get paid every week
or every month.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.110
So even if you spent the last
month's income, we have this

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.480
month's income coming in.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.210
If you have an income every six
months, you have to have

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.140
that much more self restraint.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.620
And so poor people are often
farmers, and they have to deal

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:54.340
with these very large ups and
downs in incomes which we

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.600
don't have a deal with at all.

00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:10.759
Yeah.

00:36:10.759 --> 00:36:12.226
AUDIENCE: Maybe of giving
things away.

00:36:12.226 --> 00:36:14.426
You have to give away
a bag of rice to get

00:36:14.426 --> 00:36:15.160
people to get vaccines.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.440
So it's more about
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:20.660
Exactly.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.780
Once the market doesn't
work then you have to

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.350
think of what to do.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.380
We talked about the credit
market where in the credit

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:36.930
market the reason why the poor
end up paying much higher

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:43.230
interest rates is because
there's this vicious circle of

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:46.300
if you are poor then nobody's
going to lend

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.890
you a lot of money.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.700
So since you're going to be lent
a very small amount of

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:56.770
money then the interest rate
will have to cover the cost of

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.160
enforcing the loan.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.200
And that's kind of
a fixed cost.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.295
So if that's, let's say, $10
and you are borrowing $10

00:37:07.295 --> 00:37:09.710
million, then that's nothing.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:15.370
If you were borrowing $10, then
that's, you know, 100%.

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:20.810
So you get a much bigger
kick from having

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.250
high interest rates.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.140
And then it turns into this kind
of further vicious cycle

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:31.800
because if the interest rate is
high then the incentive to

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:37.330
default is higher and then you
have to spend even more money

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.110
making sure that people
don't default.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:42.250
But that then raises the
interest rate even more.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:46.360
So you get this vicious cycle of
you start by being poor and

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.510
you end up with a very
high interest rate.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:53.515
That's one of the reasons why
the poor find it very

00:37:53.515 --> 00:37:54.765
difficult to borrow.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.065
So this one we talked
about already.

00:38:11.065 --> 00:38:15.750
This is the one we were
talking about a lot.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:20.160
So I'll skip it and go to the
last one, which is that a lot

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:25.340
of what keeps people in
poverty is just the

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.790
expectations of hopelessness
and

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:34.880
expectations of negative outcomes.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.332
Do you want to give
examples of that?

00:38:37.332 --> 00:38:37.823
Yeah.

00:38:37.823 --> 00:38:38.805
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:38.805 --> 00:38:42.487
give them a test and then told
them to stay for the test or

00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:44.640
not, like, making them
aware [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.590
PROFESSOR: Louder.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.090
AUDIENCE: Basically, in
education, students

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.440
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:49.840
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:56.600
So students are often told that
because they didn't do

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.310
well in their first grade test
that they're stupid.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:02.050
And if they believe they're
stupid, they stop trying.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.300
What's another example?

00:39:12.713 --> 00:39:17.186
AUDIENCE: That, like, we saw
that if the poor believe that

00:39:17.186 --> 00:39:19.671
they are not going to earn
much from a particular

00:39:19.671 --> 00:39:23.150
profession then they will not
pursue that [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.170
business.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.550
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:35.500
So if you think that the rewards
that you're going to

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.520
get from some investment are
pretty small so your life

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.540
won't really change in any
substantial way then you might

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.550
just give up and not try very
much to do anything

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.540
innovative.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.355
Yeah.

00:39:47.355 --> 00:39:50.564
AUDIENCE: There's also the
savings example of always

00:39:50.564 --> 00:39:52.037
expecting [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:52.037 --> 00:39:57.438
about that can be suspended as
who's qualified [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:57.438 --> 00:39:59.893
Knowing that some things can
come up that's going to

00:39:59.893 --> 00:40:03.350
require money gives an incentive
to try to save.

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:04.790
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.490
So you might expect that
somebody will tax it away

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:10.080
somehow and then you'll
never want to save.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.270
Any other examples?

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:31.560
So I just wanted to then wrap
up in a couple of minutes.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.080
Let me say a couple of things.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.060
I'm going to wrap up in
a couple of minutes.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:40.960
One thing is that you should
really give us the evaluation

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.760
for this class.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.090
It's the first time we taught it
in this format, and I have

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:50.460
no idea what the specific
problems are and

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.660
what we could do better.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.970
So it will be helpful for us.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:41:01.970
And it's only fair to the two
TAs who work very hard on this

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.310
to get feedback on what they've
done because that

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.410
actually matters for, for
example, when they go in the

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.890
job market.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.040
This is something
that matters.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.630
I know it's something
easy to forget.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.460
But you should remember
to do it.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:23.470
Other than that, I guess, just
to wrap up, this was an

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:32.640
attempt to kind of expose
you to how people--

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.320
I think mostly people from
sort of the community of

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.440
people associated with the
Poverty Action Lab but also, I

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.730
think, development, economics
more generally think about

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:46.830
issues around poverty.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.140
And I think the thing that I
think you should take away

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:55.660
from this is not that we have
solved the problem of poverty.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.190
I think that would be an
overstatement by some margin.

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:05.850
But at least that at this point
that there's a huge gap

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:10.800
between the way, kind of, the
journalistic accounts of

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.230
poverty operate, the level at
which they operate and the

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:19.990
level at which all of us now
after this conversation should

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.560
approach it.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.530
In some ways there is a very
large and relatively stable

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:29.110
body of knowledge about what
the big issues are and what

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:30.330
the sticking points are.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.440
There's a sense in
which we are--

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.100
I don't know that we have
all the answers or

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.480
even all the problems.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.610
But at least some problems have
been clearly identified.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.960
They keep coming back,
the same problems.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.800
And we kind of know how to think
about them, what can we

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.320
do about it.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.290
In that sense there is a sense
in which I think there's

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.390
reason to be optimistic.

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:55.690
If you think about something I
keep saying, is that if you

00:42:55.690 --> 00:43:00.840
think about sort of social
policy and policy against

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.300
poverty, the first thing to
remember is that this is an

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:09.300
extraordinarily modern
invention, that basically

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:14.240
other than supporting the
extremely destitute at some

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:20.320
very low level there was no
government policy to help the

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:25.480
poor at all really ever.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.240
If you were extremely poor,
somebody would feed you.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.010
But mostly there was
nothing else.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:33.960
I mean the education systems
really didn't exist except for

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.890
the elites.

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:38.750
Health systems didn't exist
except in the private market.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:42.240
And other forms of insurance
didn't exist.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.290
If you look at the world in
1900, the most striking fact

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:50.340
about it is how small
governments are.

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:54.920
No government is spending
more than 10% of GDP.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.500
Tax collections are maximum
10% of GDP.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.920
Now, if you take, like, Sweden,
tax collections are

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.730
55% of GDP--

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.230
so just to think of the range.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:12.100
So what has happened over the
last 100 years, and actually

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.510
not even 100 years, really after
the First World War, was

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:24.040
a massive expansion of things
that governments do.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:27.530
And more generally a massive
expansion of systematic

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:33.780
interventions to help people
live their lives better.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:37.720
Education systems massively
expanded.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.210
Health care massively
expanded.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.430
Social support programs
massively expanded.

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:50.930
In general the world of sort
of interventions is a very

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:54.480
modern world.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.870
This whole idea that there
should be social policy to

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.160
help the poor and all of us
should worry about it is a

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.050
very, very recent idea.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.280
So the fact that we haven't
got it right

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.200
already is no surprise.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:18.800
In some sense, what happened was
even between 1920 or 1910

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.740
and 1950, there's a massive
expansion of governments in

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.020
rich countries.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.840
Then a bunch of poor countries
became independent and they

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.840
imitated the rich countries by
also substantially expanding

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.680
their government.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.300
And then they often didn't have
the experience, the state

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.470
capacity, the bureaucratic
capacity to

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.020
implement those programs.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.960
So you've got a lot of things
happening which shouldn't have

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.730
happened, lots of disasters.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:51.550
But in my view that
says very little.

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:56.130
If you see that in the sweep of
history, in the last 10,000

00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:01.830
years of history, this is
a period of 30 years in

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.710
developing countries between
1960 and 1990.

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:06.240
Governments expanded a lot.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.140
They tried a bunch
of new programs.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.030
Many of them failed.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.350
There was lots of corruption.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.420
But I think if you see the sweep
of history, we are just

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.970
at the beginning of a process
of trying to create a more

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.510
humane social policy.

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:24.410
We're nowhere near the point
where we would like to be.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:25.880
And this is no accident.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.120
We just started.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.350
And in that sense, if you want
to take that perspective that

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:32.660
this is really the beginning
in terms of any historical

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:36.890
perspective, we are kind of at
a very early point, then I

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:41.950
think the main lesson that we
suggest here should seem more

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:45.550
plausible, which is that we
really don't know very much.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:46.930
We've been shooting
in the dark.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.490
We expanded too fast.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:51.140
We didn't know what
we were doing.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:55.930
And we're still very early
in the process.

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:59.790
And what we need to do is step
back and figure out what works

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:00.990
and how to make it work.

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:03.290
And if you had to take
one lesson away from

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.740
this class, it's that.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:09.830
But there is a way to learn much
better about what works

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:10.570
and what doesn't.

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:11.810
We haven't used it.

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:14.210
And that's no accident
because we are just

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.340
getting started really.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.320
I think once you remember that
lesson of history, I think

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.150
things look less depressing and
more promising than they

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:24.810
would look otherwise.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.660
I'm going to stop there.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:33.460
Thank you and good luck for the
final exam and for all the

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.770
things you're going to
be doing after this.

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:45.535
