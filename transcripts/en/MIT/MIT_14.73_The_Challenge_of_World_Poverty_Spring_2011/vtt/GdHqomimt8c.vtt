00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.850
PROFESSOR: So where we left it
last time is the access to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.860
family planning, the access to
contraception, et cetera, did

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.200
not play such an important
role in keeping people's

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.110
families small.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.130
It doesn't mean that it's
not a good thing to do.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.295
It certainly helps people
time their fertility.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:49.270
It makes them happier and all
other good things, but it was

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.880
not the main determinant
of family size.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.280
And so then the next question,
obviously, is then what is the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.530
determinant of family size?

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.790
If people are not constrained
by their lack of access to

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.010
contraception to choose the
family size that they want,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.670
how do they decide to choose
their family size?

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.610
And there are, I think, only
two big classes of factors

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.140
that might matter.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.280
One is social factors, so both
what the community thinks is

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.010
right, what the country thinks
is right, what your husband

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.810
thinks is right.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.550
And the other is the cost and
benefits of having sex, which

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.300
is pleasant, and having babies,
which you might or

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.620
might not want to have at a
specific time of your life.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.420
So both of these things are
traded off in some ways.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.310
And the issue is whether people
do that effectively,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.040
whether they do that
voluntarily, whether there is

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.990
some correction coming
from society or

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.600
something like that.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.270
So social norms clearly
play a role.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.190
So one example is this example
of Matlab, in Bangladesh,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.500
where this program was
introduced, and a community

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.740
worker came and tried
to persuade woman.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.170
One thing that has happened is
that, at the beginning of the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.350
program, the introduction
was very, very slow.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.080
The take-up of contraception
was very, very slow.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.180
And then it started to explode,
the take-up started

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.340
to explode.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.090
And then it comes down again.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.320
So you get a little bit of an
s-shape in adoption of the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.940
contraception.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.070
And what kind of mechanism would
explain, what kind of

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.500
social mechanism explains this
kind of diffusion curve?

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.960
You must have seen that, either
in other classes or you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.210
can think about it.

00:02:47.574 --> 00:02:48.470
AUDIENCE: Viruses.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.140
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.030
This is how viruses spread.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.940
This is also how iPads spread
or any new innovation.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.600
And why does it spread
in this way?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.301
Why does it have this shape?

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:07.780
AUDIENCE: If it's contagious,
initially, then a smaller

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.265
group of people haven't.

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:12.583
I guess that people that
interact with each other at

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:13.744
some point.

00:03:13.744 --> 00:03:16.974
I mean it kind of depends
on something, I

00:03:16.974 --> 00:03:18.217
don't exactly know.

00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:20.720
I don't know the exact
mechanism.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.215
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:25.040
But you get the drift.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.130
It spreads mostly like viruses
or new products, which spread

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.555
mostly by infection.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.910
At the beginning, no one is
infected, so the innovation or

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.800
the virus doesn't spread.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.580
And then more and more
people get infected.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.810
So they get chances to
infect more people.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.090
So there is a sudden take off.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.950
And then after a while,
everybody is infected.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.910
So the infection has nowhere
to go anymore.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.530
So that's why we find this kind
of mechanism, both for

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.440
viruses and for new things.

00:04:02.665 --> 00:04:07.200
So the fact that in Matlab the
contraception had the same

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.430
spread, at first very slow and
then a sudden take off and

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.610
then flattening out again, when
the take-up was larger,

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.680
suggests there may have been a
contagion phenomenon going on.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.490
So to look at it more directly,
there's a paper by

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:33.360
Kaivan Munshi, who looked at
what happened, whether people

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.050
do the same thing that
their neighbors do.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.590
And so the first thing you can
do is to say, well, if there

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.350
are 20 women in my neighborhood
and 19 have

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.980
adopted the contraception, am I
more likely to adopt then if

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.270
there is 0 who have adopted?

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.730
And when you do that, you find
that indeed people, who had

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.090
more people who adopted
around them, were also

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.690
more likely to adopt.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.670
So is that necessarily a sign
that they're learning from

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.340
each other?

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.775
What else could be going on?

00:05:05.775 --> 00:05:07.659
AUDIENCE: It could just
be a copycat effect.

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.543
So it's not necessarily that
you're learning, but you're

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.130
just doing as you see
someone else do.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.420
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.600
So the learning could
in a broad sense.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.370
First, it doesn't have to
be learning something.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.310
It could just be pure imitation,
where you're trying

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.500
to figure out what's the
fashionable thing to do.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.610
So there is no learning
going on.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.190
That's right.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.410
So this is going to be difficult
to separate, but

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.250
even beyond that?

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.735
Yeah?

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:30.917
AUDIENCE: I guess if more people
around you are doing

00:05:30.917 --> 00:05:33.585
it, there is greater
demand in the area.

00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:35.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.480
supplies, but it's just
inaccessible.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.560
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.330
So there might be this effect,
which is it might be that, in

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.690
response to the first demand
from the people, there is an

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.930
excess in supply.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.920
Or it could even be that it
turns out that the community

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:54.800
health worker is better in
that particular village.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.060
And so, because she's better
and more energetic, she got

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.860
your neighbors to adopt and,
also, yourself to adopt.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.940
And the fact that you adopt when
you neighbor adopts is

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.450
not a sign that there is a
causal effect of neighbor's

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.340
adoption on your, which could
be coming from copycat or

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.370
coming from learning, but just
that there is one common

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.310
factor that leads them to adopt
and leads you to adopt.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.150
So what he does is that he does
something very ingenious.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.700
He exploits the fact that most
of these villages have Hindus

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.140
and Muslims.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.350
And there is only one community
health worker for

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.890
both communities.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.530
But Hindus don't speak
to Muslims--

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.490
certainly not about
contraception.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.970
And Muslims don't
speak to Hindus.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:44.050
So now he's looking at, if it
was the certain hypothesis

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.420
that the reason why our actions
are correlated is

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.720
because of the community
health worker.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.450
Should I see that, if I'm a
Muslim woman, there is also a

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.120
correlation between my adoption
and that of the Hindu

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.290
woman if it's due to the
community health worker.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.140
AUDIENCE: Can you restate
the question?

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.640
PROFESSOR: So if it is due to
the community health worker,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.160
should I see a relationship
between the adoption of the

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.392
Muslim woman and the adoption
of Hindu woman?

00:07:16.392 --> 00:07:17.810
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.390
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.110
If it is due to the community
health worker, because she's

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.340
serving both communities, we
should see this correlation.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.590
Sorry, one more came.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.112
Thank you.

00:07:28.112 --> 00:07:29.362
Good effort.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.100
But if it is due to the social
learning, should we see a

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.670
relationship between the
adoption of the Hindu woman

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.680
and adoption of the
Muslim woman?

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.470
No.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.360
So if it's due to the people
learning from each other or

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.060
even copying each other, they
can't copy the Muslims,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.530
because they never will ask
them if they are Hindu and

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.460
vice versa.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.460
So he does that.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.860
And what he finds is that the
correlation is only within

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.920
community, which is an
indication that, probably,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.385
people are trying to figure
out what's the social norm

00:08:01.385 --> 00:08:05.370
around the social group or
are copying each other.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.580
And it's just not a joint
effect of the

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.050
community health worker.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.220
Another way in which you would
peak at the social norm is by

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.490
watching what's on TV.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:21.120
And there is a very nice paper
on the telenovelas in Brazil.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:28.640
So Brazil is a very Catholic
country and, until relatively

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.820
recently, was not a very free
society, until about

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.590
15, 20 years ago.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.390
And it was certainly not
particularly encouraging

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.030
family planning.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:46.130
But the telenovelas, which are
like soap operas, became very,

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.040
very popular.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.170
And they became very popular,
in part, because they were

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.700
quite good.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.950
And the reason why they
were quite good--

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.060
I'm told, because I'm yet to
watch one, my Portuguese being

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.630
not quite up to crack--

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.890
is that a lot of people who
would otherwise have been

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.270
artists in other fields could
not really do it very easily

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.230
in Brazil, so they all went
and did telenovelas.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:19.800
And they were aired on one
channel, called Rede Globo,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.070
which was not available
everywhere at the beginning,

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.330
which progressively spread.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.840
So what this article did is
that they looked at the

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.160
diffusion of the Rede Globo all
over Brazil and compared

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.510
the number of children that a
women had before and after the

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.920
introduction of Rede Globo
in places where it got

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.910
introduced.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.260
So exploiting, in that way, the
progressive introduction.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.670
Of course, the cities got
it first and then

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.830
the more rural areas.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.930
So places that got it first, in

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.230
general, had fewer children.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.770
But if we compare before and
after you get it, in places

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.450
that get it and places that
don't, then we get a sense

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.840
about what is the effect
of Rede Globo.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.040
And what they found is that
the women, who were of

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.320
reproductive age after Rede
Globo was introduced, had

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.700
fewer children in their lifetime
then the places that

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.090
were in reproductive age
before Rede Globo came.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.230
And another thing that was kind
of cute, as a result of

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:26.030
that, is that many of the kids
that were born in this area

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.160
were born after the characters
of the telenovelas.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.907
Yeah?

00:10:30.907 --> 00:10:33.769
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:38.000
these telenovelas, the main
characters have few children?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.790
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.215
Exactly.

00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:44.930
The reason why this happened is
that the telenovelas were

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.520
promoting, not necessarily for
the sake of it, but the main

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.610
characters in the telenovelas
were people, some of them with

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.720
0 children, if they had
children, with a small family.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.770
So they were promoting a model
of like a modern woman who had

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.560
few children, which kind of
helped or contributed to

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.710
slowly shift the norm.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.460
Yes, Brazil expertise.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.300
AUDIENCE: So it was is like
the main channel.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.200
Like if there is one that people
actually don't have to

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.852
pay, necessarily, for it, you
just get it for free, if you

00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:23.350
just have a TV So part of the
access to that channel comes

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:28.440
with some areas that are growing
into big cities,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.722
becoming a little bit
more industrialized.

00:11:30.722 --> 00:11:33.870
So that could be another
thing, stuff like that.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:40.350
People are getting access to
the TV channel, that means

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.388
that the country as a whole
is becoming more and more

00:11:43.388 --> 00:11:44.384
industrialized.

00:11:44.384 --> 00:11:49.613
And they are sort of adapting
how many kids they have to fit

00:11:49.613 --> 00:11:51.870
the model a little bit better.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.280
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.110
AUDIENCE: So the actual cause
could be different.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.200
Maybe it's not just the fact
that they were watching TV,

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.510
but the fact that they
gained access to it

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.060
and what that implies.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.450
PROFESSOR: So what you are
saying is that TV came on the

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.060
tail of other changes
in the same areas?

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.310
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:12:12.402 --> 00:12:16.114
Some places becoming a
little bit more urban

00:12:16.114 --> 00:12:19.070
and how that's changed.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:19.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.100
So that's a very good point,
which is always with this

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.590
different and difference
kind of strategy.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.160
The always are worried
about that.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.040
At least we are not comparing
directly the city to the rural

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.440
areas, but we are comparing the
rural areas as they are

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.940
becoming industrial enough
or developed

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.590
enough to get the channel.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.600
Because, presumably, the channel
decided to come when

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.770
there was enough people who
were rich enough to buy a

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:46.580
television.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.700
And therefore, they may have
been looking, not only at the

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.410
level of development of the
place, but how it was moving.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.840
And if that is the case, then
we could be picking part of

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.830
those trends.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.380
So that is something where we
could never be completely

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.520
sure, because we haven't
randomized.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.590
So those underlying trends,
we don't observe them.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.350
And so it's quite possible
that you are right.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.780
So these doubts remain.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:22.150
What the author does is try to
look at whether there are

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:30.450
trends in fertility before, that
the fertility was already

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.960
a little bit declining before
the channel came in.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.000
Which we would probably observe,
if the stories you're

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.550
talking about is the one, which
is, as I see that the

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.590
place is becoming more
industrialized, richer et

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.710
cetera, I'm putting the TV
there, as the president of

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.920
Rede Globo.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.400
And they don't see that.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.950
They see kind of shift in trend
around the introduction

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:55.900
of the television.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.420
But you might be
entirely right.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.150
That's also why I like the first
name thing, that the

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.920
kids were named after the
people in the series.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.320
Because that is less likely
to becoming from

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.360
industrialization in general and
more likely to be coming

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.390
from the fact that
you've seen them.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.056
But that's very well taken.

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:19.014
AUDIENCE: Did they
observe a lag?

00:14:19.014 --> 00:14:22.465
Like the introduction of the
TV show and the shift in

00:14:22.465 --> 00:14:22.970
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:23.640
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:23.790
Exactly.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.000
So that's exactly what
they are exploiting.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.270
They are trying to look at,
particularly, it doesn't

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:34.700
reduce the fertility of people
who were already past their

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.530
prime fertile age when
the TV came.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.370
It reduces only the fertility
of women who were in their

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.750
late teens and then early 20s
when the TV came, and whose

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.860
views were shaped by this.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.550
And this is exactly this timing
that helps, to some

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.220
extent, discriminate between
the idea that the TV caused

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.520
the reduction of the fertility
and your perfectly legitimate

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.990
point that, in fact, in part
it could also be that TV is

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.112
just a proxy for the social
progress happening.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.740
So these are all indications
that something, which is

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.760
probably not particularly
surprising, is in something as

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.160
fundamental and deep
as how many

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.460
children you want to have.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.460
The social norms around you--

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.500
these are very local, your
village, your community, your

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.760
family, your mother-in-law,
or society as a whole, as

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.470
reflected to you by TV--

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:37.910
matter.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:44.690
But there are also just plain,
simple, cost-benefit

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:49.490
calculations about do I want a
kid at this time, do I want to

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.230
take the risk of a kid at this
time by having unprotected

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.140
sex, et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.100
And one thing that I want to
argue is that people are very

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.290
good at making those
calculations.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:08.970
And in the sense the key group
to look at for a test case of

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.200
this are adolescent girls.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.500
Because in these countries and
elsewhere, we kind of suspect

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.770
adolescent girls to be not
the best at making those

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.560
calculations, necessarily,
which is why we see some

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.510
teenage pregnancies.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.520
And so if they can calculate,
then it would mean that,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.330
presumably, people can
calculate them.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.440
Another reason why it's very
interesting to look at

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.030
adolescents, in particular, in
Africa, is not only teenage

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.240
pregnancy, but teenage pregnancy
as a sign that

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.420
you've had unprotected sex,
which puts you at risk for a

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.920
STDs, sexually transmitted
diseases, in particular, HIV.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.620
So adolescents have been called
the window of hope in

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.720
the fight against HIV, because
A, they are uninfected.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.660
And once you're infected with
HIV, you're infected.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.980
You can't disinfect the people,
so it's better to

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.520
catch them early.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.560
Second--

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.069
and that goes back to the point
that you made earlier

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:11.319
about was there a lag--

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.650
people's sexual preferences,
their habits, et cetera, have

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:18.660
not yet been formed.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:24.619
And maybe it's right time to
catch them to influence their

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.829
behavior early, and then they'll
keep those patterns

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.720
for the rest of their life.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.770
So there is a lot of effort,
the world over, to develop

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:45.410
programs to try to teach kids
to have a safer sex life.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.250
And UNICEF worked on a lot
of these programs.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.480
But unfortunately, in a lot of
countries, there is some

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.920
pressure to have this program
being mainly concerned about

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.280
abstinence and faithfulness.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.890
So the strategy that is employed
in eastern South

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.730
Africa is called ABCD.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:11.350
So the A is for abstain, B for
be faithful, C is for use a

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.630
condom, and D is or you die.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:23.710
So that kind of encapsulates the
HIV prevention strategy.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.850
But in primary schools, and
primary school in Kenya goes

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.310
till grade eight, and people
start school late

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.520
and repeat a lot.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.103
So really, kids are like
16, 17, they're

00:18:35.103 --> 00:18:36.600
still in primary school.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.380
So think of primary
and junior high.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.035
There was a policy decision that
was made in Kenya, which

00:18:43.035 --> 00:18:46.140
is still a pretty religious
country, that condoms could

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.750
not be discussed in school.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.740
So the ABCD program is really
an ABD program,

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.060
abstain or be faithful.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.440
And, in fact, it's a program,
which is all day long, to

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.910
scare kids away and to say, look
everybody's dangerous.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.750
HIV is everywhere.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.900
The most dangerous kid is the
kid you meet in a disco.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.110
I'm not making any of this up.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.160
I've read the little UNICEF
books, where you have this

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.400
little cartoon of a girl going
to a disco and meeting this

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.410
boy and having sex and
then getting HIV.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:25.060
So this is the type of thing
that they are trying to put

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.970
into people's heads.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:34.140
So basically, the message
becomes, abstain until you are

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.310
of age to get married and
then get married.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.960
Now the big danger with
that is that kids

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.580
decide, well, fine.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.910
I don't want to die.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.450
But I don't want to abstain.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.490
So let me get married.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.670
And the reason why it's so
dangerous is that means that

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.720
kids could get married early.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.350
For girls, it means they would
have children early.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.750
And so we would have very early
pregnancies, which means

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.550
that they would interrupt their
schooling, which means

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.870
that they would be, typically,
quite a bit younger than their

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:09.330
husbands, which changes their
status in the family, as we

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.940
are going to see in a
minute, et cetera.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:18.330
So we decided to try and test
the impact of the ABCD program

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:26.090
against doing nothing and
against another strategy,

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.860
which is to basically make it
a little bit easier for kids

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.470
to stay in school.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.220
How do you make it
a bit easier for

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:33.630
kids to stay in school?

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.870
You just pay the cost of staying
in school, which now

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.090
is just like the uniform.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.760
So we ran an experiment with
Pascaline Dupas and Michael

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.380
Kremer, a pretty big experiment,
376 schools, which

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.810
were assigned to one
of four groups.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.270
One was a control group.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.300
One was a uniform group.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.290
And the other thing we did is
we wanted to test the ABCD

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.400
strategy, so we accelerated
the training of teachers.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.120
Because, in principle, every
school is supposed to

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.300
experience the ABCD strategy,
but, in practice, the teachers

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.630
are very shy about talking
about HIV.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.620
They don't want to be branded
as an HIV teacher.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.280
People are still pretty prudish
about the whole thing.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.320
So teachers won't do anything
about HIV AIDS prevention

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.640
until they get training
to do it.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.890
So the government has
a team of trainers.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.450
And they went, and they
trained the people.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:31.090
And that way the teacher
started to teach.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.060
So we had four groups.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.430
One, the teachers got trained.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:39.220
One, the kids got
a free uniform.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.090
And in one group,
they got both.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.780
And these are some
of our girls.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.330
And then we followed the
kids, all the way,

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.830
from 2002 to 2011.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.490
So what I'm going to show
you is really the

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.940
results that are coming.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.070
The results are as
of yesterday.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:01.190
So you get like prime news.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.410
Not yesterday, because I had
the slides on two days ago,

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:07.250
but like less than a week ago.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.630
And what do we find?

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.210
So this are simple means.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:16.050
And I tell you what is
significant in the means and

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.200
what's not.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.030
This is your probability to
complete primary school in the

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.280
four groups.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.120
So what is not surprising
in this graph?

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:29.820
Can you read?

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.800
You have the control group,
uniform, teacher training, and

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.800
then both is the uniform
and teacher training.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.630
So what is not particularly
surprising in this graph?

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.510
AUDIENCE: They all exceed
the control group.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.330
PROFESSOR: That they all exceed
the control group.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.842
And, in particular?

00:22:45.842 --> 00:22:47.092
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:49.188 --> 00:22:51.220
PROFESSOR: Both exceed just
teacher training.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.470
And?

00:22:55.684 --> 00:22:58.660
AUDIENCE: That both
is-- oh, sorry.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.160
I was going to say what's
surprising.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah, what is
surprising is fine, too.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.260
AUDIENCE: It's the fact that
both is less than uniforms.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:05.710
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.740
So what is not surprising is
uniform is much more than

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.450
everybody else.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.920
In fact, control and teacher
training are

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.170
pretty much the same.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.640
I mean, they are not
statistically different.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.150
Uniform is much more.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.140
I mean, you have to take care
of the scales, here.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.390
These are not huge effects.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.870
But getting a uniform, which
costs like a few dollars,

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.850
really nothing, increased
completion rates of primary

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.140
school by about 6%.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:41.390
What is surprising is that both
is less than uniform.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.680
You would think that it would
at least be just the same,

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.900
because at least they
have a uniform.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.740
So why is both less
than uniform?

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.360
Not to answer the question, we
are going to continue and see

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.120
what else we're seeing in this
data and then come back to try

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.100
and figure out what's
happening.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.270
That's a second thing which is
happening is whether or not

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.700
you are ever pregnant
by age 17.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.140
It's like, if you're ever
pregnant or pregnant by age

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.670
17, it will give you
the same result.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.990
So what is not surprising
here?

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.865
We can just describe
the results.

00:24:16.865 --> 00:24:18.052
Yeah?

00:24:18.052 --> 00:24:20.971
AUDIENCE: The surprising part
is that teacher training is

00:24:20.971 --> 00:24:22.210
the highest.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so the quite
surprising part is that

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.610
teacher training
is the highest.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.570
So remember, this is an
abstinence program.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.610
The abstinence program is
leading to a slight increase

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:33.420
in the number of pregnancies.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.280
That is not the sign of
a successful program.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.690
Which is the program that seems
to be doing the best?

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.640
AUDIENCE: Uniforms.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.290
PROFESSOR: The uniform
program is great.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.540
But what do we have, again,
that is surprising, here?

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.920
That both is above.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.400
So not only the teacher training
does nothing, but it

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.960
undoes some positive effect of
the uniform program, both in

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.520
terms of school attendance and
in terms of teenage pregnancy.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:11.800
So now let's look at
the STD infection.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.260
So we tested for HIV.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.520
And we tested for HSV2.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.070
HSV2 is a form of herpes.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.250
It's less bad than HIV.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:21.860
It's not going to kill you.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.250
But it has the same
characteristic, which is once

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.150
you have a biomarker for it in
your body, it never goes away.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:32.225
You have the antibody for it, so
we know that you've had it

00:25:32.225 --> 00:25:33.740
at some point in your life.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.280
It's also good to diagnose
it, because

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.540
it needs to be treated.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:42.060
It's also bad to have HSV2,
because, as other sexually

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.190
transmitted diseases, it greatly
increases the chance

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.520
that you get HIV.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.585
The transmission rate of HIV,
if you have sex with an

00:25:51.585 --> 00:25:55.880
infected partner, is higher
if you have another STD.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.280
Because there are lesions
in your body that the

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.800
virus uses to get in.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.390
So what do we find with HSV2?

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.450
So the reason we don't use HIV
is that one of the great news

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.740
of this project is
no one has HIV.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.420
We have about 1% of
HIV infection.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.600
So that's very, very low,
across all groups.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.790
So that's good.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.750
But there is much
more of HSV2.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.090
It's about 9% in the
control group.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:29.180
And here, what do we see,
with this graph?

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.470
So that is the result that
is brand, brand new.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.190
The other results,
we already had.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.800
That's the reason that this
is completely new.

00:26:39.237 --> 00:26:41.692
AUDIENCE: If they had a uniform,
it makes you more

00:26:41.692 --> 00:26:43.170
likely to [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.180
PROFESSOR: Somewhat
more likely, yes.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.840
So you can call it the same,
that both uniform and teacher

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.140
training don't help.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.680
Those are all pretty similar
in terms of standard error.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.090
But it doesn't help.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:01.300
So having a uniform makes you
stay in school longer.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.360
It makes you less likely
to a teenage pregnancy.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.410
But you're not less
likely to have

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.860
sexually transmitted diseases.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.540
Teacher training, again, is
not doing anything good.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.840
And then what now makes a
difference is the both

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.050
program, where, if you have
the two together, you're

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:27.170
significantly less likely to
be infected with HSV2.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.710
So what do you think
is happening?

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.890
Any kind of story you can try?

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but when
we wrote the book,

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.960
I didn't know this.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.430
So you will have to
make one more.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:52.160
We can start with that, then
you can retell the

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.030
story of the book.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:57.088
And then you can say why that
explains that as well.

00:27:57.088 --> 00:27:59.528
AUDIENCE: So my understanding
was that the uniforms kept the

00:27:59.528 --> 00:28:00.992
students in school.

00:28:00.992 --> 00:28:05.872
And as a result, they had less
time to do other things, like

00:28:05.872 --> 00:28:07.010
have sex, which could

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.800
potentially give them diseases.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.674
So it makes sense to me why both
would be more effective

00:28:12.674 --> 00:28:17.514
in reducing how many people were
HSV2 positive, because

00:28:17.514 --> 00:28:20.418
you would be more likely to be
in school and then you'd be

00:28:20.418 --> 00:28:22.838
getting the training from the
teacher in respect what they

00:28:22.838 --> 00:28:26.720
should not be doing in
order to avoid that.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.010
PROFESSOR: So that
is possible.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.890
So Ben's idea is that, oh, you
spend more time school.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.865
And therefore, you have more
time to learn what the teacher

00:28:33.865 --> 00:28:34.670
is telling you.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.520
And therefore, that should
be the most effective.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.660
But if that was the story, we
should see all of them going

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.060
down a little, and both going
down the most, right?

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.360
So there is something else.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.343
Yeah?

00:28:46.343 --> 00:28:49.241
AUDIENCE: Because it has to
do with getting married.

00:28:49.241 --> 00:28:52.138
So it still kind of goes along
with school, where I think the

00:28:52.138 --> 00:28:55.332
people with the uniforms seem to
be able to stay in school.

00:28:55.332 --> 00:28:56.769
And so they don't
get pregnant.

00:28:56.769 --> 00:28:58.206
Because I assume the pregnancy
would come from

00:28:58.206 --> 00:28:59.170
when they get married.

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.294
But they're probably, maybe
having safe sex.

00:29:01.294 --> 00:29:03.258
Or, I guess, unsafe sex.

00:29:03.258 --> 00:29:05.713
PROFESSOR: Unsafe sex, yeah.

00:29:05.713 --> 00:29:08.659
AUDIENCE: They're still having
sex, so they're still getting

00:29:08.659 --> 00:29:10.458
diseases, but they're not
getting pregnant and dropping

00:29:10.458 --> 00:29:11.114
out of school.

00:29:11.114 --> 00:29:16.515
Whereas with both, it may
be a category where

00:29:16.515 --> 00:29:17.988
they're getting married.

00:29:17.988 --> 00:29:19.952
And so now they only
have one partner.

00:29:19.952 --> 00:29:21.916
So they're less likely
to get diseases

00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:23.430
but not getting pregnant.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:24.463
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:29:24.463 --> 00:29:28.930
AUDIENCE: For this particular
result, are you tracking the

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.010
students who actually dropped
out and got married?

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.660
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.920
We tracked everyone.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.530
That's why it took us forever
and something like $2 million.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:48.000
But we attempted to track all of
the cohort that was in the

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.150
initial program.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.140
Of course, a lot of
them have moved.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.820
So if they went to Nairobi,
we went to

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:54.900
Nairobi to look for them.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.230
If they went to Uganda,
we went to

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.680
Uganda to look for them.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.990
So the first wave of them, we
managed to find about 60%.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:08.080
And then in the remaining 40% of
them, we really put all of

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.840
the means to find them and
found about 80% of them.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.750
And so the effective tracking
rate was about 85%.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.010
And this has accounted
for that.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.140
So we have all the married
people, the ones that have

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.690
dropped out, the ones that
didn't drop out.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:22.940
They're all here.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.080
So anybody wants to build
on the story?

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:39.620
So the story that I think is
happening is something very

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.340
similar to what you
are [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.690
Basically, you can have
two kinds of sex.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.180
You can have casual sex.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.810
And you can have sex with
a regular partner.

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.100
And then you can choose whether
or not you want to use

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.140
a condom or you don't want
to use a condom.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.870
So you can choose your
level of protection.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.000
Let's say you don't
like it so much.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.670
You should like it.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:04.320
But let's say, they don't
like it so much.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.630
And so there is some cost of
using more protection.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.230
But the advantage of condoms is
that you're less likely to

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.530
get an STD, and you're less
likely to get pregnant.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:19.280
And then what people look at
is the cost and benefits of

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.720
pregnancy, of a pregnancy
now, as a teenager.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.930
And the cost of an STD.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.930
There is no benefit
of getting an STD.

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.730
And the probability that they
might get pregnant and the

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.760
probability that they
might get an STD.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.030
And the cost and benefit of
pregnancy is the value of

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.000
having the child.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.640
You might like to have a child
more if you have partner to

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.700
have a child with then if you
have to raise them alone.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.140
So the value of a child in
marriage might be higher than

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.810
the value of a child with
a casual partner.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.450
And then on the cost side is
foregone earnings, because if

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.500
you have child, you have
to take of the child.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.040
They kick you out of
school anyway.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.030
You can absolutely not go to
school when you're pregnant.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.140
In fact, they just passed a law
saying that schools cannot

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:09.310
evict children that
are pregnant.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.380
When this was happening, it was
the end of your schooling

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:16.120
if you had a child.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.860
So the cost of the pregnancy is
that you're losing a chance

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.660
to further your education
if you wanted to.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.690
So that's kind of the parameter
of what's happening.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.545
Now we have the girls, and
they are thinking, well.

00:32:28.545 --> 00:32:31.770
And of course, people like
to have sex, girls, too.

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:35.050
So they are like weighing,
like, what should I do?

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.140
How much sex should I have?

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.700
Should I use contraception?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:47.740
And should I have a regular
partner that

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.190
might lead to a marriage?

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.750
Or should I have casual partners
that are not going to

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.530
lead to marriage?

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.770
And what the teacher training
program is telling them, if

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.800
you have casual sex, you're
very, very, very

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.040
likely to get an STD.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.130
It does change their probability
that they might

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.000
get an STD.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.110
But if you have sex within
marriage, you're safe.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.670
You're fine.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:16.140
In fact, it might do the two
things at the same time.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.810
Maybe, girls have not realized
the difference between casual

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.090
sex and married sex.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.110
But after the teacher training
program, they think married

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.390
sex is very safe.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.330
And they think that casual
sex is very risky.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.760
And the truth is that married
sex is not necessarily that

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.320
safe, because the candidate
for marriage, for a young

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.780
girl, is usually not a young
boy, who would be unable to

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.570
support a child.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:40.210
It's usually an older man,
what they call a "sugar

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:45.630
daddy", who is able to provide
for the girl and then provide

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.700
for the child.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.690
And the girls are convinced that
the "sugar daddies" are

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:52.540
faithful to themselves
and their wives.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.600
But that might not
be entirely true.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.695
And so the actual risk of
infection in married sex and

00:33:59.695 --> 00:34:01.620
in casual sex might not
be that different.

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:07.840
But when the teacher training
program arrived, they feel,

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.350
oh, my god, I have to stop
having casual sex.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:12.920
That's very dangerous.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.929
Let me reduce, a little bit,
the sex I'm going to have.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:20.130
But let me also move towards
married sex.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.120
And by doing that, they're much
more likely to become

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.650
pregnant, because, within
marriage, they think it's fine

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.170
to have a kid.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.460
And also, they think that,
within marriage, they don't

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.630
need to be protected as much.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:35.400
So for these two reasons, the
pregnancy rate will tend to

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.900
increase if anything.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.409
On the other hand, they also
have less sex, so that

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.830
balances out, which is why we
have a slight increase in the

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.679
number of pregnancies, in the
teacher training group,

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.429
instead of seeing a decrease.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.400
Because we see a reduction
in sex, but that's

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.300
counterbalanced by a shift
towards this single

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.330
relationship.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.560
And because the single
relationships are actually not

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.040
that safe, we also don't see
much in terms of reduction in

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.560
HSV2 infection.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.020
Now in the uniform group,
suddenly the cost of staying

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.610
in school has become
much lower.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.560
So staying in school becomes an
option, something you can

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.640
actually do.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.080
So then you feel,
OK, I'm going to

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.270
try and stay in school.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.860
But then I really shouldn't
get pregnant.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:27.180
So you will move from married
sex to casual sex, use more

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.450
contraception, both because you
don't want to have a kid

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:35.610
and because you don't
want to be pregnant.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.370
And that's going to reduce.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.850
So you're going to
dropout less.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.290
You're going to have
fewer kids.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.038
Yep?

00:35:41.038 --> 00:35:43.478
AUDIENCE: Why does the teacher
training still have like a

00:35:43.478 --> 00:35:48.590
large percentage of kids
with HSV2 positives?

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.720
PROFESSOR: Because the reality
is that married sex is not

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.990
that less dangerous,
in terms of HSV

00:35:55.990 --> 00:36:00.392
infection, than casual sex.

00:36:00.392 --> 00:36:02.058
AUDIENCE: But you're saying
there's not a statistical

00:36:02.058 --> 00:36:04.200
difference between training
and both.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.300
PROFESSOR: Oh, there is.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.390
So teacher training
does nothing.

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:08.640
So, oops.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.260
There is no difference
between teacher

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.240
training and control group.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.145
That's because with teacher
training people switch towards

00:36:19.145 --> 00:36:19.880
married sex.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.010
And they think that's safe.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:22.520
But that's not really.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.640
Because they're having sex with
sugar daddies who are

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.140
maybe themselves infected.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.270
So they do that, which is
why they have more kids.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.490
But they think that it's safe.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.510
But it's not safe, which
is why you get no.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.310
And then I'm going to talk
about both in a moment.

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:38.780
So I've done teacher training.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.205
I've done uniform
and now both.

00:36:41.205 --> 00:36:43.890
Well, what is happening with
both is that, on the one hand,

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.600
you think casual sex
is very dangerous.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.830
You want to avoid it.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.570
On the other hand, you don't
want to get pregnant.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:50.430
So married sex is not
great at all.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.040
So you can't substitute.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.180
The teacher training program
only pushes you towards one

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.430
kind of sex.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.240
And therefore, so that
you don't have to

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.450
reduce your sex so much.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.430
The uniform program pushes you
towards the other kind of sex.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.210
And you don't also reduce
your sex so much.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:10.590
But the both program, the can't
substitute, because

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.160
neither of them are so
great as an option.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.270
So your only option is either
to reduce sex or to increase

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:25.920
protection or both, which is why
we get the biggest effect

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:31.040
on HSV2, but we don't get the
biggest effect on pregnancy.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.650
Because we don't have this
switch towards casual sex,

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.703
which really doesn't have very
many pregnancies at all.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:43.540
So that, I think, is what is
going on, which is we get

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.630
exactly these patterns
of results.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.790
Yeah?

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:47.662
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:37:47.662 --> 00:37:51.616
So you're saying that you don't
see this as all with

00:37:51.616 --> 00:37:53.065
respect to pregnancy?

00:37:53.065 --> 00:37:54.865
You don't necessarily
have a shift

00:37:54.865 --> 00:37:56.870
towards casual sex there?

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.150
PROFESSOR: So this is what
we have for pregnancy.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.830
For pregnancy, with the
both, they stay

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.850
like at the same level.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:08.210
So you don't have
these big shift.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:10.460
You really have very few
pregnancies in casual

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.860
relationships.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.443
AUDIENCE: Does that tell us
anything about which one,

00:38:14.443 --> 00:38:19.273
uniform or teacher training,
which is more [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:19.273 --> 00:38:21.095
to be more responsible to?

00:38:21.095 --> 00:38:23.760
PROFESSOR: So both of them, in
a sense, I think, teacher

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.880
training, they were responsive
to both of them.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.260
But in the way that I just
described, in terms of their

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.280
thinking about it.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.420
But in terms of the effect
you're trying to get, well, if

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:41.980
you're interested in schooling
or in teenage pregnancy,

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.500
asking people to stay in school
is the best thing.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:50.000
If you're interested in
preventing HIV/AIDS and other

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.040
STDs, then you want to
add some training.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.790
That doesn't make if for a very,
very easy policy lesson,

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.380
because that slightly depends
on you objective.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.670
But for a very fundamental
reason, which is it

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.010
corresponds to the way people
decide and how they decide.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.780
So it seems the biggest policy
answer to that is that you

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.120
shouldn't have programs that
are lying to people.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.980
It just doesn't help.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.720
So the way the program is
structured is to try and make

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.110
the girls as scared as possible
of casual sex.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:29.780
But it would be a little bit
better to insist on helping

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.190
them to find a way to protect
themselves, both against

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.070
pregnancy and against HSV2.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.324
So I think that's kind of the
lesson that comes out of this.

00:39:36.324 --> 00:39:37.132
Yep?

00:39:37.132 --> 00:39:40.592
AUDIENCE: So along those lines,
how do these results

00:39:40.592 --> 00:39:43.924
reconcile with the fact that the
teacher training doesn't

00:39:43.924 --> 00:39:46.066
actually emphasize contraception
anymore, like

00:39:46.066 --> 00:39:47.732
safe sex at all?

00:39:47.732 --> 00:39:49.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.070
These results are a direct
consequence of the fact that

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.320
the teacher training doesn't
influence contraception.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.470
So they won't tell
you anything.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:01.570
It's not an evaluation of
teacher training in general.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.650
This is an evaluation of the way
it is done in Kenya and in

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:07.700
most of East Africa,
which is explicitly

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.930
ignoring the condoms.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:10.230
Yeah?

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.620
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:14.601
What I mean is like, in this
last finding, the argument

00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:20.324
goes that, if you have both
teacher training and uniforms,

00:40:20.324 --> 00:40:26.813
then people are more likely to
not be married but have safer

00:40:26.813 --> 00:40:28.110
casual sex.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.370
PROFESSOR: And fewer
sex in general.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:32.750
AUDIENCE: And have fewer
sexual partners.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.890
PROFESSOR: Less sex, also.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:36.800
Both things will happen
on this one.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:40.880
Because when you have just
teacher training, people have

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.480
the option to switch towards
the married sex.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.550
When you just have the uniform,
people have the

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:49.500
option to switch toward
the casual sex.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.020
But here, they don't have the
option to switch, because they

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.550
are scared of married
sex, because

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.590
they don't want children.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.380
And they're scared of casual
sex, because they

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.700
don't want an STD.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.280
And they think the probability
is high with casual sex.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.450
So the only thing they can do,
because they can't substitute

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.810
between these two activities, is
either to have less sex or

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.970
to use more contraception.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:14.230
And the teacher training,
itself, is not teaching them

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.080
about contraception.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.720
But they all know, at some
level, that it's available,

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.590
and that it prevents
both pregnancy

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.570
and STDs, to a point.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.500
So this doesn't tell us you
shouldn't train the teachers.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.120
I think this tells us you
train the teachers with

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.140
information that is actually
useful, actionable, which

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.240
might not be such revolutionary
thinking.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:43.100
But when you spend a lot of
time in education/health

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:48.540
circle in Kenya, you realize
it's actually a pretty big,

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.810
pretty controversial
statement.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.700
So Pascaline Dupas, when she was
still a Ph.D. student, she

00:41:55.700 --> 00:42:00.260
worked in this project, to do
something else, which we talk

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.990
about also a little bit
in the book, which is

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.900
the sugar daddy project.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.632
And what the sugar daddy project
is, is to tell the

00:42:06.632 --> 00:42:12.410
kids that it is not true that
sex with older people is safe.

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.020
In fact, older people are much
more likely to infected with

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.710
HIV than younger people.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:23.590
So that's the information that
was given, plus a nice video

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:28.850
about a girl who managed to trap
someone who wants to be a

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.700
sugar daddy and something like
that, a very short, very quick

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:32.660
intervention.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.800
A little film produced by
UNICEF and then these

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.890
statistics, which is your
chance to get an STD.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.450
The infection rate of older men
is much higher than the

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:47.240
infection rate of younger men.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.670
And sadly, the infection rate
of girls is also higher than

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.460
that of boys, for the reason
that girls are more likely to

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.590
have sex with older men, who
are likely to be infected.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:59.850
So you are telling the girls,
you should really have sex

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:04.530
with the boys, because they are
safer than the men, not

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.710
quite in so many words,
but making

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.140
the information available.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.390
And you're also telling the
boys that these innocent

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:13.600
looking girls actually
are probably more

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.770
risky than you think.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:19.790
And this intervention was
actually quite effective at

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:25.140
reducing sex with older
partners, as indicated by the

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.540
number of pregnancies
with older dads.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:33.610
It reduced the pregnancy with
older dads by 66%, 2/3.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:37.430
So this is also another sign of
the fact that, if you tell

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.820
people the right thing, like
people will react to what it

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.380
is you tell them.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.320
If you tell people the wrong
thing, they're also going to

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:43.870
react to it.

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.000
But they'll not react to it
in a way that is very.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.490
You don't get that many more
HSV2, and you get many more

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:55.060
kids who are married with
older men and have

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.640
children too early.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:00.080
So that's, maybe, the biggest
lesson from this finding is

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.890
you should tell people the truth
and assume that they

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:04.690
will be able to make the
right decisions.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:09.470
You don't have to scare them
away into doing things.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:13.585
So that's for that.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:22.410
So I guess the key lesson
is fertility

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.610
decisions are like others.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:25.740
We need to try and
understand them.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.380
And this is one area where
policies have been based on

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.640
the assumption that
people are idiots.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.440
And that's, I think, a very bad
assumption in general and

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.790
particularly, perhaps, in this
area, because it's a very

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:40.210
important decision that people
are much more likely to take,

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:43.290
with a lot of thinking and
with a lot of you.

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:47.180
So that brings us, pretty
naturally, into the next

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:52.710
topic, which is, if it's
a decision, inherently,

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:57.370
fertility decisions are
decisions that are made by a

00:44:57.370 --> 00:45:00.300
man and a woman.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.000
But if we think about it, a lot
of the other decisions we

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.950
talked about in this class are
also decisions that are being

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:07.740
made by a man and a woman.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.620
And we completely ignored that
our discussions so far.

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:15.730
I've always talked about parents
decide how many,

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:19.350
whether to immunize their kids,
how much to feed them,

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:22.740
how many years of education they
should get, et cetera.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.370
And in this, I've ignored the
dynamic of the family.

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.660
So now I want to spend
a bit of time--

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.190
not much, but the rest
of this lecture--

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:33.820
to talk about family
decisions.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:02.120
So the question, here, we're
going to ask is, how do

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.370
families decide?

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:09.190
So when we mean family,
we mean who?

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.940
Like who decides?

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:10.820
The dad decides.

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:11.650
The mom decides.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:12.720
The mother-in-law decides.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.590
The kids, what do kids
have to play?

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.180
They are relevant to all sorts
of decisions that are taken

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.390
jointly by parents.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.790
Until now, we've ignored it.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.710
We've assumed that there was
something called, a family.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:29.710
And yet the family, we
know, is a group.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:35.580
So in what case would it be
legitimate to ignore the fact

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.600
that the family is a
group of people?

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.790
There are two cases where we
could say, well, we know it's

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:42.040
a group, but we can ignore it.

00:46:45.432 --> 00:46:47.420
AUDIENCE: I would think all
families are the same?

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.780
PROFESSOR: All family members.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.310
Like if we think that all family
members are the same,

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:53.230
they all have the same
preferences, so they all want

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.580
the same thing.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.850
So anybody who has been part of
a family, does this sound

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:01.810
like a good approximation
to a family, the

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.456
way a family functions?

00:47:03.456 --> 00:47:04.450
AUDIENCE: No.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:04.970
PROFESSOR: Not really.

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:06.570
I think it's not the case
that there are no

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:07.560
conflicts within families.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.700
People have different
views about how

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.160
everything should be done.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.850
And the second way in which we
could ignore the fact that

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.625
it's a collection of
individuals is?

00:47:19.385 --> 00:47:22.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.380
PROFESSOR: If one person
made all the decisions.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:29.580
So we had the mother or the
father is like the person who

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.220
makes all the decisions for
everyone, possibly taking into

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:35.600
account people's preferences,
but not giving them a voice in

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.990
how the decision
is being made.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:42.740
Does that sound a plausible
model of the family?

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.600
AUDIENCE: At certain ages.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.040
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:48.730
AUDIENCE: At certain ages.

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:52.125
PROFESSOR: At certain ages, of
course, like the infant is not

00:47:52.125 --> 00:47:55.240
really in control, so someone
decides for them.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:47:59.020
Norm?

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.124
AUDIENCE: Probably on the gender
breakdown, so the guys

00:48:02.124 --> 00:48:04.170
will decide, or the male
in the family will

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:05.590
decide for the females.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:06.070
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:11.380
So it might be that in some
societies, there is really a

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.540
lot of control by the guys in
the family, as you say.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:20.500
But that will depend.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.100
Their society's say, you take
Pakistan or part of India,

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.390
which will be more patriarchal
than Africa, where the African

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:28.880
family is like--

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.810
it depends where, of course--

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.570
where there is more equality
between genders.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:35.500
So no one, maybe, is like
in a position to

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.390
really, fully decide.

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:40.680
So maybe the assumption that
one person decides for

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.820
everyone is more plausible in
some cases, but we feel that

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.480
it's not going to
be always true.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.300
And in a lot of cases, the
family is not one person.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.660
The family is a collection
of people.

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:58.320
And they are trying
to fight it out.

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.190
So women and men have different
preferences.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:03.910
For example, one area where
they have very different

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:10.270
preferences is how many children
they want to have.

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:12.600
So, for example, there was a
study in Zambia-- that I'm

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.240
going to show you in a moment--
showing that women

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.660
want to have much fewer
children than men.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.810
So one reason, of course, would
be that it's Zambia and

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:26.390
the probability of dying in
childbirth is not 0, while if

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:29.090
you're the woman, you're more
likely to be the one who is

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:30.340
paying the cost of that.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.000
So as Norm mentioned, the family
is patriarchal in many

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.990
developing countries, so maybe
men take lot of decisions.

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:42.050
But even there, you have,
usually, a little sphere, like

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:44.500
how to buy the food, et cetera,
where it's really the

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.680
woman who decides and
where bargaining

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.400
could be taking place.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.050
So how do we test this?

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:53.270
How do we know?

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:55.840
How we can we try and see
whether the family is

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.680
patriarchal, is unitary, either
everybody agrees or

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.300
someone decides for everyone?

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:06.050
So if the family behaves like
one individual, we could

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:08.020
analyze the decision problem
of a family--

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.920
for example, how much food to
buy, whether to send the kids

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.790
to school, how many children
to how, et cetera--

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:16.770
like the problem of
one single person.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.440
So the only thing that should
matter to a single person,

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:22.760
and, therefore, to the family
in this context, is the

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:27.730
family's overall income,
the prices of things--

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:32.280
how expensive it is to buy
whichever types of thing,

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.320
school fees, et cetera--

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:41.310
and information that you have,
to everyone in the family.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:42.980
But if the family
is not unitary.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.380
It's what we call this model,
where one person decides for

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:47.900
everyone or everybody agrees.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.640
We call this the unitary model,
like there is unity in

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.820
the family.

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.780
So if the family is not unitary,
than other things are

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.710
going to start to matter.

00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:00.740
So, for example, it's not only
the overall income that is

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.730
going to matter, but who
brings what share.

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:09.680
Because they can now, say, well,
if you don't do what I

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.690
want to do, then I'm just
going to take my

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:13.430
income and go away.

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:16.220
So now it's not the overall
income that's going to matter,

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.540
it's the share of the income.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.820
So again, we could see men
taking much more decisions,

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.670
that's because they are bring
more of the income.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:30.300
And we could see, maybe, that
when woman bring more income,

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.720
they would be able to
take more decisions.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.910
The second thing that might
matter is private information.

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:39.480
So if you know that the family
is not unitary, and you find

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.810
something out, you might
keep it for you.

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:46.160
Because that gives you some
power to make some decisions.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.770
So let's look at whether we
find evidence that private

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.150
information, that is information
that one member

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:55.630
has and not the other, makes a
difference in decisions and

00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:58.610
whether it's who brings
the income to

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:01.050
family matters as well.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.300
Let's look at these
two things.

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:08.970
So private information, let's
look at fertility.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:13.060
So I was telling this data from
Zambia showing that women

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:16.010
want to have fewer
kids than men.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:18.630
And in fact, they report hiding
contraceptives from

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:21.280
their husbands.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.140
So in that case, you could
ask a question.

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:30.990
If I provide information to
women about contraceptives,

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:34.150
would it make a difference if
I provide it to the woman

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:39.260
alone or if I provide it
together to women and men?

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.050
So under the unitary model,
what would we expect?

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:47.750
AUDIENCE: Whoever the head of
the household is, [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, whoever we give
it to, even if it's not

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:51.270
the head, we give it
to the woman, she's

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:52.780
going to tell the husband.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.330
So it should make
no difference.

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.785
Or maybe it would even have a
bigger effect to give it to

00:52:56.785 --> 00:52:59.390
the men, because they are more
likely to understand, they're

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:01.690
more likely to be involved,
et cetera.

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:05.100
So a lot of family planning
policies are now saying, we

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.980
have to involve the men.

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.500
Because after all, the men
have something to do with

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:09.140
contraception.

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:09.830
That's the idea.

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:11.870
Let's involve the men, and they
would be more likely to

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:13.210
be informed.

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:23.540
On the other hand, if it is the
case that women are more

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:27.770
likely to want fewer children,
then involving only the woman,

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:32.730
it gives her an option to hide
the contraception from her

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.280
husband and, therefore,
potentially,

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.430
to have fewer kids.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:37.050
So it could really
cut both ways.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.910
In the unitary model, you would
expect no difference or

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:42.920
maybe doing it to both together
would be better.

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:47.740
Or it would have a larger
effect, because the

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.190
information would be
more likely to be

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:50.730
diffused in the family.

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:52.750
Under the non-unitary model,
maybe the woman

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.750
would matter more.

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:56.280
So what do you think
is happening?

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:00.470
What's your bet?

00:54:03.502 --> 00:54:05.306
AUDIENCE: The women use
it more when their

00:54:05.306 --> 00:54:06.460
husbands don't know.

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.440
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.210
What they find is that women
use it much more when their

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:12.180
husband doesn't how.

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:12.960
So they did that?

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:17.620
Well, they ran an experiment
where they provided people a

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.480
voucher to skip the queue.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.780
Because in Zambia, in principle,
you are allowed to

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:25.030
have contraception, et cetera.

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:27.630
But in practice, it
takes a long time.

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:28.510
The nurse calls you.

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:31.430
Once you've come, if you don't
have your clothes for an

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:32.880
examination.

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.730
So people don't really go
to the family planning.

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:40.850
So here, it's a voucher for
first class treatment, no need

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:46.170
to bring your clothes and
a good, nice setting.

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:49.350
So they did that.

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:50.510
I don't know if it was half.

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:54.550
But the separated the group in
two, one where they gave the

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:57.750
voucher to the wife, alone, and
one where they gave it to

00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:59.000
wife and husband together.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.190
And so the question is whether
women are more likely to take

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:08.440
care of their contraception,
whether they're more likely to

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.890
be able to control their
fertility in one

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:13.130
case than in the other.

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:18.050
So that's what the find for the
take-up of the voucher.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:21.850
So the first two columns
are whether or not

00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:23.970
you redeemed a voucher.

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:29.200
And the second two are whether
or not you get an injection of

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:33.670
contraception, which is a method
of contraception that

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:35.770
you can hide easily.

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.580
Because you got the injection.

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.940
No one knows that you
are not fertile for

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.180
the next three months.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:45.590
And what you find is that people
are more likely to

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:48.880
redeem the voucher in the
individual treatment than in

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.920
the couple treatment .

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.640
And they are more likely to
receive the concealable method

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:59.240
in the individual treatment than
in a couple treatment.

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:05.220
So the effects are of the
order of, let's say, 55%

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.200
received a voucher in individual
versus 42%.

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.800
So these are not negligible
effects.

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.010
So it seems that it matters how
you provide information.

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:20.260
It matters also for the number
of kids that people have.

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:24.270
So this is the fraction of
births, in the months

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:28.450
following the treatment, among
women, who said, at baseline,

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:30.760
that they did not want
any more births.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:36.000
So you can think of them as
unwanted pregnancies.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.820
So six months later,
of course, you

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:40.070
should see no effect.

00:56:46.045 --> 00:56:48.650
The couple treatment, which is
the red line, is a little

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:51.410
below, but that's not due to
the treatment, because it's

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:53.990
six months later.

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:57.000
And then at nine months,
the couple cross.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.920
And the red line is above the
blue line for a few months,

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.950
which reflects about three
months of Depo-Provera use.

00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:08.160
And then what happened is that
the effect on that, it

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.620
disappears subsequently.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.420
And it goes up a lot for both.

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:17.740
And the reason is that there was
a policy change in Zambia.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:21.040
All of the injectable were taken
away from the market.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:26.310
So any effect of the treatment
goes away, because after your

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:29.230
first injection, you could
not get the second one.

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:36.860
So we should expect an effect
in the 9 to 14 month, after

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:39.950
the treatment, which is
exactly what we find.

00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:45.310
So if we look at the number of
unwanted births that were

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:47.140
prevented--

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.630
I actually don't remember
exactly the number.

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:50.950
But it's a fair number of
unwanted births that were

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:56.750
prevented by going from
couple treatment to

00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:57.780
the woman only treatment.

00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.000
So that's the first indication
that the family is not

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.380
unitary, because who you are
giving information to changes

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.210
the outcome.

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:06.850
So people hide information.

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.560
The second information
is what economists

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.870
call bargaining power.

00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:18.650
So even when the information
set is the same for both

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:20.560
partners, they might start
to bargain over a family

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:25.380
decision, who works, how hard,
how many children to have, how

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.710
much to feed the children,
how much to educate the

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:29.520
children, et cetera.

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.860
So the bargaining power is your
ability to weigh-in on

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.280
the family decision, if the
family decision are the

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:38.560
process of these discussions.

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.630
So what would affect a woman's
bargaining power, other than

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:42.920
the information she has?

00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:49.020
So we already mentioned
an income.

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.992
What else could be there?

00:58:51.992 --> 00:58:54.990
If you have good eyesight, you
can read it on the slide, but

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:56.670
you can also think
about it instead.

00:59:00.135 --> 00:59:03.590
AUDIENCE: Maybe divorce
policy?

00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:04.760
PROFESSOR: Absolutely right.

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.400
Divorce policy will affect
bargaining power.

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.863
And how does it work?

00:59:08.863 --> 00:59:11.761
AUDIENCE: Depending on how
they allocate the family

00:59:11.761 --> 00:59:15.142
resources after divorce,
I don't know there.

00:59:15.142 --> 00:59:18.523
But I know in the past, in the
US, they would allocate it

00:59:18.523 --> 00:59:19.972
mostly to the man.

00:59:19.972 --> 00:59:21.920
And now, in a lot of
states, it's 50-50.

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.410
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:24.600
If you live in a divorce regime,
where all of the

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.060
assets, and maybe the control
over the children, goes to the

00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:31.910
man, then for a woman to
divorce is a disaster.

00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:34.080
So when the take decisions, when
they bargain, they are

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.980
thinking, what is my
outside option?

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:40.520
And if I'm thinking my outside
option is absolutely horrible,

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.640
then I have to agree
to whatever

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.670
the husband is proposing.

00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:48.070
So the divorce laws are going
to make a difference.

00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:52.620
How much of the commons assets
can the woman get back, and

00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:55.020
how much control of kids
could she have?

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:58.430
And in fact, it's been shown,
in the US, that when the

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:01.150
change that you talked about
was implemented, it was

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:03.860
implemented in different states
at different times.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:07.770
So you can trace what happened
to women, in particular, to

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.230
decisions that are more in the
interest of the woman.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:13.190
You can see that the decisions,
within the

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:16.390
household, improved in favor of
the woman when the divorce

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:20.500
law improved to give
women more rights.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.628
So divorce law is one.

01:00:22.628 --> 01:00:25.098
AUDIENCE: Actually,
like health?

01:00:25.098 --> 01:00:28.925
So if the husband is in really
bad health, the woman probably

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:31.520
has a lot of power
in the family.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.090
PROFESSOR: If the husband
has bad health, the

01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:34.340
woman has more power.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.260
Yes, that could be one.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.490
Maybe because his outside
option is now very bad,

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:42.620
because A, he couldn't get
married to someone else,

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.460
because he is so sick.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:50.330
B, he couldn't get by himself,
so he has to kind of be nice

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:53.570
so that she will continue
to take care of him.

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:55.170
AUDIENCE: So this slightly
related to a lot of them.

01:00:57.825 --> 01:01:01.730
If you came from a wealthy
family or came from a family

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:05.322
with a status, the husband
couldn't get anything from the

01:01:05.322 --> 01:01:06.768
family, but just so as
not to embarrass

01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:08.220
himself in the society?

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:08.690
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly.

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:12.560
So the family you're coming from
will influence bargaining

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:17.550
power, because, maybe, not
wanting to embarrass himself.

01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:20.500
Also, because it could be a
threat that my very strong

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:24.060
brothers are going to break
your kneecaps if you don't

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:25.650
behave with me.

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:28.070
So that creates like
an outside option.

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:31.350
Also, in case of divorce, again,
it gives you a chance

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:34.350
to come back to something,
whereas if you have no family,

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:36.100
then you have no options.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:40.030
So that's very good,
your family,

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.580
where people came from.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.938
What else could we have?

01:01:42.938 --> 01:01:46.354
AUDIENCE: The relative level
of education [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:50.746
If she's just been to high
school, [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:50.746 --> 01:01:53.186
make that economic decision.

01:01:53.186 --> 01:01:58.554
She may not have the mental
leverage to say, what I'm

01:01:58.554 --> 01:02:00.506
saying makes more sense.

01:02:00.506 --> 01:02:01.030
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:01.820
So that's very good.

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:05.760
So the relative level of
education will matter, both

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.820
because, again, it creates
some different outside

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.750
options, because with a
high school dropout,

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:11.040
what would you do?

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.820
You're kind of dependent.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:16.230
And the other point you're
making, which is not about

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:18.940
outside options, but even
your ability to bargain.

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:21.510
You might not feel confident.

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:23.810
When someone tells you that I
know better, you might feel

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:26.080
like, yeah, maybe
you know better.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.791
Good.

01:02:27.791 --> 01:02:31.767
AUDIENCE: Is it possible to
consider that a woman could

01:02:31.767 --> 01:02:35.246
tell her husband, we won't have
intercourse if you don't

01:02:35.246 --> 01:02:37.750
do this and that.

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:45.430
Not only is it possible, but I
think that's a pretty frequent

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:47.440
bargaining technique.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:52.830
So, in that case, if that's the
bargaining technique, then

01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:56.830
you would think how attractive
each partner is and how long

01:02:56.830 --> 01:02:58.890
they've been in a relationship
and things like that

01:02:58.890 --> 01:02:59.720
are going to matter.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.010
Because the level of the threat
is also whether or not

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:06.170
you think it's a problem or
you could figure something

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:07.420
else out if necessary.

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:14.338
What else would we have?

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:23.920
Well, one more is your ability
to earn an independent income.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.760
So that's related to the point
you're making about education.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:33.660
But it could also be just labor
market opportunities for

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:34.630
men and women.

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:38.280
So for example, if you live in
a society where women cannot

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.680
get jobs, because say there is
[INAUDIBLE], then what will

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.040
the woman do without husbands?

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.350
There would be a big problem.

01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:51.370
Whereas if you live in a society
like here, where you

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:57.580
could get a job, if you needed
to, then that changes your

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:00.950
level of outside options, and,
therefore, changes the way the

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:03.010
negotiations would be made.

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:06.120
Another one is the
marriage market.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.130
Is it possible for a woman to
get married or for a man to

01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:11.310
get married after a divorce?

01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:13.190
There are some places
where it's harder.

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:19.150
What is the gender ratio, how
many women there are for men?

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:23.350
If you are in, for example, an
immigrant community, where the

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:27.540
ratio of men to woman is very
skewed, because a lot of men

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:32.190
have come, new men have come,
then the woman can threaten to

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:34.090
get married to any of
those available

01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:35.990
boys within the community.

01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:38.250
That would increase their
bargaining power within the

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:42.790
family compared to a situation
which is more even.

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:47.352
People said that about China,
today, that one kind of

01:04:47.352 --> 01:04:51.130
strange consequences of the fact
that the gender ratio are

01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:54.140
completely skewed, due to
selective abortion and things

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.040
like, it means that women,
actually, are in short supply.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:02.090
And therefore, it's getting
easier to marry them.

01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:05.210
And they have a lot of
bargaining power within the

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:09.090
family, because there's no
substitute for them.

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:11.450
So all of these things
would matter.

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:18.120
So let's focus on one, for the
purpose of this, which is how

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.500
much money women and men bring
to the family, and, in

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.810
particular, how much money
they would have access to

01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:26.190
should they leave
the marriage.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.640
That's going to matter
for family decisions.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:37.160
So policy makers are very
convinced it's the case.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.460
So for example, all the cash
transfer programs that exist

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:45.160
in Latin America, to encourage
schooling and health--

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.685
like the PROGRESA program in
Mexico, that we discussed in

01:05:47.685 --> 01:05:49.220
the case of education--

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.570
they tend to always give
the money to women.

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:55.190
On the ground that A, women will
make a bigger use of the

01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:57.830
money, and B, that's going to
increase their bargaining

01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:00.410
power and, therefore, increase
all decisions.

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:05.720
So there is very benign sexism
going on around in the policy

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.900
world that women are generally
better people, which I don't

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.160
necessarily disagree with.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:14.820
But it should be looked
into a little bit.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:17.680
So another one that is very
much inspired by this is

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.800
microcredit.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.000
Microcredit claims,
the world-wide,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.780
are almost all women.

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.370
Part of the reason is that
women are believed to be

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:27.350
better at repaying.

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.530
But part of the reason is also
that it was believed that it

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:33.360
was a way to introduce some
changes, within their

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.780
families, by giving power
to the family.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:39.470
So does it matter who gets money
or doesn't get money?

01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:43.000
I want to give one example to
prove my point that women are

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.760
better people than men.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:50.840
Looking at one example where
money went into the household,

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:56.560
either with the men or with
women, which is the end of

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.930
Apartheid in South Africa.

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:02.150
They took a pension program,
which existed for white

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:05.270
people, which was, for white
people, a very small pension

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:10.480
program, in that it was not
a lot of money for them.

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.910
And also, almost no one was
eligible, because you couldn't

01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:16.070
be eligible if you had
a private pension.

01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:18.050
And most people have
private pensions.

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:21.820
So it was smallish program on
the side, a little bit like we

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:24.700
have here with minimum,
old-age security.

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:28.640
But at the end of Apartheid, the
new government had to make

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.970
a decision about, should we can
the program or should we

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:33.870
expand it to the black
South Africans?

01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:36.970
Of course, they're not going to
keep two separate programs.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:41.380
And they decided to expand it,
because it was believed,

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:44.600
rightly, that the older people,
who would be eligible

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.240
for this program, are precisely
the people who

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.790
suffered the most from
Apartheid, for

01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:52.570
their entire lifetime.

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:54.210
So they expanded the program.

01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:58.650
And every man above 65 and
every woman about 60 is

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:00.770
eligible for the program
unless they

01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:01.560
have a private pension.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.220
And very few of the black people
had a private pension.

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.160
So about 85 to 90% percent of
people who are eligible

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.950
actually get the program.

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:11.200
So the old-age pension program,
which is still there

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.800
today, it's a huge, huge deal.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.220
It's a lot of money.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.470
And it's very important
for the families.

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:22.880
And, of course, a lot of the
older people don't live alone.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.370
They live with children or they
live with grandchildren.

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:28.460
And in particular, in South
Africa, it is quite frequent

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:32.680
that you have skip-generation
households, where you have a

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.210
grandparent, no parent,
and the kids.

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:40.290
This is for two reasons, one is
HIV/AIDS, which has killed

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:42.460
a lot of the middle
generation.

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:46.979
And the other is the way the
society was structured under

01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:49.870
Apartheid, people couldn't bring
their family when they

01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:51.529
went to work in the city.

01:08:51.529 --> 01:08:56.739
So they went alone, and they
left the kids behind with the

01:08:56.739 --> 01:08:57.689
grandparents.

01:08:57.689 --> 01:09:01.520
So for this reason, about a
quarter of kids, aged 0 to 5,

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.550
live with a grandparent.

01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:05.314
And that grandparent
can either be a man

01:09:05.314 --> 01:09:08.170
or it can be a woman.

01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:10.540
And the question we can ask is,
does it make a difference,

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.910
when this pension program comes
in, in 1993, if you

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:17.310
happen to live with no one or
with a grandparent, who

01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:21.779
becomes eligible, or with a
grandfather or a grandmother?

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:29.060
So of course, one problem is
that the families who have a

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:33.359
grandfather are different from
the family who don't have a

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:36.160
grandfather.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:47.204
So what we can look at is, let's
take a sample of kids

01:09:47.204 --> 01:09:54.980
who live with a grandfather, but
let's compare the one who

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:59.030
lives with a grandfather who is,
let's say, 55, versus one

01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:04.920
who is 65 or a grandfather who
is 50 to 64 versus 66.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.780
So in both cases, there
is a grandfather.

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.090
But one is just short
of being eligible.

01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:12.770
And one is just eligible.

01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:15.880
So other characteristics of the
family should be more or

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:16.990
less constant.

01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:19.360
It just happened that your
age is a good thing.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.600
And of course, people couldn't
really predict that this

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.780
pension was coming, so the kid
lives with a grandfather and,

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:28.920
oh, he becomes just eligible
or is not yet eligible.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:32.520
The same thing with the
grandmother but around 60.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.290
So this is what this is doing.

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:36.360
This is looking at weight
for height.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.485
So this is short trend
measure of nutrition.

01:10:43.095 --> 01:10:44.880
As soon as you start
eating better, you

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.190
weight for height improves.

01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:52.510
And in orange, we have
the boys, and, in

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:54.980
yellow, we have the girls.

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:58.010
And you can see that.

01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:59.000
So what can you see?

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.743
Can you interpret this?

01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:07.644
AUDIENCE: So this bar is
higher for eligible

01:11:07.644 --> 01:11:12.370
grandmothers that took all
their grandsons in.

01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:13.200
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.088
AUDIENCE: Heavier grandsons
and granddaughters.

01:11:15.088 --> 01:11:19.336
And my guess is that, because
they're eligible earlier, they

01:11:19.336 --> 01:11:22.130
have more to give earlier.

01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:23.090
PROFESSOR: So this
is right after

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:26.660
eligibility in both cases.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:28.710
So we don't have a longer time.

01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:29.080
Yeah?

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.050
AUDIENCE: Well, it's just to
show that grandmothers seem to

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:34.525
care more about their
grandchildren than

01:11:34.525 --> 01:11:37.495
grandfathers do when they
become eligible.

01:11:37.495 --> 01:11:40.465
And then you can also
see the bias.

01:11:40.465 --> 01:11:44.920
So for grandmothers, it seems
like they treat girls better.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.880
And grandfathers also
treat girls better.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.960
PROFESSOR: So, basically, we
don't have much for the

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.950
grandfathers.

01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:56.080
So the grandfather doesn't seem
to be using the money to

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.760
be feeding the kids.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.210
And we have up a much larger
effect for the grandmothers,

01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:04.040
particularly for the girls.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.750
And some effects for the boys,
but only half the size.

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:10.102
AUDIENCE: Now why is it the case
that the grandsons are

01:12:10.102 --> 01:12:15.310
worse off when their eligible
grandfathers [INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:17.650
PROFESSOR: So if we had the
confidence interval bar on

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:20.310
this graph, you would see that
this is not significant.

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:23.830
So this is kind of same-ish.

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:26.330
No eligible grandparents and
the bars for eligible

01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:29.340
grandfather are around
the same magnitude.

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:32.010
What is really different
is the girls with the

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:33.620
grandmother.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.584
And the boys to some extent, but
it's about half the size.

01:12:36.584 --> 01:12:39.795
AUDIENCE: So could there be an
effect in that, when you have

01:12:39.795 --> 01:12:41.928
an eligible grandfather, they're
older, so that they'll

01:12:41.928 --> 01:12:43.560
have to spend more of
their pension on

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.340
like their own stuff?

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:45.980
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:50.280
So that could be that.

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.170
The grandfather is older.

01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:55.050
And also, men live less
longer than women.

01:12:55.050 --> 01:13:01.960
So actually, a 65-year-old man
is quite a bit older than a

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.280
60-year-old woman.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.630
So that could be a reason.

01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:08.130
So we can start looking
at this kind

01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:09.700
of stuff, for example.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.400
Also, they might want to save
more of their pension if it's

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.670
a grandfather, because he's
going to die very soon.

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:18.550
So it's more like a transitory
income shock than a permanent

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:19.090
income shock.

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:21.380
So you might want to
say, let's save it.

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.850
So we looked at saving,
too, to control.

01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:26.370
And we couldn't find a
difference in savings.

01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:27.610
The savings seem
to be the same.

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:34.560
But you're right, it could be
explained by that, that the

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.210
grandfathers need to be
spending the money on

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:38.408
themselves, where the
grandmother doesn't need to.

01:13:38.408 --> 01:13:41.645
AUDIENCE: Also, could it
potentially be the case that

01:13:41.645 --> 01:13:45.380
the grandmothers may be alone
in the household, with their

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:48.119
grandchildren, therefore they
would not have to spend

01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:50.360
anything on other people.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.850
Whereas, maybe in the culture,
it's more likely that a

01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:56.114
grandfather has to take care,
also, of his wife, therefore

01:13:56.114 --> 01:13:59.036
when he becomes eligible, there
is a greater fraction of

01:13:59.036 --> 01:14:01.471
his income that also
goes to a wife.

01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:02.445
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

01:14:02.445 --> 01:14:03.730
That can be tested.

01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:06.080
Because you can look at
all of the family size

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.360
configurations.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.060
And you seem to find these
difference regardless of who

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:12.840
is who is who.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:16.400
What is interesting, which helps
answering your question,

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.230
is the grandmother could be the
mother's mother or could

01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:22.460
be the father's mother.

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:26.000
So you can look at, the pension
goes to the mother's

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.670
mother or to mother's father
or to father's mother or to

01:14:29.670 --> 01:14:30.920
the father's father.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.280
Which one do you
think matters?

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.920
Under your hypothesis, if it's
only due to the health issue,

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.930
what should we see?

01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:45.780
That mother's mothers and
mother's fathers should be the

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:48.960
same and then the father would
be lower, because they need

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.600
more money.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.800
And then, in practice,
what do we see?

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.020
These high bar is only their
mother's mother.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.250
So it's only the pension
translating to higher health

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:04.310
of the kids if it's a maternal
grandmother of a girl.

01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:06.960
So that seemed to have something
to do with these

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.830
gender lines.

01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:11.130
And that doesn't mean that the
grandmother doesn't do other

01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:12.210
things for the kids.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:16.220
But in terms of how they decide
to feed the kids, it's

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:20.040
really the identity of the
kid that matters a lot.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:28.750
So let me show you one last
thing, which is these results

01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:32.330
seem to show, relatively
clearly, that the family is

01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:33.470
not unitary.

01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:37.880
So who brings in the
resources matters.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.310
They actually do not show that
women are better people than

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:41.940
men, because we don't
know what men do.

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:44.920
Maybe they spend more on the
education of the children.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.756
I only showed you
a very partial

01:15:46.756 --> 01:15:49.330
window into the family.

01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:51.940
So the only conclusion we can
take from this is that

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:53.470
families are not unitary.

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:55.220
So the next question we
might want to ask

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:56.950
is, are they efficient?

01:15:56.950 --> 01:16:01.170
In that, they are bargaining
with each other, but are they

01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:03.790
bargaining in a way that they
are first maximizing the size

01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:07.650
of the pie and then deciding
to split the pie?

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:11.640
Or are they bargaining in a way
that the women would be

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.230
willing to reduce the pie as
long as she could get a higher

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:16.110
share of it?

01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:18.230
You understand the difference?

01:16:18.230 --> 01:16:20.950
So two people who would just
meet and who don't know each

01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:23.860
other, will tend to interact
with each other like in the

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.020
prisoner's dilemma, that you
might have seen in game

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:29.420
theory, which is they will try
to grab as much of the pie as

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:32.730
they can, even if it makes
the pie lower.

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:36.350
But two people who know each
other very well, who are in it

01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:38.850
for the longer run, might decide
that cooperating to

01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:42.020
make the size of the pie the
biggest possible is the first

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:45.590
thing they should do and then
think about how to share it.

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:48.870
And this is actually an idea
we can test, because

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:51.490
households are engaged not only
in consumption but also

01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:53.710
in production.

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:58.100
So if the direct analogy is to
first maximize the size of the

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:02.880
pie and then decide how you're
going divide it, are they

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:06.530
maximizing the production
that they can have.

01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:10.250
And one way to look at that is
farming, because in a lot of

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:14.570
countries women and men grow
different plots of land.

01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:19.010
So in Burkina Faso, the study,
by Chris Udry, looking at

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:22.600
households in which each member
is farming their own

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.490
little plot.

01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:28.650
And an efficient household
should first use the inputs

01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:32.390
the most efficiently possible
and then decide on the basis

01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:36.120
of people's bargaining power
how to share the product.

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:42.450
Once we condition for the
quality of the plot and the

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:45.150
crop planted, we shouldn't see
that the women get fewer

01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:50.400
fertilizer or less labor or
less input or less seeds.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:55.330
And in fact, instead this paper
tested it and found that

01:17:55.330 --> 01:17:59.380
women get significantly less
of every input, including

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:00.540
fertilizer.

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:03.190
And fertilizer has very
concave returns.

01:18:03.190 --> 01:18:06.200
So there is really no point of
putting more fertilizer on a

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.600
field of the men, when you could
put a little bit on the

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.520
field of a woman, from the
point of view of family

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.540
production.

01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:14.870
And that's not what you see.

01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:17.620
You see all of the fertilizer
being spent on the men's field

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.570
and very little on the
women's fields.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:23.520
Which suggests that the family
is not efficient, because they

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.610
could become richer by just
reallocating resources among

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:27.890
themselves.

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:30.650
So this suggests that the
family is not only not

01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:37.410
unitary, but it is also
not fully efficient.

01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:39.850
Which leads us to this question,
what role does the

01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:41.460
family play?

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.750
What is the family
inefficient?

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:46.550
And what implications does have
to policy, which we'll

01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:50.630
take up after you become all
refreshed from the vacation.
