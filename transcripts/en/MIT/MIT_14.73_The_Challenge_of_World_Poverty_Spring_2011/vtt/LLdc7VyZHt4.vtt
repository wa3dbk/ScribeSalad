00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.640
PROFESSOR: So as you might have
noticed, much of for this

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.090
class, and much of our work, in
a sense, is about designing

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.750
good policies, given the
particular challenge and

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.080
environment--

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.150
the policies functioning
in it.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.890
So that's a lot of what we do.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.890
If you look at a lot of how
policies are made in the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.260
world, it has less to do with
the problem then to do with

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.250
other priorities.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.810
So the example we give
in the book is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.420
emphasized here, is Egypt.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:21.520
Egypt became a major recipient
of US aid in 1979, when Egypt

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.380
essentially broke ranks with the
Arab countries, and signed

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.120
the Camp David accord
with Israel.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.780
And the Camp David accord was
not quite a declaration of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.630
friendship, but it was enough
of a change in the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:52.770
relationship that Egypt was then
on seen as a major ally

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.190
for US/Israeli interest
in the Middle East.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.910
So it was a very substantial
political change.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.650
As a reward, in a sense, for
agreeing to that, Egypt was

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.430
offered a lot of
aid every year.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.330
So Egypt the biggest recipient,
other than Israel,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.830
of US aid over this period.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.290
And that was not based on the
idea that either that Egypt

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.140
was a country that was
particularly poor--

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.450
Egypt is one of the richest
countries in Africa--

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.360
or on the idea that Egypt
was going to do a lot of

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.180
good with the money.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.535
There's no such presumption, no
such idea was ever mutated.

00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:46.840
It was very clear that the money
in Egypt was supposed to

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.800
be a payoff for being
friendly--

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.770
a payoff not necessarily to the
President, but a payoff to

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.520
maybe, to some extent,
to the military

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.770
establishment in Egypt.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.740
So a payoff nonetheless.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.520
So it was very much
seen as a payoff.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.530
So as a result, when
basically, if

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.140
you take the amount--

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.610
enough aid was given to Egypt
every year to pay $20 per

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.025
African child under five.

00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:24.380
So just to get a magnitude
of that--

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.130
Egypt is one of the richest
countries in Africa.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.740
The aid given to Egypt was so
large that if it was given to

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.110
the rest of Africa,
it would be $5 for

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.546
every child under five.

00:03:37.546 --> 00:03:40.160
So that's a significant
amount of money.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.580
It was not given based on the
idea that Egypt was going to

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.610
make very good use
of this money.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.735
And it was not really
development aid.

00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:54.730
It was just aid as a price
for being our friends.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.340
And that's an important
example, because it

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.690
underscores the point that even
though we may work very

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.790
hard, and come up with policies
that make sense,

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.650
often money is spent for reasons
which have nothing to

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.670
do with sense--

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.124
or may have sense, but sense
in some other calculus.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.660
And that's related to a separate
point, which is-- so

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.880
one point that comes up in that
process is that, what's

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.510
the point of knowing anything
if money will not be given

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.470
where the information is?

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.520
So the information says that you
should do this policy, but

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.980
in fact, Egypt gets all the
money because it happens to be

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.830
the country that's willing
to be nice to Israel.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.950
So that's one question.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.620
Related question is some
countries just don't have a

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.130
functioning state.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.370
Right now, prominent example
is Cote d'Ivoire.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.710
Cote d'Ivoire, if you noticed,
has an ongoing civil war where

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.470
the president is supposed to
have lost the election, but

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.040
doesn't seem to want to leave.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.680
And there's a French army in
there, which may or may not

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.470
succeed in re-establishing
order, et cetera.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.830
So at this point, we might
discover a very efficient way

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.630
to find people will get people
to immunize their children,

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.450
but that might be beside the
point in Cote d'Ivoire.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.930
It's true that in Cote d'Ivoire
right now, there is

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.850
no state, and therefore, if you
think of a policy that's

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.540
going to be adopted by the
state, who's going to do the

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.940
state that adopts that?

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.710
So a lot of people have
made that point

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.560
against us, if you like.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.466
And I think the most articulate
version of that is

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:19.110
this paragraph by Bill
Easterly, who says,

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.990
"Randomized controlled trials
are infeasible for many of the

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.550
big questions in development,
like the economic-wide effects

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.270
of good institutions or good
macroeconomic policies.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.370
Embracing randomized control
trials has led development

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:42.430
researchers to lower their
ambitions." So basically, the

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.290
big issues are not being
touched here.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.080
What we are doing is
we're solving--

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.770
it's a small problem, and the
implied argument is that if

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.540
you don't solve the big
problems, there's no reason to

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.060
salve the small ones, that we
should start by solving the

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.680
big problems of state
formation, of good

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.230
macroeconomic policies,
getting an effective

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.732
functioning state, and then
solve the other problems.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.310
So there's a lot of people who
are, I think, are very fine

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.590
economists who believe in this
position, which is what I

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.470
would call the institutionalist
view.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:34.380
And really two separate,
possibly independent claims.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.370
One is that without good
politics, you cannot have good

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:43.580
policies; and the second is that
with good politics, good

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.540
policies will follow.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.560
So their claims in two
directions, right?

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.240
One is a positive claim, the
other's a negative claim.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.700
That is, it's hopeless to
try to do anything if

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.870
you have bad politics.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:05.640
And you here, what people really
mean by politics is not

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.070
just that you should have a good
leader or something, but

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:14.930
you need a whole package of
what people think of as

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.340
appropriate institutions.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.810
So the basic vision is that the
appropriate institutions--

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:29.020
and the things like
property rights.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.990
Basically, is it private
property or not?

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.400
Is private property
well secured?

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.000
That's one thing people
focus on.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.320
The second thing people focus
on is whether the political

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.230
system is relatively open.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.740
There's some constraints on
the executive, or whether

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.990
there is basically absolutism,
so the guy who's running in

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.420
power can do whatever
he wants.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.270
So those are the kinds
of things.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.830
So I'm going to keep using
institutions with

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.240
capitals for awhile.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.380
And you'll see why later.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.150
So I'm going to use it in
capital for the time being.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.660
So let me say what I'm
trying to get at.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.610
These are not only
institutions--

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.810
MIT is an institution, too--
but it's not institution in

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.200
the same sense as property
rights is an institution.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.110
I'm sure, it might be as
[? venerable ?], respected

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:37.460
institution, but it would not
count in the same sense as

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.600
institutions in this sense.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.890
This is institutions meaning
these big things that define

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.090
how the economic and political
system jointly functions.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:55.120
There are institutional, few
kind of structural features of

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.240
the economy, which drive
everything else.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.160
And those are things like
property rights, political

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.630
system, et cetera.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.900
So I think one interesting place
to start is to look at

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:12.260
the work of Acemoglu, Johnson,
and Robinson.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.920
Acemoglu and Johnson are
both MIT professors.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.510
This is a really interesting
book.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.650
And what I'm going to try to--

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.570
what they claim in their book
is that countries succeed or

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:40.450
fail based on institutions as
defined by property rights--

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.570
few things like the nature of
property rights, the nature of

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.600
the political system,
et cetera.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.410
And what they have done, I
think, very compellingly is

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:57.240
provide some very interesting
evidence along these lines.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.470
So I'm going to start by
presenting the evidence.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:05.770
And then, we'll think about
what, given that evidence, how

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.600
should we think about
the world?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.620
Now the first reason why this
evidence is difficult is

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.180
because institutions
are androgynous.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.040
What do I mean when I say
institutions are androngynous?

00:11:20.356 --> 00:11:21.606
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:30.562
wanted a place that's very
distractive, or had a very

00:11:30.562 --> 00:11:32.020
[INAUDIBLE] infrastructure.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.480
It would tend to stay the
[INAUDIBLE] of time.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.646
PROFESSOR: So you're saying that
it's the opposite, saying

00:11:36.646 --> 00:11:41.845
that institutions are not
affected by local conditions.

00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:44.090
AUDIENCE: Well, they're
initially [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.040
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.252
AUDIENCE: They are initially
[INAUDIBLE] by something.

00:11:47.252 --> 00:11:49.485
But once they're in place.

00:11:49.485 --> 00:11:50.916
PROFESSOR: They're formed
by something.

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:53.331
That's the key.

00:11:53.331 --> 00:11:54.581
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:56.712 --> 00:11:58.644
instituations was created
by [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:05.619 --> 00:12:06.996
PROFESSOR: Do you want
to add to that?

00:12:06.996 --> 00:12:07.455
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:11.490
I wanted to say that the state
of the society [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.789
determines which institutions
it [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:15.789 --> 00:12:19.268
But at the same time, the
institutions contribute to

00:12:19.268 --> 00:12:20.262
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:20.262 --> 00:12:21.760
the state of the society.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.133
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:28.020
So you might say that, for
example, to have effective

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.830
property rights, we need
effective courts.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.150
To have effective courts, we
need effective judges.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.210
To have effective judges,
we need an

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.050
effective education system.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:44.050
To have an effective education
system, we might need good

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.280
properties.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.715
So all of these things
are related.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.090
The investment in the education
system may not be

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.780
effective without property
rights, so all of these things

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.550
are related.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:03.530
So basically, institutions are
androgynous in the sense that

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.180
lots of things that matter for
other aspects of the economy

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.000
also affect institutions.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.230
Institutions are a result of
what else is happening in the

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.240
economy they also cause.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.510
So that's what makes
it difficult.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.750
So how do you study
the effects?

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.200
Problem with things that are
androgynous is that, how do

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.010
you study the effects
of those?

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:32.210
Because in some sense, the basic
rule of us studying the

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.920
effect of something is what we
want to do is we want to say,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.260
here's two countries.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.010
One country has better
institutions than the other

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.280
entirely by chance, not because
this country has some

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.290
other aspect that makes
it better, right?

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.830
The problem is, we're worried
that if I say that Spain has

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:58.380
better institutions than
Portugal, then I would need to

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.420
argue that this is not a result
of the fact that Spain

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.220
was, to start with, a stronger
economy, and that's why the

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.550
institutions came out.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.920
We want to say there are two
countries essentially

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.860
identical, and by an act of
chance, Portugal got worse

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.490
institutions than Spain.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.940
And those acts of chance
are difficult to find.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.400
That's basically
the challenge.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.810
So how does anybody solve
this problem?

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.955
Well, here's a very
nice insight.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.740
The very nice insight is that
in former colonies--

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.850
so take the counties that
were European colonies.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.900
It's a lot of countries--

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.290
pretty much all of Africa, and
most of Asia, and most of

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.810
Latin America.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:55.730
All of Latin America, most of
Asia, and most of Africa were

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:01.890
former colonies of either
Britain, France, Holland,

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:07.840
Portugal, Spain, or Belgium.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:15.390
So essentially, these six
countries were between them--

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.660
Germany to a very
small extent--

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.470
had most of the world
carved up.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:27.800
So most countries were colonies
of these countries.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.880
And it turns out, not
surprisingly--

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.340
it's what was said a
little while ago--

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.030
institutions are persistent.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.290
So if the institutions were good
institutions were set up

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.480
in this country a long time
ago, they still remain

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.110
relatively good.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.200
And if bad institutions
were set up-- so

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.180
good and bad here--

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.980
I'm not telling you what would
good and bad are, yet I'll

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.110
tell you what they
mean in a minute.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.770
But the basic theory is that
whatever institution was set

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.910
up a long time ago, that's
how they stay.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.250
So institutions are
persistent.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.700
That's step one.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:11.920
Step two is to observe that when
Europeans settled in a

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.220
country, they were very clear
about what kinds of

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.900
institutions that wanted to set
up, and that has a lot to

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.540
do with whether they want to
live in the country or not.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.930
If they didn't want to
live in the country--

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.800
so they just wanted to go there,
control the country,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.210
and make some money from it,
then this institution they set

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:38.210
up enabled making money quickly
in the country.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.000
So they were not very protective
of the local

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.130
population.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.980
They were what are extractive
institutions--

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.580
institutions which basically
take the shape of--

00:16:49.580 --> 00:17:00.920
it's easy to kind of bully
people, not a lot of legal

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.130
protection, so that you could
extract whatever you wanted.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.000
You want the mines to
be very profitable.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.530
You don't really want legal
rights for the workers,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.829
because if you have legal rights
for the workers, then

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:15.329
they will complain, and then
you wouldn't get very

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:16.410
profitable mines.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.280
So if you want mines to be
profitable, the best way to do

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.490
it is to not have very many
legal rights for workers.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.410
If you want labor to be cheap,
you don't want to educate the

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.150
labor force.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:36.620
If you want people to be docile,
you don't want to have

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.870
a lot of democracy.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.190
On the other hand, if Europeans
were going to stay

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.340
there, then the vision for the
country was very different.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.500
They wanted it to be livable,
and kind of like

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.070
their lives in Europe.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.350
And then the set of
institutions, which were much

00:17:54.350 --> 00:18:00.600
less directly extractive.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.090
And that happens to be
true, sadly enough.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.570
So what are countries where
Europeans did settle?

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:11.000
And what are countries where
they didn't settle?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.716
Examples.

00:18:13.716 --> 00:18:19.205
AUDIENCE: The United States,
Australia, Canada, Argentina,

00:18:19.205 --> 00:18:20.455
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.700
PROFESSOR: Those are
good examples.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.600
What are countries where
they didn't settle?

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.320
And you can start to see what
the pattern is going to be.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.440
What are countries where
they didn't settle?

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.095
Yeah?

00:18:36.095 --> 00:18:37.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.136
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:18:39.136 --> 00:18:41.626
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:18:41.626 --> 00:18:43.120
Well, [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:49.594 --> 00:18:51.586
PROFESSOR: Where did Africa
get their [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.360
South Africa.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.174
To some extent, Zimbabwe.

00:19:00.174 --> 00:19:02.270
To some extent, Kenya.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.390
Those were three countries where
they settled, and most

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.970
other countries, they
didn't settle.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.980
Now one reason--

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.000
so here's what's nice
about the paper.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.650
They claim that one reason this
happened was because of

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.050
settler mortality.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:38.040
So if you look at these early
colonies in the first years of

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.030
settlement, there are massive
mortality rates.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.620
Really massive, like four out
of five people died within

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.650
five years.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.500
That kind of mortality rates.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.370
Because Europeans were
encountering new diseases,

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:50.930
basically--

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.250
new tropical diseases of all
kinds-- so the mortality rates

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.930
were massive.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.500
And so therefore, the places
where they did agreed to

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:11.960
settle were places where the
mortality rates were

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.020
relatively low.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:31.650
And so one good predictor of
what happens whether you get

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.740
one good predictor, or whether
you get a European settlement

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:40.110
or not, is settler mortality
in the early days.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:44.860
And so, what they did, which is
very creative, is to find a

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.050
data set of settler mortality
in these places.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.400
So basically, the idea is, let's
look at what happens.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.230
Let's compare places where the
settlers died in droves with

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.480
places where they didn't.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.540
So here's a set of pictures
that underpin their paper.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.230
So let's start with
the first one.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:29.740
This is the picture of GDP per
capita on expropriation risk.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.300
Expropriation risk is how
secure are property.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.950
So expropriation is the opposite
of property rights.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:41.600
So expropriation risk is just
how likely is it that if you

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.300
have a private property,
it will just be

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.120
taken away by the state.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:54.900
And you see that countries
where it varies a lot is

00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:03.490
Haiti, in Mali, in
Niger, Nigeria.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:07.710
It's low in the US, Singapore,
Australia, New Zealand.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:19.870
So if you look at the colonies
that do well, they tend to be

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.976
relatively--

00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:26.140
the richer colonies are also
the ones which had lower

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.970
expropriation risks.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.530
Now this is androgynous
regression, because you could

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.800
have almost shown
this regressions

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.820
the other way around.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.340
You could have asked, is it the
case that rich countries

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.400
have lower expropriation
risks?

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.730
This is not a regression that
can be causally interpreted by

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:47.660
itself, because it's exactly
saying that expropriation risk

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.210
is high in these countries.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.850
But is that because rich
countries are safer, or is it

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.320
because safe countries
are richer?

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.570
We don't know.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:06.120
Now before I come to a-- well,
actually, let me skip these

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:11.750
two pictures, come back
to them later.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.660
Here's a more maybe
revealing picture.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.620
So this picture says, what's
the relationship between

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.080
settler mortality and
GDP per capita?

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.380
Now this is kind of a dramatic
fact, which is that if settler

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:35.100
mortality was high, like in
the Gambia, GMB, Nigeria,

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.785
Mali, Togo--

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:41.400
those countries are poor.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.590
Countries which are rich
tended to have

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:50.480
had low settler mortality.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.660
So if we think that settler
mortality has nothing to do

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.370
with GDP today, then that's
a surprising fact.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.640
Why was it that settlers, when
they came to settle-- when did

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.535
they come to settle
in the Americas?

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.470
When were the Americas
settled?

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.990
16th and 17th century.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.500
When was Africa settled?

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.880
19th century.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.540
So these are all
the long time.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.370
When was Asia settled?

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.230
When was Asia conquered?

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.370
18th and 19th, mostly.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.750
Everything that we are talking
about is saying that, what

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:50.770
happened before 1850 or 1880,
basically, has a strong

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.260
consequence on outcomes today.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.670
So if were in a country where
Europeans died in droves in

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:03.490
1870, like in Gambia or--

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.800
I don't know, whenever
that was, 1860--

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.290
people died in droves in 1860.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.850
Then Gambia is still
a poorer country.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:15.220
So that's sort of an interesting
correlation.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.090
And here's why they think--

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.050
then ask the question, now that
I told you that Gambia is

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:30.330
poorer than the US, and even
120 years ago I could have

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.712
predicted this, you say why?

00:25:33.712 --> 00:25:35.110
Why would that be the case?

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.680
How could you?

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.720
What's the link between
120 years and now?

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.310
And their claim is that this
is the persistence of

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.030
institutions.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.860
So Gambia is a place where
Europeans didn't settle.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.495
And as a result, they set up
extractive institutions, and

00:25:48.495 --> 00:25:52.130
extractive institutions
are very persistent.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:56.480
So the reason why we see this
mapping from settler mortality

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:04.800
to expropriation risk to GDP is
the reason why we have the

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.070
persistence.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:11.350
Settler mortality affected
institutions when the country

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:16.210
was set up, which affected
institutions now.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.820
And it's very dramatic again.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:23.045
The quality of institutions
goes down very fast with

00:26:23.045 --> 00:26:24.295
settler mortality.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.045
So that's the basic argument.

00:26:29.045 --> 00:26:32.580
The basic argument in the paper
is these two facts,

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.190
which is that, look, countries
with a high settler mortality

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:42.980
are poorer, and they have
poorer institutions.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.310
And there's no reason why
something that happened so

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:52.570
long ago would affect outcomes
today, and therefore it must

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:53.820
be institutions.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.840
Now, they do something else
that's actually very

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.100
interesting.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.960
In fact, they do
more than this.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:12.040
One thing they do is to argue
that in the world of like,

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:20.650
let's say, 1500 or 1600, we
don't know GDP in 1600.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:24.420
So what they are going to try
to argue is not just that we

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:29.820
see this pattern, but that this
pattern doesn't reflect

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.520
fixed geographical
characteristics of these

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.620
countries, because if you
have fixed geographical

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.130
characteristics of these
countries, then the countries

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:45.950
where you had low settler
mortality would have been

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:56.080
countries which were richer
already in 1500.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.650
So one thing they wanted to show
is that this is not the

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.750
effect of some long-term,
historical difference.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:05.890
It is not that the countries
that have low settler

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.180
mortality were rich
countries already.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.350
So the US, which had low
settler mortality, was

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.030
actually a poor country
in 1500.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.120
How do they show that?

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.720
Well, they can't actually
measure GDP in 1500 very well.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.400
But one thing they can do is
they can use urbanization

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.450
rates, or population density.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.255
Historically, richer countries
had more population.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.310
So let's start with this.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.190
Start with this picture.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:46.620
This picture says that you look
urbanization and GDP per

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:55.380
capita, these are extremely
correlated, right?

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.370
Extremely, tightly correlated.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:01.080
So then they're making the
point that therefore

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:06.360
urbanization rates in 1500
are a reasonable

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.696
proxy for GBP in 1500.

00:29:09.696 --> 00:29:12.030
OK, that's the second step
in the argument.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:26.880
So this picture says
organization rates in 1500--

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.290
if you assume that's a predictor
of GDP in 1500, then

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.860
look at that relationship.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.110
What does that say?

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.620
Yeah?

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.330
PROFESSOR: The richer the
country was in 1500, the

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.330
poorer it is now.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.830
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.330
I'm not sure I understand
the niche.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.830
Wouldn't initial population
density play a huge role?

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:13.830
So maybe the populated areas
were kind of [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:17.830
the temperate zones that were
colonized later, and then

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.330
settlers set up their
own settlements.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:23.330
And any one of those [INAUDIBLE]
talked how not

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.330
having a population in the first
place was one of the

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.830
reasons they settled
there, as well.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.330
And also, if you're looking at
urbanization rates, shouldn't

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:34.406
you care the tropical colonies,
before they were

00:30:34.406 --> 00:30:38.334
organized to European countries
that did the

00:30:38.334 --> 00:30:41.034
colonization, and you see higher
organization rates in

00:30:41.034 --> 00:30:44.717
the temperate zones that
have a [? purple ?]

00:30:44.717 --> 00:30:46.190
population densities.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.470
PROFESSOR: OK, those are
both good points.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.408
Hold them.

00:30:48.408 --> 00:30:49.815
We'll come back to them, OK?

00:30:49.815 --> 00:30:54.360
You're asking questions on
whether this argument is--

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.330
you're trying to pick holes
in this argument.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.130
Let's wait on that.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.775
I want to understand the
argument before picking holes

00:30:59.775 --> 00:31:00.710
in it

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:05.480
So I think both points you
made are interesting.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.160
But hold them.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.570
We will repeat them
in a minute, OK?

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.480
So right now, they're
making the case---

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.850
look, it's not that there's
a persistence of poverty.

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:19.510
It is not the case that the
countries that were poor in

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.520
1500 are poor now.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:27.900
If urbanization is a good
measure poverty, of being

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.050
wealthy, then those countries
were rich countries then, and

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.300
are poor countries now.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.300
And the US, for example, was a
poor country then, and a rich

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.710
country now.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:42.240
Indeed, famously, there's a
claim that the reason why the

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:47.780
British didn't manage to take
back the US in 1776.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:53.320
The US was very weak, relative
to Britain in 1776.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.620
How did the US colonies
manage?

00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:00.570
Well, there was a threat of
another attack to, I think, to

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:04.260
Jamaica, which was a much
wealthier area--

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.650
sugar-growing, much
wealthier area.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:10.290
So that's why the British
government had to decide

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.620
whether to protect Jamaica,
or to predict the US.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.850
And it decided that Jamaica
was more worth than

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.330
protecting the US.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.610
May have not been the right
judgement historically.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:26.550
But nonetheless, so they made
this call on it, based

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.440
apparently on the fact that
Jamaica was a wealthier area.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.510
This is another one.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:37.160
This is a [INAUDIBLE] population
density, which is

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.810
another classical measure
of wealth.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:44.615
So typically, historically, more
populated countries have

00:32:44.615 --> 00:32:46.940
been richer countries.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:57.910
Indeed, historically, people
have suggested a very simple

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:01.130
model, which is sometimes called
the Malthusian model,

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.650
which is that if countries are
more productive, they can

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:08.800
sustain a bigger population,
because if you're not more

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.140
productive, then you have
a bigger population,

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.780
you starve to death.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.790
So basically, the Malthusian
model says that more

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.650
productive countries had
bigger populations.

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:22.570
And you see that if you believe
that, then once again,

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.830
richer countries in 1500 are
poorer countries now.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:38.300
Finally, population density
in 1500, you can see, is a

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.550
negative predictor of
expropriation risks now.

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:49.670
So more dense countries in 1500
was protected against

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:52.230
risk expropriation.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.292
So they had less property
rights.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:02.200
And what this is saying is that
you look at the economic

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.360
outcomes of the higher
urbanization countries and the

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:13.860
lower urbanization countries in
1500, you can see that the

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:18.010
higher urbanization countries
actually fall below the lower

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:25.100
urbanization countries in the
middle of the 19th century.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.350
This is GDP.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.530
So they call this the
reversal of fortune.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.480
So two claims being made.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.830
One is that rich countries
became poorer, and the reason

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:41.290
why they became for poorer is
because of the paternal

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.449
settlement, which generated
better institutions, which

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.694
generated better economic
outcomes.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.190
Then they go on to claim that
if Zaire had the same

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.650
institutions as the US today,
it'd be five times richer.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:11.830
So that's a huge claim, right?

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:12.550
It's huge.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.704
The magnitudes they're talking
about are immense.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.670
So now coming back
to the question.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.980
You were trying to start asking

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.680
questions about this evidence.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.490
What are possible ways in which
this evidence might be

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:31.740
misleading?

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.938
So let's go back to you.

00:35:36.938 --> 00:35:41.750
AUDIENCE: One was that I
thought maybe they're

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:47.020
dismissing the geography
explanation if you compare

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:51.430
tropical countries before they
were colonized to European

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.860
countries before they actually
colonized the other countries,

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.780
because it might be in North
America and New Zealand and

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.430
Australia, they had better
institutions, didn't really

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:05.240
have populations settled there
in the first place.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.720
It's probably one of the
reasons that European

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.210
colonizers set up camp there.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.915
PROFESSOR: So you're saying
empty may be different.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.280
The development patterns may be
different for a variety of

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.970
reasons, which may not have
to do with institutions.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.360
It may well be that if you start
with an empty place, you

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.630
can have a different development
pattern, even if

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.390
you have the same
institutions.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.170
That sort.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.010
One of the things.

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:36.680
Is that you're saying?

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:42.692
AUDIENCE: Kind of, but also
that if you're trying to

00:36:42.692 --> 00:36:47.272
totally dismiss that the fact
that climate may have played a

00:36:47.272 --> 00:36:50.930
role, you shouldn't compare
places with similar population

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:53.085
densities to start off with.

00:36:53.085 --> 00:36:55.460
So you should compare
Europe to--

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.033
PROFESSOR: Why would
that make sense?

00:36:59.033 --> 00:36:59.526
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:59.526 --> 00:37:07.907
AUDIENCE: Because in comparing
Latin America and Saharan

00:37:07.907 --> 00:37:12.097
Africa, one of the papers talked
about how there already

00:37:12.097 --> 00:37:15.302
were rich cultures thriving
there, and that it was a

00:37:15.302 --> 00:37:16.288
reversal of fortune.

00:37:16.288 --> 00:37:21.464
But if you're comparing those
places to, say, North America

00:37:21.464 --> 00:37:24.176
and New Zealand, the population
of North America

00:37:24.176 --> 00:37:26.148
and New Zealand were small.

00:37:26.148 --> 00:37:27.627
There wasn't a lot going on.

00:37:27.627 --> 00:37:29.550
So maybe you should compare
it to Europe.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.166
I think Europe would have been
a lot more prosperous if you

00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:35.630
compare it to the
Incas, Aztecs.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.950
PROFESSOR: I see.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:50.420
You're saying that maybe
comparing with the empty place

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.595
is misleading, because
those places are--

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.510
but still, isn't the point
that this is misleading

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:04.640
because empty places, for some
reason, would have a different

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.960
development path.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.160
After all, the empty places
across the [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:11.940
become better.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.580
So you're saying that even
without good institutions,

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:20.890
empty places might have had a
different path, because maybe

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:26.820
it is the case that just
the population

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.320
composition is different.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.220
If there's no one else living
there, and I go and settle,

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:36.415
I'm 100% of the population,
whereas if there's a lot of

00:38:36.415 --> 00:38:41.250
people living there, then if I
go settle, I'm a different

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:43.730
fraction of the population.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.230
OK, you were-- yes?

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:50.200
AUDIENCE: Do you think the
countries that actually

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.550
colonized--

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.641
the ones who actually
go and settle--

00:38:55.641 --> 00:38:58.167
do you think [? depending ?] on
the country, does that make

00:38:58.167 --> 00:39:01.790
a difference on how well
the colony does?

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:06.830
For example, all the colonies
that ended up doing well were

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.240
British colonies.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.950
And of course, you have
India, which--

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.060
PROFESSOR: There's a lot
of British colonies

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.080
that didn't do well.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:27.810
Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda,
Sierra Leone.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.620
Lots of British colonies.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:29.945
Burma.

00:39:29.945 --> 00:39:32.720
AUDIENCE: Right, but most of the
other ones, those happened

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.370
at different times, right?

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.035
Like many of the--

00:39:39.236 --> 00:39:42.080
a lot of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.450
happened later on,
and the love of

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:45.440
exploration happened in Africa.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.320
Of course, there was already
traffic in terms of slavery

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.500
and things like that.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.660
I'm thinking into 1600 or so.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:59.070
But a lot of the colonies that
have been in Africa were in a

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.110
different time.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.150
[INAUDIBLE] history spectrum.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:08.240
So I just think that the big
market was just different.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:13.210
The world was very different
at the time.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.256
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but I
don't see why that's

00:40:16.256 --> 00:40:19.480
another good point.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.065
I agree with everything
you said--

00:40:21.065 --> 00:40:22.315
whoops.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:32.590
You want to add to that?

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.080
I don't understand exactly why
that's a criticism what

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:35.470
they're doing.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.780
I understood if you said--

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.266
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:37.266 --> 00:40:39.453
I was just asking a question
actually, because that's just

00:40:39.453 --> 00:40:42.470
something that comes
up when I--

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:44.370
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
absolutely true.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:45.830
I think everything
you said is true.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:47.080
But I don't see why.

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:53.665
So they were definitely
colonized in different times,

00:40:53.665 --> 00:40:56.970
but still, two things they do.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:00.940
One is the compare
within Africa.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.220
They can compare
within Africa.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.050
It's not quite statistically
as solid as it should be.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.600
But you can still do it.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:14.600
You can compare Zimbabwe, South
Africa, Kenya with the

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.290
rest of Africa-- the countries
that have high settlement and

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.810
low settlement, and you see some
of the same difference.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.480
Mostly different by South
Africa, unfortunately, which

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.810
is rather special.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:29.060
But the second thing you can do
is you can control for the

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.790
identity of the colonizer, and
that doesn't change anything.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:35.150
So you can compare only British
colonies with British

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:41.590
colonies, and that doesn't
change anything.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:44.770
That's much more solid.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:48.125
So you could compare just French
colonies with French

00:41:48.125 --> 00:41:49.460
colonies, and British colonies
with British

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.240
colonies, and average.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.180
AUDIENCE: So even
within Africa--

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.020
PROFESSOR: I don't know whether
you can do that

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.310
[INAUDIBLE] that becomes
two small a data set.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:02.380
So if you compare only Spanish
colonies within Africa, there

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.810
will be two.

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.430
And that's not going
to be a lot.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:08.140
AUDIENCE: I'm not saying
within Africa.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:12.090
Would you say that British
colonies are probably better

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.820
off then, let's say, Portuguese
colonies where you

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.210
have Angola and [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.570
PROFESSOR: It's probably
true, actually.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.076
AUDIENCE: Whereas you compare
that to South Africa, South

00:42:20.076 --> 00:42:21.430
Africa's much better off.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:22.550
PROFESSOR: It's probably true.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.635
But that's not what they do.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.650
They're worried about--

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:33.270
that comparison is difficult,
because British colonies are

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.600
not randomly chosen.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.830
Britain was one of
the leaders.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:39.090
In African colonization,
Britain

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.200
was one of the leaders.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.080
Britain got all of the most
productive countries.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.136
So if you look at--

00:42:47.136 --> 00:42:47.582
sorry?

00:42:47.582 --> 00:42:49.020
AUDIENCE: What about France?

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.780
PROFESSOR: France
was a follower.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:55.420
And so, France ended up with the
less productive countries.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.260
So Britain targeted some
countries, and then grabbed

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.590
the best ones.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:04.020
So this is not an accident.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.270
Yeah?

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:11.265
AUDIENCE: So to follow on the
earlier point that emptier

00:43:11.265 --> 00:43:14.223
places versus more heavily
populated places that

00:43:14.223 --> 00:43:16.195
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:16.195 --> 00:43:19.892
if a place is more populated,
then it already has some kind

00:43:19.892 --> 00:43:20.632
of institutions.

00:43:20.632 --> 00:43:23.590
And if some institutions already
exist, whether they're

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:27.041
equitable or not equitable, I
think it would be much easier

00:43:27.041 --> 00:43:31.971
to establish institutions
would not be equitable,

00:43:31.971 --> 00:43:35.160
because the system is
already set up.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.140
PROFESSOR: That's a point,
but that they won't

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.390
disagree with, obviously.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.320
Imagine that they said that
places which have no one

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.670
there, or very low population
density in the beginning, it

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.090
was easier to set up fresh
institutions, and fresh

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.400
institutions persists.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.600
Would you say that's not
a version of the

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.440
institutionalist argument?

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.800
That's just a slight variant
of their argument.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.460
I don't think it's
that different.

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.420
AUDIENCE: Well, I don't think
that if it's an empty place,

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.830
then the probability that you
could settle and then

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:13.260
procreating an institution
would be lower.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.780
PROFESSOR: That's
absolutely true.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.750
I think they would say that
that's still an argument for

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.380
expropriating institutions
are bad.

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.250
You're just making a slightly
different argument of why

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.811
expropriation institutions
are bad.

00:44:27.811 --> 00:44:32.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just getting
back to the point [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:37.036
So when you say, yeah, that's
correct, the British empire

00:44:37.036 --> 00:44:39.900
was sort of the leader of
political lines in Africa.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:43.120
However, that's not the case
when you're talking about the

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.150
Americas, right?

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.910
Right, so even though Spain and
Portugal were the leaders

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.697
in this case, it's not like
they did invite a

00:44:51.697 --> 00:44:52.860
colonization.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:58.370
And when you even referenced the
paper, if British empire

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:03.300
chose the regular countries in
Africa [INAUDIBLE], wouldn't

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.520
that imply that they would
have a [INAUDIBLE] more

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.705
aspiration-based, and therefore
maybe South Africa

00:45:10.705 --> 00:45:14.220
would be in a worse position?

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.470
Does that make sense?

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:17.640
Or does it show that--

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.220
PROFESSOR: It's not so clear.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.180
They might have chosen-- we're
getting off point.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:26.640
Let's say just to comment, the
British might have picked

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.180
better places, and better
places might be more

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:29.780
productive.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:33.020
It might also be more
attractive to be

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.940
expropriating, but those two
factors are going in opposite

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:36.460
directions.

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.480
So if you started with
better places, that

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.790
already helps you a lot.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:44.530
And maybe they knew exploit a
bit more, instead of slavery

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:45.860
or something.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.910
But still, it might well be on
balance that you do less

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.050
damage there.

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:53.660
It's not clear, because you
start with a better place,

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.040
then you do a little
more damage.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.530
I don't know which
way it goes.

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:58.780
But you're right.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.480
That's a certainly good point.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.760
Any other concerns?

00:46:09.622 --> 00:46:10.872
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:15.346
if you could just [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:15.346 --> 00:46:19.892
geographical argument, because
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:19.892 --> 00:46:21.142
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:29.830
PROFESSOR: Well, to be honest,
I think if you look the world

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.930
in 1800s, the United States
doesn't look like a more

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:34.050
valuable economy.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:38.470
It looks like a less valuable
economy, because the idea was

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.220
that places that could
grow sugar were the

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.480
most valuable places.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.860
So when you compare places to
the Americas, they typically

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.380
compare Jamaica with the US.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:53.350
And Jamaica was a place which
looked more valuable then.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:58.660
US was actually a good place to
settle, because no one was

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.860
empty, and no one wanted
to come there.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:06.120
So it was empty, and no,
not much competition.

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.190
The British were very
worried that the

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:11.136
Spanish would take Jamaica.

00:47:11.136 --> 00:47:12.040
Yeah, keep going.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.834
America [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:15.834 --> 00:47:17.770
South America [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:21.642
And North America [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:21.642 --> 00:47:25.514
I mean, it is or Asia,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:25.514 --> 00:47:27.934
but it's [INAUDIBLE] in
Africa [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:34.685
least favorable, in
terms of the land.

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.170
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:40.130
is a very poor [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:43.100
The institutions point
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:46.370
PROFESSOR: But that's the point
about the reversal of

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:49.470
fortune, in the sense that the
reversal of fortune is exactly

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:52.720
point that these were
richer places.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:48:01.640
In 1500, the places which are
poor now were rich places.

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.560
So somehow, you need to argue
that geography has a different

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.790
effect then than it does now.

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:17.730
It's not implausible, so one
point you could make is that

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.690
geography is not some
fixed thing.

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:26.250
These countries were richer
then, because this was a

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:31.650
period when it turned out that
agriculture mattered.

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:37.010
And then, they invested
a lot in agriculture.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:41.440
Turned out that by some
accident, industry became the

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:46.850
big thing later, and so places
that started later were more

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:52.090
able to jump on the industry
bandwagon than the places

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:56.320
that-- so geography that helped
you originally might

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.310
hurt you later.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:01.440
Because Jamaica specialized
in sugar.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:05.460
Sugar was great in 1800, but
not so great now, because

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.030
something better
was discovered.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.865
So maybe what happened was that
these places that were--

00:49:10.865 --> 00:49:12.290
it was not the institutions.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:16.980
It was just the specialization
in certain products that

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.900
really mattered.

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:19.760
You want to continue?

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:24.251 --> 00:49:27.245
Africa [INAUDIBLE] more
resources [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:27.245 --> 00:49:29.740
just going to pick [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.066
agricultural countries.

00:49:37.066 --> 00:49:40.770
PROFESSOR: But in some
sense, why is that--

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:41.810
find.

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:46.150
But isn't that just a version of
the institutional argument,

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:50.430
that where you want to extract
diamonds, you don't create any

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:52.480
institutions, you
just extract?

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.940
And that's exactly their point,
in a sense, is that you

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.370
create extractive
institutions.

00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:58.850
That doesn't seem any
different from--

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:04.670
seems like a variant on the
argument, that where you set

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.652
up extractive institutions,
you get bad outcomes.

00:50:07.652 --> 00:50:08.572
Yeah?

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:11.404
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:11.404 --> 00:50:13.292
So could it be the case--

00:50:13.292 --> 00:50:15.652
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:15.652 --> 00:50:18.806
because they had invested a lot
in agriculture and that

00:50:18.806 --> 00:50:20.525
was the thing back then.

00:50:20.525 --> 00:50:23.962
They were well off, and as times
changed, there became

00:50:23.962 --> 00:50:26.417
less of an emphasis that other
countries would invest

00:50:26.417 --> 00:50:27.399
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:27.399 --> 00:50:31.327
It could also be the case that
other countries, the ones in

00:50:31.327 --> 00:50:34.273
temperate environments, were
forced to look at other things

00:50:34.273 --> 00:50:36.728
early on because they knew that
agriculture wasn't there

00:50:36.728 --> 00:50:40.152
[INAUDIBLE] and that was a bet
they made not knowing how the

00:50:40.152 --> 00:50:43.784
future would be [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:43.784 --> 00:50:45.780
PROFESSOR: That's an
excellent point.

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:50.160
So it could be that just if you
have very easy access to

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.696
the very productive agriculture,
then you'd be in

00:50:52.696 --> 00:50:56.330
a society which is not looking
forward to solving certain

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.790
types of problems.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:50:59.360
So that's an excellent point.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.110
I don't know if it's true or
not, but it's an extremely

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:06.120
interesting observation,
and part of that.

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:09.850
And more generally, one concern
with this kind of

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:17.520
evidence is, that, as you
might imagine, the most

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.150
compelling examples turn out
to be Hong Kong, Singapore,

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:28.530
South Africa, plus US, Canada,
New Zealand, Australia.

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:40.870
The regression's driven by very
few countries, though I

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:45.560
think if you look at this
picture, it's less true than

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.810
you might imagine.

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:52.010
Yeah, we can do this one.

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.000
So we look at this picture.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.610
It's not entirely driven by--

00:51:55.610 --> 00:52:00.600
so if we look at that square
in the middle, even there,

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.260
there's a slight
downward slope.

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.180
So leave out US, New
Zealand, Canada,

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.540
Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia--

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.930
those are on the left--

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:16.260
and just South Africa and
whatever, one other country.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.830
I don't know what it is.

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:20.780
And look at the block in the
middle where India is the top

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:27.000
left-hand point,
and whatever--

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.320
MLI is Mali--

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.690
is the bottom right point.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.450
Even within this square,
there's clear

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:36.130
downward slope, I think.

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:41.280
So even if you left out the very
rich countries, you do

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:45.770
get a weaker but significant
relationship.

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:48.710
And that still tells you,
if you just took that

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:52.880
relationship, you still will
get a big effect of settler

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:57.870
mortality, even if you left
out the few really

00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:02.600
exceptionally rich countries,
or something.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.666
You still get reasonable
good fit.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:14.810
I guess one concern I have is
whether or not expropriation

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:17.890
risk is something that
we have assign to

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.790
countries based on success.

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:30.400
So one worry I have is that it
may well be that the countries

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.220
that have high settler
mortality are

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:35.180
poor whatever reason.

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.660
And then we think it's because
of expropriation risk, but

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:42.820
expropriation risk is just based
on our perception of

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.300
economic success.

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:51.180
So India and Pakistan saw very
different expropriation risk.

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.610
One is at eight and the
other is at six.

00:53:54.610 --> 00:53:57.030
I'm not sure that those are
based on anything in

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.530
particular.

00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:01.050
I think there might well be
a legitimation of success.

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:03.150
So countries which
are successful

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:05.320
are assigned better--

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.740
with these numbers, who knows
what expropriation risk is.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.950
It's some number somebody
made up.

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:17.570
And we may worry that this
number isn't quite right.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:20.530
And maybe all it does is it just
reflects the fact that

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:22.370
richer countries are richer.

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:28.890
So people assign them higher--

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:31.160
these countries are richer,
they must have

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.210
good property rights.

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:36.380
I don't know how much of
that's what's going on.

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:44.280
But I still think that, in some
sense, I guess I'm more

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:51.660
inclined to take this evidence
as telling us something

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.910
interesting.

00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:00.120
But I think one should take
it really seriously.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:03.570
So first point it's making-- if
you take it seriously, it's

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:07.090
not just the institutions
that are important.

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:10.140
It's not saying just that
institutions are important.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.370
It's saying something much
more specific than that.

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:15.150
It's saying that institutions
that were set up a long time

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:21.340
ago, and evolved slowly over
time in countries where there

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:24.860
was low settler mortality
are very different from

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:28.250
institutions that were set up
a long time ago, and evolved

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:31.370
for a long time in high settler
mortality countries.

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:35.590
So it's not saying that if I
suddenly took Mali, and gave

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:38.790
it the institutions of the
US, the institutions will

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:40.460
automatically start
functioning.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.460
That's not in this data.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:45.780
It's not saying anything about
whether or not we can be

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.630
replace institutions in one
place or the other, right?

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:50.175
It's in fact saying quite
the opposite.

00:55:50.175 --> 00:55:56.170
It's saying that all we can tell
is that places that good

00:55:56.170 --> 00:56:00.060
institutions because of a lucky
accident 200 years ago

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.410
or 400 years ago are
better off now.

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:08.760
That's not necessarily
a big helpful policy.

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.880
It's not that it says that we
could change institutions

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.490
today successfully.

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:15.480
That's not what it implies.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.450
It could be true that we could
change it, but that's not what

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:19.590
we learn from this evidence.

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.020
What we learn from this evidence
is if we happen to

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:25.590
have been lucky 400 years ago,
then we are lucky today.

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:30.480
But that's a very different
point from saying that we are

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:35.440
able to fix institutions today,
and if we give Mali the

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.770
same institutions the US had.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:41.840
And I'm not just making
a debating point.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.440
Think about what the US
constitution means.

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:48.600
The US constitution means a
lot of things, but it also

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:55.100
means every school who goes to
school in the US learns about

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:56.320
the constitution.

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.995
It creates a certain set of
loyalties to the constitution

00:56:58.995 --> 00:57:00.500
that are very important.

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.700
It is emphasized that this

00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:04.750
constitution has a long history.

00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:08.100
there were lots of battles about
this constitution in the

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.130
Supreme Court and
other courts.

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:13.370
All of these things are part
of the effectiveness of the

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:14.060
constitution.

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.560
It's not just the constitution
that is effective.

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:23.330
The US constitution is given
content by all the judgments

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:24.440
of the Supreme Court.

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.500
The famous judgments of the
Supreme Court is what makes

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.580
the constitution what
it is today.

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:33.570
So it's not clear that you can
just transplant a constitution

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:35.680
without the history
that goes with it.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.436
So that says that if you believe
this point of view,

00:57:40.436 --> 00:57:43.450
you should be very pessimistic,
because it's not

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:46.490
actually saying that we
just have to fake good

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:48.060
institutions.

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:49.790
This is where I think
it still is wrong.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:56.870
Even if you believe this point
of view, it doesn't say much

00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:59.370
about development policy,
because it actually doesn't

00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:02.840
tell you that you can fix
institutions today in Mali,

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:05.840
and you'll get good outcomes.

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:12.160
And as Acemoglu and Robinson are
very consistent in their

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.170
book, they basically explicitly
state this

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:17.240
pessimistic position.

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:20.520
They say, God knows how
to fix countries,

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.940
let's not even bother.

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.500
Mostly that's their the
position, and that's a very

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.480
internally consistent
position.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.040
Now there are other people who
take a less consistent

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.280
position, who want
to say that the

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.930
institution is an important.

00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:36.580
This is the evidence from
Acemoglu and Robinson, and now

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:39.410
we're going to go fix countries,
which is a very

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:43.840
different plan, that we're going
to fix institutions,

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.610
evidence doesn't say that you
can fix institutions.

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:49.800
It says if you had the right
institutions 400 years ago,

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.940
then it would be good.

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.950
That's very different from
saying we can fix

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:54.220
institutions.

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.774
You see that?

00:58:55.774 --> 00:58:56.748
Yeah?

00:58:56.748 --> 00:58:59.183
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:59.183 --> 00:59:02.105
appropriate it would be with
history, time changes going on

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:06.488
in the world, but can you kind
of take this as if we could

00:59:06.488 --> 00:59:08.923
transition towards better
institutions in some

00:59:08.923 --> 00:59:11.350
countries, then maybe in 400
years those, countries would

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:12.250
be better

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:14.640
PROFESSOR: Maybe, but
not tomorrow.

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:18.536
So I have nothing useful to say
about 400 years from now,

00:59:18.536 --> 00:59:21.440
but if we can.

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:25.000
But what it clearly doesn't say
is if a fixed institution

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.010
thing would be better today.

00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:29.566
That's it does not say.

00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:31.498
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:31.498 --> 00:59:32.947
Africa, [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:32.947 --> 00:59:34.396
nations [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:40.192 --> 00:59:43.110
can't really have institutions
[INAUDIBLE].

00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:43.370
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:48.190
So that's also true.

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:51.780
I think the point that you're
making is also important, and

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.630
we don't know how to [INAUDIBLE]
institutions.

00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:59.710
It's not that people don't
live in [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:06.980
So here's a fact that I know
isn't in [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:14.026
Whoever owns any country,
take a taxi--

01:00:14.026 --> 01:00:16.466
I'm talking about in
many countries.

01:00:16.466 --> 01:00:20.278
Get off from the taxi.

01:00:20.278 --> 01:00:24.530
You either agreed an amount when
you got on the taxi, or

01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:25.661
there's a meter.

01:00:25.661 --> 01:00:29.831
You read the meter, you give
the person the amount.

01:00:29.831 --> 01:00:38.520
And at that point, the person
takes the money.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:45.666
He shuts the meter off, and he
says, here's your change.

01:00:45.666 --> 01:00:48.080
This happens in many,
many countries.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.350
Now what's remarkable
about that?

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:54.226
What's remarkable is
why did I pay him?

01:00:54.226 --> 01:00:59.210
I could have said no.

01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:00.570
So what if it says $20?

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:01.820
I'm going to give you $5.

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:05.220
What's to stop me?

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.120
There's nobody else
was that's there.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.280
Usually when I get off in front
of a house, there's no

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.340
one else there.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.320
I can walk off.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.180
By the time the taxi
driver can find the

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:16.280
policeman, I'll be gone--

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.490
on one side.

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:21.900
So the response has to be that
I'm afraid of the taxi driver

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:26.120
beating me up, which
may be true.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.850
But if the taxi driver can
beat me up, why isn't the

01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:30.100
reverse true?

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.000
As soon as the taxi stopped, why
isn't he trying to beat me

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.110
up, and saying you have to give
me $40 instead of $20, or

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:42.130
I'll beat you up, and claim
that you owe me $40.

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:47.290
How is it that we manage to
negotiate this space in many,

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:48.540
many countries successfully?

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.840
If I'm paying the taxi driver
who's a taxi driver who beat

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.640
me up, then he should beat
me up in any case.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.580
And otherwise, if he can't beat
me up, then I shouldn't

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.010
pay him in any case.

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:09.580
So why do I pay him?

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.000
And why do these
transactions--

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.100
thousands of millions of
these transactions--

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.020
always happens?

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.980
So it must be that
even societies

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:21.310
that don't have good property
rights distribution enforced

01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:26.140
up top have figured out ways to
enforce lots of contracts

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.400
on the ground.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.950
That has to be true.

01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:34.130
That a lot of what we call
property rights must live in

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:37.120
other forms than the form
that we think of as

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:37.930
the official form.

01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:39.269
Yeah, you had a comment?

01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:40.519
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:42.762 --> 01:02:46.255
if there's no policeman standing
there, you sort of

01:02:46.255 --> 01:02:48.251
assume [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:48.251 --> 01:02:50.746
there's a certain trust that
you have [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:50.746 --> 01:02:51.260
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.960
Trust, or something like
that is important.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.400
The only point I'm making
here, that's

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.530
not a property right.

01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:59.080
That's something else
that is important.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.262
So there's lots of substitutes.

01:03:00.262 --> 01:03:00.485
Yeah?

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:02.412
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:05.129
in terms of game theory, if you
play this game just one

01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:07.352
time, of course you can say
that, oh, either way

01:03:07.352 --> 01:03:07.846
you can have it.

01:03:07.846 --> 01:03:10.810
But if you think of it as
playing a game over and over,

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:11.798
you could sustain--

01:03:11.798 --> 01:03:12.950
PROFESSOR: Well, I don't
want to play with

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:15.256
the same taxi driver.

01:03:15.256 --> 01:03:18.714
Next time, I'm going to cheat
the next taxi driver.

01:03:18.714 --> 01:03:19.702
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:19.702 --> 01:03:22.666
for every taxi driver to beat
you up that one time, then all

01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:25.710
the taxi drivers are going to
start beating people up, and

01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:28.470
people will stop using taxis.

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:31.020
PROFESSOR: That's a bad outcome,
but that is the

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:34.190
outcome predicted by the game,
that there will be no taxis.

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:39.380
In fact, taxis exist because we
have trust, we have norms.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.650
We have all kinds of things
which live outside this

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:43.290
institution frame.

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:47.150
So one point that I think is
important is to think of, if

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.960
you want to transplant
institutions, you have to

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.520
realize that institutions
already

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.000
exist in these countries.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.410
Even the ones which you think
don't have institutions have

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:57.010
tons and tons of them.

01:03:57.010 --> 01:04:00.810
And you're always trying to turn
existing institutions to

01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:01.780
other institutions.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:06.320
You're not creating issues in
a void ever, anywhere, ever.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.570
So we'll pick that
up next time.
