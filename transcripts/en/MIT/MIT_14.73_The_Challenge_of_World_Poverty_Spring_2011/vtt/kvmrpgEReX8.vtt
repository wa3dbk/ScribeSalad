00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.290
PROFESSOR: So what I want
to do is continue

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.370
talking about risk.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.170
We've already talked about risk
quite a bit last time.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.910
And what I want to do partly
is sort of emphasize some

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:51.380
specific points and, I think,
partly go over some of the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.310
ideas that have to do
with a community

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.210
sharing its own risk.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.650
So rather than risk through
formal insurance markets, talk

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.080
about what happens if people
try to insure each other.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.610
And what that does is it creates
a nice context for

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.450
thinking about institutions in
general and the fact that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.930
people live together, how that
might actually change their--

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.920
I think it's the display
settings.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.900
I think we need to move to--

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.740
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.990
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.110
So how the fact that people live
together in one place and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.510
have to deal with each other on
a long run basis, how that

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.410
affects the ways in which they
can structure their economic

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.280
lives to help each other.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.770
So it gets into a question
which is beyond, I think,

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.000
moving us beyond what we'd
usually be talking about,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.380
which is individual decision
making, towards a more

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.370
collective action kind
of perspective.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.640
So we want to slowly move
towards not just what happens

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.050
at the level of the individual,
by why doesn't the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.390
collectivity together generate
good outcomes?

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.150
And this is a good in
to that question.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.500
So we're going to talk.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.060
So I'll give you a set of
examples of collective action,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.100
and we'll start talking a bit
about the collective efforts

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.580
to improve things.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.340
I'm not sure what's happening.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.920
But we'll figure this out.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:47.100
So the first, just to remind
you, we were talking about

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.680
risk and, in particular, the
fact that poor people face

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.170
extremely high levels of risk.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.320
I said that yesterday, and
today I'll show you some

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.640
numbers on that just to
get us on to that.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.950
Just to summarize where we were
last time, what we talked

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.540
about primarily were sort of
both that the poor face a lot

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.560
of risk and that they do a lot
of things to mitigate risk,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.020
but those things are not
necessarily good for them.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.690
So the examples we talked about
or, for example, going

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.960
to work when your income
goes down.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.460
But when you go to work when
your income goes down,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.290
typically that's when
everybody else's

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.400
income also went down.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.000
So they also all go to work.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.460
That drives wages down
and makes everybody

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.720
potentially worse off.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.060
And the second example--

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.000
what's another example of a
costly thing you could do to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.924
mitigate risk?

00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:56.830
Yep.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.243
AUDIENCE: Farm separate pieces
of land that are far apart

00:03:59.243 --> 00:04:00.350
from each other.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.560
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.610
Farm separate pieces of land far
apart so that they don't

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.266
have the same risk profile.

00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:07.711
AUDIENCE: You could choose not
to take a crop that might be

00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:11.623
more successful because you're
worried that if you spend

00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:14.945
money to buy new seeds and
it doesn't turn to be as

00:04:14.945 --> 00:04:17.246
successful then you loose more
money than if you just used

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:20.425
your seeds from the
previous crop.

00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:23.359
PROFESSOR: Any other?

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:25.350
AUDIENCE: Choosing a bunch of
different jobs instead of

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.440
specializing in one.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.180
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.634
Choosing a bunch of different
jobs rather than doing one.

00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:35.882
Why do you want to specialize?

00:04:35.882 --> 00:04:37.274
AUDIENCE: It allows
you to become more

00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:38.870
productive, more skilled.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.170
PROFESSOR: So you give up--

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.150
sorry?

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.600
AUDIENCE: I was just going
to say efficiency.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.580
PROFESSOR: Efficiency,
exactly.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.010
You just get better at a job
if you do it more with more

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.500
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.480
Yeah.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:55.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.375
Like, if you were doing 15
classes [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:03.283
PROFESSOR: 15 is
a high number.

00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:06.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:06.942 --> 00:05:07.340
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.040
So I think you can see
the logic of this.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.200
So the question is we already
talked a bit about kind of the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.950
market for insurance.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.010
What we didn't talk as much
about is why don't people help

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.120
each other?

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.720
One solution to this problem
is just helping each other.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.890
So the logic of helping each
other is very, very simple.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:02.070
We each get maybe independent
shocks and so it's quite

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.340
likely that, you know, when
somebody else gets a shock, I

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.360
don't and vice versa.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.700
So we can kind of
split the shock.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.960
So if anything bad happens,
we don't bear all of it.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.190
We can pass on a part of
it to somebody else.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.410
That seems straightforward.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.840
So why doesn't that solve
most problems?

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.030
That's sort of the question that
we're going to spend some

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.780
time thinking about.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.110
It's a very simple
idea, right?

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.910
We don't need to go to
an insurance company.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.990
We can just pool together
our own risk.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.467
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:54.932
like, the cost of living
[INAUDIBLE] cost?

00:06:54.932 --> 00:06:57.643
Like, how many people are
you going to pool

00:06:57.643 --> 00:06:58.876
together for that?

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:00.601
And sometimes people think that
they shouldn't have to

00:07:00.601 --> 00:07:01.350
pay for someone else's--

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.330
PROFESSOR: How many people
should we pool together?

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.550
AUDIENCE: As many as possible.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.020
PROFESSOR: Why as many
as possible?

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.370
AUDIENCE: Because then it's
more diversified.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.840
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.040
So if we think that--

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.700
so you have the example, the
probability, here, let's say

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.060
they have independent
probabilities.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.270
Two people, they have a
probability of a quarter that

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.130
they both end up with
a bad shock, right?

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.930
What's that probability if
there were n people?

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.180
AUDIENCE: 1/n squared?

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.930
PROFESSOR: N squared.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.980
Think about what were
the probability.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.070
The probability is half that--

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.230
I think you meant the other.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.570
You just inverted
the exponents.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.500
It's 1 over 2 to the power n.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.694
I think you're writing it in--

00:08:07.694 --> 00:08:09.330
it's 1 over 2 to the power n.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.770
So as n goes to infinity, the
number of people who get

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.820
shocks together is going to 0.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.510
So that's sort of a
very simple idea.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.000
So the question is why
doesn't it happen?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.850
And that's sort of what we're
going to spend our time

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.100
talking about.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.940
So it does happen.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.795
The first answer is
it does happen.

00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:37.372
So here's a nice,
nice example.

00:08:37.372 --> 00:08:40.730
And it says something about--

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.010
actually, it's an interesting
example.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:56.590
So it turns out that the way
to work in Nigeria, I don't

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.070
actually give you money.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.990
I don't actually give you
money when something bad

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.530
happens to you.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.780
What do I do?

00:09:10.382 --> 00:09:18.910
I loan you money and in
particular if you're expected

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.880
to pay me back, I ask
for less payback.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.300
If I'm expected to pay you back,
I pay you more than what

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.680
I was supposed to owe you.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.490
So usually interest contracts
tend to be completely

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.040
inflexible.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:48.390
You know, my mortgage
is quarter of 5.4%.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.580
I pay 5.4% every year until
the market is paid.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.130
That's not what credit looks
like in Nigeria.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:00.320
In these villages you found that
the interest rate itself

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.850
is very flexible.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:11.790
So I pay more than what I owed,
in some sense, when you

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.190
are doing badly and I pay less
than what I owed when you're

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.770
doing well.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.480
That's a way to provide
insurance, but it goes through

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.730
this cover of a loan.

00:10:24.035 --> 00:10:26.007
AUDIENCE: How do they determine
if someone has an

00:10:26.007 --> 00:10:26.993
adverse [INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.965
You know, like, through
word of mouth?

00:10:28.965 --> 00:10:30.444
PROFESSOR: Perfectly
good question.

00:10:30.444 --> 00:10:30.937
We'll come back.

00:10:30.937 --> 00:10:32.540
Let's come back to that.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.630
I want to spend a minute,
before we get to that

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.710
question, on a more basic
question, which is why do you

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:40.960
think they do this?

00:10:50.964 --> 00:10:56.990
Why do you think that they go
through this loan mechanism?

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:02.380
So then what they seem to be
doing is paying you more on

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.790
your loan when you do badly and
paying you less on your

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.830
loan when the payer
is doing badly.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.100
Why does that make any sense?

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:19.402
What could be driving
that structure?

00:11:19.402 --> 00:11:19.884
Yep.

00:11:19.884 --> 00:11:23.740
AUDIENCE: Because they know
that later on when they'll

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.546
probably be doing badly that
they'll get a break and that

00:11:25.546 --> 00:11:26.160
it'll help them out.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.500
PROFESSOR: But why don't they
just give them money?

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.350
Why through the loan?

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.110
The question here I'm asking is
why is it that I give you a

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.270
discount on your loan
rather than just

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.250
handing you some cash?

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.040
What is that pointing to?

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:52.280
AUDIENCE: Desire to
not to feel like

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.840
you're giving a handout.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.282
PROFESSOR: So one possibility
is that you it's sort of a

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:57.310
cover, right?

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.090
That's an interesting idea.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:03.300
It's a cover for I'm giving
you the money.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:11.400
But it's not so much that people
are not seeing that I'm

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.940
handing you some cash.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.830
They're seeing that I'm actually
paying you some money

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:16.780
back for a loan.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.770
So in that sense it's a cover.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.580
Maybe everybody else also
knows that you are poor.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.730
It's not so clear that it's
so hard, you know.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:30.980
You had a comment?

00:12:34.416 --> 00:12:37.155
AUDIENCE: They don't want them
to think that, become

00:12:37.155 --> 00:12:40.392
dependent on things like that
being free or, like, kind of

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:43.380
expect that they're going to
get handouts all the time?

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.014
PROFESSOR: Well, why would
that be any different?

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:49.240
I could always say that I'm
doing badly, and you'll pay me

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.900
more on the loan I gave you.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.490
Why would that be any
different to loan?

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.410
AUDIENCE: Maybe because it
creates some sort of

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.880
dependence relationship between
the two people.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.350
So if you have to agree to it
beforehand, the other one can

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.820
just say, well, [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.784
PROFESSOR: I will come
back to that.

00:13:12.784 --> 00:13:13.278
Yeah.

00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:15.501
AUDIENCE: I was just going to
say that it sort of sets up a

00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:18.382
contractual agreement where when
I'm not doing well, you

00:13:18.382 --> 00:13:19.916
help me out and when
you're not doing

00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:20.194
well, I help you out.

00:13:20.194 --> 00:13:21.444
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:25.605
Yeah.

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:27.459
AUDIENCE: You could also say
that if someone just gives you

00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:32.040
money that's kind of expected
to get some of the money,

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.010
something non zero benefits, a
loan that you have to repay,

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.227
there isn't really a guarantee
how much of a discount you're

00:13:38.227 --> 00:13:38.970
going to get.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.960
You can't really take that
into account as well.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.880
PROFESSOR: So what you're saying
is related to what

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:53.970
they're saying, which is that
one thing about a loan is

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.190
using the loan suggests that
this is making use of a

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.630
preexisting financial
relationship, so an ongoing

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.510
relationship.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:06.190
The difference between my giving
you money seems to be

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:11.330
mostly that in a sense these are
people who already had a

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.820
financial relationship.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:18.850
So it's the case that a lot of
these people, one owes the

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.190
other one money already.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.650
And adjusting the terms of that
suggests that it's not so

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:29.740
much-- so in other words, it's
not clear that what this isn't

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.980
telling us is simply that the
people who have these

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.770
transactions are already people
who've had a stock

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.860
against each other.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.730
So it's not the case that--

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:47.370
so it's, you know, you keep
count and say it's not clear.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:53.780
So instead of thinking of the
loan as being a separate

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.750
financial product, one way
to think about it is

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.300
that we keep accounts.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.730
And I've done you five favors.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.470
You've done me three favors.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.250
And the net is two favors.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.325
And the loan amount really
reflects our netting out of

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.180
those favors.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.580
So in other words, what is nice
about a loan is it's a

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.010
net I owe you or you owe me.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.370
It's a net accounting device
for keeping track of who's

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.220
done who how many favors.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.850
So by thinking of it in long
terms, it creates a natural

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:30.160
framework for thinking about
this as kind of a social

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.990
accounting device.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.520
How do I keep track of--

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.840
like, maybe people also say,
well, I did you seven favors

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.810
and you've not done me one.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.310
I have heard people say things
like that, so the same

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.170
psychology.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.580
It's a good way to keep track.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.290
Thinking of it in terms of a
loan makes it clear that what

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.250
you're trying to do is keep
track of an ongoing

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.930
relationship.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.540
It's a stock.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.150
I gave you 100.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.070
You paid me back 50.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.150
Then I give you 30.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.820
Then you give me 200.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.400
And when I add those up, every
stage, what I really care

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.390
about is not how many times
what happened but the net

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.100
amount you owe me.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.780
And that's a good way to account
for the relationship

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:22.155
so we can keep track of am I
someone who owes you or are

00:16:22.155 --> 00:16:25.960
you someone who owes me by sort
of counting that amount.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.400
And that way we don't need to
keep track of all these other

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.660
numbers, whether it was 20
ones and 15 another time.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.470
It's just one number which
kind of measures our

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.120
collective obligation.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:46.920
And the reason that we would
like-- why would we like to

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.645
keep track of the collective
obligation?

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.170
Why does it matter that we keep
track of the collective

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.420
obligation?

00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:05.234
AUDIENCE: I mean, it promises
them security, right?

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.634
PROFESSOR: Security for who?

00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:19.939
AUDIENCE: I would say that in
the community because one

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:23.348
person who was taking thousands
of dollars from

00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:27.244
someone else, I'd know that if
that person asks me for money,

00:17:27.244 --> 00:17:28.240
I wouldn't loan the person
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.450
PROFESSOR: So one advantage of
that might be that it kind of

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.750
summarizes my status in
the collective system.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:45.840
So it may be that everybody
knows I owe you 50.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.050
And then nobody will want to
lend me much more because it

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.280
looks like I'm just somebody who
takes money from everybody

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.210
and never gives them.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.160
So it's a good way to keep
track of whether there's

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.630
someone who sort of tried
to beat the system.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:07.502
But there's another even
simpler reason why.

00:18:07.502 --> 00:18:11.117
AUDIENCE: I guess [INAUDIBLE],
which is

00:18:11.117 --> 00:18:12.330
basically the same thing.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:12.810
PROFESSOR: Speak up.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.684
AUDIENCE: Just to be a way to
avoid moral hazard, which is

00:18:16.684 --> 00:18:18.090
essentially basically
the same thing.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.043
PROFESSOR: Why would they
avoid moral hazard?

00:18:20.043 --> 00:18:23.424
AUDIENCE: Because it's an
accountability system.

00:18:23.424 --> 00:18:26.910
So, like, everyone in the
community is kind of aware of

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.882
it's a way of keeping track of
it on a smaller scale at a

00:18:29.882 --> 00:18:31.295
larger company.

00:18:31.295 --> 00:18:33.180
For example, like, in the
city couldn't do it.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.230
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.530
That's basically
the same thing.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.010
But in some ways I think there's
an even simpler reason

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:44.380
why you may want to keep track
of it, which is simply it may

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:50.180
well be that I just knew
vis-a-vis someone else, he may

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:55.580
want to know, how many times
has this guy taken from me?

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.890
And I may want to just put a
limit to that because I know

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.710
that at some level
I'm going to die

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.840
in 20 years or something.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.750
And so I'm going to say, look,
you know, if it's reciprocity,

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:13.150
so that the reason I'm giving
him is x, that he will pay me

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:18.110
back eventually, then I want
to know whether it's

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.440
reasonable to expect that I'll
get enough back from him.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.510
So if I think that basically the
reason why I'm giving him

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:29.270
the money is because he will
eventually give me back the

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.360
money when I need it.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.980
Well, if my future is 20 years
and I've given him $5 million

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.150
dollars, I'm unlikely to
get that much back.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.050
So I want to know roughly where
I am in that transaction

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.440
because that's the only way
that I can kind of make a

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.165
rational decision about whether
it's worth continuing.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.730
If my reason for being in the
relationship is that I also

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.640
think that I'm going to get
some favors from him then

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:05.570
knowing how much he already owes
me is a way to keep track

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:09.980
of how much can I reasonably
expect to get back from him.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.680
If that number's already way
past anything then I don't

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.060
need to give him extra favor
to get more back.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.350
At some level I'm just not going
to be able to collect.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:28.410
So if there's some kind
of a rational--

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.110
so I might want to limit my
exposure to him because in

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.720
some sense I know that it is
never going to pay off to

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.330
invest so much in a
particular person.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.820
So it might be a useful
accounting device.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.770
So I think that Chris Udry,
who did this study, his

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.400
interpretation very
much was this.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:52.290
They're keeping track of how
much they owe each other, that

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:57.780
everybody knows roughly I owe
this guy this much, which is

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.220
within reasonable limits.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.610
It's not too much.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:05.890
And, therefore, I can expect
to get it back eventually.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:13.990
So this is a table from
Chris's paper.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.440
And it's just a very simple
point, but it's worth looking

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.410
at the paper.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:20.730
It's sort of striking.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.600
So it's the monthly
interest rate.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.160
These are huge numbers.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.360
That's why it's worth
looking at.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.450
The monthly interest rate,
when the borrower gets no

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:39.990
shock, he pays four percentage
points less per month.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.780
That's a lot, right?

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.870
Four percentage points.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.500
What's four percentage
per month compounded?

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.873
What's the compounded?

00:21:56.873 --> 00:21:59.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.550
PROFESSOR: Close to 50%.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.540
So that's like 50% off.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:08.570
So you're getting, like,
4% per month less.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.260
Now take a look at the number.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:17.590
When the lender, he has a bad
shock, no shock, he charges

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:23.570
basically 10 percentage points
less per month than when he

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.720
has a shock.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.200
Difference would be minus 7.5
and 2.6, is basically 10

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.000
percentage points.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.420
But when he has a shock,
he charges 10

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.700
percentage points more.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.350
So these are massive numbers.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.930
I mean, those are, like, huge.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.880
The interest rates just move
enormously suggesting that

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.320
there is actually substantial
resource transfer

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.570
that's going on.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:52.720
Yeah.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.845
AUDIENCE: So is this like he
actually charges or the person

00:22:56.845 --> 00:22:58.165
just chooses to pay more?

00:22:58.165 --> 00:22:58.670
PROFESSOR: He chooses.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.560
So we don't know that.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.230
All we observe is that the
person pays that much more

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:10.010
when the lender gets a shock.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.890
But the difference, just to get
the order of magnitude,

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.510
these are very, very
large numbers.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:19.320
So these are substantial
transfers going on in both

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.160
directions.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.870
On the other hand, there's
still 10% of a loan.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.120
So it's like, you know, the
stock is much bigger.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.640
So these people have an ongoing

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.330
ledger with each other.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:40.220
And then they change that
number by changing the

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.470
interest rate by a lot.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.910
Now, what's that also
telling us?

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:52.510
It's also telling us something
about the scope of this

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.350
relationship, right?

00:23:55.350 --> 00:24:02.390
So if the way I'm going to get
my insurance is by getting

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.760
even a 10 percentage
point reduction in

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.820
the interest rate--

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.610
so let's say the interest
rate is 15%.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:15.270
And I get 10 percentage points
off, but I owe you $100.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.520
How much do I save?

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.510
I save $5.00, right?

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:38.280
I was going to pay you $15,
and I now pay $5.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.390
The main point is that the
amount of insurance that you

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.190
can get through this system is
still very limited by the

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.900
amount of loan there is because,
you know, if I'm

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.910
giving you a discount on a loan
then that depends on the

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.490
loan amount I had.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.010
So if the loan amount was $1
million then a discount on

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.330
that is worth a lot.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.420
If these are poor people and
their net loan amount is $10

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.090
then the fact that I'm getting
a discount from the loan is

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.200
not giving me that
much insurance.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.050
So the downside of thinking
about it in loan terms and in

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:16.100
principle, this could be
relatively small number.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.510
So I think these interest
rates are high.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.890
But they're not high enough to
turn a small number into a

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.140
small number.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.530
So that's sort of one thing
to keep in mind.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.190
We'll come back to this because
I want to talk a

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.600
little bit more about other
forms of insurance.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.010
So one form of insurance we
observe is this loan.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.800
And that has its advantages,
and it's a

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.290
nice accounting device.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.280
I can keep track of
what's going on.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:48.380
It has the disadvantage that if
I haven't given you a loan

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.710
then I can't help you.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.430
It sort of goes through
this loan.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:57.910
So if you only owe me $5 then
it's not going to be a big

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.320
transfer because you can,
at most, let off the

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.580
interest on the $5.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.990
But the interest
on $5 is $0.50.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.840
And that's not going to make
a big difference to me.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.590
So in general that limits
the scope of the system.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.840
And what I want to talk about
is a bit of stuff from

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:20.720
Thailand, which is different
because our colleague, Robert

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.460
Townsend, has been studying
these villages

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.980
for many, many years.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.640
And I'll show you some data
from what he's collected.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.860
And then we'll see that the way
insurance is offered in

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.440
Thailand is very different
in principle.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.280
And so institutional form--

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.940
in Nigeria it's a loan.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.900
In Thailand we'll
see what it is.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.215
So first here's a nice table.

00:26:48.215 --> 00:26:51.970
It's sort of a fact that I've
been saying many times.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.100
It just says how much
risk do people bear?

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.940
So what this table is,
each row is a farmer.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.450
They don't have data
for every farmer.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.120
But two things to note.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.520
One is look at the best
year and the worst

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.770
year for these farmers.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.600
They're somewhat correlated
but not perfectly, right?

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.410
The best year for some
farmers was '85.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.580
The worst year for some
farmers was '85.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.550
The best year for some
farmers was '88.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.335
The worst year for some
farmers was '88.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.185
Why am I emphasizing
the correlation?

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.860
These are all within the same
village, within one village.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.950
Why am I emphasizing
the correlation?

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.910
AUDIENCE: To emphasize that the
shocks are independent.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.950
So that there is scope
for insurance.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:12.870
I can insure you only if we
don't both get into trouble at

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.140
the same time.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.770
So the worst year for one farmer
is not the worst year

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.910
for the other farmer.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.500
The second thing is look
at the magnitudes.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:31.350
That last column is
the percentage.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.440
If you look at the harvest
amounts, the best year and the

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.105
worst year, the differences
are massive.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.860
It's just the amounts.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.850
I just want you to
look the amounts.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.680
The amounts are impressive
because think about you got an

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:58.120
income of 50 one year and
115 the next year.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.370
Those are big differences.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.720
Anything else that
strikes you?

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.520
Now, this may be difficult
to see.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.090
But one thing that's interesting
is that if you

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.380
look at the--

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:59.040
it's not that the people who
have average less harvest, the

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.960
risk seems to be independent
of that.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.570
So richer people seem to have
roughly the same risk as

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.200
poorer people.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.720
So everybody seems to
be exposed to risk.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.390
It's not that the rich people
have less risk.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.570
AUDIENCE: How do you
define richness?

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:18.400
PROFESSOR: Take the maximum
amount of harvest, the maximum

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.320
harvest, the people with the
biggest maximum harvest

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.110
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.810
This table is nice too.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.790
It goes back to answering
the implied question.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.580
What's going on?

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.830
What's the source of risk?

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.630
AUDIENCE: These are all
the same households?

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.820
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.590
AUDIENCE: These are all
the same households?

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.090
PROFESSOR: No.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:43.870
Yeah.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.360
These are the same households
as the previous table, same

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.650
numbers, B35, 36.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.030
These are the same households.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.790
They all live in the
same village.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.720
And this is asking why
did you face risk?

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:02.170
And, again, mostly it has
to do with weather.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:08.030
Though, for some people, there's
one person who says

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:11.960
that insects is the biggest
source of risk.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:47.724
Yeah.

00:31:47.724 --> 00:31:50.209
AUDIENCE: I don't fully
understand how someone's best

00:31:50.209 --> 00:31:53.688
year was also someone's
worst year, how rain

00:31:53.688 --> 00:31:54.682
could be the problem--

00:31:54.682 --> 00:31:56.680
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.990
Someone else want to
suggest the answer?

00:32:06.325 --> 00:32:09.748
AUDIENCE: I mean, I think
it indicates that--

00:32:09.748 --> 00:32:11.085
I think there's two
potential answers.

00:32:11.085 --> 00:32:13.158
One, rain could be the answer.

00:32:13.158 --> 00:32:15.102
Maybe some of these fields
are irrigated.

00:32:15.102 --> 00:32:18.018
But judging by the variation on
even the wealthiest fields,

00:32:18.018 --> 00:32:20.448
which presumably would have
the greatest chance of

00:32:20.448 --> 00:32:22.878
irrigation, the fact that it's
still pretty big fluctuations,

00:32:22.878 --> 00:32:24.336
that's probably not
the answer.

00:32:24.336 --> 00:32:26.401
I mean, I think it's indicative
that there's other

00:32:26.401 --> 00:32:28.100
factors at work other
than rainfall.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.390
PROFESSOR: But they're saying
that it's rain.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.688
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:32:31.688 --> 00:32:33.640
I mean, maybe because
they don't realize.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.365
I mean, I think if they realize
what the other farmer

00:32:36.365 --> 00:32:38.610
was doing that [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:41.060
more successful, they'd
probably try to do it.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.000
So maybe they didn't realize
that fertilizer-- and maybe

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.370
that they got unlucky and got
hit with a disease they

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.830
weren't able to recognize.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:47.690
PROFESSOR: They didn't
realize.

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:48.980
That could be.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.840
Go ahead.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.860
AUDIENCE: It could be
different crops.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.990
So most of this explanation is
that some of them are doing

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.960
very different crops.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.730
So it might be some crops
hate water and

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:03.790
others really like it.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:07.710
Like, rice really
adores water.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:11.540
But cotton or chilies
hate water.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:16.450
So there are crops which you
get too much rain, you get

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:23.510
lower output and crops which
output is always

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:25.000
increasing in rain.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.970
And so one possible explanation
is that they were

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:29.230
planting different crops.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:32.490
So we both planted
the same time.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:37.290
I'm planting a crop which will
hurt if the rain is bad and

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:40.170
will do well when the rain is
good and the other way around.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.270
So that's one possibility.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:44.200
The other possibility is that
they're just micro climates,

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:51.200
that the rain is sort of--

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:57.310
after all, what matters is not
so much rain as such but rain

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.530
at the right time.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:02.320
So I plant on a particular
day.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.800
My saplings have just come
out of the ground.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.320
That's when I need rain, when
the plant is young.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.260
And so it may well be that
the rain on those five

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.030
days was very good.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:19.070
But then the guy who planted
later, he thought the rains

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.719
would be better in five days.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:23.770
And then the rains were
really not better.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:24.920
They were really bad.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.969
So it may very well be that
there is either geographical

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:31.969
variation in rainfall within a
local area or just over time.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:35.350
So I planted on a
particular day.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.860
I needed the rain 10 days
after that when the

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.940
saplings came out.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.010
I got the rain.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.440
You didn't get the rain.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.110
So I think both of those
are plausible.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.840
So I just wanted you to
look at this because I

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840
keep talking of risk.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.340
But this is sort of a much
better way to look at it.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.429
You just see the magnitudes of
it and the sources of it.

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:56.780
So I thought these tables
were very nice.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.950
And what he goes on to do in
this paper is asking how do

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:03.200
people deal with risk?

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:14.350
And so he's describing three
villages very close to each

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.690
other, to the point where one
of the villages, people

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.580
actually use the financial
institutions

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:21.580
in the other villages.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.650
So they're very close
to each other.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.480
They're exactly in this
area where the

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.610
rainfall was measured.

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:28.950
So the risk is roughly
what you saw.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.670
So we got a sense of the risk.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:39.620
And in Nigeria we saw that
people respond by borrowing

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.240
from each other.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.360
Here, in this particular
village, there are five

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.430
different funds.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:49.330
So there's a village
savings fund.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:55.490
And the village savings fund
is actually an equity fund.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:59.220
These guys actually pay you
a different rate of return

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.740
depending on what the borrowers
were willing to pay.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:09.110
So I put in money
into this fund.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.895
And then you come and borrow.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.000
You're willing to pay 20%.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.540
Then that money gets
rolled back to me.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.950
So it's a fund which has a
variable interest which

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:28.780
depends on the village
demand levels.

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:45.730
What do you think should happen
to the interest rate in

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:48.235
that fund when the rainfall
is good or bad?

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.000
How would it pay?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.465
Will it go up when the rainfall
is good or down?

00:37:12.075 --> 00:37:14.257
AUDIENCE: Won't it go up because
people are willing pay

00:37:14.257 --> 00:37:15.500
more [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:21.370
PROFESSOR: So one possibility it
will go up because when the

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.810
rainfall is good, productivity
is high.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:27.570
People are willing to buy
more inputs to produce.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.295
Is that good for insurance
or bad for insurance?

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.508
Yeah?

00:37:43.508 --> 00:37:45.484
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:45.484 --> 00:37:47.353
PROFESSOR: That's good for
insurance because the people

00:37:47.353 --> 00:37:48.310
who are getting high

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:52.400
productivity shocks are borrowing.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.270
But you would imagine the
opposite, which is a fund with

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:00.105
a variable interest rate where
we only borrow from it when

00:38:00.105 --> 00:38:01.355
we're desperate.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.870
Then you might see the demand
for those funds being

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:10.660
particularly high when rainfall
is bad because we're

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.470
all trying to borrow from
that to survive.

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:17.645
And at that point, very few
people are going to lend.

00:38:17.645 --> 00:38:19.610
The interest rate is
going to go up.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.430
That's going to be bad
for insurance.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:24.726
So it depends very much.

00:38:24.726 --> 00:38:29.800
Rather a fixed interest fund,
a variable interest fund can

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.420
be either good or bad
for insurance.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.310
Then there is a fund for
purchase of pigs.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.440
Here, the interest
rate is fixed.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.560
But there's a rollover
provision.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.600
Rollover provision is if you are
in trouble and you can't

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.690
pay, I can let you keep
the loan for longer.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:51.060
You pay more, but you don't
have to pay back now.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.440
Is that good for insurance
or bad?

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:01.060
AUDIENCE: Well, it depends
on the person

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.020
that they're insuring.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.980
If the person [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.410
they can keep rolling it over
and eventually drop out.

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:13.310
But it could be good if the
person is experiencing some

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:16.290
transitory shock [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:17.930
PROFESSOR: Assuming that the
person is going to pay it

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:19.220
back, it's good for insurance.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.740
Rollovers are good
for insurance.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.290
There's a fund for purchase
of fertilizer.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:29.410
So each of these is almost
like a proper financial

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.040
institution at the
village level.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.550
So in this village,
the leader has

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.280
organized a bunch of funds.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:44.120
And you can save money to
buy pigs in this fund.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.780
And right now if I've saved
money and you want to buy

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.300
pigs, you can borrow
from this fund.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.920
And, likewise, there's money
in a fund for buying

00:39:54.920 --> 00:40:02.890
fertilizer, a rice bank where
the rice I grow I can store.

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.640
And when I need rice, I
can take rice from it.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.150
And there's a health care fund
where we each put in money.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:11.660
And if somebody gets sick,
he gets to spend it.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.700
So this is a village which
is rich with financial

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.560
institutions.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.810
These are not loans.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:26.000
In particular, the health care
fund or the rollover is

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.250
something where I'm making a
direct transfer to the people

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.250
who are hurting.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.160
But it's not bilateral loans.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:45.050
These are kind of financing from
a financial institution.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:49.210
So the main point I'm making
here is that here you see a

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.820
very different sort
of insurance.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.260
This is organized through
collective action.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.710
Everybody's getting together and
lending to everybody else.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:09.415
Now, he goes down a few more
miles from May Wak to a

00:41:09.415 --> 00:41:11.580
village called Sop Wak.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.150
And what does he see?

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:14.730
Well, on paper it looks
very similar.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.710
But here's the problem.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:24.300
All the loans are in default.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.580
Not all, but a lot of loans
are in default.

00:41:30.385 --> 00:41:32.245
Is this good or bad
for insurance?

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.930
Anybody else?

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.080
Why is a default bad
for insurance?

00:42:02.872 --> 00:42:04.657
AUDIENCE: Because then the
people who are putting in the

00:42:04.657 --> 00:42:06.300
money won't get any money.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.005
PROFESSOR: But maybe the person
who is defaulting is

00:42:08.005 --> 00:42:10.400
the one who needs to not pay.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.375
It's so clear that default
is bad for insurance.

00:42:13.375 --> 00:42:16.730
The problem is with this default
then nobody will put

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.220
money into the bank.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:24.510
So default is, in a sense, a
form of insurance, right?

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:28.190
I allow you to not pay
when you can't pay.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:32.480
But if there's a lot of default
and I think that's

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.410
mollified then I may not put
money into the bank.

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:39.210
So, again, it's not clear
which way it goes.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:42.320
But he interprets this as saying
that these places,

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.650
these banks, nobody's putting
money into them.

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:46.130
So these banks are
kind of defunct.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:46.962
Yeah.

00:42:46.962 --> 00:42:50.025
AUDIENCE: How could it default
and not repay?

00:42:50.025 --> 00:42:53.580
PROFESSOR: Oh, we could imagine
a world where that's

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.400
exactly how we provide
insurance.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:04.040
So we each imagine
that the rule is.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.820
Year one, if you have a shock
this year, you borrow.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:15.370
Even year two, if you again have
a shock then you default.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:19.520
We write it off, happens in
one time out of 10 or

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.950
one time out of 20.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:25.110
But, you know, it can
happen to any of us.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.370
And when it's really bad and
I've had two shocks in a row,

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:32.412
it's better for me to not have
to pay back than you to give

00:43:32.412 --> 00:43:34.020
me yet another loan.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.210
There's no particular reason why
default would be bad for

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.650
insurance if we could
make sure that

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:39.900
the default is limited.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.325
AUDIENCE: Doesn't the insurance
company just loose

00:43:44.325 --> 00:43:45.970
all that money though?

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:46.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.860
But it counts into its--

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.220
the insurance company is
losing that money.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.030
But remember, when an insurance
company makes a

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.260
payment, it also loses money.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.140
So just think of it as
a form of payment.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.620
Default could just be a form of
insurance because I could

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.090
be paying people in the
form of default.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.040
You don't have to pay.

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.260
Fine.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.620
You don't have any money,
you don't have to pay.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:11.350
That's a perfectly legitimate
form of insurance.

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:16.336
Just the question is whether
it's deliberate, in which case

00:44:16.336 --> 00:44:17.720
there will be too much of it.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.240
And in that case the
system won't work.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.228
Yep.

00:44:21.228 --> 00:44:24.192
AUDIENCE: That may be the case
when there's an insurance

00:44:24.192 --> 00:44:27.156
company or a government which
is writing off the loan.

00:44:27.156 --> 00:44:30.614
But the latest census
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.990
PROFESSOR: I guess a lot is
relative to what they're

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:39.730
willing and what they
were planning for.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:42.470
There's nothing else about
a lot of default.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:43.740
It's just what you're
planning for.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.230
I could plan for, you know, one
loan out of five will be

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:52.200
defaulted, and the others will
just absorb that loss.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.170
It might me fine.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:54.650
It may be a form of insurance.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:57.040
Default is a natural
form of insurance.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.920
That's a way of understanding.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:03.420
There is nothing obviously
bad about default if it's

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.570
completely just I
have no choice.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:06.540
I default.

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:10.030
That's a perfectly good way to
insure myself because then I

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:12.680
don't need to pay when I'm
in really bad shape.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:16.620
It's when I start using as an
excuse to not pay that it

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.888
makes a difference.

00:45:17.888 --> 00:45:18.386
Yeah.

00:45:18.386 --> 00:45:20.876
AUDIENCE: I think I'm getting
tripped up because usually

00:45:20.876 --> 00:45:24.860
default is when the intent is
for you to get that paid back.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.346
So if you're using default as
a form of insurance, to me,

00:45:28.346 --> 00:45:29.591
it's no longer default then.

00:45:29.591 --> 00:45:32.340
It's just a form of insurance.

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:32.460
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.210
I kind of agree with that.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.490
I mean, that seems like we're
arguing over words.

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:41.240
So I think default just means
I don't pay the loan.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.340
And when I don't pay the
loan, that might

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.080
very well be desirable.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.910
Now, as you see, their view is
a bit that it's not actually

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:56.530
necessarily a good idea to
collect because they're taking

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:00.250
the view that these people are
defaulting because they need

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:01.170
to default.

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:03.430
So it's not clear what
default means here.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:04.885
And that's worth
understanding.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.580
Then he walks down to
a third village.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.290
The third village is
a few miles down.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:17.590
And none of these funds exist.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.600
So one village, all the funds
are working well.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.130
In the second village, there's
lot of default.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.490
The funds are still there.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:28.310
Third village, no funds
except one.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.850
And you are in the Nigerian
mode where you're just

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.100
borrowing from each other.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.150
So what's the advantage
of a fund over

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:39.400
borrowing from each other?

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:47.180
Let me see if someone else
wants to answer.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.780
What's the advantage
of a fund over

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.650
borrowing from each other?

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:53.760
AUDIENCE: They have more
resources for you to borrow?

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.624
PROFESSOR: Why?

00:46:54.624 --> 00:46:57.677
AUDIENCE: One individual has a
limited constraint, whereas if

00:46:57.677 --> 00:46:59.380
people pool their
money together.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:46:59.810
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:01.830
It's a way to pool many
more people in.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:06.240
So that's the advantage
of a fund.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.730
So what do you think
is going on?

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.690
Why do these villages, which
are very similar, have same

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:15.880
kind of risk next to
each other, have

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.130
very different patterns?

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:28.515
Think about what it takes for
such an institution to exist.

00:47:38.076 --> 00:47:40.990
AUDIENCE: They need the trust
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.670
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:50.950
So the way one of these funds
works is by saying that I'm

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:54.260
going to put money into it now
because I can get money into

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.510
it in the future.

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.390
What does that assume?

00:48:04.946 --> 00:48:05.423
Yeah.

00:48:05.423 --> 00:48:06.360
AUDIENCE: It's going to
exist in the future.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.800
PROFESSOR: That there
is a future.

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.930
So in other words, if I think
that everybody else is going

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:17.200
to default today, I should
default as well because there

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.780
will be no fund in the future.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:33.740
So this is a classic kind of
problem of anything that's

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.430
sort of sustained
by the future.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.760
It depends on there
being a future.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:46.460
So this is the problem that
right now a lot of microcredit

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.580
organizations are facing.

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.930
Microcredit organizations
promise you a loan if you pay

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.180
back your loan.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:04.040
Now, suppose you think that
nobody else will pay back

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.630
their loan.

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:07.365
What's going to happen to the
microcredit organization?

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:15.680
It's going to go bankrupt.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.380
If it goes bankrupt, what's
going to happen

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.672
to your future loan?

00:49:20.672 --> 00:49:21.090
AUDIENCE: It doesn't exist.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:22.460
PROFESSOR: It doesn't exist.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:27.070
So basically if everybody
expects people to default in

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:31.500
the future then I should
default now.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:37.110
So if everybody else is expected
to default, it is

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:38.470
rational for me to default.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.470
If everybody expected to pay
back in the future then it's

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:49.170
rational for me to pay back
because then the fund will be

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:51.020
there for a long time.

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:54.250
So I think this is sort of
the reason why funds--

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:58.760
so all of these kind of informal
institutions are

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.135
fragile because they rely on
this kind of coordination.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:09.800
I only want to repay if
everybody else wants to repay

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.410
or at least as long as enough
people want to repay that the

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.100
fund will be going.

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.710
If I expect that lots of people
will default in the

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:20.650
future, I should default now
because the fund is going to

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.330
go out of business.

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.610
I'm not going to get anything
out of it in the future.

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.270
So I might as well just stop
having anything to do with it.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.960
So it totally depends
on trust.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.580
If I believe that everybody else
is going to behave well

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.470
then I should behave well.

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:39.880
If I think that everybody else
is going to behave badly then

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.650
it's over in some sense.

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:45.110
That's one central weakness
of these kinds of informal

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:46.475
institutions.

00:50:46.475 --> 00:50:55.420
They rely on the expectation
that I'm going to behave well

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:57.080
in the future.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.410
Yeah.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.710
AUDIENCE: Well, if everyone else
is going to pay back in

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:03.742
the future, wouldn't it still
be better for you to default

00:51:03.742 --> 00:51:07.410
now if you were being selfish
because the fund's still going

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:08.410
to exist whether or not--

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:08.670
PROFESSOR: No.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:10.430
But then you can't
borrow again.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.280
Then they can say, look,
you defaulted.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.550
You didn't pay the money
when you needed to.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.390
You were supposed to pay
money into the fund.

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:18.390
You didn't pay.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.270
Now you're out.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:24.620
But if you come and ask me to
put money into the fund and I

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.620
know that everybody else is
planning to default, I'm never

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.820
going to do it.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.400
And if I ever get a loan out of
it, I'm going to default as

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.815
soon as I can because I
know everybody else

00:51:32.815 --> 00:51:34.040
is planning to default.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:39.540
So in these kinds of
institutions, default is

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:43.010
entirely sort of
self-fulfilling.

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:45.620
So if I expect default,
I'll have default.

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.850
If I expect people to behave
well, we'll probably all

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:49.910
behave well.

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:52.970
So probably the reason why
these villages are so

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:57.340
different is because of this
expectation mechanism which is

00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.920
very important to understand.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.050
And it's true of lots of
financial institutions.

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:08.260
They rely on our future
compliance to work.

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:17.850
And that's why, for example,
even banks to some extent--

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.060
if I decide that I'm going to
withdraw my money from the

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.020
bank, everybody is going to
withdraw money from the bank

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:26.540
tomorrow, what should
I do today?

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.030
PROFESSOR: I should
withdraw today.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:30.360
That's a bank run.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.370
So a lot of financial
institutions have

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:33.570
exactly this feature.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:36.500
And that's why it's not so
surprising to see that some

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.650
villages have very good
institutions, rich set of

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:41.400
institutions, others don't.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.290
The fact that some villages
have default,

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:45.080
it's the same reasoning.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.950
Once people start defaulting,
everybody's going to start

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:48.360
defaulting.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.342
Yeah.

00:52:49.342 --> 00:52:52.779
AUDIENCE: Could it be possible
that in one village a default

00:52:52.779 --> 00:52:54.743
is costlier than in
another village?

00:52:54.743 --> 00:52:57.689
Maybe, like, socially you'll
be ostracized or something

00:52:57.689 --> 00:53:01.617
like that, and that will help
support the program where

00:53:01.617 --> 00:53:04.080
everyone pays into the fund?

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:04.680
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:08.270
So it could very well be that
another thing that this tells

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:10.580
us is that, for example,
a leader matters.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:14.850
So if the leader is someone who
can enforce punishments in

00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:17.020
the village so if I default--

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.900
suppose I'm supposed to pay
back, and I know I can pay

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:22.950
back but, you know, I just
refuse to do it.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:28.870
If the leader can basically have
me ostracized then, in

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:30.780
some sense, I'm not
going to do it.

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.130
And then given that I'm not
going to do it, everybody else

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:34.620
is willing to pay
into the fund.

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.150
So it's going to be huge
leverage from effective

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.690
leadership.

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.370
That's the other actually
conclusion of this paper is

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:45.760
that there's a good leader in
the first village, and he was

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.670
very important in setting
up these institutions.

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:51.597
He made them work.

00:53:51.597 --> 00:53:52.571
Yeah.

00:53:52.571 --> 00:53:54.032
AUDIENCE: I was actually
going to ask that.

00:53:54.032 --> 00:53:58.049
It seems that you have to
someone who's a good leader in

00:53:58.049 --> 00:53:59.890
order to make these
things work.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:04.773
But what was that guy or girl
doing to keep people confident

00:54:04.773 --> 00:54:06.023
of the performance?

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.960
PROFESSOR: I can't tell you.

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:14.060
It said that the leader was
very energetic, et cetera.

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:16.300
There's a description of the
leader, but it doesn't tell me

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:19.880
what he was doing so much.

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:23.930
OK, so we already talked
about moral hazard--

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:26.960
other limits of insurance.

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.830
But I wanted to emphasize that
because I wanted to emphasize

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:31.790
that this is not just a
limit of insurance.

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:35.000
It's a limit of any institution
that is not

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.890
enforced by legal punishments.

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:39.880
Anything that's not enforced
by legal punishments is

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.440
fragile always.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.860
It will work if it works.

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.490
It doesn't work, it
doesn't work.

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:50.200
That's sort of the main
point of that example.

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.370
If we all stop paying money
into the fund then

00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:54.570
the fund will die.

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:56.600
So I might as well take
my money and run.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:03.550
That's true of not just
insurance but of any other

00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:05.210
kind of institution.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:08.810
Now, moral hazard, we've
talked about.

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:12.320
I'm going to skip
moral hazard.

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:16.800
Here's another problem with
informal insurance.

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.630
This is all what we've been
talking about a bit.

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:30.660
So we've been sort of talking
about implicitly default.

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.910
But we've also been talking
about one thing that an

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:39.240
insurance arrangement demands is
that when it's your time to

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.580
pay, you pay.

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.270
Sometimes you get money
from the fund.

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:45.360
Sometimes you pay
into the fund.

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.370
You have to be willing to
pay money into the fund.

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:49.050
That's what keeps it going.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.790
Why do you want to keep putting
money in the fund?

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:59.590
We said this already,
but just to repeat.

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:01.830
Today I am rich.

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.260
I want to put money into the
fund so that somebody else can

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.290
take it out.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:06.540
Why would I want to do it?

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.968
Why does anyone want to
put money into a fund?

00:56:14.968 --> 00:56:15.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:16.752
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:56:16.752 --> 00:56:18.120
AUDIENCE: To get more
money back.

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:18.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:23.450
Eventually you pay me some
return on the fund.

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:26.890
But if it has to have an
insurance component then it

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:32.000
has to be that the return I get
on it is lower than the

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.830
market return because otherwise
they could have

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:38.020
borrowed from the market.

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.770
It doesn't provide
any insurance.

00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:45.110
So it can't be just because I
want to get the money back.

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:50.080
It must be because I expect that
I will be able to borrow

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.180
from the fund in the
future as well.

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:56.050
So I will be willing to put
money into a fund which pays

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.500
lower than market rate, which
is what insurance is.

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:04.080
Insurance is that I'm willing
to lend to someone at lower

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:09.590
than market rates so that when
he's in bad shape, he doesn't

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:10.500
suffer too much.

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:11.650
That's what's insurance.

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:14.268
AUDIENCE: It's probably also
probably the reason why

00:57:14.268 --> 00:57:15.696
wealthier people would be
less likely to give

00:57:15.696 --> 00:57:16.410
into a fund, right?

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:19.320
Because they're already exposed
to less risk than they

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:19.390
have already.

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:21.359
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:23.454
AUDIENCE: I thought you
said that why would a

00:57:23.454 --> 00:57:23.854
rich person do it.

00:57:23.854 --> 00:57:25.723
Because I was like, I don't
know why a rich

00:57:25.723 --> 00:57:26.710
person would do it.

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:28.870
PROFESSOR: Well, one reason they
may want to do it is that

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:31.420
they feel the same need as--

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:34.940
so what's an insurance fund?

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.370
An insurance fund is a fund
where I put in money so that

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:40.820
other people can be helped in
return for the fact that they

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.470
will put in money and
I will be helped.

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:47.720
Why would I put in money now?

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:49.540
Because I expect to be
helped in the future.

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:51.350
So what are the kinds of
people who don't want

00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:53.040
to join that fund?

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.580
You already gave one answer,
which is people who are rich.

00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:59.360
They don't expect
to get helped.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.390
So that's why you're going to
see that if there's a lot of

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:05.620
inequality in the village,
you're unlikely to see a fund

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.430
because the rich don't really
think that they can be helped

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:09.650
by the poor.

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:11.730
If they ever need money, they're
going to need, you

00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:13.990
know, $100,000.

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.170
The poor won't have it.

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.460
And, otherwise, they
won't need money.

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:18.718
Yeah.

00:58:18.718 --> 00:58:20.200
AUDIENCE: I think the chapter
also mentioned

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.164
timing as one factor.

00:58:23.164 --> 00:58:28.104
I mean, if people always
postpone, they value future

00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:30.090
outcomes less than
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:30.520
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.010
So you need to be forward
looking to be willing to

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.070
behave well and be
forward looking.

00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:41.530
If I always think that, well,
I'll just not pay now and

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:43.680
whatever happens in
the future, that's

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.370
not going to work.

00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:46.350
You need to be forward
looking.

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:50.830
And what's the point
around migration?

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:52.130
Why is migration important?

00:59:08.722 --> 00:59:11.466
AUDIENCE: Could you say that as
you have to expect to be in

00:59:11.466 --> 00:59:12.121
that area to benefit?

00:59:12.121 --> 00:59:12.870
PROFESSOR: In the
villiage, yeah.

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:15.500
You need to be in the village
to benefit from the fund.

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:20.760
If I expect to go away, I don't
know whether I'm going

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:23.010
to be here to benefit
from this fund.

00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:25.600
So if there's a lot of mobility
in a place then

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:26.760
everything falls apart.

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:37.930
So villages that are closer to
the road, to a big city, find

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:40.500
it harder to insure
each other.

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.110
Why?

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:45.300
Because everybody there has
a link to the city.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:48.870
So they don't know whether
they're going to help from the

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:51.010
village or they're going
to go to the city

00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:52.910
and get a job there.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:56.850
And so given that I am not
committed to being in the

00:59:56.850 --> 00:59:59.510
village, it's very hard
to give me insurance.

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:01.480
So all of these things.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:06.570
You need low mobility, low
inequality, and forward

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.795
looking people.

01:00:07.795 --> 01:00:08.785
Yeah.

01:00:08.785 --> 01:00:11.095
AUDIENCE: Also we should say
there are people who have

01:00:11.095 --> 01:00:14.871
access to ways to save their
money Right then--

01:00:14.871 --> 01:00:15.833
PROFESSOR: That's an
excellent point.

01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:19.690
What would a bank account do?

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:21.260
A bank account would undermine
insurance.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:21.850
Why?

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:25.640
Because in a bank account
I now can get high

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.530
return on my savings.

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:33.720
So when I have money, it's more
tempting for me to put it

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.050
in the bank account rather
than put it in this fund,

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.280
which is going to pay me a
lower return because it's

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.970
trying to help out
other people.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:44.350
So any outside options that
you provide-- so financial

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:47.710
development might undermine
local institutions.

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:50.540
So you might actually see worse
institutions where the

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.096
financial system is
better formally.

01:00:54.096 --> 01:00:55.088
Yeah.

01:00:55.088 --> 01:00:59.056
AUDIENCE: I misunderstood
the whole fund.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:02.540
You said that the market rate
was higher than the fund rate.

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:02.872
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:01:02.872 --> 01:01:03.530
Yes.

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:07.940
AUDIENCE: So even if there was
a bank and you experienced

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.432
some hardship, you would
be more inclined to

01:01:10.432 --> 01:01:10.780
borrow money from--

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.350
PROFESSOR: Oh, absolutely.

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:12.812
It's the other way around.

01:01:12.812 --> 01:01:15.170
The question is who do you
borrow money from?

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:18.390
If the bank does it, it makes
it too easy for me.

01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:20.800
Today, I have money and
you need money.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.900
I'm going to put my
money in the bank.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.520
That's why you can't get
money from the fund.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.020
The fund is a two way
street, right?

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:29.950
I need to put in money.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:31.200
You need to take out money.

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:37.900
As my options of putting money
elsewhere get better, it's

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.580
going to be harder and harder
to force me to put

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.980
money into the fund.

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.080
AUDIENCE: Even if the rates at
the other places are higher

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.330
than the rates at the fund.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.640
PROFESSOR: Especially, right?

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.130
Let me be clear.

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:52.290
What are we saying?

01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:53.920
There's a fund.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.520
What's a fund?

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:59.260
The fund is that I put
money into it.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.940
I get lower than market rates.

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:01.240
Why?

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.400
Because I want to give that
money to someone else who

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.340
needs it desperately,
providing insurance.

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.430
There's also a bank, which
pays the market rate.

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:14.550
Now, as the market rate gets
higher, it's harder and harder

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:18.970
for the guy who has money today
to not feel tempted to

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:22.350
put his money into the bank.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.064
Yeah, you had a comment.

01:02:24.064 --> 01:02:27.508
AUDIENCE: But, like, there's
a threshold, right?

01:02:27.508 --> 01:02:29.609
You have to have a certain
amount of money before you can

01:02:29.609 --> 01:02:30.240
open a bank account.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:30.510
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:33.385
So maybe the bank is not
actually available to you.

01:02:33.385 --> 01:02:35.460
But if the bank is available to
you, that might actually be

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.710
bad for insurance.

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:43.630
That's sort of maybe surprising
that a bank shows

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:46.280
up and that actually undermines
people's ability to

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.070
insure each other because it's
too easy to now park your

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:53.850
money elsewhere.

01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:57.250
Other reasons why informal
insurance doesn't work very

01:02:57.250 --> 01:03:00.350
well, we've also talked
about the

01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:04.750
coordination quite a lot already.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.370
If I expect to default
on the fund then you

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:14.550
will default too.

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:16.800
That's coordination.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:29.470
Also you would expect that these
funds only work because

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:38.050
I know when you really need
money and when you don't

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:41.130
because otherwise you could
always say I need money.

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:45.460
So you're not letting people
who are very isolated--

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:49.020
so people who are not in the
village network don't get into

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:49.930
these funds.

01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:54.860
They tend to be of people who
are relatively well connected

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:56.100
to the village community.

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:56.410
Why?

01:03:56.410 --> 01:04:00.240
Because I need to know whether
you're lying or not.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.850
And if you live next to me I
know that, yes, your cow died

01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:04.760
or whatever.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:11.330
Your pig was eaten up by a tiger
or something, whatever

01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:12.390
happens to pigs.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:18.790
But if you live far away, how
do I know whether you are in

01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:19.890
trouble or not?

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:26.400
So it tends to be that this is
concentrated among people who

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.220
know each other.

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:30.540
The scope of the insurance
is limited.

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:42.280
And, finally, in some sense,
this is a very bad mechanism

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.650
for dealing with shocks which
affect everybody in the

01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:47.600
village, obviously.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.490
If there is one blight in the
village which affects

01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:53.180
everybody, this is not going to
help anybody because nobody

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.660
can help each other.

01:04:55.660 --> 01:05:00.690
So that takes us back to where
we were at the end of the last

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:03.590
lecture, which is saying on
the other hand, formal

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:06.420
insurance markets are
hard to develop.

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.230
That's where we ended
last time.

01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:10.530
We said formal insurance markets
are hard to develop.

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:11.110
Why?

01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:13.500
Because people are suspicious
of these products.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.700
They don't understand them.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.160
They're too complicated.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.480
They have all these exclusions,
which you don't

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.270
understand.

01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:21.170
So you don't like it.

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:23.680
I was telling the story of all
of these women who got really

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.670
upset because one of their
friend's husband died.

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:30.260
But the medical health insurance
didn't pay for it.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.095
Health insurance was actually
right in not paying for it in

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:36.185
formal terms because their
contract said we'll only pay

01:05:36.185 --> 01:05:37.740
for people who go
to the hospital.

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:39.080
He died at home.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:43.890
But they thought that, well,
something bad happened.

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:45.450
Why aren't you paying for it?

01:05:45.450 --> 01:05:49.820
So they basically
got very upset.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.150
So insurance is confusing.

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:55.610
Formal insurance has rules,
which if you [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:55.610 --> 01:05:56.990
you don't understand.

01:05:56.990 --> 01:06:02.200
It tends to be quite limited
in other ways.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.530
I know a lot about
my neighbors.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:13.290
I know if his cow was eaten up
by a tiger, for example.

01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:16.880
Insurance company doesn't know
anything about my neighbor, so

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.640
it can't insure things
like that.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.950
But there's a very nice story.

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.120
So cow insurance--

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.360
I bring up the example because
it's a good example.

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:35.020
Insuring cows is a big issue
in every developing country

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.990
because cows are
a major asset.

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:40.080
In some countries, like in
Botswana, it's the single

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.910
biggest asset other than
diamonds, it turns out.

01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:45.420
So there only two major
assets in Botswana.

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:48.150
They are cows and diamonds.

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:49.730
But most people have cows.

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:51.880
Very few people have diamonds.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:58.290
So insurance companies have been
trying for a long time to

01:06:58.290 --> 01:06:59.340
insure cows.

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:04.370
The problem is that you insure
cows by saying if the cow

01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:06.380
dies, I'll pay you money.

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:09.190
But it's convenient for
cows to die because

01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:10.970
they turn into steaks.

01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:14.630
And steaks, many people
like them.

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:19.910
So they create a huge moral
hazard problem.

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:23.170
So this company, [INAUDIBLE],
had a very clever idea.

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:28.270
They said that if you claim that
your cow has died, you're

01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:29.870
to bring me the ear
of the cow.

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:37.210
Dead cow, you're to cut his
ear off and show it to me.

01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:39.210
I don't know.

01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:40.460
What happened?

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.230
AUDIENCE: A lot of
earless cows?

01:07:48.166 --> 01:07:51.088
AUDIENCE: So everytime my cow
died I would start cutting off

01:07:51.088 --> 01:07:53.320
ears and creating, like, a
black market [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.420
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.130
So imagine my cow dies.

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:56.630
I'm not insured.

01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:57.820
What do I do?

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.550
I cut off his ear and sell it
to somebody who's insured.

01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:04.210
It created a robust market
for cow ears.

01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:06.360
Everybody was buying cow
ears to go to the

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.070
bank and collect insurance.

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:14.180
So that's your primary problem
with sort of formal insurance.

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.620
They don't know where
the cow died.

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.819
They have to figure out a
way to track that down.

01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:23.760
That's not easy to do because
of this ear problem.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.840
So basically we're between
a rock and a hard place.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.540
People don't understand
insurance.

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:35.330
Insurance is incomplete, at
best, because you can't really

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:36.859
insure cows because
I don't know when

01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:38.420
your cow died or not.

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.979
On the other hand, if we look
at insurance that comes from

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:44.069
the community, the people who
have the information, that is

01:08:44.069 --> 01:08:46.229
too limited for these other
reasons we've discussed.

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:48.779
So we were kind of between
a rock and a hard place.

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:54.560
So I think the message of this
particular area is that this

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.470
is a classic area where a
government providing some kind

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:06.359
of insurance that's not expected
to break even is much

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:07.609
more efficient.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.149
So rather than thinking
of insurance

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:18.340
which is market supplied--

01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:22.104
for example, a government scheme
which says you can come

01:09:22.104 --> 01:09:27.090
to work whenever you need to
work and we'll pay you a

01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:34.290
minimum wage is very
effective because

01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:35.279
the wage is low enough.

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:38.090
You're not ever going
to take that job if

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:44.359
you have a real job.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.689
You only take it when
you're desperate.

01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:50.010
So that's a very efficient
way to provide insurance.

01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:51.810
Now, the problem is
that that's not

01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:53.750
going to fund itself.

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:58.950
It's a one way payment
from the government.

01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:02.490
But on the other hand, it makes
sure that anybody who is

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:05.520
really desperate can
find a job and

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.860
therefore it secures them.

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.370
So in some terms this
is a classic area--

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:11.930
or if you think of insurance
where people don't understand

01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:16.000
the product, well, they don't
want to buy it because they

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:16.820
don't understand the product.

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:18.680
But if you provide it free,
they'll take it.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:23.210
So if the government were to
actually subsidize insurance,

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:25.960
that might be a very good way
to help poor people because

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.730
it's something that they
don't understand

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:29.930
that's good for them.

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:34.090
The demand is too low because
they don't know how to

01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:34.330
interpret it.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:37.970
On the other hand, they will
get the benefits from it.

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:42.430
I think insurance is a very,
very natural place for public

01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:43.680
intervention.

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.680
And I think that's sort of
what makes it really

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.860
interesting is how to design
good insurance products for

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:55.720
poor people which possibly
combine some advantage of the

01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:00.540
market and some advantages
of public funding.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.600
So, for example, instead of
the government providing

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.340
health care, maybe everybody
should have health insurance

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:11.220
with some appropriately
designed coverage.

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.450
And maybe that should be
provided free to people.

01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:15.710
If they don't understand the
value of it, that's fine.

01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:18.660
In the end, sick people are a
burden of the government.

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:23.930
So they might as well
provide it ex-ante.

01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:26.610
Providing a job to everybody--

01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:29.670
work fair is the word people
use in the US--

01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:34.240
to people who want a job is a
way to make sure that people,

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.370
when they're desperate, there's
some way of generating

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:41.050
income and that the wage at that
income doesn't go down

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:43.200
because everybody's
demanding a job.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.470
So in some sense it's a
way to secure people.

01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:49.830
And it's a way to do it
efficiently, to make sure that

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:52.210
the right people go to it.

01:11:52.210 --> 01:11:53.330
You don't want to
give them money.

01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:56.080
You want to give them a job
because a job has the

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.070
advantage that you
get targeted.

01:11:58.070 --> 01:12:00.130
So in some sense it's a
good domain to think

01:12:00.130 --> 01:12:02.190
about public policy.

01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:03.120
I'll stop here.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.590
We might talk a little bit
more about it later.
