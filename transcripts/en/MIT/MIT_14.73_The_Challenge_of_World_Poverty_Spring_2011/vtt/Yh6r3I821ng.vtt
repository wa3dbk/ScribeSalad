00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:31.470
PROFESSOR: A lot of what we
have done, until today, we

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:40.840
sort of assumed, at one place
or another, that the people

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.640
were unable to borrow.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.230
For example, a lot of the
s-shaped problem that we have

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.710
seen along the way, people would
be able to escape from

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.850
them if only they
could borrow.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.740
For example, all of the issues
on risk that we've discussed,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.220
that people have these shocks
and they lose their business.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.170
And that puts them back on the
left part of the curve.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.080
This could be removed if you
were able to borrow your way

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.890
out of these problems.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.700
So when you are in a bad
shock, you borrow.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.180
And when you are in good state,
you reimburse, and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.430
everything is good.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.790
So it seems that we needed to
spend some time discussing.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.190
We can't really take
it as given that

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.090
people can't borrow.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.490
First, because it's not
true, actually.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.300
Poor people borrow a lot.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.900
It depends, a bit, from
country to country.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.270
But in a country like India,
for example, about 70% of

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.530
people will have some loan from
someone, usually not from

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.330
a bank, but from a moneylender
or a shopkeeper or their

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.210
landlord or something
like that.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.180
So there are actually a lot
of lending-borrowing

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.030
relationships around.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.500
So it doesn't seem to be a very
good assumption to start

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.830
with the idea that people
can't borrow.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.810
Secondly is, even if they
couldn't borrow, we want to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.740
spend some time and
try to understand

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.490
why that's the case.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.660
So in a sense, we could have
done this many lectures ago.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.360
But finally, we are now getting
the crux of this

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.610
borrowing question.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.070
What the newspaper article, for
today, made kind of clear

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.970
is that this is one way, one
reason why you should be

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.320
interested in these things or
you might be interested in

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.570
this things.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.040
Microcredit is being discussed
a lot these days.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.190
Has anyone heard what is
happening to Yunus these days?

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.075
Have any of you heard like
what's the situation?

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.916
Sorry?

00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:51.850
AUDIENCE: Did you say, Yunus?

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.450
PROFESSOR: Yunus, yeah.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.856
What's happening with Yunus?

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:56.172
AUDIENCE: I don't know the
details, but he's kind of

00:02:56.172 --> 00:02:58.587
getting pushed out of the
organization that he started,

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:02.460
Grameen, the microfinance
banking [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.750
PROFESSOR: Right, so he's being
pushed out of Grameen on

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.700
sort of technical reasons.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.540
I mean it's not.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.540
He is older than 70.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.170
And then the government is
arguing that Grameen is a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.320
public bank, because
the state owns some

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.370
parts of the capital.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.120
But a very small part,
because Grameen is

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.446
largely held by the borrowers.

00:03:21.446 --> 00:03:23.700
They're now trying
to push him out.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.940
And at the same time, there is
a discourse along the line

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.030
that, ooh, maybe microcredit is
not all that its cracked up

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.010
to be, et cetera.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:40.870
This follows a big event in
India, in November, where, in

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.980
Andhra Pradesh, one of the hot
beds of microfinance in India,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.730
the government decided that
it was now illegal to--

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.440
issued and ordinance saying
that it was illegal to ask

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.210
people to repay in the absence
of the local mayor.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.120
So given that the local mayor
are not always in the field,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.120
always present, et cetera, that
turns out to be a pretty

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.420
big constraint.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.590
So all the repayments stopped
to microfinance agencies in

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.710
Andhra Pradesh, in November.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.460
And to this day, they haven't
really restarted.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.320
And in the context of that, you
have had a lot of articles

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.149
in the press about maybe
microcredit is actually bad,

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.300
maybe microcredit is
the new usury.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.980
But I don't want to go into the
details of whether it's

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.380
good or bad now, because you're
going to do it in the

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.140
next lecture.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.500
What I want to do is to give
us some tools, today.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.350
So it's going to be a little bit
more theoretical lecture

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.460
than usually.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.920
I want to give us some tools
to try to understand why it

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.300
might be difficult for the poor
to borrow, why the poor

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.460
might face higher interest
rates, and what microcredit

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.750
has done that can partially
solve this program or why it

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.460
doesn't solve them
fully, et cetera.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.282
That's kind of where
we're heading, now.

00:05:01.282 --> 00:05:04.770
So maybe we can start with some
facts that it's good to

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.550
have in mind.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.820
And then we are going to have a
series of simple models that

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.790
we are going to try to
apply to these facts.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.730
So the first fact is that most
of the poor do not have access

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.690
to any kind of formal credit,
excluding microfinance, which

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.150
reaches about 200 million
people worldwide.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.480
So most of the poor don't borrow
from a bank or from a

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.010
credit union or something
like that.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.360
There are some numbers that are
coming from the the data

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.520
set on the life of the
poor, under $1 a day.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.470
You see, on the left side,
the fraction of

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.480
people who have a loan.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.570
And you see that it's
not nothing.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.110
Actually, the number
six is wrong.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.520
It's more.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.350
60% of people had a loan in
India, Cote d'Ivoire, 31%, 12%

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.375
in Indonesia, 93% in Pakistan.

00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:00.710
Yeah?

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.410
AUDIENCE: Why is there is such
a big discrepancy between--

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.770
or why [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.260
informal market in Pakistan?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.275
PROFESSOR: So first, what
you notice is that

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:13.780
everywhere you have.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.840
The fact that a lot of the
loans that people.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.070
So there are two facts in this
corner-- or three facts.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.460
One is that it is not that
credit access is 0 in most

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.110
countries, except in Panama,
where it's pretty low.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.130
The second fact is maybe what
you were talking about, that

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.220
there is a lot of viability,
where in a place like Pakistan

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.000
or India-- once the typo
is corrected--

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.130
you have an enormous amount of
lending, like 93% of people

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.830
have a loan.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.000
And the third fact is that these
loans are mostly not

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.330
from the formal sector, with
the possible exception of

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:57.520
Indonesia, that has 25%
of loans coming

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.980
from the formal sector.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.660
Do you want to re-ask your
question to make sure then?

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.436
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean, just
Pakistan has such percentage

00:07:03.436 --> 00:07:05.121
of individual with loans.

00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:09.504
I mean it would be more
understandable that fraction

00:07:09.504 --> 00:07:11.939
of loans coming from a bank in
a country that doesn't have

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.400
that much lending would be
lower, just because there

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.390
isn't that much opportunity.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.324
What surprises me is how low the
fraction of loans that are

00:07:17.324 --> 00:07:19.565
coming from a bank, given
how many individuals

00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:20.810
have loans at all.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.798
So I was wondering if there is
a reason that that's the case

00:07:23.798 --> 00:07:26.860
in Pakistan or is
it an anomaly?

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.500
PROFESSOR: So in a sense,
we could ask the

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.710
question two ways.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.480
Why is the informal loan market
so particularly active

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.830
in Pakistan?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.920
Or why is the formal
market so absent?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.230
And I think the first question,
in a sense, is the

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.790
way to ask it.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.730
Basically, in Pakistan, there
is not much more formal

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:53.080
lending then in a place like,
say, Cote d'Ivoire.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.620
But there is much more informal
lending, so there is

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.420
much more activity.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.820
That varies a lot.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.520
That varies from country
to country.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.480
Within countries, it also varies
from place to place.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.120
And it also varies even within
a village, within a region.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.710
Who has access to credit, who
doesn't have access to credit

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.080
also varies.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.000
So I can't really answer the
question, right now.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.270
But I'm sort of hoping that,
by the end of the lecture,

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.520
we'll have some elements that
we can apply back to saying,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.252
why are things different
in Pakistan ?

00:08:25.252 --> 00:08:25.590
Yeah?

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.824
AUDIENCE: What's the percent
of people with a loan

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:30.680
[INAUDIBLE] in developed
countries?

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.434
PROFESSOR: What's the percentage
of people with a

00:08:32.434 --> 00:08:33.760
loan in developed countries?

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.059
I think it would be very,
very, very high.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:40.010
Because, as soon as you have a
credit card, you have a loan.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.230
So I think, as a fraction of
adults, that it would be

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.210
pretty close to one,
I would say.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.330
You're absolutely right.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.630
I don't know if this is
what you had in mind.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.840
But this is lower than in
developed countries.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.210
And what is particularly
striking is the low access to

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.875
any kind of formal lending.

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.845
AUDIENCE: How would it look
different if it was urban

00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:07.835
instead of rural households?

00:09:07.835 --> 00:09:09.815
Because like Panama
is really weird.

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.810
It must be [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.060
PROFESSOR: Few people
living [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.350
In the same table, we also have
the urban households.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:25.140
They will have more loans
and more informal loans.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.710
So the ratio of informal to
formal in urban households is

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.410
actually not that different
from what it is here.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.150
You have more loans and more
informal loans and more formal

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.000
loans, with a ratio--

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.670
to my knowledge--

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.590
remaining more or
less constant.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.930
That's the first fact, a fair
amount of loans but very few

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.780
formal loans.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.030
The second fact is more
like a history fact.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.880
Governments have tried,
historically, to do

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.680
something about it.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.000
So in the 1960s and the 1970s,
many governments of developing

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.540
countries, in India, in Brazil,
in Colombia, in Peru,

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:14.660
in Mexico tried to either force
or subsidize the banks,

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.650
either public banks or
government banks, to go and

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.150
lend to the poor.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.400
So in India, for example, the
way it happened is, first, the

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.700
banks were nationalized, by Mrs.
Gandhi, during the same

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.625
period as The Emergency.

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:33.470
They were nationalized
in two waves.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.780
And then the banks, irrespective
of whether they

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.580
were nationalized or not, were
then told that they could not

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.390
open a branch in a town if they
did not open, at the same

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.730
time, four branches in
rural areas that were

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.430
not previously served.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.900
So as the bank tried to expand
in an urban area, where they

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.250
had a market, they had to
expand in rural areas.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:03.810
And moreover, to this day, banks
were given rules about

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.190
how their portfolio needed
to be allocated.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.350
So you have a rule called a
priority sector rule, saying

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.600
that the bank must lend 40%
of their portfolio to the

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.260
priority sector.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.040
The priority sector is
small enterprises

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.420
in the rural sector.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.180
And within priority sector,
they need to do at least a

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.190
fraction to the rural sector.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.510
So both of these things are
forcing the banks to go into

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.610
the rural areas and then forcing
them to balance their

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.900
portfolio this way and capping
the interest rate up, capping

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.670
the interest rate that
they could charge.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.350
It had the result that loans
were pushed to farmers and

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.860
things like that.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:48.640
But those loans were rather a
disaster, with very, very high

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.910
default rates.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.120
So a lot of people never
reimbursed their loans.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.930
And eventually, they became more
like a political giveaway

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.980
rather than a credit program.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.020
So it became sort of expensive,
inefficient way to

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.420
give people money as opposed
to a real credit program.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.570
Let's give you one illustration
of a political

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:11.650
giveaway, which is a paper by
Shawn Cole, which looks at

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.050
what he calls lending cycle.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.970
You're missing something
important, which is what is on

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:21.900
the x-axis, over here, is the
year until the next election.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.952
So this is the year.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.460
There is an election about
every five years.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.870
So this is saying this
is the year just

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.730
before the next election.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.280
And what you're seeing is that
the year before an election,

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.780
you get a huge boost in
lending, suddenly.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.050
And this is for public banks.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.550
And if we look at private
banks-- there are a few left--

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.830
you don't have these political
lending cycle.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.410
And another thing that he has,
which is interesting, is that

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.940
you get more of this boost in
swing districts, in districts

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.670
that are where the margin of
victory in the previous

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.980
election was low, then in safe
districts, where it's pretty

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.845
clear who was going to
win the election.

00:13:01.845 --> 00:13:02.180
Yeah?

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.380
AUDIENCE: I might
have missed it.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.321
So why is there more lending
before an election?

00:13:06.321 --> 00:13:09.123
Is that because after the person
gets elected, everyone

00:13:09.123 --> 00:13:10.060
just defaults [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.590
PROFESSOR: So remember all of
the facts that I just said.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.090
You get more lending just
before the election.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.450
It's only public banks.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.280
And it's only in swing
districts, in districts where

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.010
the margin of victory in the
previous election was close.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.212
So why do they lend more?

00:13:25.212 --> 00:13:27.180
AUDIENCE: They borrow
[INAUDIBLE], because the

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.640
candidates will make a promise
that they'll [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.600
don't have to pay [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.720
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.160
The default rate is
so high that loans

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.675
are pretty much gifts.

00:13:39.675 --> 00:13:43.105
So if you give more of it, than
it's like vote buying

00:13:43.105 --> 00:13:45.180
kind of activities.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:45.620
Yeah?

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.500
AUDIENCE: Could you
go back to the

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.320
previous slide for a second?

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.940
Why is it 0, negative
0.1, negative 0.2?

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.415
PROFESSOR: So 0 is just
a normalization.

00:13:55.415 --> 00:13:56.755
So it starts at 0.

00:13:56.755 --> 00:13:58.940
It is saying that any year that
is not a year just before

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.560
the election is below.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.620
Because this is to show, in
relation to that year, the old

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.320
one is negative.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.705
An you have the little
standard errors on

00:14:09.705 --> 00:14:11.660
the side, as well.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.330
Good question.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.540
Whatever the level is,
he's normalized them.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.850
So basically, that is telling
you that even

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.180
if you had the effort.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.190
It's not that Grameen's
didn't try.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.870
But in India--

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.340
and then it's also the case
in other countries--

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.290
eventually, they stopped trying
to at least use these

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.170
banks as banks.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.410
They are more used as like
pushing money away.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.240
Eventually, in India, they
decided to shut down the

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.750
social banking program
in the early 1990s.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.600
Now the banks that don't have
to start in rural areas.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.940
They still have the priority
sector rules, but they don't

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.290
have to start in rural areas.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:57.650
So that's the fast fact of two
halves of a fact, very little

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:06.420
formal lending and rather not
very good performances in the

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.620
effort to lend to the poor.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.730
The second fact, so people, when
they access loans, access

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.230
them mostly from the
informal sector.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.180
And the second fact that is
important is that loans are

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.570
available in the informal
sector, but the interest rates

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:29.770
are very high, very high and
very variable, which is going

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.330
to be our next fact.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:36.140
But just to say very high, the
sort of range where I think

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.620
you would get most of the rates
is between 40% a year to

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.670
200% a year.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:48.400
That's pretty high, if you
compare very, very high

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.130
interest rates on your credit
card, in the US, is of the

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.710
order of maybe 20% a year.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:53.510
Yeah?

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.040
AUDIENCE: So a question I had
while reading the article was,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.984
yes, they're very high,
percentage-wise.

00:15:56.984 --> 00:16:01.170
But if the loan amounts are so
small, like, say, if I were to

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.630
borrow $1 today, I have
to pay $2 tomorrow.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.525
That's a huge percent increase,
but it's not that

00:16:06.525 --> 00:16:08.640
big of an amount.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.197
PROFESSOR: It's not that big
of an amount but from your

00:16:11.197 --> 00:16:12.510
perspective.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.770
It's a very good point.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.480
And we're going to go back to
that, which is the fact that

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.190
it's not that big of an amount
is relevant for the bank, who

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.355
is giving you this money.

00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:26.930
But for you, it just means
that whatever--

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.520
it's still, the interest
rate is very high.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.470
So unless you have a very good
use for this money, the fact

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.470
that it's just $1, yet you have
somehow to find a way to

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.900
transform this $1 into
$2 next year.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.800
We're going to go back
to your point.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.340
From the point of view
of supply, it's

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.910
going to matter a lot.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:47.590
You're going to see that.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.970
It's going to turn out to be one
of the key things, which

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.230
is, because people borrow a lot,
these high interest rates

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.090
are, in a month, a relatively
small part.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.370
But from the point of view of
the borrower, it means that,

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.130
not only they can't borrow much,
but they have to repay

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.349
this huge interest rate.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.440
It comes to the daily rate.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.520
Some people borrow on
the daily market.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.260
For example, food vendors borrow
on the daily market.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.839
A common rate on the daily
market is 5% a day.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:21.740
So do you have like a guess of
what 5% a day is per year?

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.887
An order of magnitude?

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.870
Is it 5% multiplied by 365?

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:36.272
AUDIENCE: No.

00:17:36.272 --> 00:17:37.076
Because it's compounded.

00:17:37.076 --> 00:17:39.900
PROFESSOR: No, because
it compounds.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:45.180
So if it's on the order of the
millions of percentage, it's a

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.780
very, very, very, very, high
interest rate, because it

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.270
compounds it really fast.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:53.400
It's 1.05 to the power of 365.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.500
It's a huge interest rate.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:01.020
That's on the high range
but not uncommon.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.340
There is one study that
I'm going to keep

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.820
returning to, today.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:10.590
It's a lovely study on Pakistan,
where some guy,

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.725
called Aleem, went and talked
to various moneylenders and

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:16.390
collected very detailed data
on their operation.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.130
And for Pakistan, he found that
the interest they charge

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.750
was 79%, almost.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.020
And you could say, well,
this is because their

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.030
own money is expensive.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.810
But they're own cost
of capital is 33%.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.730
So their own money is expensive,
because they are

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.920
probably borrowing from the
bank or borrowing from

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.730
somewhere at some high cost.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.260
But there's still a big wedge
between the cost of capital,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.000
for them, and what they
charge the lender.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.870
So that's fact two.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.600
Keep in mind, high
interest rate.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.020
Fact three is these interest
rates are not only high,

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:56.990
they're very variable, even
within the same village.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:05.160
So if you go back to the Aleem
study, the mean was 79%.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.090
The standard deviation is 38%.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:14.740
Which means that the 95%
confidence interval includes a

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.590
very low number, like 2%
a year, and a very high

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.460
number, like 150%.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.060
So it means you see, pretty
frequently, in the same

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.990
village, people borrowing at
very, very different traits.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.720
So that is a certain other fact
we have to have in mind.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.205
Yeah?

00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:35.115
AUDIENCE: Was that huge range,
is that a reflection, then,

00:19:35.115 --> 00:19:38.510
that lenders are really adept
at calculating, precisely,

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.390
someone's actual likelihood
of repayment or is that

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.875
favoritism?

00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:43.845
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:19:43.845 --> 00:19:45.800
So we'd have to understand
like how come

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.050
this can be so variable?

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.930
Is it likely that the likelihood
of repayment can

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.970
explain such a big range
or do we have to

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.680
think about other things?

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.970
And if it's where the likelihood
of repayment, can

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.220
it explain that much
difference?

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.590
AUDIENCE: Is this taking into
account the fact that if the

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.484
lender had a spell, then he
gets paid more, because he

00:20:07.484 --> 00:20:10.820
needs more money?

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.670
PROFESSOR: No.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.980
That's the average rate
that they charge.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.850
These are really moneylenders,
like professional

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:19.120
moneylenders.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:25.280
So I think what you're referring
to is, sometimes,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.460
when people lend to each other,
say, you know, you and

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.710
I lend to each other.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.770
Because you have had a bad time,
I lend you some money.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.860
And then when I get better, you
lend me some money when

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.550
you get better.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.160
When you see people doing that
informally, what you're seeing

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.590
is that people tend to pay
higher interest rate when

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.830
they're doing well and lower
when they're doing poorly.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:51.950
But also, they tend to pay
higher interest rates when the

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.220
people who have lent them
money are doing poorly.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.760
And they pay higher interest
rate when the lender is doing

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.080
poorly and lower interest rate
when the lender is doing well.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.930
So the former could be just,
because I don't have money, I

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.000
can't reimburse.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.250
The latter is a sign that people
sometimes use this

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.370
informal lending between each
other as a way of smoothing

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.620
consumption.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:19.940
So we can remove that.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.710
These are more like a way of
insuring, mutually insuring,

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.420
like you saw in the
last few lectures.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.810
Where these are like
professional moneylenders that

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:29.690
are charging different rates.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.140
So maybe we need to go back
to your question.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:38.580
Is it the case that that can be
explained by the ability to

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.340
repay or do we need to bring
in some more things, like

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.240
favoritism, social
relationships, what have you?

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.300
So let's keep that in mind.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:52.230
We now have three, very little
formal lending, high interest

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.316
rates, very variable
interest rates.

00:21:55.316 --> 00:22:01.110
The fourth fact, one of the
dimension of variation is how

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.990
rich you are.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:07.850
So the rich have larger loans,
and they pay lower rates.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:17.015
So here's one fact for all of
India showing that the range

00:22:17.015 --> 00:22:22.645
for the landless is between 28%
and 125% interest rate, so

00:22:22.645 --> 00:22:25.630
again, this wide range with a
pretty high interest rate.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.840
And the range for the people
who have land is

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.530
between 21% and 40%.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.510
So its both a smaller range,
and it doesn't include the

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.320
very high value.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.990
So the rich tend to pay-- and
is this is just one fact.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.800
But we can accumulate
these facts.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.310
That's kind of a representative
fact of that.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.720
Yeah?

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.210
AUDIENCE: To some degree, that
variation is to be expected

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.202
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:50.700
loan.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.186
So therefore, if it is a smaller
loan, then, of course,

00:22:54.186 --> 00:22:56.710
the percent interest rate
is going to be higher.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:57.210
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:01.215
So to what extent can this be
explained by fixed costs?

00:23:01.215 --> 00:23:02.900
That's the question we'll
ask in a minute.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.190
I think you're exactly right.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.810
And that goes back
to [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:09.200
point earlier, that fixed
costs will play a role.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:18.870
The issue we are going to ask
is, why is it the case that,

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.310
even if there is a relatively
small fixed cost, that

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.460
translates into such large
differences in

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.620
the interest rate?

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.970
And we're going to see that.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:26.770
But you're exactly right.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.430
That's exactly the intuition
is that it has to be that

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.000
there is some fixed
costs of lending

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.250
buried here, somewhere.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.210
So in that case, there
is this intuition of

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.180
fixed cost we'll explain.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.300
We also, first, have to explain,
why is it the case

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.110
that the rich borrow more?

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.570
After all, it's not because
you're rich that you

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.410
necessarily have better ideas?

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:54.810
So to start with, should we take
it as given that the rich

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.520
should be able to borrow more?

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.030
In a sense, that's something
that's very intuitive,

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:03.620
because, here, too, when you
want borrow to pay for you

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.020
house, they're going to ask you
to pay at least 5% of the

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:08.890
value of the house.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.370
So you can see, immediately,
that the loan you can get is a

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.100
function of how rich you are.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.550
Or your credit is
also like that.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.360
They ask you what is your
income, and they give you a

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.550
credit line that sort of
corresponds to your income.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.430
But if you think for a few
minutes, in principle, where

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.860
is that coming from.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.640
That's another thing we kind
of have to understand.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.830
Does it come from the most basic
model, that the loan you

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.780
can get depends on
how rich you are?

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.370
It's not completely obvious.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.910
And then once we have that, we
need to see, well, does that

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.480
help us explain that the
interest rate also varies with

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.960
how rich you are?

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.290
And that's where the
fixed costs are

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:47.495
going to be very helpful.

00:24:47.495 --> 00:24:48.745
The fifth fact.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.860
The fact that the rich
pay lower interest

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.020
rates, that's true.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.670
And that does seem
to be linked to

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:58.570
how much they borrow.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.860
The size of the loan is
inversely related to the

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.790
interest rate.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.320
So that's kind of the same fact
as before, but it's true

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.790
more generally.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:11.270
For example, in Udaipur, our
famous district in Rajasthan,

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.280
where we did all of these
studies, we also asked people

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.290
whether they borrow and
how much they pay.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:21.380
And basically, the credit for
interest from a loan varied

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.460
for each hectare
that you have.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.410
Actually, that's not a great
fact to illustrate that.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.250
But the interest rate
is also declining in

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.770
how much you've borrowed.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.020
So those two are kind
of related.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.050
And the sixth fact, which we are
going to need to take into

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:44.050
account, is that those high
interest rates are going to be

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.880
difficult to explain,
mechanically, by default.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.050
Because, in fact, people do
not seem to be defaulting.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.355
Default rates are
very, very low.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:02.720
So to summarize, the poor can't

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.060
borrow from formal lenders.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.620
The interest rates are high.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.140
The interest rates
are variable.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.410
The rich borrow more.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.860
People who borrow more pay
lower interest rates.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.930
And the default rates
are very low.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.380
AUDIENCE: Why would a rich
person borrow from an informal

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.350
lender if they could just
borrow from a bank?

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.410
PROFESSOR: Rich meaning
richer.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.550
It doesn't necessarily
mean that they have

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.320
access to the banks.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.140
So the name of the game--

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:33.880
yeah, Ben?

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.820
AUDIENCE: Aren't the rates at
the bank higher than the ones

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.740
that the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.810
PROFESSOR: So this is
not in [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.020
This is in formal lending.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.940
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I mean
informal lending.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.670
PROFESSOR: No, the rates
at the banks

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.090
are much, much lower.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:54.020
If you can get a bank loan,
it's going to be at like,

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.050
nominal, in Indian, 18%
a year maximum.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.210
And then if you could get a
microcredit loan, or you got a

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.500
microcredit loan, the rate would
be about, in India, 24%

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.430
a year, maybe, in Bangladesh,
around this.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.680
It's much higher in Mexico.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.630
The range charted by the
microcredit agency tends to be

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.224
outside this range, closer
to the bank rates.

00:27:23.224 --> 00:27:25.924
AUDIENCE: For the fact the
default rates are low, could

00:27:25.924 --> 00:27:28.625
that be that people don't borrow
if they're desperate?

00:27:28.625 --> 00:27:30.589
Could that also be because
they won't get a loan if

00:27:30.589 --> 00:27:31.571
they're desperate?

00:27:31.571 --> 00:27:34.026
Because they don't have enough
capital, people won't trust

00:27:34.026 --> 00:27:37.850
them enough to loan to them
in the first place.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.598
PROFESSOR: So the default
rates are low.

00:27:40.598 --> 00:27:47.890
And people who borrow are often
people who borrow for

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.500
productive investments,
et cetera.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.590
I think you're exactly right,
that people will try not to

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.510
lend to someone who has a very
urgent need and might not be

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.780
able to reimburse.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.820
So the fact of that the default
rates are low is an

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.950
equilibrium outcome.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.420
It's the result of how the
lender decides to lend his

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.960
money and how much
monitoring they

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.454
are exercising, obviously.

00:28:10.454 --> 00:28:14.918
AUDIENCE: So it would also make
sense to give more loans

00:28:14.918 --> 00:28:17.894
to the rich, because it's not
very profitable, the very

00:28:17.894 --> 00:28:20.208
small loans, if you're going to
get a very small interest

00:28:20.208 --> 00:28:21.862
rate over it at the time.

00:28:21.862 --> 00:28:25.334
And like the money basically
costs you, as a lender, to

00:28:25.334 --> 00:28:28.310
give up that remaining 10th of
a loan to someone, especially

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.740
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.150
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.720
So this is intuition coming
back to the fixed cost.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.980
If the cost of money, for the
moneylender, is proportional,

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.300
he's also paying some interest
rate to a depositor, people

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.950
who are giving money to him.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.050
Or maybe he is getting money
from a bigger moneylender.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:48.000
And so that proportional to
how much he is getting.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.890
So the cost of fund, itself,
is proportional.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:58.960
So the cost of fund would not
explain why a small loan is

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.410
more expensive than
a big loan.

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:04.170
So we have to add something to
that, which is something about

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.960
the cost of administering
the loan.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.410
Exactly.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:10.960
PROFESSOR: So that's exactly
where we're heading.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.390
Yeah?

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:15.665
AUDIENCE: What about default
rates for the poor when

00:29:15.665 --> 00:29:17.565
they're borrowing
from informal?

00:29:17.565 --> 00:29:19.230
PROFESSOR: This is that.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.780
This is what it is.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.372
The default rate for the poor,
when they're borrowing from

00:29:22.372 --> 00:29:25.470
informal sources is very low.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.370
The default rate, from anyone,
when they're borrowing from

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:29.220
the bank, is very high.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.580
But that is because the bank
is largely not a lending

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.095
operation anymore.

00:29:35.095 --> 00:29:37.277
AUDIENCE: Is the reason the
interest rates are different

00:29:37.277 --> 00:29:39.460
in different countries because
the fixed cost environment

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:39.945
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:41.143
PROFESSOR: It might well be.

00:29:41.143 --> 00:29:44.250
And I want to go back to that.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:49.220
So let's write down some models
that formalize a little

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.090
bit the intuitions that
have already come.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.670
So let's start with the
simplest model.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.430
So the name of the game is going
to take these facts and

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.600
write down a model.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.460
The simplest model, with the
fewest assumptions possible,

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:06.200
is going to help us make
sense of the facts.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.970
So let's start with your
14.01 type of model,

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.810
like a basic model.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.320
What should the model be?

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:23.320
Suppose that you have d% risk
of default on any loan, but

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.630
that's do the fact
that someone's

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:26.840
business has collapsed.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.560
It's not that they ran away with
the money or whatever.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.680
It's just something happened.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.380
There business collapsed.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.140
They can't reimburse.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.000
So that's d%.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.710
That is observable
by everyone.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.440
And let's assume that the growth
interest rate is big R,

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:44.000
so that's 1 plus little r.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.920
And suppose that banking
or moneylending is

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.325
a competitive industry.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.570
And so the moneylenders
make no profit.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.045
We're going to return to that,
whether it's a good assumption

00:30:58.045 --> 00:30:59.200
or a bad assumption.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.050
But suppose, for the moment,
that lending is

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.810
a competitive industry.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.430
So we are going to use
a 0 profit condition.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:14.030
So the expected marginal product
of capital has to be 1

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:17.920
minus d times R, So the
depositors, whatever you need

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.430
to set to big R, such that
you're depositor are getting 1

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.040
minus d times R.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.880
So this d is very high.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.940
Then you need to set a higher
interest rate, so that you can

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.870
compensate your depositors.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.260
So that would be your
basic model.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:40.940
Now, let's look at what kind of
facts can it explain, what

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.190
kind of fact can
it not explain.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.100
So we go back to the fact.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.650
Does it have anything to tell
us about formal versus

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:49.900
informal lenders?

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.120
In this model, everything
is seen, observable.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.870
So, in principle, everybody
should be able to lend to the

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.726
poor, formal or informal.

00:32:07.726 --> 00:32:09.887
But this model doesn't tell us
why the banks are not able to

00:32:09.887 --> 00:32:11.137
lend to the poor.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.140
Can it explain high
interest rates?

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.800
And under what conditions
would it explain

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.050
high interest rates?

00:32:22.918 --> 00:32:24.846
AUDIENCE: If under the
assumption that the poor

00:32:24.846 --> 00:32:27.898
default more often than the
rich, then it would make sense

00:32:27.898 --> 00:32:29.680
to charge them a higher
interest rate

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.190
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:35.050
If the default rate was very
high, you would explain the

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.200
high interest rates.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.205
And if they were differently
high for the poor than for the

00:32:41.205 --> 00:32:43.320
rich, you would also explain
that the interest rate paid by

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.460
the rich is higher
than the poor.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.070
So the problem is that you can't
both explain the high

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:51.910
interest rates and the
low default rate.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.960
Given the low default rate,
you should have

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.030
low interest rates.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:59.160
Likewise, given the low and
reasonably similar default

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.110
rate, there is no reason
for the interest

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.520
rate to be very variable.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.660
The interest rate paid by
everyone should be the same.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.580
And there is no reason
for the rich to be

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.700
able to borrow more.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.560
You should be able to borrow
what you need to borrow, as

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.710
long as you're willing
to reimburse.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:22.690
And you should also not be
a lower interest rate.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.180
So that's kind or a long winded

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.300
answer to your question.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.590
Even if the cost of fund is--
maybe the poor want less money

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.060
because they have smaller
projects.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.980
But in that case, if the only
problem is the cost of fund

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.400
multiplied by some chance of
default, then that really

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.640
shouldn't fit the facts.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.320
So we need to introduce
something else to make sense

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:45.980
of this fact.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.182
So I'm going to do
it in two steps.

00:33:48.182 --> 00:33:52.460
First, I'm going to introduce
the possibility that the

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.010
borrower might want to run
away with the money.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:00.040
So they have invested in their
little enterprise.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.650
Their enterprise succeeded.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:06.250
But still they managed to
escape with the money.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:11.460
So imagine that the bank or the
moneylender lends to an

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.850
entrepreneur who has a business,
which will lead the

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:23.170
F of k, when k units of
capital are invested.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.489
So you invest k and
you get F of k.

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:28.340
So supposing you have a little
shop, and you build some

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.850
shelves, and you start
your business, and

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.389
you'll get F of k.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:36.110
So if you already have w, in
order to invest k, you need to

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.460
borrow k minus w, right?

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.790
And then at the end of the
period, you need to reimburse

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.790
k minus w, multiplied by the
growth interest rate, what

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:47.130
you've borrowed plus
the interest rate

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.280
on what you've borrowed.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.679
Everyone's on board with that?

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:57.830
So if we didn't have the chance
that people run away

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.350
with the money, we
would be done.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:05.580
Now, suppose that you could
spend some cost, h, and then

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.300
you could run away
with the money.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.690
And suppose that spending the
cost, h, is not on the amount

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.880
of money you've borrowed, but on
the entire amount of money

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.420
you've invested.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.890
So basically, in order to run
away with the money, you need

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:20.200
to dismantle the shop and then
take it, move away somewhere.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.370
So you need to try to move the
capital, so that's on the

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.650
entire shop you need
to pay the cost.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.340
And that's some cost, h.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.840
And then suppose that you need
to pay some money to your

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.540
depositors.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.510
So the cost of capital is
D, low cost of capital.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:39.530
So if you're the moneylender,
if he gets 1 in capital, he

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:44.680
needs to repay D times 1
at the end of the day.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.400
So let's look at the
borrower choice.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.150
And the end, when he's realized
his money, he has a

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.330
choice between repaying.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:59.560
So if he repays, he will get F
of k, which is what he's made

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:04.320
with his business, minus K minus
w, what he has borrowed,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.540
multiplied by the interest rate,
growth interest rate.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.430
So that's if he decides
to behave.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:16.220
If he decides to run away, he
still gets F of k minus the

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.970
cost of running away.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.730
Now what is the lender
going to do?

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.670
At the end of the day, this
is the choice that

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.200
the borrower has.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.669
What's the lender going to do?

00:36:33.669 --> 00:36:34.128
Ben?

00:36:34.128 --> 00:36:36.882
AUDIENCE: Make R times
k minus w term

00:36:36.882 --> 00:36:38.720
smaller than the hk term.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.040
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.070
He's going to try to make
it worthwhile for

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.890
the borrower to reimburse.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:51.402
So it's going to set R times k
minus w lower than hk, or at

00:36:51.402 --> 00:36:52.652
least equal.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:59.540
That is in order to make it
worth the while for the

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.300
borrower to reimburse.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.470
So suppose we equalize that.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:09.020
We make R times k minus
w equal to h of k.

00:37:11.906 --> 00:37:14.940
That gives us the expression
that's over here, which is k

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:19.780
over w is R times R minus h.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.700
It looks like it's almost
like a movie.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.110
Occasionally, some very, very
noisy guys passing back.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.690
At any rate, so can you discuss,
interpret, a little

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:41.310
bit, this graph,
this equation?

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.680
What is it telling us?

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:52.414
What is it telling us that
is possibly interesting?

00:37:52.414 --> 00:37:54.382
A lot of it's already here.

00:37:57.826 --> 00:37:58.318
Yeah?

00:37:58.318 --> 00:38:00.778
AUDIENCE: You would assume that
then interest rates would

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:02.028
be lower, [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.570
PROFESSOR: They could play with
R. But remember, they

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.930
have the depositors
on the other end.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:21.140
So they don't have much of a
choice for R. So what are they

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.610
going to try?

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:25.780
What's the variable of
adjustment for the lender?

00:38:28.462 --> 00:38:29.810
AUDIENCE: The loan size.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.580
PROFESSOR: It's the loan size.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.210
So what are they going to
do if you're poorer?

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:39.630
AUDIENCE: They'll make the
loan size smaller.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.740
PROFESSOR: They'll make
the loan size smaller.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.880
So R is not really a variable
with which they can play much,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.250
because they have to pay the
depositor on the other end.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.810
So they have to make 0 profit,
otherwise they'll lose money.

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.060
So what they are going to play
with instead is they are going

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.970
to play with the amount
of money that is

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:56.920
being lent to people.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.120
So what this is going to deliver
for you is that you

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.770
can't borrow as much
as you want.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:06.100
You're going to be able to
borrow some multiplier of how

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.490
much money you already have.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:08.310
Yeah?

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:11.372
AUDIENCE: Couldn't they also
play with the cost of leaving,

00:39:11.372 --> 00:39:13.216
like increasing the cost.

00:39:13.216 --> 00:39:16.350
PROFESSOR: Right, they could
also play with h, exactly.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.568
So what does that tell us?

00:39:17.568 --> 00:39:21.380
For example, how could they play
with the cost of leaving?

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.344
AUDIENCE: Regulations,
bankruptcy law.

00:39:23.344 --> 00:39:25.450
PROFESSOR: They could play
with bankruptcy law.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:26.950
And if they're an informal
moneylender?

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:34.160
So if they're informal, in a
village, so they don't really

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.220
have the option of using
the police or whatever,

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.470
what could they do?

00:39:40.513 --> 00:39:41.491
AUDIENCE: Well, if they're all
part of the same village,

00:39:41.491 --> 00:39:44.126
everyone knows one another,
just use the social ties.

00:39:44.126 --> 00:39:45.050
PROFESSOR: They could
use social ties.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:47.038
What else could they do?

00:39:47.038 --> 00:39:48.529
AUDIENCE: They could
beat the person.

00:39:48.529 --> 00:39:50.517
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:39:50.517 --> 00:39:52.505
AUDIENCE: If the person feels
like there will be some

00:39:52.505 --> 00:39:53.996
physical punishment.

00:39:53.996 --> 00:39:57.475
PROFESSOR: Yeah, they could
break people's kneecaps.

00:39:57.475 --> 00:40:02.920
Or at least they could credibly
threaten to make

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.995
people offers that they won't
be able to refuse.

00:40:08.218 --> 00:40:09.212
Lisa?

00:40:09.212 --> 00:40:11.365
AUDIENCE: Which is probably why
in some contexts, or at

00:40:11.365 --> 00:40:13.188
least some historical contexts,
like the mafia and

00:40:13.188 --> 00:40:15.176
organized crime.

00:40:15.176 --> 00:40:15.673
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:40:15.673 --> 00:40:19.670
This is why the mafia is very
well placed to lend to you,

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:24.670
because they can very credibly
commit to go and torture your

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.939
sister and your first born if
you don't send back the money.

00:40:27.939 --> 00:40:28.917
Yeah.

00:40:28.917 --> 00:40:29.406
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:40:29.406 --> 00:40:32.095
Before, we were talking about
why the poor don't tend to

00:40:32.095 --> 00:40:35.029
default on their loans, which
made the first probably not

00:40:35.029 --> 00:40:35.763
really [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:35.763 --> 00:40:38.208
But why were there high
default rates for the

00:40:38.208 --> 00:40:39.458
government loans?

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:44.375
PROFESSOR: We can try and
interpret that in context of

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.980
this model.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.440
Can the government threaten to
go break your kneecaps if you

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.720
don't repay?

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.460
No.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.862
Well, not very effectively.

00:40:54.862 --> 00:40:55.354
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:55.354 --> 00:40:55.846
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:40:55.846 --> 00:40:57.322
AUDIENCE: I said in
Libya they can.

00:40:57.322 --> 00:40:59.290
PROFESSOR: In Libya they can.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.790
I don't know what's the default
rate on Libyan loans,

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:03.400
actually, now that
you mention it.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.140
AUDIENCE: I bet it's
a lot higher now.

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:07.316
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

00:41:07.316 --> 00:41:10.710
But they're credibility of
whether they can threaten

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.695
breaking the kneecaps of people
has certainly gone

00:41:12.695 --> 00:41:18.150
down, since their own kneecaps
are in trouble at the moment.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.280
But that would be one thing.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.560
And another thing, going back
to Svetlana's point, is that

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.050
the bank also knows
people less well.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.470
So it's kind of much easier to
run away with the money of the

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.830
bank, when the bank
officer sits a

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:30.510
little bit farther away.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:31.324
Sorry?

00:41:31.324 --> 00:41:34.320
AUDIENCE: Why don't they just
keep stuff as security?

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:34.730
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:38.330
So they can also.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:43.820
This is like a way of making
things costly is you keep some

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:47.470
amount of money yourself.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.780
You keep some amount of
the money yourself.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:54.570
So it could, here, be that part
of the cost, hk, is that

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.170
part of the capital invested,
in fact--

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.340
this wasn't in the model,
but we could include it.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.940
If you are going to invest that
much in your company, you

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.760
need to give me a bit on the
side, which I'm going to keep

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.300
as a collector for the loan.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.680
So that's a pretty good model.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.110
It explains a number
of things.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:22.060
It explains, in particular, that
the rich can borrow more.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.840
We're taking the fact that
the default is low.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.790
The default rate is low not
because people are very nice,

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:32.120
not because of the kind,
fundamental nature of the

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.910
poor, but because things that
set such that they won't go,

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.000
they won't default.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
It's an equilibrium outcome.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.723
So the rich borrow more.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:46.230
The poor and the rich-- that
should be green-- that the

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.300
formal lender at
a disadvantage.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.230
What we don't really get from
this model is the facts on the

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:54.720
interest rates.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.970
Here, the interest rate is
being pinned down by the

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.175
default rate.

00:42:59.175 --> 00:43:01.090
And it has nothing to
do with how much you

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:03.790
borrow in that model.

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:08.470
So it is neither different for
the poor or for the rich nor

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:16.220
is it higher when you borrow
less nor should it be very

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:21.530
variable nor should it be
particularly high, actually.

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:24.050
The only thing that this model
delivers, which is already a

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:26.880
first thing, is this rationing,
that some people

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.720
won't be able to go as much
as they would want to.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.060
Another thing is that this also
does not deliver another

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.280
fact, that some people might
be unable to borrow at all.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.200
Here, everybody can borrow
just some fraction

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.040
of what they have.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.320
So if you have very
little, you can

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.250
borrow very small amounts.

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:44.610
And if you have a lot, you
can borrow a larger loan.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.940
But everybody has some access.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.920
So that model is missing
something.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.150
Yeah?

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:52.450
AUDIENCE: In this model, if
you're a poor person, isn't

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:56.790
your w lower, so, therfore,
your R would be different?

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:57.890
PROFESSOR: No.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:02.600
The w is lower, therefore, the
k will be lower, but the R

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.090
will be the same.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.440
Because in this model, the R
is entirely pinned down by

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.860
what you have to pay
the depositor.

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.550
So in this model, it's not
going to be any default.

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:14.212
And the only thing that is going
to vary across people is

00:44:14.212 --> 00:44:15.462
the loan size.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:26.300
So we need to introduce one more
thing, which you already

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.580
mentioned, which is the
idea of a fixed fee.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:36.130
We need to introduce that
there is a fixed fee to

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:38.190
administer the loan.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.910
So you already have all
mentioned it as something

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:44.350
rather obvious, so maybe I need
to not spend much time to

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.690
explain why there would
be a fixed fee.

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:51.120
So even a small loan requires
some effort.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.970
So you need to open a
line on your Excel

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:55.940
document for this person.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.700
But more importantly,
you need to go

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.560
and do some due diligence.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:05.050
So Aleem describes how the
moneylenders spend like a

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.730
number of days to--

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.220
I wanted to check the X,
which is it's an X.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.300
But you need to spend like two
or three days, kind of go and

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:18.290
visit the person, figure out
who they are, who their

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:21.760
siblings are, so that you can
go break their kneecaps, and

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.100
what their business is, and
whether they are really

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.100
intending to do the business,
and then some kind of regular

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.620
checking of what's going on.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.740
That's money, time,
and time is money.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.710
So anything you want to do,
it's going to cost you a

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.950
little bit of money.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.500
So it seems kind of.

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.490
[INAUDIBLE], you already
made this point.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:47.420
So it's not very
controversial.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:52.420
But that's going to
play a big role.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.250
We already went through
the intuition.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:57.690
Intuitively, now you have a
fixed cost that you also need

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.290
to recover on the loan.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:03.170
So the interest rate is going
to need to adjust to recover

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:04.850
that fixed cost.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.200
So that's the intuition.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.520
What I want to show you now is
that the interest is going to

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.390
more than adjust one for one.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.630
It's going to adjust
many for one.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:16.420
So a small fixed cost is going
to lead to a big explosion in

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:17.770
interest rates.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:21.370
And let's see how that works.

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:24.300
So we're going to assume that
it's the same thing.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.415
You can run away with the money,
by paying some cost.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.860
So you can run away.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:39.060
So it says, before, you can
decide by running away.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.340
You can decide to run away.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.020
That's the second
equation here.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.160
You could decide to run
away at the end.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.460
So we are going to need to set
how much you can borrow to

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:51.780
make sure that you don't
want to run away.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:55.520
But in addition, you have
to pay some fixed costs,

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.470
otherwise, if I give you the
money without paying the fixed

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:01.490
cost, you can run
away at cost 0.

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:05.170
So you have to pay some fixed
cost on the loan, anyway.

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:09.690
So now, the lender must satisfy
two constraints when

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:15.610
he picks both the interest rate
and the amount he lends.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:18.860
Number one, he needs to still
satisfy the previous

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.840
constraint, which is the amount
lent must not be too

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.290
high to give people the
temptation to run

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:29.210
away with the money.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:33.070
Number two, the amount of
interest that he's collecting,

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:40.050
when he collects, must be
sufficient to cover what he

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:44.180
needs to pay the depositor,
which is D, that's the growth

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.275
interest rate paid
to the depositor,

00:47:46.275 --> 00:47:48.750
plus the fixed cost.

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:52.900
That is the new term, relative
to what we had before.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.760
You OK with these
two equations?

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.030
So we need to manage
these two things.

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:58.560
Now we're going to combine
these two equations.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.330
And when we combine these two
equations, we get that hk must

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:08.920
be equal to D times
k minus w plus c.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.860
That's going to help us pin down
what's the parameter here

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.170
and what's free.

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:17.420
What's the free variable?

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:26.090
D is a choice or is it given
to the moneylender?

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:26.920
AUDIENCE: Given.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:27.860
PROFESSOR: It's given.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.576
How about w?

00:48:29.576 --> 00:48:30.074
AUDIENCE: It's given.

00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:31.070
PROFESSOR: That's given.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:34.458
How about c?

00:48:34.458 --> 00:48:35.412
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.390
PROFESSOR: It's the fixed cost,
so it can't really be

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:40.470
fixed up. h is the other cost.

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:42.050
That's the cost of
running away.

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:43.230
That's also given.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.436
So the only free variable
here is k.

00:48:45.436 --> 00:48:47.991
AUDIENCE: Does c not change
depending on how much money

00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:49.780
the person [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:50.540
PROFESSOR: No, that's
the point.

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.160
It's a fixed cost.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:56.370
So h is the part that
is very relevant.

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:58.590
It's the fixed cost that you
need to pay, regardless, on

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.140
the size of the loan.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:05.140
So in the lending cost, there
is some cost that is fixed.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:05.980
That's c.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.920
It's like going and doing your
two days of due diligence to

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:16.040
know who the guy is and what
is business and stuff.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.670
And h is the variable part.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.420
So the only thing that we have
that is free in this

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.830
equation now is k.

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:30.140
So we can use it to determine
what k is going to be.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:37.560
And k is going to be D times w
minus c divided by D minus h.

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.240
So what happens if dw
is smaller than c?

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:46.813
Yeah?

00:49:46.813 --> 00:49:49.228
AUDIENCE: Then you can't borrow
if it's a negative.

00:49:49.228 --> 00:49:51.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah, then it
would be negative.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:53.840
But if it's 0, you can't
borrow anything.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.840
So now we have a result that is
slightly different than the

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.630
one we had before.

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:00.040
We now have a result where some
people will not be able

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.210
to borrow at all.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:06.890
Some people will not be able
to borrow at all if the

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:10.330
amounts that they could borrow
is too small to cover the

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:12.080
interest rate.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.405
And how does k vary with w?

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.600
It's increasing.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.730
When you're richer, you
get to borrow more.

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:30.190
And with h, it's also
increasing.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:33.830
When you have a negative,
which is under--

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:37.440
if the cost of running away is
bigger, than you also get to

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.570
borrow more.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.660
That's the kneecap argument.

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:46.480
k is divided by something with
a minus is front, so that

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.230
makes it negative.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.870
So that's for the capital.

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:52.020
And now we can go back and look
at the interest rate.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:51:01.240
And so we can replace the value
for k in the interest

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:01.735
rate expression.

00:51:01.735 --> 00:51:06.380
And you get this expression,
which is the interest rate

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:09.970
that someone pays is going to
be-- you can see that people

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:16.660
will pay a higher interest
rate if they borrow less.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.000
People will pay a higher
interest rate when the borrow

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.850
less, simply because the fixed
costs has to be spread over a

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.900
smaller amount of money.

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:30.380
And then if replace what they
can borrow in this expression,

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.710
we're getting the expression
for the interest rate as a

00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:37.330
function of all of the exogenous
stuff in the model.

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:43.750
So what they are paying is the
cost, D, plus c times D minus

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:48.420
h divided by hw minus c.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:53.440
So what you're getting is a
multiplier property, which is

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.760
when you increase the cost to a
depositor by 1, you increase

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.310
the interest rate
by more than 1.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:03.410
Every time you increase the
interest rate paid to the

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:05.660
depositor by 1%, you increase
the interest rate

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.240
by more than 1.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:14.340
And likewise, when you increase
the the fixed cost c

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:19.020
by 1, you increase the
interest rate paid

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.270
by more than 1.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:27.790
And then the last thing you
have is the interest rate,

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:32.050
also, depends on your
wealth and also in

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:33.790
this multiplier way.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:38.230
So now small differences in
the cost of funds, small

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:41.880
differences in the cost of
monitoring the loans, either

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.920
the fixed costs or the variable
costs, or small

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:49.570
differences in wealth are all
things that are going to lead

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:53.190
to big differences in
interest rates.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:54.580
This is what we see
in the math.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.220
But can you think of an
intuition behind this

00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:58.170
multiplier property?

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:00.510
Why do we have this multiplier
property?

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:02.710
Why is it that it's just
not one for one?

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.971
Think of Libya.

00:53:15.971 --> 00:53:18.985
AUDIENCE: People pay the cost
on a risk [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:18.985 --> 00:53:20.650
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:23.870
AUDIENCE: Risk has a cost.

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:24.790
PROFESSOR: That could be true.

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:27.250
But think in the context
of this model.

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:30.690
Without even exiting the model,
what is happening in

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:34.210
this model which tends to set up
anything that will push the

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:38.630
interest rate up a bit, like the
cost of fund or the amount

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:42.770
of you have or the cost of
monitoring or the cost of

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:44.900
running away?

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.090
Anything that will push the
interest rate a bit

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:48.595
with feed on itself.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:55.490
It appears in the math, here,
very clearly, but try to think

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:56.980
of the intuition behind this.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.330
AUDIENCE: As interest rates
increase, there's going to be

00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:06.290
more and more people
susceptible to

00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:07.270
not paying it back.

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:09.066
So therefore, it just
perpetuates the negative

00:54:09.066 --> 00:54:10.210
feedback cycle.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:10.870
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:16.540
So it's not so much more people,
but each person wants

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.650
to run away more.

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:21.480
So when the interest rate
increases, it makes you run

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.850
away more, which is necessary to
increase the interest rate

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:27.577
further, which makes you run
away more, et cetera, et

00:54:27.577 --> 00:54:29.470
cetera, up to the point
where it stabilizes.

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:32.500
And then for some people, it
might never stabilize.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:35.340
And these people will not be
able to borrow at all.

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:41.990
So here you won't be able to
borrow if hw is too small.

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:46.910
If hw is smaller than
c, you won't borrow.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:49.740
The interest rate would
be infinite.

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.460
Because that spiral will
not stabilize.

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.444
For other people, it just
feeds on itself.

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:06.370
So now this model can explain,
pretty much, all of our facts.

00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:12.840
The poor can't borrow from the
formal lenders, while some

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.763
people won't be able
to borrow at all.

00:55:15.763 --> 00:55:19.190
And in particular, people will
be not very able to borrow

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:24.455
from places which are not able
to impose high costs.

00:55:24.455 --> 00:55:28.270
They are just going to not be
able to borrow to the poor if

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:30.440
they want to get
the money back.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.230
The interest rates are high.

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:37.250
That's because if the cost of
fund is D, the interest rate

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:38.870
multiplier relative to
that, so you can

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:40.150
have a big wedge now.

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:41.710
It's not only the
default rate.

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:46.200
It's like all this effort that
you have to pay to get people

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.450
to reimburse.

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.840
The interest rates are
very variable.

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:57.330
And, in part, because, for
example, you know someone a

00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:57.920
little better.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.700
So that goes back to the
question that was before about

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:01.480
favoritism.

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.330
Maybe it's favoritism.

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:03.560
You know them better.

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:07.150
Well, here, if you know someone
better, you can indeed

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:10.240
lend them at lower rates,
because knowing someone

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:14.380
better, maybe, reduces the fixed
cost, c, or maybe it

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:16.420
increases the cost
of running away.

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:20.220
All of this will have big
effect, big jump on the

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:20.830
interest rate.

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:24.170
So you could have very large
variation in the interest rate

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:26.570
as a function of this
h and c, et cetera,

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:27.820
within the same village.

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.490
So that's the interests
are variable.

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:35.970
The rich can borrow more.

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:38.900
That's because what you can
borrow is a function of how

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.780
much wealth you have.

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.220
And the rich pay lower interest
rates, because they

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:43.910
borrow more.

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:45.630
That's because of
the fixed costs.

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:47.330
And that's good to a point.

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:49.700
And that's all in equilibrium.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:51.820
In this model, there are no
defaults, since everything is

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.160
set up to ensure there
is no defaults.

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.340
So the default rates are
nothing but automatic.

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:59.810
They are the result of
people setting the

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:01.700
interest rate that way.

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:06.130
So I think, at an intuition
level, you had seen where this

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:07.040
was coming.

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.490
But you can see that introducing
these fixed costs,

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:15.000
plus this proportional cost of
running away helps us kind of

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.900
cover, pretty much, all
of our bases in terms

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.540
of the basic facts.

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.320
And then we can go a little bit
further, and we can start

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.920
thinking about other things that
we might try to explain

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.120
with this model.

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.940
So moneylenders are close
to the people.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:36.120
So they are the ones who
area able to borrow.

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.840
They are the ones who are
able to punish people.

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:41.160
They are the ones for which
the fixed cost is lower.

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.300
They may be able
to impose large

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:47.320
penalties, like the mafia.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:51.530
An example we have in the book
is, in India, people called

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:55.660
Kabuliwala are the moneylenders
or were the

00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:56.770
moneylenders of choice.

00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:58.170
I don't know if they
are still there.

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:01.370
Kabuliwala, the men from Kabul,
who had this reputation

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:03.290
of being very fierce.

00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:07.600
So every like Indian child read
the story about the man

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:12.270
from Kabul, with his tender
heart, but who ends up killing

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:17.160
someone, because that person
has treated them badly.

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.445
And so you would see a villager
telling this story.

00:58:20.445 --> 00:58:24.670
Or you would see these guys
coming under the pretense of

00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:30.010
selling you dried fruits and,
in fact, being moneylenders.

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:34.020
Because they are the ones who
you knew that they would be

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:38.790
able to get at you, with a very
persuasive argument, if

00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:41.151
you were not going to
be able to lend.

00:58:41.151 --> 00:58:43.367
AUDIENCE: I've only read the
article so far, so this might

00:58:43.367 --> 00:58:46.480
be in the book, and I
don't know this yet.

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:49.532
I was a little curious about
why the banks never work

00:58:49.532 --> 00:58:50.690
directly with these people?

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:52.180
Is it like a liability thing?

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.206
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:58:53.206 --> 00:59:00.010
So there's an example of that
where Citibank, in India,

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:02.600
decided that, why wouldn't
they use these guys.

00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:08.290
So they tried to use the kind
of local thugs to repossess

00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:10.280
their car loans.

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.800
But once it got found
out, like they

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.340
ran into big trouble.

00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:19.160
And they had to stop
that operation.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.950
And it's not clear whether or
not it's welfare increasing to

00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:25.310
forbid Citibank to use
the goondas to

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:26.690
recover their car loans.

00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:27.500
But they tried.

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:30.790
And then they ran into problems
with the law.

00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:33.200
So it turns out that it's not
legal to kill people who don't

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.140
reimburse your loan.

00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.260
So that was the problem,
exactly.

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:40.610
That's a good point.

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:47.220
There is another anecdote in the
book about formal banks--

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:49.340
I don't remember if
it was Citibank--

00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:53.560
threatening to send
people eunuchs.

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:57.730
Because, in India, eunuchs
showing their private parts is

00:59:57.730 --> 01:00:03.630
supposed to be like
a bad omen.

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:07.410
So the thing is, pay up,
or we'll send the

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:09.495
eunuch to see you.

01:00:09.495 --> 01:00:11.300
AUDIENCE: Did you say, eunuch?

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.290
PROFESSOR: I don't know how--

01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:12.840
eunuchs.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.370
AUDIENCE: You know, eunuch.

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:17.264
PROFESSOR: Eunuch, eunuchs.

01:00:17.264 --> 01:00:19.195
AUDIENCE: So it's just like
their presence is considered

01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:21.570
like threat in itself?

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:22.820
PROFESSOR: Their exposition.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.835
If they expose their
private parts, it's

01:00:27.835 --> 01:00:30.652
supposed to be bad.

01:00:30.652 --> 01:00:33.634
AUDIENCE: Seriously, the banks
were hiring people to flash

01:00:33.634 --> 01:00:35.622
themselves?

01:00:35.622 --> 01:00:37.113
PROFESSOR: Not people,
eunuchs.

01:00:37.113 --> 01:00:40.592
I mean, people who
are eunuchs!

01:00:40.592 --> 01:00:43.077
Not just anybody.

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.205
Not anyone.

01:00:47.205 --> 01:00:48.510
It's a very specialized
industry.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.480
So that explains why the

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.720
moneylenders have a good business.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.030
Basically, it's a bit like,
you have to resort to very

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.920
complicated stuff.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.260
If you're a bank, you
can't threaten to

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.960
kill people, et cetera.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.180
So the moneylenders
are well placed.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.780
The problem, however, is that
moneylenders don't have,

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:15.390
themselves, access to
very cheap funds.

01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:19.720
Because if you have savings,
maybe giving them to a

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:23.880
moneylender is not the best
thing you can do.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.880
So moneylenders, themselves,
they're cost of fund is high.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.700
And there is also a multiplier
on the cost of funds, which

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.226
explains why the interest
rates are high.

01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:38.580
So you'd explain why you have a
moneylender doing a good job

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:40.750
and why their interest
rates are so high.

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:43.690
So it is not entirely clear,
when you're talking about

01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:48.530
driving them away, that they
are necessarily bad people

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:50.440
trying to exploit the poor.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.480
They also have their own cost of
funds that it is expensive.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.330
And then they are trying to
make a living in this way.

01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:57.324
Yep.

01:01:57.324 --> 01:01:59.312
AUDIENCE: Well, if formal
institutions can't work

01:01:59.312 --> 01:02:02.791
directly with the poor borrowers
and enter that

01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:06.270
interaction, why can't they work
with the moneylenders,

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:07.761
since those would borrow
larger sums?

01:02:07.761 --> 01:02:13.725
And they could be like a private
person who would just

01:02:13.725 --> 01:02:15.961
decides to borrow from someone
and later decides to do

01:02:15.961 --> 01:02:16.707
something with it.

01:02:16.707 --> 01:02:18.210
Why can't that [INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:20.837
PROFESSOR: I think, in a lot
of cases, it's sort of

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:23.780
happening, which is the
moneylender is like a big

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:29.140
landlord, who will take
a loan from the bank.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.540
So I think part of the money
that the moneylender is

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:34.480
getting is precisely coming
from the bank.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.780
So that intermediation exists.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.900
Maybe not be officially,
because moneylending

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.990
is often not legal.

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:45.770
But they just go and they
borrow some money.

01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:47.258
And then they relend it.

01:02:47.258 --> 01:02:48.512
And that's it.

01:02:48.512 --> 01:02:51.227
AUDIENCE: How do these rates
change with the objective of

01:02:51.227 --> 01:02:54.591
the lending institutions and
the objective of the people

01:02:54.591 --> 01:02:55.769
who are receiving the loans?

01:02:55.769 --> 01:02:59.546
So if there was a social
purpose, as opposed to a

01:02:59.546 --> 01:03:03.784
for-profit purpose, then the
spread would be smaller.

01:03:03.784 --> 01:03:07.053
You'd be trying to break even
versus trying to make some

01:03:07.053 --> 01:03:09.390
income off of the person
you're lending to.

01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:12.300
And I also imagine, if you're
lending to someone who is just

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.050
trying to smooth their
consumption, they'd be more

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:17.900
likely to pay you back then if
you were lending to someone

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.530
who was trying to start a
business then, who's success

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.380
rate might also be low.

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.255
PROFESSOR: So in this particular
model, we have

01:03:25.255 --> 01:03:26.550
assumed-- and, in fact,
I'm going to come back

01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:28.010
to that in a moment--

01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:29.670
that there is perfect
competition between

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:31.880
moneylenders.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.650
So people, are here,
breaking even.

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:38.060
So in that sense, you can't do
better from that without

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.110
starting to lose money.

01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:42.800
However, you're exactly right
that someone could decide that

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.940
it is worthwhile for them
subsidize the interest rate.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:49.020
For example, you are
like an NGO.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.430
And you want to do something
good for the poor.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:54.210
You could decide that you're
going to want to subsidize the

01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:56.140
interest rate, a bit.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:00.955
And then you're going to benefit
from the multiplier

01:04:00.955 --> 01:04:03.440
rate the other way.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:09.080
So if you were good at it, if
someone had the local presence

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.570
and were able to replicate
what the moneylenders are

01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:16.000
doing, in terms of lowering the
rate of running away with

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.870
the money and lowering the fixed
cost of lending, and

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:21.400
they combined that with some
subsidies of the interest

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:26.750
rate, then the multiplier would
play in your favor.

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:31.370
And that's where the microcredit
comes in.

01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:36.530
When we talk about microcredit,
in a way, they

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:39.510
are still, say, trying
to break even.

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:42.850
Or they might even be willing to
lose a little bit of money.

01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:45.370
And this losing a little bit of
money might translate into

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:47.700
a large drop in the
interest rate.

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:48.410
You're exactly right.

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:51.820
If you're willing to, any profit
that you're going to

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:56.970
give away might translate into a
lot of money saved, from the

01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:58.570
point of view of the lender.

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:02.560
You're also right on the other
end, which is all of these

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.900
things depend on the propensity
of people to run

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.880
away and things like that.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.490
If you could identify good
borrowers that are not going

01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:13.030
to default, they are borrowers
with a big h, in a sense.

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:14.960
And there are borrowers
you could lend to

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.210
with a lower rate.

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:19.830
The problem is, for the
moneylender or for the bank,

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:22.170
is whether they can identify
people with a low

01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:24.472
or high h or not.

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:33.560
In this world, you would
have what you see with

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.070
moneylenders, which is
moneylenders that charge very

01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:38.820
high rates, get very low
defaults, in equilibrium, they

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:42.140
don't need to break anybody's
kneecap, as long as it's known

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.630
that that's what would happen.

01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:51.550
Another story about the
moneylenders, however, is that

01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:58.720
it is not that they just have to
charge this high rates and

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.330
variable rates because of the
fixed cost of lending and

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:05.230
monitoring the loans,
but because they

01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:07.850
are monopoly lenders.

01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:11.560
So that's another thing that you
often hear is that these

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:16.560
guys, it's one game in
town in the village.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.430
They are the only one who can
lend the money to you.

01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:22.890
And therefore, they are just
charging you this huge rate,

01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:27.060
just because they are the
only possibility.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:32.380
And you have two facts
when trying to

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:33.700
evaluate these claims.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.220
You have two facts which are
pulling in slightly different

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.580
directions.

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.640
One fact is that, usually, in a
village, you have more than

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.270
one moneylender.

01:06:42.270 --> 01:06:44.580
You could have at least like
four or five moneylenders,

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:47.730
which are like the shopkeeper
and then the guy

01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:50.170
who has a big land.

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:54.060
And two or three people like
that will be moneylenders.

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:57.580
So in principle, there is
competition between them.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:02.420
However, you don't see
people switching.

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:06.120
So people usually stick
to the same person.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.190
So it is not clear in the end.

01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:13.550
Is it a competitive situation,
because, in principle, you

01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:14.790
have a choice?

01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:17.640
Or is it a monopoly situation,
because, in practice, you

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.430
don't switch?

01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:23.120
So what's your view of how we
can try and explain that, by

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.900
just enriching this
model just a bit?

01:07:33.648 --> 01:07:36.078
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm not sure how
to incorporate this, but I

01:07:36.078 --> 01:07:37.050
can think of two facts.

01:07:37.050 --> 01:07:41.106
First, the person who borrows
needs to have some trust for

01:07:41.106 --> 01:07:45.552
the moneylender, in the sense
of like the moneylender says

01:07:45.552 --> 01:07:48.516
you have to pay this interest
rate and then doesn't raise it

01:07:48.516 --> 01:07:50.986
immediately when you actually
go to repay.

01:07:50.986 --> 01:07:53.456
And that requires some costs
to establish this

01:07:53.456 --> 01:07:53.950
relationship.

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:57.408
Then there's also some cost to
switching, again, to establish

01:07:57.408 --> 01:07:58.890
this relationship with
another moneylender.

01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:01.456
But there might be the trade-off
that you hear, from

01:08:01.456 --> 01:08:03.151
other people, that the other
moneylender charges

01:08:03.151 --> 01:08:05.960
significantly lower rates
or something like that.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.970
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:09.490
So if evaluate on the cost
of switching-- yeah?

01:08:09.490 --> 01:08:12.168
AUDIENCE: Didn't you also say
that the c would decrease if

01:08:12.168 --> 01:08:13.386
you stayed with the
same moneylender?

01:08:13.386 --> 01:08:16.308
Because they don't need
to recheck you out.

01:08:16.308 --> 01:08:19.230
So in the future, they can
charge you the lower rate

01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:21.670
because of this.

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:21.830
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:22.992
So there could be.

01:08:22.992 --> 01:08:26.970
You see, this cost of switching,
part of it is the

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.310
guy trying to figure
out who you are.

01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:33.990
So we can think a part of
the c as being paid

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.950
once and for all.

01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:37.790
And then maybe you're paying c
again every time you borrow.

01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:42.439
But a part of the c might be,
maybe, paid once and for all.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:50.210
Now, it means that, if you want
to switch, you would need

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:53.300
pay this c again.

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:56.290
So number one, that would mean
that you would pay a higher

01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:57.310
interest rate.

01:08:57.310 --> 01:09:01.939
Number two, on the other hand,
the lender, to whom you are

01:09:01.939 --> 01:09:05.029
coming, he's going to wonder
about, why is it

01:09:05.029 --> 01:09:06.789
that they are switching?

01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:14.260
If the c has been paid, once and
for all, you should want

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:16.300
to stay with your moneylender.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.880
If you're not, it might mean
that you have something

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.410
suspicious about you.

01:09:22.410 --> 01:09:26.109
So here, in this model, we have
only included a moral

01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:28.950
hazard that is the probability
of running

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:30.520
away with the money.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.910
But there could be an element
of adverse selection.

01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:37.810
There could be some people who
are more likely to run away or

01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:39.029
less likely to run away.

01:09:39.029 --> 01:09:42.189
And you just don't
know as a lender.

01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:44.189
And you need to investigate.

01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:47.720
Now, if you're trying to
switch from an existing

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.550
lender, lending relationship,
which, in principle, gives you

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:55.880
these lower rates, it might be
because you have something to

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.270
hide about what your cost is.

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:02.780
So the resenting moneylender is
going to think that you are

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.100
a high risk kind of a guy.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.350
So he's either going to spend
even more effort checking you

01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:10.425
out, or he's going to charge you
higher rate and lend you

01:10:10.425 --> 01:10:15.210
less money to correspond to
the most risky people.

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:20.160
So because of that, the fact
that you are switching,

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.830
because it might signal that
you're a bad type, makes it

01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:26.570
even less likely that
you'll switch.

01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:31.920
So if we add a layer of like
adverse selection.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.240
You know about yourself
than the lender

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.420
knows, which is realistic.

01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:40.450
Then that will make switching
unlikely.

01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:44.040
That means that you're stuck in
your existing relationship,

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:49.120
which means that the lender will
try to exploit the fact

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.580
that you're stuck into this
existing relationship.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:55.990
He will say, well, staying with
me brings you a surplus.

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:59.670
I'm going to extract some of
that surplus from you, which

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:01.910
means that, even though there
is a lot of competition,

01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:05.140
ex-ante, ex-post, you might
be stuck in a one on one

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.890
exploitative relationship.

01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:08.730
So that's why we can have
these kind of two things

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:11.310
together, of a lot of
competition and, at the same

01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:14.240
time, this one on one monopoly
relationship.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:14.670
Yeah?

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.390
AUDIENCE: For all this to hold
true, it must be true that

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:17.620
rates that the different
moneylenders

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.230
charge are about equal.

01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:22.025
Because if there was a huge
benefit to switching, it might

01:11:22.025 --> 01:11:23.260
out weigh the costs.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:23.605
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:11:23.605 --> 01:11:27.210
So it's to a point, it's
going to equilibriate.

01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:30.480
So basically, what the
moneylender that your are with

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.290
is going to do is that they are
going to set the interest

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:38.660
rate just low enough that
switching is not worth it.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:43.070
But that means they are going
to start making a profit on

01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:45.680
the people in which they
have a relationship.

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.640
Because now, they know that they
can do better than just

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.310
charging the break even rate.

01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:56.980
Because there is this gain of
thing with them, which is a

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:57.950
very big gain.

01:11:57.950 --> 01:12:02.720
Because the other people would
be quite suspicious of you.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.050
And you're exactly right.

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:07.000
Everybody will end up charging
the same rates in a village,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.100
in equilibrium.

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.040
And this rate will be higher
than the rate that they would

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.620
have been charging in
the absence of this

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.870
difficulty to switch.

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:24.215
So that's why you could have
like this combination of, you

01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:26.420
know, they are kind of running
their business in a difficult

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:29.220
situation, and they are actually
taking advantage of

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:29.760
their clients.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.248
Yeah?

01:12:30.248 --> 01:12:32.200
AUDIENCE: I know that one of
the articles that I read--

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.616
I think it was [INAUDIBLE]
professor that proposed it or

01:12:35.616 --> 01:12:38.560
proposed-- or maybe it was
the Finacial Times--

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.054
creating this central--
at least in India--

01:12:42.054 --> 01:12:46.615
MFI, like a database of all the
loans, of some way to see

01:12:46.615 --> 01:12:49.390
everybody's indebtedness,
across the board.

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:52.670
Wouldn't this help minimize
the cost of switching?

01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:55.370
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:58.810
This kind of central database,
credit registry, similar to

01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:01.450
what we have in the US,
that would help.

01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:04.910
Because that would exactly
solve this problem.

01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:07.350
Because then the new moneylender
would know exactly

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:08.430
what is your history.

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:09.790
The thing is the moneylenders
are not going

01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:11.150
to enter into that.

01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:15.100
So that is something that the
microfinance agencies could do

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.340
for themselves.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.250
But that's something that
moneylenders won't do.

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:22.390
There is sort of one more fact
that is going to push the

01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:26.680
interest rate up that is less
benevolent from the point of

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:27.930
view of the moneylender.

01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:35.770
The formal institution
we already discussed.

01:13:35.770 --> 01:13:38.450
The formal institutions
are far away.

01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:40.540
The formal institutions
don't have a

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:43.690
means to threaten people.

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:51.030
The formal institutions, even
if they were able to get

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:54.770
people to repay, they might not
like headlines of farmer's

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:56.350
suicide and all that.

01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:58.590
So that doesn't put them
in a very favorable

01:13:58.590 --> 01:14:03.100
situation to lend.

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:08.800
So these difficulties in the
credit market explain why,

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:13.310
despite the effort, the formal
institutions have been

01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:19.450
relatively unable to lend to the
poor until now and explain

01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:22.630
why people have access to all of
these moneylenders at these

01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:24.320
very high rates.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:28.210
The genius of microcredit is to
introduce an institutional

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:32.060
form that solves a lot of
these problems without

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:35.350
resorting to breaking
people's kneecaps.

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:38.270
So what microfinance does-- and
you're going to see that

01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:40.070
in much more detail next week.

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.870
What are the key elements of
the model of microfinance?

01:14:47.624 --> 01:14:50.079
AUDIENCE: You borrow in
groups, [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.390
PROFESSOR: And what is
the group doing?

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:55.990
What is the value
of the group?

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:57.900
See, if we put it in the context
of the model, what is

01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.210
the value of the group?

01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:02.268
AUDIENCE: So they insure
payment for each other.

01:15:02.268 --> 01:15:05.130
So if one person defaults, the
others can cover the loan.

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:05.610
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:08.014
So where does it play out in
normal debt, in term of the

01:15:08.014 --> 01:15:08.610
parameters?

01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:11.070
AUDIENCE: It decreases
the run away risk.

01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:13.830
PROFESSOR: It decreases
the run away risk.

01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:15.656
It could also decrease the fixed
cost, because you know

01:15:15.656 --> 01:15:16.780
people are not running away.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.480
The cost of the monitoring, it's
not that it decreases .

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.950
Someone still needs to pay
for the monitoring.

01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:24.240
But it is the other people.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.950
It's not the bank anymore.

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:28.270
So there is no multiplier.

01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:30.090
The cost of the monitoring
reduces.

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:33.480
And therefore, because of the
multiplier effect, you can

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.460
reduce the interest rate quite
a bit as a function of that.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:39.170
So that's one, group lending.

01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:43.175
What else is microcredit
doing?

01:15:43.175 --> 01:15:45.610
AUDIENCE: I know two of the
functions they have, like

01:15:45.610 --> 01:15:47.558
certain payment schedules
and steps.

01:15:47.558 --> 01:15:51.210
And typically, they assign you
some sort of consultant or

01:15:51.210 --> 01:15:54.619
someone who helps you discuss
business plans

01:15:54.619 --> 01:15:55.350
and stuff like that.

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:58.050
So your default risk is also
lower, because you'll make

01:15:58.050 --> 01:15:59.780
smarter use of it.

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:00.190
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:03.130
So they can reduce the default
rate like that.

01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:06.070
The other thing you said is
that they have this very

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:07.700
regular schedule.

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:10.680
So they try and reduce the
administrative cost by making

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.920
all of the products the same.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.410
So the typical microcredit loan
is you take a loan, and

01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:19.660
then you reimburse it in 52
installments of the same size.

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:25.000
So that means one guy can
handle a vast number of

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.290
repayments in just one round.

01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:30.990
They basically go from village
to village, meet with the

01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:33.800
entire center, which is usually
a combination of these

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.610
groups, and take all the
money at once and go.

01:16:36.610 --> 01:16:40.040
And so that reduces the c, if
you want, the cost, the fixed

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.320
cost of administering the loan,
which, again, can be

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.890
passed to the borrower.

01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:48.746
AUDIENCE: As a result of that
as well, you're making a

01:16:48.746 --> 01:16:53.520
relationship with
the borrower.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.889
You build a relationship of
trust and the incentive is to

01:16:56.889 --> 01:17:00.638
want to pay back [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:00.638 --> 01:17:04.550
PROFESSOR: Right, another thing
that microfinance has is

01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:08.830
that they are lending one loan,
that's usually small at

01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:10.820
the beginning, and then they
increase it and then they

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.650
increase it and then
they increase it.

01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:14.440
And that's supposed to
give people incentive

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.840
to continue to repay.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.800
Although one has to wonder
when that stops.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.510
Because, eventually, they might
consider that they have

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:22.830
now built up enough that they
can just default with the

01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:24.070
entire money.

01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:28.290
But over the whole beginning of
relationship, you are going

01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:31.930
to benefit from this incentive
to continue repaying.

01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:34.180
Because now the incentive is
not only I'm going to break

01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.410
your kneecap if you don't repay,
but it's I'm not going

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:39.980
to lend you another loan.

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:46.440
So making product very
standardized makes it to

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.800
available to hire people, who
are less well known, going

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.990
straight to the villages,
using the group loans.

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:55.840
All of that reduces the cost of
lending, which, because of

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.480
the multiplier, is passed
to interest.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:00.800
And of course, they are often
nonprofit or even subsidized,

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.360
which again helps, with
regard with the

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.720
discussion we had before.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.190
So I'm going to leave
it here for now.

01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:10.120
And then, next time, we're going
to get much more into

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.370
detail about microcredit.
