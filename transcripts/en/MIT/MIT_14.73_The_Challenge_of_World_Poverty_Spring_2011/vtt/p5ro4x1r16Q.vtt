00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.600
PROFESSOR: We ended last time
kind of without really a

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.760
resolution in the sense that we
looked at this example of

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:46.030
these vendors in India and the
Philippines, and these vendors

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.295
were somehow--

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.630
they seem to be unable to save
their way out of something

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.960
that seems extremely costly
to keep bearing.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:13.310
They were paying 5% a day, and
even when somebody paid down

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.800
their entire debt so that they
didn't have to borrow any

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.170
more, they slipped back into
debt within about three weeks.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:32.060
So it was a sense in which these
people seem to find it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:40.140
difficult to stay out of debt
and, in particular, to hold

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.520
onto their savings.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.960
So here's another experiment,
which sort of brings out some

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.205
more off it.

00:01:51.205 --> 00:01:55.900
It's in Busia, Kenya, a
letter missing there.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.870
So the way it started
is that--

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.370
the experiment is by Esther
Duflo, Michael Kremer, and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.630
John Robinson.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.260
What they had done was they
started by actually giving

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.590
farmers some fertilizer.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.600
One of the enduring kind of
puzzles in agricultural and

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.090
economics is why farmers in
Africa don't use more

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.700
fertilizer given that fertilizer
is something that

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.600
basically makes money
for people.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.860
So why don't they use
fertilizer, and their various

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.000
possible answers would
talk about those.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.605
But to demonstrate that it
really does seem to work--

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.190
what they started by doing is
making sure that it's true

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:09.400
that it works, so what they did
was they had people give

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.610
farmers fertilizer and told
them, this is your plot, just

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.790
go ahead and use fertilizer,
and they give them free

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.510
fertilizer.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.990
So they took a bunch of plots
and gave them free fertilizer.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.040
So very simple, you give people
free fertilizer, they

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.010
do use it, not surprisingly,
especially if you make sure

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.560
they can't sell it, and
they do use it.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:50.150
When they use it,
their incomes go

00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:05.320
up by 27%, and that's--

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.360
Oh, their incomes go
up by 27%, which is

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.340
100% increase annually.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.410
So that's like three months,
three months, you bought the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.310
fertilizer, you laid it in the
ground, you waited for three

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.100
months, you would get
27% more back.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.630
So they were pretty convinced
that fertilizer was a very

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.510
useful thing to use.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.500
And this, they did it many
times, so it varies.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.980
Fertilizer is, in fact,
not predictable.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.590
Sometimes it works better than
others, but the range of these

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.360
returns, where you never got
less than 80%, I think,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.710
basically, on your money, and
that's a very good investment

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.400
if you get 80% on your money.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.620
Sometimes, you get 500%, but
even if you got a 80% on your

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.370
money, that would be
a good investment.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.760
So question is why
don't they do it?

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.500
So the various theories,
obviously, on why

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.110
people don't do it.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.200
One is that they don't
know about it.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.350
That seems implausible, partly
because fertilizer's not a new

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.720
technology.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.950
It's been around for
a very long time.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.380
And second, because take those
farmers who were given free

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.590
fertilizer.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.440
They used it, they got 100%
return, annualized return, go

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.900
back to those people at the
end of the year and the

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.350
beginning of next season and
ask them do you want to use

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.680
fertilizer.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.530
98% say yes, of course, we
want to use fertilizer.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.460
Only 37% actually use it.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.010
So these are people who clearly
know fertilizer works

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.475
because they did it.

00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:08.725
It worked.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.990
There's no two ways about the
fact that they know it

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.500
because, the fertilizer, they
had used it, they saw the

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.550
results, they saw
it's working.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.630
Why didn't the farmers who had
seen that the fertilizer

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.210
generates these massive returns
not go back to using

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.440
fertilizer?

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.850
Yeah?

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.730
AUDIENCE: Beause they said
couldn't really afford it, and

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.694
then also the fact was when
they did have the money,

00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:38.670
fertilizer generally
wasn't there.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.128
And when they didn't have
the money it was there.

00:06:42.128 --> 00:06:43.610
So it's difficult.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.590
PROFESSOR: OK, so that's
sort of the--

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.770
but before we come there,
lets rule out some other

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:51.830
explanations.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:07:00.990
So one other explanation is
credit constraint, so we

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.390
already discussed it's hard
for the poor to borrow.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.110
Interest rates are very high.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.780
That would be a good explanation
if fertilizer were

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.020
indivisible, so if you had to
use a certain minimal amount

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.900
to make money.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.240
But fertilizer is extremely
divisible.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.550
You can buy it in like You could
buy 500 grams of it, put

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.500
it on a small plot, and
you'll make more money

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.740
on that small plot.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.720
If you bought two kilos,
you make more

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.080
money on a bigger plot.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.050
If you bought 10 kilos,
you'd have even more.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:42.290
So the question is why don't
people use fertilizer?

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.190
If they have less money,
why don't they use it

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.440
on a smaller plot?

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.120
It's not enough to say that they
don't have money because

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.175
money just--

00:07:54.175 --> 00:07:59.400
if you're less money, you
can use it on less land.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.840
The main point is that whenever
you use it, you make

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:08.170
money, so even if you use it on
a smaller plot, the output

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.110
on that plot would still go up
by a lot, and the returns

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.860
would be 100% a year on
the money you put in.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.800
Yeah?

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.774
AUDIENCE: So I understand what
you're saying, but on the

00:08:18.774 --> 00:08:23.020
other hand, they can only afford
to fertilize a very

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.172
small amount of land, that their
returns might just not

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.325
be worth it to make this
tiny investment.

00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:32.720
You would have to wait for
several months to get an extra

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.387
several rupees whereas you have
this money now, you might

00:08:35.387 --> 00:08:37.085
as well spend it now
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:39.846 --> 00:08:45.330
PROFESSOR: I guess that might
be right, but it's sort of--

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.600
in the end, it's why aren't they
thinking, look, it's 100

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.260
Kenyan shillings now.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.950
I'm going to get 200
in three months.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.300
If it's 100 shillings, and
that's very little, that's a

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.220
dollar and a bit, it's still
you get twice as much.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.610
So why aren't people thinking
in proportion?

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.870
Why aren't they thinking that
twice as much is a lot more?

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.170
Yeah?

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.130
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't fertilizer
be more viable for bigger

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.100
farmers because they have
irrigation, which is required

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.590
for fertilizer to really work.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.280
PROFESSOR: Not in
Kenya, actually.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.410
I mean, fertilizer is--

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.880
it's true that it would
be more useful.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.610
But mostly even, Kenya
has especially--

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:34.280
this is the what they call
the short rain season.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.570
Most of agriculture in the short
rain season is rain fed,

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.400
so I think people don't--

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.600
it's true that I'm sure
fertilizer would reduce risk,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.680
but there isn't much of risk.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.150
Even when the rains are not
great, you still make money.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:59.100
So if you ask farmers, they do
tell you the answer that they

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.350
don't have any money.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.430
So they're answer is we
don't have any money.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.090
It's exactly what you
said, which is that

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.360
they don't have money.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.200
Well, how would we
buy fertilizer?

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.890
The fact is that, as you'll see
in a minute, they do have

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:25.320
money, especially when
they harvest.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.780
Farming is a cyclical
business.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.940
You make money at some point.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.820
You plant, you wait for three
months, your crops come out,

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.330
you sell your crops,
you get money, then

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.030
you wait for a while.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.690
You buy some seeds.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.040
You plant again, so it's
kind of a cycle.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.640
So if you think of the point
when they have sold the crops,

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.920
they certainly, at that point,
certainly do have money.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.090
It's not true that they don't,
and we'll see in a minute

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.210
evidence that they
do have money.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.570
And in particular,
they seem to--

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.620
I mean, even if they can't save
all of it because they

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.090
need to eat most of it, they
could have saved a little bit

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:13.390
of it, so they could have
saved the money.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.030
Alternatively, they could just
buy fertilizer then, when they

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.710
have the money.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.330
Fertilizer it is very durable.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.600
You just buy fertilizer.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.320
You keep it in a bag.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.050
It'll stay for three months.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.190
It's not that you need to buy
fertilizer on the day when you

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.430
need to go farming.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.200
You could have bought fertilizer
ahead of time and

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.640
kept it in your home.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.140
So we'll see that they do have
money at some point, and when

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.040
they do have money, they
don't necessarily buy

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.290
fertilizer with it.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.530
In fact, they did a small
survey, and they asked did you

00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:02.200
buy fertilizer at harvest
time when you had money.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.890
The answer is, no, almost
no one did that.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:11.960
So if you look at the
population, about 30% of them

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:20.970
use fertilizer at any point of
time, but of that 30%, only

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.650
about 3% had bought it early
when they had money.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.850
Most of them bought it at the
point of planting, so they had

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.620
either managed to save
or they had borrowed.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.390
But in any case, they had--

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.730
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.125
Let me remove Skype.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.510
Yep.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:11.130
So what is true is that, so
basically, no one buys

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.620
fertilizer early even though--

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.970
if you think that it's
a problem to--

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:25.760
maybe you don't have money at
planting time, then you should

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.900
just buy it early.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:34.460
So here's a nice experiment,
which is sort of exactly

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.590
trying to figure out what's
going on here.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.830
So what they did was they went
to different farmers, and

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.730
since some farmers had already
had some experience using

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:56.495
fertilizer and others had not,
they stratified by that.

00:13:56.495 --> 00:13:57.745
What does it mean to stratify?

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.430
PROFESSOR: Right, they're
randomized within the group of

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.870
people who had used it before,
and within the group of people

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.050
who had used it before.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:27.850
So they divided up the
population and randomized

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:32.650
within each group, and then they
came to the household and

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:38.970
offered them fertilizer and
said, look, you pay for it.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.742
We will sell it to you, and
we'll bring it to you so you

00:14:43.742 --> 00:14:45.770
don't have to go to a
market to buy it.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:53.110
And that saves a trip, saves
trouble, but it also--

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.910
so this was done at harvest
time, and it basically forced

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:01.650
them to make a decision then.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.530
So you couldn't say, well,
maybe I'll buy it.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:05.390
Maybe I won't.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.885
I'll wait until when
I need it.

00:15:09.885 --> 00:15:13.160
It was kind of a all or nothing
decision, where they

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:20.880
had to take a decision right
now when they had money.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.130
This was the first experiment.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.210
Then they follow it up a second
experiment where they

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:40.950
took another set of people,
and then in the second

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.995
experiment, they offered people
an additional choice.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:53.120
You can either choose
when you'll get--

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.390
we'll come to sell
you fertilizer.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.570
This was done before harvest, so
they didn't have any money

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.620
at that time.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.250
So they said you can either tell
us, and we'll come right

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.840
after harvest, or we'll
come when you plant.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.550
Just tell us what to do.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.330
So the first experiment, they
were not given the choice.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.190
They said you want it now, we'll
bring it to you free.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.920
You don't have to go collect.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.610
If not, that's it.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.030
Then you're on your own.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:32.280
Now, it's you can either
buy now or later.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.530
You're offered a choice.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:46.660
And the other thing that they
did was other people who were

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.620
not given any offer like this,
when it came to the actual

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.410
time of the planting, they came
to these people and said

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.620
do you want to buy fertilizer.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.890
We'll bring it to you, and then
some people, they offered

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.760
a 50% discount.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.410
So they actually said if
we give you a discount,

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:09.680
will you buy it?

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.089
So these were the treatments, so
think of the treatments as

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:17.130
the first treatment, all or
nothing at harvest time, you

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:22.790
want to buy fertilizer; second
treatment, before harvest, do

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:27.250
you want to buy fertilizer at
harvest or later; third

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:32.180
treatment, at planting time, do
you want to buy fertilizer

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:36.260
from us if we deliver
it to you free.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.510
That's the experiment.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:50.160
Before we get into
the experiment,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.540
suppose people were--

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.420
what's the disadvantage
of saying that you

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.930
can only buy it--

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:02.370
we'll offer it to you
now, but not later?

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.130
What's the downside of that?

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.530
Why did they go to the second
treatment, do you think, where

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:15.500
they give you a choice
when to buy?

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.683
What's the advantage of giving
you this choice?

00:18:32.966 --> 00:18:33.459
Yeah?

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:34.709
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:45.510
PROFESSOR: Right, exactly, I
mean, typically we think that

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.560
buying things early
is a bad idea.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:48.900
Why?

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.240
Because you're locking
up your money.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.130
I mean, fertilizer's not that
easy to sell, whereas if

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.130
somebody got sick, you
had money, you'd

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.490
be able to buy medicine.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.180
Now, instead you have
fertilizer.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.710
So why would you
lock up money?

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:09.740
So in general, the standard
intuition would be that

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.670
locking up money is a bad
idea, not a good idea.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.970
So in the first treatment,
they were

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.310
forced to lock up money.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.870
The second one, they
give them a choice.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:33.390
So we take the first one,
basically, there was a 50%--

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:39.860
so about, as I said, 25% to 30%
of them use fertilizer.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.340
That went up by 11 to 14
percentage points, so that's

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.460
like a 46% to 63% increase
in fertilizer use.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.050
So you get more than 50%, more
than 50% increase in

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.785
fertilizer use when you just
tell people, look, we'll bring

00:19:57.785 --> 00:20:00.760
it to you for free.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.910
Do you want it at
harvest time?

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.790
This did not change--

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:15.720
so then what they looked at is
this season, of course, you

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.200
getting it delivered to
you, so you buy it.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.260
It doesn't have any
persistent effect.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.790
You saw that it was
a good idea.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.220
Did you start saving money
or finding a way to

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.040
buy ahead of time?

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.820
The answer's no.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.150
People seem to be--

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:39.440
when you offer it to them for
free at harvest time, a

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.430
substantial number
of them buy it.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.780
But if you said, look, last
year you did this,

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.040
look, it was good.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.800
You got much more output.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.010
This time, why don't you
buy on your own?

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.120
Just buy it at harvest time.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.630
We won't help you.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.210
You can do it on your own.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.760
Nobody does it.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.690
So it's not the case that
people learn from this

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:08.060
experience to buy fertilizer
to use at harvest time.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.725
They go back to not using
it, basically.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:25.820
So when you give people a
choice, that's experiment two,

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.970
you get bigger effects.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.550
Instead of getting 11 to 14
percentage points, you get 18

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:31.940
percentage points.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:42.040
That's almost 75% increase in
fertilizer use, so if you give

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.040
them a choice, then you get
more people taking it up.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.160
On the other hand, if you show
up at harvest time--

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.680
so this is not mainly an effect
of offering it to them,

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.240
just bringing it to them.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.490
It's not because they're getting
free transportation.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.990
It's not because they don't have
to go buy it that they're

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:08.130
doing it because if you came to
them at planting time and

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:13.310
said do you want to buy it,
we'll get it to you free, that

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.560
has no impact.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:23.650
If you bring it to people at
planting time free, then they

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.720
don't buy it, so it's not the
case that you get the same

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.560
effect by just delivering it
to them free at any time.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.450
You have to deliver
it to them free

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.940
typically at planting time--

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.710
sorry, at harvest time.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.190
When they have money, you have
to deliver it to them free,

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.830
then they buy it.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:47.280
If you bring it to them when
they are planting, and you

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.240
offer free delivery, that
doesn't have the same impact.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.520
So it's not that whenever
you offer it to them

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.800
free, they buy a lot.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.030
They only buy a lot if
you offer it free

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.280
when they have money.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:13.310
The 50% discount does have a
significant effect, maybe not

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.520
surprisingly.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.480
On the other hand, it's not
really smaller than just

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:25.680
offering people to get free
delivery with no discount.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.650
No discount is better than
giving people a discount if

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.270
you give them the discount
at the right time--

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.360
sorry, the free--

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.750
the delivery at the
right time.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:41.640
So if I go to you at harvest
time, and I say I won't give

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.490
you a discount, when do you
want it, you get a bigger

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:48.980
effect than if I tell you I'll
give you 50% discount, but

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:55.820
that I offer that to you
only at planting time.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.780
So just those magnitudes are
what's worth looking at

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.600
because you're getting
people--

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.180
it's not that people, even if
you offer them a 50% discount,

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.790
you don't get as big an effect
as just finding the right time

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.835
to make an offer without
a discount.

00:24:17.551 --> 00:24:18.044
Yeah?

00:24:18.044 --> 00:24:21.970
AUDIENCE: How do people get this
if it wasn't delivered?

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:25.300
PROFESSOR: You just go to the
local town and you buy--

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.188
AUDIENCE: --drag it back
or pull it back--

00:24:27.188 --> 00:24:29.140
PROFESSOR: Oh, you
bring it on a--

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.520
they have all these three-wheel
taxis and little

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.040
trucks in Kenya.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.470
You put it in the back of
one, and you bring it.

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.970
It's like--

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.090
PROFESSOR: No, it's a small
cost, actually.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.340
That's the usual.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.010
Now, you notice that
there was this 18

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.880
percentage point increase.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.800
That came from a bunch of those
people said, look, it's

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:06.230
free delivery, but
we just want it

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.590
delivered at planting time.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:18.760
So some people behaved as if
they had no worries about

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.290
having the money later, and the
other half said bring it

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.930
to us now, so a bunch
of people said

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:28.180
bring it to us now.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.790
The reason why this one gives
you a bigger effect than

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.230
forcing people to buy early is
because a bunch of those

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:43.080
people actually prefer
to get it late.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.870
So it's clear that the economics
we described before

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:49.380
is working for some people, but
it's also striking that

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.940
about half of those people
say, no, we want it now.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.970
We want to lock up our money.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.060
We want our money to
not be spendable.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.370
We want it in fertilizer now.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:04.590
So what's quite striking is
that people are willing to

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.340
lock up their money,
even though it's--

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.030
So what could be going on?

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:31.500
So here's a story that
seems to mostly work.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.890
So these people have money
at harvest time and want

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.310
fertilizer, but somehow, they
don't manage to buy

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.900
fertilizer.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:46.170
So the reason why the experiment
works is that these

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.746
people basically say, look,
we will buy fertilizer.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:06.690
So what seems to be going on
is that, as we said, 98% of

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:11.050
those people who had plots where
fertilizer was used said

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:12.500
they wanted to buy it again.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.970
Only 37% actually did.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.490
So at harvest time, it seems
most people plan to use

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:22.390
fertilizer, and then only
a small fraction of them

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.470
actually managed to get there.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:29.310
So what seems to happen
is that they

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.180
don't manage to implement.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.730
So they think that they're going
to buy fertilizer, but

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.710
then somehow end up spending the
money before they get to

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:39.960
the fertilizer.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:51.600
So one way to think about what
could be happening is that

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:59.240
people say, look, today I really
want to buy fertilizer,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:05.160
but right now, I really like a
drink or I'd really like to

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.430
have a barbecue.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.250
So they go to the market, they
buy something, and they say,

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.220
look, it doesn't really matter
because tomorrow,

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.470
I'm going to save.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.610
Today, let me have a barbecue,
but tomorrow, I'm definitely

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:23.850
going to save.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.470
So they say that so it doesn't
really matter.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:31.970
It's going to be in three months
that we're going to

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.040
plant, so even if I don't save
today, I'll save tomorrow.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.270
So sometimes, this is
represented by this formula.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.710
These kind of preferences are
sometimes [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.360
by this formula.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:56.040
So the U function is the
utility you get or the

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.160
pleasure you get out
of eating today or

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.330
tomorrow or day after.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:07.330
Today is c0, tomorrow's c1, day
after is c2, the day after

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.480
that is c3.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.130
Or we could think of months,
c0 this month, c1 is next

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.886
month, et cetera.

00:29:15.886 --> 00:29:20.830
What's important is that U of
c1 is multiplied by two

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.876
numbers, both less than 1.

00:29:26.208 --> 00:29:30.730
U of c2 is multiplied by
beta delta squared.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:34.570
If delta's less than 1, delta
squared is less than 1, but I

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.810
didn't multiply by beta
squared delta squared.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:40.150
I multiplied by beta
delta squared.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:46.150
The day after that is multiplied
by beta delta

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:51.440
cubed, so I didn't multiply
by beta cubed delta cubed.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.610
Why am I doing that?

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:58.610
What's the point being made
by having that structure?

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.860
This is sometimes called a
quasi hyperbolic model.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.995
Why did I put that
structure there?

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:28.573
Yeah?

00:30:28.573 --> 00:30:33.010
AUDIENCE: Maybe like delta is
something that [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.968
whereas beta is a variable that
probably won't happen.

00:30:35.968 --> 00:30:37.218
Like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:47.560
PROFESSOR: Well, specifically,
these are constant, so think

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.000
of them as being numbers.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.370
Beta's like a number, like--

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:57.520
maybe delta is 0.9, and beta's
something like 0.6.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.230
That's the sort of numbers
people often throw

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.718
around over a month.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.930
What does this preference
specifically say?

00:31:19.525 --> 00:31:20.914
Yeah?

00:31:20.914 --> 00:31:23.670
AUDIENCE: Seems like it's just
saying that if more importance

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:29.060
is given to c0, and anything
in the future as a discount

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.040
factor of beta.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.940
But the further into the future
you go, you go from

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:39.350
delta to delta squared
so [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.340
PROFESSOR: Right, but
specifically what it's saying

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.970
is that today versus tomorrow
is very different from

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.580
tomorrow versus day
after or day after

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.870
versus day after that.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:57.420
It's saying specifically that
when I offer you a choice

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:01.250
between today and tomorrow,
you want it today, but you

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:05.390
don't care as much about day
after versus day after that.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:11.080
So beta and delta both numbers
less than 1, then what this

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.610
preference is exactly
saying is that I

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.860
would take one today.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.850
I'll give up two tomorrow to
get one today, but when I

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:27.260
compare tomorrow with day after,
I'm not going to take

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:32.380
one tomorrow instead
of two day after.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.130
So people are very short--

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.290
they want things now, but they
don't really care about when

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:39.790
they get it if they
don't get it now.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:47.000
Why is that an interesting
set of preferences?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.020
Well, if you believe those set
of preferences, then this

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.180
behavior seems to start
to make sense.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:33:00.910
So what I really want
is I want tomorrow--

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.650
since I don't care about whether
I consume tomorrow or

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:08.070
day after, I want tomorrow
to do the saving.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.370
Today, I don't want to save
because today is much more

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:17.300
important to me than tomorrow.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.610
Tomorrow is not that much more
important than day after, so

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.870
if I want some money for day
after, the best way to get

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:29.430
there is by eating a lot today,
saving a lot tomorrow,

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.450
and then ending up with
the money day after.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:39.220
I would rather do that than eat
little today and also a

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.210
little tomorrow.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:46.940
I would rather save by binging
today and then waiting, and

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.000
then implementing
saving tomorrow.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.290
The problem is that when
you get around to

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:54.235
tomorrow, what happens?

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:02.210
If your plan is I will save more
tomorrow, I'll eat more

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:03.740
today, save more tomorrow,
what's the

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.966
problem with that plan?

00:34:05.966 --> 00:34:07.110
AUDIENCE: Tomorrow
becomes today.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:08.830
PROFESSOR: Tomorrow
becomes today.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:12.600
Once tomorrow becomes today, you
start thinking, OK, well,

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.020
I have the same preferences.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.889
c0 then becomes tomorrow's c0.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.870
I want to implement the
same plan tomorrow.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:28.590
I want to eat a lot tomorrow,
and get day after to do the

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:32.239
savings, and you can
keep doing that.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.692
That's the problem.

00:34:33.692 --> 00:34:40.870
OK, so that's the idea.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:43.760
Now do people actually
behave in such a way?

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.380
So here's an experiment.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.460
Ashraf, Karlan, and Win asked
1,700 subjects in the

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:10.090
Philippines the following
questions.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:13.900
So they asked them, first, would
you prefer 200 pesos now

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:18.280
or 250 pesos later?

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.840
Some people said I'd prefer
250 later, in

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.220
which case, they stopped.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:29.770
If they said that they would
prefer 200 now rather than 250

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:34.815
in a month, then they were
asked how about 300?

00:35:42.884 --> 00:35:49.070
If they said they'll even take
300, then they were asked how

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:53.410
much would it take to stop you
from wanting 200 today?

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:56.430
Somebody might say 400.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:02.020
I'll take 200 today
and 400 a month.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:08.170
So there are people who could
say 250 I'll take in a month.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.840
Some people say I'll take
300 in a month.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.280
Some people will say
name a number.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.010
So do you see how it goes?

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.775
Then they are given a break.

00:36:20.775 --> 00:36:25.930
They went and wander around,
then came back, and 15 minutes

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.480
later, they were asked the same
set of questions, but

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.580
with one change, which is that
instead of asking them about

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.020
today versus in a month, they
were asked in six months

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.500
versus in seven months.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.630
Same thing, but notice
what we're doing is

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.915
exactly this exercise.

00:36:46.915 --> 00:36:51.080
We are exactly trying to
pinpoint whether or not people

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.950
have a different view of today
versus tomorrow versus one

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.430
month later at any other
point of time.

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:05.830
That's exactly the idea, that
am I someone who thinks that

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:09.300
tomorrow is going to be--

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:13.340
do I think that tomorrow
it's going to be it

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.360
really doesn't matter.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.430
I can cut back tomorrow,
but I really don't

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:20.010
want to cut back today.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.260
So this is what they found.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:26.280
This is a complicated
table, but we can

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.530
go through it slowly.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:34.485
So the way to think about
it is that the--

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:44.720
each square in a matrix is how
much money would you take

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:50.325
today versus 200--

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.260
so how much money in the future
versus 200 today.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:06.750
Along the vertical dimension,
we're increasing the amount of

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:11.730
money in a month from today.

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:16.120
On the horizontal dimension,
we increasing the amount of

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.650
money in a month from
six months.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.760
And those are the fraction of
people who make those choices.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.880
So some people are
just patient.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.730
Those people say, you offer
me 200 today, I'll

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:46.160
take 250 in a month.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.900
You offer me 200 in six
months, I'll take

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.580
250 in seven months.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:39:00.320
Some people say you offer
me 200 today, I

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.120
take 250 in a month--

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:09.180
or more than 250, but less than
300 in a month, and they

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.350
express the same preference
in the future as well.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:19.560
But then interesting people
are the people who seem to

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.190
have different preferences, and
we see that there are both

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.470
kinds of people.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:26.855
There are some people
who are--

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:37.360
So what is the dark squares?

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.920
What are the dark squares
telling you?

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.646
Who are those people?

00:39:40.646 --> 00:39:42.070
The really dark ones.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:48.960
What are their preferences?

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.645
AUDIENCE: They'll take less
money, one month from now then

00:40:16.645 --> 00:40:19.270
require more money
in the future.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.720
PROFESSOR: The really daft, daft
ones are the ones who are

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:30.680
saying I'll take less than 250
for 200 in one month, but six

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.650
months or seven months, it'll
take me more than 250 to

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:35.640
compensate.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.090
So they seem to be the opposite
of the kind of people

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:39.310
who you're talking about.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:43.640
They seem to be impatient
in the future but

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.420
patient in the present.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.191
Yeah?

00:40:47.191 --> 00:40:48.153
AUDIENCE: All right,
I have a question.

00:40:48.153 --> 00:40:51.520
Could it be that it's not so
much about money today versus

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.368
money tomorrow, and preferences
for consumption

00:40:55.368 --> 00:40:57.773
versus investment?

00:40:57.773 --> 00:41:01.820
So if you're waiting for the 250
in a month, you're putting

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.688
your income towards investment
as opposed to [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:04.688 --> 00:41:06.122
consumption.

00:41:06.122 --> 00:41:06.600
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.000
AUDIENCE: Does that
make sense?

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.020
PROFESSOR: I mean,
it makes sense.

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:14.700
It's just I don't understand
why that's different.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.040
It's the same thing.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.720
I'm going to get money
in the future.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.796
Investment is just a way to
get money in the future.

00:41:22.796 --> 00:41:25.330
I think it's the same thing.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:28.440
What's not visible, but I can
tell you, is that those three

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.890
dark squares, which are people
who are patient now but

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.470
impatient in the future--

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:41.570
that's about 15% of the
population seem to be patient

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:44.960
now, impatient in the future.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:54.220
Now, the ones who are in the
kind of what I call hyperbolic

00:41:54.220 --> 00:42:00.430
squares, that's about 25% of
the population, they're

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.950
impatient now, patient later.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:06.270
They are the people
who are impatient.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:14.950
They're saying I'll take 200
now over 300 later, but--

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.540
or was it 250 later?

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.670
But in a month, I'll reverse
that preferences.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:23.760
I'll take 200 in six
months rather than

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.520
250 in seven months.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.660
Sorry, the other way.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:31.710
I'll take 250 in seven months,
but 200 in six months, and

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.240
that's about 25% of
the population.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:40.530
And then there is another 17%
of the population who are in

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:45.290
that other box, and they're
people for whom--

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.950
about half of those are actually
more patient now than

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.470
they were in the future than
the other way around.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.770
So basically, what this
shows is that it's not

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:55.970
everybody's like that.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.430
Some people are just
very impatient.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.850
Who are the very impatient
people?

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.180
Which box would they be?

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:15.920
PROFESSOR: Those people, we--

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.936
You're right, they are
the people who are--

00:43:21.936 --> 00:43:27.900
I guess they're the people who
are most impatient, but some

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.360
of those people are more
impatient now.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.860
Some people are more impatient
in the future.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.270
Who are the most
patient people?

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:49.080
Which box?

00:43:56.095 --> 00:43:59.065
AUDIENCE: Require 250
now or later?

00:43:59.065 --> 00:44:02.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so the top
left-hand boxes were the most

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.580
patient people.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.510
So basically, what this says
there's about a third of the

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.910
population who are
very patient.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:10.394
Yeah?

00:44:10.394 --> 00:44:13.298
AUDIENCE: What were
the incomes of the

00:44:13.298 --> 00:44:14.750
people in this survey?

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:20.558
Like is 250 a lot for them,
relative to 300 or--

00:44:20.558 --> 00:44:22.550
PROFESSOR: No, these
are actually

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.230
small amounts of money.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.910
Not very cvalued.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.002
These are not very big
amounts of money.

00:44:29.002 --> 00:44:31.978
AUDIENCE: But in terms of part
of their income, would that be

00:44:31.978 --> 00:44:34.470
significant or not?

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:40.610
PROFESSOR: Significant per
billion, but really not.

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:46.570
So the point that we want to
take away from this is that

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:48.450
people seem to vary a lot.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:50.660
It's not that there's one kind
of people in the world.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:55.610
Some people are patient now and
impatient in the future.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:59.150
A lot more people are impatient
now and patient in

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.200
the future.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.980
But there's a whole bunch of
people who are both impatient

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.670
now and impatient in the future,
and a whole bunch of

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.080
people who are patient now and
patient in the future.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.620
So there are all kinds
of different

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.080
behaviors in this table.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:13.573
Yeah?

00:45:13.573 --> 00:45:17.024
AUDIENCE: Does this table change
for people in developed

00:45:17.024 --> 00:45:19.000
countries who are making
lots of money?

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.580
PROFESSOR: So here's
another experiment.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.970
It's not here.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.070
Let's look at another one.

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:30.940
This is actually interesting.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.386
I think I have it here.

00:45:32.386 --> 00:45:34.145
I'll show it to you.

00:45:34.145 --> 00:45:35.710
Actually not--

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.830
it's quite interesting.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.070
This one was done in the
US, and it's kind of

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:42.320
interesting to see.

00:46:22.902 --> 00:46:25.760
[INAUDIBLE], OK, good.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.330
It is something funny.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:32.100
This is not going to get
recorded, but it's this--

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.150
yeah.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:46.680
So this is a very famous
experiment on the US.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.760
Exactly the same kind
of question, but

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.010
now, people were asked--

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.840
so this is the median
response.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:05.010
So people were asked how much
money would you take in x

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:07.730
months, where x is either three
months, one year, or

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:11.630
three years, relative to
that much money today.

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:22.720
OK, so this is in the US with
college students, and then

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.030
these were Cornell students
if I remember right.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.690
So you can see, this
is the answer--

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.680
it's interesting.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:46.700
So if I offer you $15 today
versus $30 in three months,

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:50.040
the median response--

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.360
many people were asked this
question, and this is the

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.150
answer to the question, what's
the median response.

00:47:56.150 --> 00:48:00.770
So if you take half
the people--

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:07.820
so for example, for $15, half
the people said I'll take less

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.330
than $30, half the people said
I'll take more than $30, so

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:12.900
the median response was $30.

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:17.680
So you can see that, basically,
the US in three

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.790
months, the trade off
is basically people

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.970
want twice the money.

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:26.410
That's a yearly discount
factor of 277%.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.343
For one year, they say $60.

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:45.280
For three years,
they say $100.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.650
Now, the point is that that
number is getting, relatively,

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:52.240
you're getting more patient as
you look into the future.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.320
So it's today versus the future
always, but as I may

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.000
force you to look further into
the future, you become

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.760
actually more patient.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.080
And that sort of phenomenon I
was alluding to, which is that

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.480
as people really want it today,
but the difference

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.160
between tomorrow and in
one year later is

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.920
not that much more.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.830
AUDIENCE: So the amount
increase, right?

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.195
It's not [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:22.195 --> 00:49:26.075
more patient just because you
are talking about $3,000

00:49:26.075 --> 00:49:27.045
versus $15.

00:49:27.045 --> 00:49:28.500
Then you say [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:34.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that's
exactly right.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:36.770
That's to make the other
point, that as amounts

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:40.530
increase, people look like
they're more patient.

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:43.710
So if this was a lot of money--
so in the US, they're

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:47.380
going to look actually more
impatient than in the

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.000
Philippines.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.280
The Philippines, they were
looking much more patient

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.200
because these were actually big
amounts of money in the

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.930
Philippines.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:56.090
In the US, for those
amounts of money,

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:57.340
they look more impatient.

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.870
So it's when the amounts of
money are bigger, people seem

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:06.070
to look more patient.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:07.510
That's the bottom
line of that.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:11.320
The bottom of that says that
once you go to $3,000, people

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.030
really don't want
twice as much.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.760
They'll take much less than
twice as much to wait three

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.460
months, so people get much more
patient as you increase

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.230
the amount of money.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:26.110
I think that's a very kind
of interesting fact.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:30.160
I need to go back to where
I was, but this is a--

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.320
so that's kind of the answer to
your question, is that this

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.980
is actually relatively--

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:44.090
people are actually-- no,
this is the wrong--

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:45.505
I need to go back to the PDF.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.240
So actually, they are relatively
patient here

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.480
because these are amounts of
money that are relatively

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.730
large for them.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.360
If you make the amount of money
smaller, people become

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.370
less patient, not
more patient.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.300
So in the US, with these
choices, they look more

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.415
impatient actually, not
less impatient.

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:23.370
OK, so the question is can this
is really explain the

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:24.390
fertilizer puzzle?

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:27.000
So we can see that there are
people, about a quarter of the

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.500
population, do behave
in this funny way.

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:32.210
They want it now, and they think
in the future they're

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:34.110
going to be very patient,
so they want to

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:35.610
postpone their savings.

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:40.680
They want to say I will consume
now and save later.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.990
That's a kind of a natural
instinct for about a quarter

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:45.890
of the population.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:48.550
The problem is that this
requires people

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:50.160
to be pretty naive.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.060
What do I mean by naive?

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:55.650
I mean they need to actually not
realize that this is what

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.000
they're doing because otherwise
they should be able

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.030
to say, look, but I'll do that
tomorrow as well, and day

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:04.710
after and the day after that, so
I'll never buy fertilizer.

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:06.990
I want to buy fertilizer.

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:10.030
So if you were sophisticated
and, you fully understood what

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:12.940
you were doing, what
would you do?

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.040
Yeah?

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.000
AUDIENCE: You force yourself
to save [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.660
PROFESSOR: You'll buy now.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.870
You just buy now.

00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:30.615
You know that you can
never really--

00:52:30.615 --> 00:52:34.820
Yeah, or you save now, whatever
you need to do.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.640
You know that you'll never win
the game by postponing because

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.330
you know tomorrow you'll
have the same problem.

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:44.890
So basically, if you're
sophisticated,

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:46.890
you would buy now.

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:50.280
So you never want to do it, so
you really need people to be

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.235
pretty naive to be able to--

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:05.990
In other words, sophisticated
people should not react to

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:08.210
this program.

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:10.070
They would buy in any case.

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:12.670
The only advantage this program
offers is that they're

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:16.750
getting free delivery, but free
delivery, as we saw, is

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:17.870
not worth that much.

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:20.480
When you give people just free
delivery, that doesn't have a

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.110
big effect.

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:32.530
So in other words, if these guys
are really sophisticated,

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:37.130
they shouldn't need this program
to get them to buy

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.670
fertilizer.

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:40.260
They would buy it in any case
because they'll realize that

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:44.630
this is what's going on and
say, look, if I can try to

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.670
fool myself and say I'm going
to buy it tomorrow, but I'm

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.940
not going to buy it tomorrow.

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:53.370
I'm always going to
do the same thing.

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:53.630
Yeah?

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:56.746
AUDIENCE: Didn't they say that
the fertilizer wasn't

00:53:56.746 --> 00:54:00.078
available [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:00.078 --> 00:54:01.982
back to the city to check
it, so that's why they

00:54:01.982 --> 00:54:02.880
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.810
PROFESSOR: I'm sure that's also
true, but just take this

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.060
particular experiment.

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.280
I'm sure there are other costs,
like there is some

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:25.510
transportation costs of finding
fertilizer, et cetera,

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:31.830
but it's hard to imagine that's
the only problem.

00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:34.430
However, here's a problem with
saying that they are

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:35.680
sophisticated.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:47.770
Suppose people were
sophisticated, then they

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:49.880
wouldn't want the fertilizer--

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.530
the program would not have an
effect because, basically,

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:54.540
they would buy it in any case.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:58.650
Now, suppose they're not
sophisticated, so they don't

00:54:58.650 --> 00:54:59.980
understand they do this.

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:03.020
Suppose they come and tell you
do you want to buy now or in

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.460
the future?

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:05.710
What would you say?

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:10.920
You all would say in the future
because why would

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.170
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:18.200
I don't realize I'm going to
do this, so then I have no

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.730
reason to say lock
up my money.

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:24.850
I should always ask to spend
it in the future.

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:31.160
You cannot have them being
completely fully

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:33.680
sophisticated, in which case the
program would not have an

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:37.360
effect, because they're
sophisticated.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.530
They don't need the program.

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:39.890
They'll buy in any case.

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:43.720
But if you assume that they was
not sophisticated at all,

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:47.120
then they would say,
look, bring it

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.600
back at planting time.

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.740
I'll buy it then.

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:51.350
Why would I lockup my money?

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:55.040
Because I don't understand
that I have this problem.

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.670
So these people must be
halfway between being

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:00.200
sophisticated and not
being sophisticated.

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.910
They cannot be either
fully sophisticated.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.360
If they were fully
sophisticated, they would not

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.320
need this program.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.590
If they were fully
unsophisticated, they would

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:20.450
not respond to when you offer
them and ask them do you want

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.800
to buy it now or later, they
would all say later, and half

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.330
of them say they want it now
even though they don't need

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:29.080
the fertilizer now.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.180
So some of those people must
realize that later, they're

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:37.390
going to not have the money,
so somehow there is some

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:42.690
combination of sophistication
and naivete that's driving

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:43.940
this behavior.

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:50.640
So one way to look at this
question of how sophisticated

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.380
is go back to that experiment
that we were talking about,

00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:55.520
the Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin.

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.925
What they do is they offer their
subjects a lock-box.

00:56:57.925 --> 00:57:03.940
A lock-box is just a box where
the key is usually kept with

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:07.720
someone else, so you don't
have access to the key.

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.065
You can put money into it.

00:57:09.065 --> 00:57:12.460
It's just a money box.

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:16.570
And they were told that
you can set you goal.

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:24.940
Your goal can be either a date,
so I'll break the box,

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:29.360
I'll open the box
at Christmas.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.930
Or it could be an
amount of money.

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:34.380
I'll open the box once
I have $200 in it.

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:44.150
So if you look at what people
say, most people want it on a

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:51.450
date, so a huge fraction say
I want it on Christmas, my

00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:55.060
wife's birthday, my husband's
birthday, my son's birthday,

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:58.030
my child's graduation,
something like that.

00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:01.960
Then some people have an
amount based goal.

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:06.140
They say that I need it for
buying a house, so I need this

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:07.450
much money.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:10.390
But most people seemed to
set time-based goals.

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:22.440
Now, out of 1,7000 people,
only 200 people

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.060
wanted these boxes.

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.210
So not everybody wanted it.

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:35.300
In fact, only one out of eight,
roughly, wanted one of

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.550
these boxes.

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:48.570
But among those who did, there's
a massive effect of

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:49.660
being hyperbolic.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:54.680
Hyperbolic are those people who
are patient in the future

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.880
but impatient now.

00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:03.030
Those are the people who really
wanted the lock-boxes,

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:04.210
so that's what you'd expect.

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:10.360
You'd expect that somebody who
is fundamentally patient, but

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:16.070
is impatient right now, is the
one who wants a lock-box

00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:19.580
because they do see the
value of saving.

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.770
They're patient fundamentally,
but they're impatient right

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:25.010
now in the moment.

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:27.270
Those are the people who would
want a lock-box, and that's

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:28.520
exactly what you find.

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:31.610
You find that the people who
want the lock-box tend to be

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:36.690
people who are patient in
general, in the future are

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:39.510
patient, but are less
patient right now.

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:42.320
They want the lock-box to kind
of bind their hands.

00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:54.450
So they seem to know that
they're hyperbolic, so a lot

00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:57.640
of these people seem to know
they're hyperbolic.

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.190
They seem to realize that they
have this problem, so they're

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:01.570
not unsophisticated.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:04.940
They seem to be relatively aware
of their-- they're not,

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:06.570
at least, totally
unsophisticated.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:08.140
They seem to have some
awareness of their

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.640
self-control problem.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.320
The other striking thing is
only women are effected.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:21.120
Men don't seem to understand
they have this problem, even

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.080
though they do, actually.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:26.760
So women seem to understand
they have a problem.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.275
Men also have the same problem,
but they don't seem

01:00:29.275 --> 01:00:31.000
to understand it.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.190
Now, here's another experiment,
last experiment we

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:43.170
will talk about, which gives a
different take to this men

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:44.420
versus women question.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:52.820
We've been talking a lot about
this kind of hyperbolic view,

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.340
which says that I'm worried that
I won't be able to save.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.690
An alternative view of why
people don't save is they feel

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:05.160
like I want to save, but I
know that I can't because

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.450
somebody else will come and
take the money away.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.800
My husband will spend it, or my
brother will come and beg

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.040
me money, and I'll have to give
it to him or something.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.940
So one other reason for not
saving, which is related, and

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:27.500
one reason why women might want
a lock-box more might not

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.740
be because just that
they're hyperbolic.

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:33.540
They might also worry about the
fact that their husbands

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:38.710
will just take away the money,
and that might explain their

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:42.380
demand for lock-boxes, that they
want to keep the money

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.580
away from their husband and say
that we can't get at the

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.210
money right now.

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:52.270
So this is an experiment
in a bank.

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:58.280
This one was done by Simone
Schaner, who was a

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:02.320
PhD Student at MIT.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.910
So this is a bank, and
basically, she invited a bunch

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:12.440
of married couples to the bank
and said do you want to open

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.230
an account.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:18.315
And the accounts she offered
had came in three types.

01:02:18.315 --> 01:02:24.730
I mean, everybody was offered
one joint account for two

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:29.690
spouses, one wife's account,
and one husband's account.

01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:32.410
The reason why they did that,
she was trying to get at this

01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:36.130
idea that maybe if I have a
joint account with my husband,

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:39.910
that's not very good because
he can take out the money.

01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:42.490
If I want to have an account,
I want full control of it.

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:52.700
So what she's interested in is
this question, are people

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.550
sufficiently aware of this
problem that they're willing

01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:58.500
to give up a high return
account to

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.750
have their own account?

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:07.040
So the design of the experiment
is one where,

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.940
sometimes, randomly, the joint
account has the highest

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:14.420
interest rate, and your own
account has a very low

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:15.990
interest rate.

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.720
And what she's interested in is
whether you would give up

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.400
getting a high interest
rate account to

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.720
get your own account.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.320
So for the whole family, it
would be better to get a joint

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.100
account in terms of returns.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:38.470
So the returns can vary between
0% to 10%, so you

01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:41.620
could be getting 10% on the
account instead of zero, but

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:46.360
you might choose zero because
you don't want your wife or

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.335
husband to get at it.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.910
So I'll skip this.

01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:02.310
This just explain the point.

01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:05.890
The point is that people got
different accounts offered, so

01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:08.560
some people were offered a
joint account with the

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:14.040
interest rate zero, a man's
account with interest rate

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:19.640
zero, but a joint account
with interest rate two.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.680
So this is sort of just to
understand the experiment, you

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.630
might be someone who gets the
joint account interest rates

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:32.310
could be 10, but the man's
account interest rate could be

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:34.710
zero, and the woman's account
interest rate could be two.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:49.600
So what's in the squares are
the excess interest rate on

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:55.560
the account you're choosing, so
maybe you choose an account

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.650
which gives you 4%.

01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:01.080
You could have gotten the best
account you could have got

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.640
would have interest
rate of 10.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.390
Your excess interest rate is
negative in that case.

01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:08.530
You are getting a -6%
on the interest.

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:11.350
So the question here, the reason
why this experiment is

01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:14.920
interesting, you're trying to
figure out do people give up

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:21.850
getting lots of extra money
to make sure that somebody

01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:23.477
doesn't have access
to their account.

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:34.360
So first thing she did
was to figure out--

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.350
she'll administer
these questions

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:42.426
where they ask them--

01:05:42.426 --> 01:05:44.890
it's kind of like the questions
we were asking.

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:56.190
How much money would you give
up today for 290 Kenyan

01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:59.940
shillings tomorrow?

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:03.030
So these are questions basically
aimed to measure how

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:06.000
impatient people.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.310
Would you take 20 today or 200
tomorrow, and if you say 20

01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:12.665
today, you're very impatient,
obviously.

01:06:12.665 --> 01:06:15.650
So that's the kind of question
she was asking.

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:21.520
So what she did, by using that,
what she figured out was

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.380
who are the couples who
are well matched.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:28.570
So if I'm impatient and my wife
is impatient, that's no

01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:31.340
problem because neither
of us want to save.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:36.760
So I don't have to tie my
husband's hands or my wife's

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:42.730
hands because I have the same
preferences as she does, and

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:45.810
therefore, if she wants to
spend, I also want to spend.

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:52.450
Then there are couple which are
both parties are patient,

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:57.450
so if one wants to save, the
other wants to save.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.610
And then there are people
who were given--

01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:08.240
the couples which
are ill matched.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:11.630
Ill matched couples are where
one says I want to save now,

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:14.880
the other says I want
to spend now.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.670
So they're ill matched
couples.

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:20.960
Now, it's the ill matched
couples that are going to

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.510
choose accounts that
have low returns.

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:29.940
If you're well matched, it
really doesn't matter who's

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:33.340
name the account is in because
we have the same objectives.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.850
We both want to spend now.

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:38.060
We both want to spend
in the future.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.980
Whatever we want to do,
we both want to do.

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:44.030
But if one of the spouses is
patient, and the other's

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:46.170
impatient, you have a problem.

01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:48.910
Now, it turns out, she went
with the hypothesis that

01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:51.300
she'll find that only the
men are impatient.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:55.760
Turns out it was about 50/50,
about men and women are

01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:00.280
equally likely to be less
patient than their spouse.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:04.500
But a lot of these households
were ill matched, so a lot of

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.650
the households had one spouse
who was very patient and the

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:10.700
other spouse who was
very impatient.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.930
That's a setting where you'd
imagine going back to the

01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:18.520
issue we were raising, as we
said, maybe people don't save

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.220
because they feel that
they can't save.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:28.220
If they try to save, the spouse
will just spend it.

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.609
So if one of the spouses is
patient, but the other's

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:33.970
impatient, the impatient
spouse kind of has an

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:36.760
advantage because once the
money's spent, it's gone.

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:42.779
The patient spouse will keep
guarding the money, but the

01:08:42.779 --> 01:08:46.240
impatient spouse, all she has
to do is to spend it.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.370
Once it's spent, it's gone, so
in a sense, the impatience

01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:53.710
spouse always has
an advantage.

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:56.910
So you're always fighting
against the impatience spouse.

01:08:56.910 --> 01:09:01.350
The patient spouse is always
trying to save it and can't do

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:04.380
much about it once the
money's spent.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.529
But as a patient spouse
is always--

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:09.430
if she's saved it through today,
she has to save it

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:10.399
through tomorrow.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:15.529
In some sense, it's kind of
an asymmetric problem.

01:09:15.529 --> 01:09:19.279
So what she's looking for is
what happens to these ill

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:20.529
matched couples.

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:28.929
So this is sort of just to give
a sense of how many are

01:09:28.929 --> 01:09:29.380
ill matched.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:30.114
Yeah, Melissa?

01:09:30.114 --> 01:09:31.364
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:09:35.926 --> 01:09:38.686
PROFESSOR: We'll be done
in two minutes.

01:09:38.686 --> 01:09:42.160
So this is a graph of
ill matched couples.

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.520
A lot of these are at zero.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.470
You can see zero means you have
the same discount factor.

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.080
You're equally patient.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.920
But you can see that there are
people who are difference of

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:06.000
-0.5, so that means
that I want it--

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.300
my discount factor is maybe
0.9, and my spouse is 0.4.

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.640
And look, it's basically
symmetrical.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.290
Men and women are
not different.

01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:19.450
It's just one of the
spouses is more

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:20.840
impatient than the other.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.160
And then what she looks at--

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.970
I'll skip these and show
you the picture.

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:29.530
So on the horizontal axis
is excess interest rate.

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:30.810
How much are you giving up?

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.500
When the wife's account has,
let's say, the highest

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:43.540
interest rate over the
other account--

01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:59.010
what fraction of the people
use the account more?

01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:02.420
And you can see that basically,
for well matched

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:06.880
couples, the shared saving in
that account is clearly

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.720
increasing with interest rate.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.570
If the interest rate
is higher, you save

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:11.930
more in that account.

01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:16.260
For ill matched couples, they
see no relationship.

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:20.800
You don't save more because the
account is more rewarding.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.100
Why?

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.750
Because it doesn't matter if
it's more rewarding or not.

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:28.000
You just don't want that on
the other guy to have that

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.300
access to that account.

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:37.000
So ill matched couples don't
react to the interest rate.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.800
Their priority is
something else.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.390
They want their own account.

01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:42.760
Doesn't matter whether that's
a low interest account.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.890
The well matched couples, you
see this, and you can see the

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:49.770
same thing for the
joint accounts.

01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:52.490
The joint accounts, again, it's
the same question, excess

01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:55.850
interest rate, share saving.

01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:58.970
The well matched couples, as the
interest rate goes up, you

01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:01.200
save more in that account.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.180
In the badly matched couples,
it doesn't matter.

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:05.050
Interest rate doesn't matter.

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:08.490
If you're badly matched, you
choose the one that you will

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:11.220
keep the other guy out.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.190
You're not the one that has
the highest interest rate.
