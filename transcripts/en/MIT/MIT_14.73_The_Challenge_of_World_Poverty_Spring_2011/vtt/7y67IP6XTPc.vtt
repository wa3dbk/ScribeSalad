00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.470
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.800
So I am Esther Duflo.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.820
I am the other person who
teaches this class.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.010
You had Abhijit for
the first class.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.040
I am going to start by doing
a bit of housekeeping.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.610
Keeping in mind that maybe
some people are going to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.480
arrive, so it is your
responsibility to inform

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.200
everybody else of what
I said today.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.070
I got some requests of
clarifying what was the

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.300
requirements for this
class, so I'll just

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.920
go through it once.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.580
So we are going to post
essay topics.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.390
For 10 topics.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.400
And we are going to give
three or four choices.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.090
You can also make
your own essays.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.600
Whatever it is.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.070
You do have a chance to
write up to 10 essays.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.830
But you don't need to
write that many.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.280
You are going to be graded
out of the best five.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.540
So you can write any between
one and ten.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.800
And if you have one you're not
going to have a very high

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.030
grade but--

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.640
Any between five and ten and
then we'll just take

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.500
the best five, OK?

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.200
I think the syllabus said seven
and Abhijit said five,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.910
so I went for the
easier thing.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.160
So that's one thing.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.890
The syllabus also said that we
might not grade all of them

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.730
but, actually, we are going
to grade all of them.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:50.350
So I would suggest that you do
the first one so that you get

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.560
used to it.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.560
Traditionally, it has been the
case that when students can

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.460
decide how to arrange their
deadlines, they think that

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.600
it's efficient to set all the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.340
deadlines late in the semester.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.850
I can tell you by experience
that it's actually exposed not

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.300
to be such a good idea.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.920
So if I were you, I would
arrange things to do as many

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.660
of them early as possible
so you don't get

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.910
panicked by the end.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.300
So that's one.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.090
The other component of the
requirement for this class is

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.050
to do the readings.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.670
And so to be prepared to
discuss in the class.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.480
One way in which we're going
to ensure that you're doing

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.220
the reading is a very,
very short pop-quizes

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.560
every once in awhile.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.140
It also means you have
to come to class.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.570
It's not a class that's
very difficult.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.490
But one thing that it requires
is that you actually come.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.580
And so we're going to have those
at any random times.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.380
Very simple.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.270
2, 3, 4 questions just to check
that you've actually

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.080
read the thing.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.770
And today the questions for the
first topic were already

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.600
posted on Stellar.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.030
So you already have access to
them as well as the deadline

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.300
for the first thing.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.070
And that's it.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.400
Other than that, I think I gave
a version of this spiel

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.950
in 14.74 yesterday.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.080
There are two development
classes.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.460
If you're wondering which one
you should be in, this one is

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.190
going to be more based
on the readings and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.920
discussion and lectures.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.060
And the other one's going to go
more in the detail of the

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.460
techniques of papers and
solving the models and

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.470
replicating empirical
papers, et cetera.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.450
So this one's a better
introduction and the other one

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.430
is better if you already have a
fair amount of economics and

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.990
econometrics.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.290
So that's the trade off.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.854
Other than that, obviously, the
themes that are going to

00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:06.530
be covered are going to
be pretty similar.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.720
So my sense is, probably, that
you don't want to take both at

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.900
the same time.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.480
Although you could think of
taking them both in sequence.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.580
Then you would do 73
first, 74 second.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.640
I don't recognize any 74
students, but you shouldn't

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.170
want to take 74 and then 73.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.470
That would be a bit boring.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.160
So you're welcome to shop a
little bit for some time and

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.440
then decide what's
more appropriate.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.280
You're welcome to take both but
I would have warned you

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.370
that there will be some overlap
between the two.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.930
That's it for housekeeping so if
you have questions, that's

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.190
a good time.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.980
I'm happy to answer questions by
email also but chances are

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.870
that if you have a question on
the logistics, a lot of people

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.120
share it as well.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.562
Any questions?

00:04:57.562 --> 00:04:58.812
No.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.030
The class is being recorded,
that's for OpenCourseWare.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.440
But don't worry about saying
anything embarrassing.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.100
That would be edited out.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.220
I'm the only one--

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.780
and Abhijit--

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.440
is going to be the only ones who
are being recorded on tape

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.970
saying things embarrassing.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.990
I'm assuming if you say
something extremely smart we

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.961
can keep it though.

00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:18.870
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.930
PROFESSOR: So there
is no danger.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:20.930
Feel free.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.090
Just ignore them.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.900
And hopefully, the idea is that
if it works well, it will

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.640
be one of these classes that
people can take on their own

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.890
down the line.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.830
Anything else?

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.920
Any questions?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.130
No questions?

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.490
When you speak, at the
beginning, if you at least

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.290
would state your name so
that I can possibly

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.445
get to know who are.

00:05:48.445 --> 00:05:49.870
I can address you
by your name.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.610
That would be nice.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.850
And otherwise, we're
ready to roll.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.500
Shall we dive in?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.750
Let's dive in.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:12.220
So, in the video that you saw
last time, you saw quite a few

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.110
people who were maybe trapped in
some kind of poverty trap.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.700
So for example, there was this
farmer who, before he was

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.095
given fertilizer, had
very low yield.

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:26.250
And because he had
very low yield he

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.500
didn't have much money.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.080
Because he didn't have much
money, he couldn't buy

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.020
fertilizer and, therefore,
he continued to

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.760
have very low yield.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.390
And what the Millennium Village
Project did is to give

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.340
him the fertilizer.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.770
And the hope was, that with this
first gift of fertilizer,

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.470
his yield would increase by a
sufficient amount that, down

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.160
the line, he would be able to
buy his own fertilizer.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.140
And grow more and more maize.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.680
And then, progressively, maybe
start feeding his children

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.220
better and buying them books
and all of those things you

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.040
want to think about.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:15.100
So in that video, the Sachs and
Jolie video that you saw

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.770
last time, this argument that
there might be these poverty

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.190
traps keep coming over
and over again.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:27.700
So for example, in the Kennedy
story with the farmers, you

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.630
see it in the schools.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.360
The schools don't have computers
so the kids cannot

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.590
really learn well.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.660
You start putting computers
and kids can learn better.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.160
They will then make
more money.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.390
They will then be able to buy
computers for their schools,

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.930
et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.000
So one of the things that we
are going to do a lot of in

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.040
this class is to try to
understand when there are such

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.620
poverty traps and
when, in fact,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.430
maybe it's not so obvious.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.130
And for that, we have to
understand what creates the

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.730
conditions for such poverty
traps to emerge.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.820
So what I want to do today--

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.470
we are going to delve in on one
example of one particular

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.870
poverty trap and how
that could work.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.160
Which is going to be the fact
that we are physical,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.760
biological bodies.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.520
But what we're going to go
over as a mechanism, it's

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.350
going to carry us during
the entire class.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.490
We are going to have to be
looking for the same type of

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.010
conditions.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.110
So I want to start with
a story of someone

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.950
that actually I met.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.409
I met some guy called
Pak Solhin.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.830
Pak means mister.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.160
Mister Solhin.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.900
So people in Indonesia don't
really have a first

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.680
name and last name.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.452
They just have a name.

00:08:51.452 --> 00:08:55.420
And so, for example, Mrs.
So-and-so is Ebu--

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.170
I would be Ebu Esther,
for example.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.110
So this guy is Pak Solhin.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.950
And I met him in a village
in Indonesia--

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.585
in Java, which is one of the
richest parts of Indonesia.

00:09:09.585 --> 00:09:13.130
This is the main island, most
densely populated--

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:18.270
in the summer of 2008.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.800
In the summer of 2008, I was--

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.150
probably for you it's already
ancient history, it's before

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:28.400
the great collapse of the
world economy and stuff.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.520
--One of the key events at the
time, for the developing

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.210
countries in particular,
was that the food

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.810
prices were very high.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:43.020
Basically since 2005, food
prices have increased

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.360
enormously in the world for
reasons that are not fully

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.900
understood.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.070
And then they collapsed
again when the whole

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.700
economy went berserk.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.360
The world economy went away,
the food prices also

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.370
collapsed, and they have started
to increase again.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.760
Part of the hunger that
you see now--

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.650
in Egypt, Tunisia, et cetera,
all over the Middle East--

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.760
part of it is fueled by a
re-increase in the food prices

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.610
which are almost reaching
the 2008 level.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.820
For people in urban areas,
this has, of course,

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.080
immediately threatened
their livelihood.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.430
Because they don't
produce food.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.260
They buy food.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.850
So as soon as the food prices
increase, that immediately

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.660
affects them.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:36.510
So the beginning of 2008,
2007 you observed this

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.280
kind of food riots--

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.600
nothing like we are seeing
now in Egypt--

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.930
but dis-content in various
urban areas.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.120
And generally, people were
wondering what was happening

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.610
to food prices.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.020
What people have been thinking
is that there are several

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.980
factors that are responsible
for the

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.850
increase of the food prices.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:02.840
One is there are many more
people in China and India

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.430
making more money.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.080
And as they are making more
money, not only they eat more

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.790
but, more that that,
they eat more meat.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.130
And it turns out that to produce
1,000 calories of

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.560
meat, you need much more
grain than to produce

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.430
1,000 calories of grain.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.110
That may sound strange, but it
turns out that the cow is not

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.240
a very efficient way to
transform the calories from

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.790
grain into calories
that we eat.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.420
The cow has started by using
a lot of it, et cetera.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.130
So to produce 1,000 calories
of cows, you need much more

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.070
than 1,000 calories
worth of grain.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.510
So as China and India is
becoming richer and eating

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.550
more meat, then there is a
demand for more grains.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.410
That's one.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.550
The second thing that is
happening is bio-fuels.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:57.881
With the increase in the world
prices of fuel there is more

00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:02.290
and more demand for bio-fuels,
so entire strips of Brazil

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.740
have been covered into
maize that is being

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.800
used to make ethanol.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:15.730
A third thing is oil is actually
an input into the

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.790
production of food.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.240
Because oil is a very important
input into the

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.090
production of fertilizer.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.730
So as the price of oil increase,
the price of

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.710
fertilizer increase,
and therefore the

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.650
price of food increases.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.850
So all of these factors are
fundamental forces which

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.300
explains why, after the short
dip right after the crisis,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.520
the food prices again
started to increase.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.580
So that's the backdrop
of my visit to

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.550
this village in Indonesia.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.240
And I met this guy.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.950
And he was all alone.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:57.110
He has a small, dingy,
little house.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.450
And he was a bit depressed,
or very depressed.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.700
And why was he depressed?

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.820
Well he was depressed because
he was all alone at home.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.890
And he was all alone at home
because his wife had gone to

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.920
the city to start working
as a maid.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:21.440
His oldest son had also gone to
the city to start working

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.680
as an apprentice on a
construction site.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.400
And the two young kids were
with the grandparents.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.950
So he was all alone, he didn't
have anything in his house, he

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.480
didn't do all that much,
and he wasn't happy.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.280
So the question is, why
did that happen?

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.300
Why was he not working?

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.390
And what he explained to me
is that he was not working

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.180
because he didn't have a job.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.040
And he didn't have a job because
when the fertilizer

00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:01.230
prices increased, the farmers
that used to employ him

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.120
decided that they had to do
something to cut costs.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.240
They weren't very sure whether
they were going to be able to

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.000
sell their outputs and they were
facing those increases in

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
expenditure.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.510
So they decided they
had to cut costs.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.270
And so they could have done
one of two things.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.520
What could they have done?

00:14:23.605 --> 00:14:23.790
Yeah?

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.928
AUDIENCE: They could have cut
wages or cut the number of

00:14:27.928 --> 00:14:28.870
people employed.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.320
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.980
They could have cut wages or
they could have cut the number

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.615
of people who worked for them.

00:14:33.615 --> 00:14:35.700
So of course, if they had
cut wages, he still

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.310
would have a job.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.020
But instead, they
cut employment.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.730
And why did they cut employment

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.650
rather than cut wages?

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:48.620
Well his theory was that if they
had cut wages, his wages

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.720
would've been so low that he
would not have been able to

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.250
buy enough food--

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.450
especially as the food prices
were rising at the same time--

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.830
with the equivalent of one day
of wage that would have been

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.750
too little to sustain himself
to be strong enough to

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.980
actually work for a whole day.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.670
So seeing that, the employer,
instead of cutting the wage

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.130
and therefore making him unable
to work, then you give

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.790
a wage of someone, let's
say, 1,000 rupiahs--

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:25.420
1,000 rupiahs is not enough to
get yourself energetic for a

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.290
full day of work.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.300
So you've spent your 1,000
rupiahs but the person can't

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.510
feed himself for
a day of work.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.412
You get nothing out of him,
so there's no point.

00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:34.662
Yes?

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.760
AUDIENCE: The question that came
to my mind was, is there

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.060
any truth to his theory?

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.406
Did you find any other examples
that would back up

00:15:43.406 --> 00:15:47.537
that that's the reason why the
farmer, that he used to work

00:15:47.537 --> 00:15:50.700
on his land, decided to cut
jobs instead of wages?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.480
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.250
What you're asking
is whether--

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:57.420
that's fine-- whether maybe
it's a plausible theory.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.370
But is there any truth to it?

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.800
We're going to spend a fair
amount of time on this very

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.290
question, not on Tuesday,
but starting Thursday.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:17.645
In terms of the empirical truth
of his theory, in terms

00:16:17.645 --> 00:16:26.160
of the biological soundness
of it, it

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.470
sounds plausible a priori.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.300
That you need to start with a
certain number of calories

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.480
just to get going, right?

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:41.690
Your body needs maybe 1,000
calories just to survive.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.915
So the first thousand calories
that you're consuming are not

00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:50.310
very useful to you to help you
to actually start exercising.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.190
Then, once you are alive,
the next calories

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.100
will start being useful.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.140
So a priori, maybe
there was some

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.050
plausibility to this theory.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.690
That's only one theory.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:08.250
So that means that he
lost his job so he

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.910
couldn't do much of anything.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.470
He was not doing nothing,
otherwise I would

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.079
not have met him.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.170
He would be dead.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.950
But he was doing things that
was not taking too

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.460
much effort for him.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:21.800
For example, he was sitting next
to the bank of a lake and

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.329
he was fishing.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.069
He was getting a little
bit of rice from

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.530
the government program.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:30.600
He was getting a little bit
of meals from his brother.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.700
But he was not really
living a full life.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.950
He was sort of surviving.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.470
So at the heart of
his theory--

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.780
and I think your question of
whether this is true or not is

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.570
a very interesting question
which certainly came to my

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.660
mind when I was talking
to him--

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.460
but at the heart of this
theory was this purely

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.926
biological mechanism.

00:17:51.926 --> 00:17:54.350
And then on top of this
biological mechanism, other

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.170
things crept up.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.890
One is the fact that he was not
doing anything, and that

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.770
his kids were gone.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.980
That made him depressed so
then it gave him very low

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.940
energy to actually
you do anything.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.230
So even if his theory was
wrong, he sort of became

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.550
trapped in a poverty trap that
may have been more of a

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.860
psychological one.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.850
Because he was there, sitting
all alone in his hut, unable

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.530
to do anything, thinking that
he was worthless, therefore,

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.930
in some sense, becoming
worthless.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:32.810
There are other parts of his
stories where we start seeing

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.160
other bits of poverty trap.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.980
For example, what happened
with his kid.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:43.420
So the kid who had to drop out
of school to start working as

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.860
a construction worker was
actually a bright kid.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.560
So that's another place
where you see now an

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.690
inter-generational
poverty trap.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:58.460
Where because the parents are
poor, the kid has to drop out

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.140
of school because he has to go
to work and therefore himself

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.235
will probably make less
money down the line.

00:19:03.235 --> 00:19:06.370
And that's another thing where
we have to ask exactly the

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.940
same question you were
asking before.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.640
Is it an isolated example?

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.050
Or is it something that
is generalized.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.420
That it's actually something
like the inability to work for

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.310
the parents, or the lack of
income, that forces kids to

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.840
stay out of school that
could have otherwise

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.340
have gotten an education.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.140
That's another place where we
can find, potentially, a

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.100
poverty trap.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.380
Where the kid got
some schools.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.970
He got a few years of school but
maybe not enough for it to

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.560
be sufficient for him to
actually get a good

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.810
job down the line.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.120
And for himself, he couldn't
work as a construction worker

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.180
because he was too weak for the
basic jobs which require

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.840
some strength, and too unskilled
for the better jobs,

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.305
and too old to be an apprentice
like his kid.

00:19:56.305 --> 00:19:59.470
He was kind of trapped.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:09.080
So what is happening in this
story that you would think--

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.600
even if we accept the biological
mechanism, which I

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.490
want to go back into in
detail in a moment--

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.260
something else could
have happened.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.520
So for example--

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:27.045
if we're thinking that his
being out of a job is a

00:20:27.045 --> 00:20:28.930
temporary phenomenon--

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.630
maybe he could have gotten a
loan to sustain his family so

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:37.910
that the kid could at least stay
in school until the time

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.380
for him to graduate.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.150
Then at least you wouldn't
have that

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.530
inter-generational trap.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.580
So at the heart of it, we have
this biological phenomenon and

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:57.790
then other things sort of creep
in that maintain him in

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.880
this position that creates
the poverty trap.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.530
So what I want to do now
is go through the

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.120
biological story in detail.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:13.190
And then we're going to see how
the other things add up,

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.156
creep in, and create
that trap.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.490
So let's go through the
biological poverty trap.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.240
I should say that it's
one of the most

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.005
ancient ideas in economics.

00:21:29.005 --> 00:21:30.320
A very old idea .

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.680
It dates at least
from the 1950s.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.500
And this is an old
idea exactly in

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.940
this form of the biology.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.440
So the idea is that the first
few calories that you get to

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.980
consume are used by your
body just to survive.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.770
So they don't make you strong.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.740
And then, when you start eating
enough to survive, the

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.060
next calories start giving
you strength.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:04.310
So that's when you can start
working out or you can work.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.130
So someone who is very poor,
like Pak Solhin, may not have

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.770
enough to eat to be very
productive but if he could eat

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.890
more, then he would
become productive.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.160
So at the heart of this is this
idea of what they call a

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.610
capacity curve.

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:24.630
And a capacity curve has
something like this shape.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:32.570
It relates how much effort you
can exercise to how much

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:36.850
income you have, and, of course,
how much income you

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.300
have is supposed to be related
to how much you consume.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.846
So what is the assumption that
is underlying the fact I have

00:22:44.846 --> 00:22:46.380
put income here on the x-axis?

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.475
Yep?

00:22:49.475 --> 00:22:51.350
AUDIENCE: The more money you
have the more you eat.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.760
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.980
The more money you have
the more you eat.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.890
So for example, the simplest
case would be, all

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.940
you have, you eat.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.060
Of course, we know that it's not
true because you also need

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.050
to take care of your
basic needs.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.240
You need to clothe yourself.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.210
You need to pay your children's
school fee.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.410
Maybe you need something
for your housing.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:13.300
So maybe you will only consume
a part of your income.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.110
But maybe some fraction
of what you have,

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.910
you're going to eat.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.120
So that creates a relationship
between the income you have

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.930
today and how much
you get to eat.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.190
So instead of income here, we
could have calories consumed.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:34.050
And one first big question that
we'll have to answer next

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:37.850
time is, how steep is this
relationship between how much

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:42.380
income people have and how
much they are eating.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.040
Here we are assuming that there
is some relationship and

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.640
it's formidably steep enough.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.960
So whenever you have income,
you start eating.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:58.910
And what we have here on the
left, on the x-axis is the

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.770
work capacity.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.540
So how many bushels of wheat
are you able to harvest or

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.505
something like that.

00:24:08.505 --> 00:24:13.280
How many trenches can you dig.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.870
So the work capacity,
you think of

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.910
it as physical output.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.550
But of course, there could be
a relationship between this

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.530
physical output and your
income tomorrow.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.260
Because, for example, you could
be paid by the piece.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.150
So if you're paid by the piece,
however many bushel of

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.850
wheat you harvest, you
get that much income.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.492
That creates the work capacity
and your income tomorrow are

00:24:36.492 --> 00:24:38.310
related one for one.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.150
Right?

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:42.390
So here we have income
today, work capacity.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.340
And instead, we could
have income

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.960
today and income tomorrow.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.560
OK?

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.380
Now why is this shaped
the way it is?

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.545
What does the shape represent?

00:24:59.315 --> 00:25:02.261
AUDIENCE: The left part is the
part where your body is just

00:25:02.261 --> 00:25:03.243
able to survive.

00:25:03.243 --> 00:25:06.189
And then afterwards he gets a
chance to actually make more

00:25:06.189 --> 00:25:09.150
money tomorrow because
[INAUDIBLE].

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:09.410
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.490
So the left part is the first
part where you're just getting

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.900
enough to survive.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.230
You are just eating
enough to survive.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.330
So the first few calories are
good because they keep you

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.870
alive so you can actually
move about.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.760
But after that it just keeps you
at this kind of low level.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.260
Right?

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:32.470
And then you start having, maybe
1,200, 1,500 calories.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:36.080
And then suddenly, it's a good
breakfast you're eating before

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.940
going out for your run.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:45.140
It shoots up and then, why does
it flatten out again?

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.614
Yeah?

00:25:45.614 --> 00:25:47.510
AUDIENCE: Because after a while
you're satisfied and it

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.940
levels out once [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.320
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.490
After a while it satisfy
and it levels out.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.550
And if we had continued the
curve, what would happen?

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:55.410
It would really go down.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:59.130
Just think of post-Thanksgiving
slump and

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:03.130
she probably gets a deep
down going line.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:08.510
So that creates this kind of
funny shape between you're

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.410
income today and your work
capacity and, therefore,

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:14.080
between your income today and
your income tomorrow.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.370
Or it could be within a week or
something like that, right?

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:22.700
Which seems to have a reasonable
biological sense.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:33.180
Now what happened when the
price of food went up?

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.180
What does it do to the
work capacity?

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:39.860
Yeah?

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.500
AUDIENCE: I suppose it goes down
because those people have

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.380
to spend more of their
income on food and

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.060
then buy less food.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.030
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:58.775
So what happens when the price
of food goes up is that, in

00:26:58.775 --> 00:27:01.440
terms of bushels of wheat,
that's the same thing.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.250
But in terms of actual income
that the bushel of wheat

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.130
transform into-- how
much income-- that

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.330
creates a jump down.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:17.980
Because to go from income to
work capacity, to create from

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.710
income today to calorie,
that's more expensive.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.900
So the curve shifts down because
for every dollar that

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:31.320
you spend, or rupiah that you
spend on food, that's fewer

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.840
calories and, therefore, that
shifts down whatever you are

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.050
able to achieve in terms
of capacity, right?

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:43.050
So if we have it in the form
of income to work capacity,

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:48.796
the prices of food going up
makes the curve going down.

00:27:48.796 --> 00:27:49.768
Yeah?

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:52.198
AUDIENCE: Could you also, if
you were talking about

00:27:52.198 --> 00:27:54.142
students, instead of saying the
word capacity, I'd put the

00:27:54.142 --> 00:27:56.669
way you pay attention?

00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:59.002
Would they pay more attention
if they ate more?

00:27:59.002 --> 00:28:01.432
Or is it just physical spending
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:01.432 --> 00:28:01.920
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.030
Here, if we're thinking of Pak
Solhin, we are thinking about

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:05.860
physical [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.650
But if we're thinking about
Pak Solhin's children, for

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.340
example, it could well be their

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.920
capacity to focus in class.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.190
And it could easily have
the same shape.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.950
In fact, there are other thing
that competes also for

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:18.780
calories for children.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.480
For example, whether or not they
have intestinal worms.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.270
And the intestinal worms also
shift your work capacity, your

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.790
attention capacity,
down because they

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.760
are eating your food.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.100
Therefore, that tends to make
the kids anemic and less

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.660
likely to be listening.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.370
That's exactly right.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.830
Yeah?

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.151
AUDIENCE: And so increase in
food prices, does that cause a

00:28:38.151 --> 00:28:40.226
shift or a stretch?

00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:42.475
PROFESSOR: It specifically
causes shift and a--

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.480
how would you call it,
west-southwest, right?--

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.060
It is both a shift
and a stretch.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:59.010
Which is, it will take more of
your income today to have you

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.440
switch to the--

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.700
think of it going this way.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:08.420
And alternatively,
what happens when

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.220
the wages go down?

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.540
That's another thing
we can look at.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.240
What happens to the
work capacity?

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:20.790
Not to the work capacity, but if
we put income on the y-axis

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.260
now and the wages go down?

00:29:27.026 --> 00:29:27.948
AUDIENCE: It shifts lower.

00:29:27.948 --> 00:29:30.970
PROFESSOR: It again will do the
same thing because now the

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:35.740
same work capacity will
translate into less income.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.640
So what was happening in
Indonesia in 2008 was, on the

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.040
one hand, food prices
were going up.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.540
On the other hand, farmers were
stressed out because the

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.400
input prices were going up.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.020
So at the same time they wanted
to reduce the wages

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.410
when the prices were
increased.

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:59.640
And both of these phenomenon
create this southwest shift in

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.709
the capacity curve.

00:30:00.709 --> 00:30:01.198
Yeah?

00:30:01.198 --> 00:30:02.909
AUDIENCE: Why didn't the farmers
just increase the

00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:06.090
prices they were selling the
crops at [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.260
PROFESSOR: That's an excellent
question, so why didn't the

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.730
farmer just increase
the prices?

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.860
The thing is that with the
agricultural cycle, you

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.490
produce and then-- so you put
your fertilizer in the ground,

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.810
then you put your crop
in the ground and

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:22.490
then you wait around.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.190
Then the crop comes and
you try to sell it.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:29.130
And you're exactly right, the
fact that the input prices

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.260
have gone up while the demand,
in principal, would

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.010
not have gone up.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:37.790
It would have meant that the
food prices sold by the farmer

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.580
would probably go up.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.570
But what happened is that they
weren't very sure whether or

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.790
not the food prices were going
to go up by the time they sold

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:49.400
their food in proportion
to the input prices.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.820
So the situation that prevailed
in 2008 is a lot of

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.900
volatility.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.050
The prices were high but they
were also increasing.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.755
And that was true for the input
prices and that was true

00:31:01.755 --> 00:31:03.400
for the output prices.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.590
And when you were talking to
the farmer, everybody felt

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.320
that they were holding the
short end of the stick.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.195
The farmers were saying,
well, yes, the

00:31:11.195 --> 00:31:12.350
food prices will increase.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.480
But we don't know whether it
will increase enough to cover

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.100
our input prices.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.830
Moreover, the farmers found
it difficult to

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.290
get loans, for example.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:25.530
So even if they know that the
prices are going to go up for

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.380
that input in the future, in the
meantime, they still have

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.670
to buy the fertilizer.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:32.350
So they sort of had
to cut costs now.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.060
So this is a little bit
what was happening.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.520
It's a mismatch between the
price you have to pay for the

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.100
fertilizer today.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.780
And you're going to realize
the output in the future.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.150
So that creates this uncertainty
plus the fact that

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:46.650
you need to finance it
one way or the other.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:52.310
Which is why, at that time,
there were two things going on

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.530
which were both against
the poor guy.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.870
So this is what we have with
the capacity curve.

00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:11.582
So we've had this reasoning for
food but let's think a bit

00:32:11.582 --> 00:32:14.390
about other reasons--

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:19.010
forget that we are talking about
physical work capacity.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:24.560
Think about other reasons why
there might be a relationship

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.610
between your income today
and an income at some

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.360
point in the future.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:35.170
Think of the next generation,
think of next month, or

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.090
anything like that.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:42.010
Can you think of other reasons
why this kind of funnily

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:46.370
shaped curve might appear?

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.410
So food might be one.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.965
What would be other reasons why
this funnily shaped curve

00:32:52.965 --> 00:32:54.215
might appear?

00:32:57.526 --> 00:32:58.013
Yeah?

00:32:58.013 --> 00:33:00.460
AUDIENCE: Over the long
term, maybe education.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.400
PROFESSOR: So let's go through
the education one.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.138
Why do you think--

00:33:06.138 --> 00:33:11.008
AUDIENCE: Before, the less long
you can afford to keep

00:33:11.008 --> 00:33:12.469
you're children in school.

00:33:12.469 --> 00:33:17.339
And so their income capacity
isn't as low as yours was.

00:33:17.339 --> 00:33:20.504
But the richer you are, the more
schooling you can get and

00:33:20.504 --> 00:33:22.230
the higher income you
can [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.290
PROFESSOR: So this is right.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.720
That there is probably a
relationship between how long

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.500
you can keep the
kid in school--

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.620
because if there are school fees
you might or might not be

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.100
able to afford them.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:36.410
Or there might also be an
opportunity cost for the child

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.310
to be in school.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.710
Like Pak Solhin's son couldn't
afford to be in school because

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.100
he had to work.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.360
So I think it's not very
controversial to say there

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.560
might be a relationship between
your income today and

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.120
how long your kid will
stay in school.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.310
And then, there is probably a
relationship between how long

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.870
your kids can stay in school
and their income.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:01.320
Which will create a relationship
between your

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.140
income today and the income
of the child.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.830
So that creates a relationship
of some form or another.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.510
But what would be necessary for
this relationship to have

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.570
this S-shape?

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:18.989
So what you have explained, I
think and I think most people

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:19.659
would agree--

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:21.880
we can ask around-- but I think
what you have explained

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.575
clearly is that we might expect
through education--

00:34:25.575 --> 00:34:28.179
a relationship between
income today and

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.080
income of the children.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.909
Now what else do you need for
that relationship to have this

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:36.066
funny shape?

00:34:36.066 --> 00:34:37.542
AUDIENCE: At the start, you
need to invest more.

00:34:37.542 --> 00:34:42.954
So like if they just learn to
fifth grade, or if they just

00:34:42.954 --> 00:34:45.168
learn to second grade, it isn't
going to make that much

00:34:45.168 --> 00:34:45.906
of a difference.

00:34:45.906 --> 00:34:48.612
But as they finish middle school
and high school, it's a

00:34:48.612 --> 00:34:50.826
much steeper curve.

00:34:50.826 --> 00:34:55.254
But then, going to college
versus Ph.D. levels off.

00:34:55.254 --> 00:34:55.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:00.500
Sadly, going to a Ph.D usually
leads to a drop in income

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.950
compared to having gone
to a Master's.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.880
Especially if you choose
the Master's properly.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.040
But this is exactly
that, which is we

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.470
need one more thing.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.140
What you're saying
is exactly right.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.985
What's your name?

00:35:12.985 --> 00:35:13.835
AUDIENCE: Yousef.

00:35:13.835 --> 00:35:14.260
PROFESSOR: Yousef.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.060
But what she told us is you
need one more thing.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.950
You also need for the benefits
of the first few years of

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:24.240
education to be relatively
low.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.010
And that's an empirical question
that goes back to the

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.580
plausibility question that
you were asking earlier.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:34.860
Is it the case that the first
few years of education are

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.181
useless, or not very useful?

00:35:38.181 --> 00:35:40.380
Or is it the case that every
year of education

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.810
is a year of education.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:47.750
And there will be an S-shaped
based on education if the

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.970
first few years of education
are not that useful.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:53.260
And [INAUDIBLE], if in fact,
even the first few years of

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.100
education are that useful.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.130
I'm not going to answer
this question now.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.820
But we are going to answer it in
due course, whether or not

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.880
this is the case.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.660
You see that this is not
something that we can just

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.600
think of in the abstract.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.780
We have to find out.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.700
There could be reasons
the other way.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.050
You could feel, for example,
that the first years of

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.190
education are amazingly useful
because this is when

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.760
you learn to read.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.930
And once you know how to read,
who cares about all of these

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.040
things that I'm trying to teach
you because you can

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.060
teach yourself everything
you need to know.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:27.010
Or you could think that
education is not useful unless

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.190
you have a secondary degree.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.910
Because that's what opens
the door to you for

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:33.920
various formal jobs.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.600
Right?

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.230
It could easily cut one
way or the other.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.390
I don't know if you guys
have an insight.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.390
For example, what
is your view?

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:46.210
Do you think that this is likely
that the first few

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.836
years of education are
not so useful or--

00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:51.266
AUDIENCE: I think the first
few years are very useful

00:36:51.266 --> 00:36:52.724
because some people
learn to develop,

00:36:52.724 --> 00:36:54.182
like, love for reading.

00:36:54.182 --> 00:36:57.584
And actually realize that they
can learn things by reading

00:36:57.584 --> 00:36:59.060
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.085
PROFESSOR: So for example, you
think that, the first few

00:37:02.085 --> 00:37:03.930
years of education
are very useful.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.350
So there would be a relationship
between income

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:07.650
today and income
of my children.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.820
But it wouldn't have this shape
if that is the case.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.050
In fact, it might have a
completely opposite shape

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:17.890
where it's more like an inverted
L as opposed to an S.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:19.400
So education would be one.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:23.920
What would be another
possibility for this funnily

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.170
looking shape to appear between
income today and

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:28.670
income at some point
in the future?

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:31.580
Is it on my income in the future
or the income of my

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.480
children or my income
next year?

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.520
What would be other sources
of such shapes?

00:37:40.534 --> 00:37:42.830
Yeah?

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.216
AUDIENCE: Access in knowledge
of, like, the job market.

00:37:45.216 --> 00:37:48.965
In the sense that if you were
raised in a family that's a

00:37:48.965 --> 00:37:51.084
higher income and so, therefore,
your parents would

00:37:51.084 --> 00:37:53.162
teach you more from a younger
age and would allow you to

00:37:53.162 --> 00:37:55.000
have a higher income.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.285
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:37:55.285 --> 00:38:00.850
So for example, for access
to the job market, it is

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:07.270
possible-- if I can rephrase
what you are saying-- that

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:11.260
people who live in a village,
their horizon is the village.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.850
Where they are growing
whatever.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:17.120
They are growing stuff and they
are making some income.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.240
But they don't have the
perspective in mind that they

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.330
could go to the city where
there a number

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.530
of other jobs available.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.840
So in that case, for people who
have very little money and

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.030
live in the village, well, their
children will again also

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.790
live in the village and have
very little money.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:39.340
If suddenly something opens the
possibility to go to the

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.850
city-- for example, someone
comes into some money, gets

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.820
the option to buy a train
ticket, goes to the city and

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.510
figures out the options there.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:52.420
Then suddenly you have access
to a number of other

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.560
opportunities, potentially
much more rewarding, that

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.130
would potentially create
this S-shape.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.836
Where the fact of being poor
means that you live in a

00:39:01.836 --> 00:39:02.900
relatively restricted
environment.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.240
You stay there.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:09.170
And then when you become just a
bit richer, that opens this

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:12.770
opportunity that helps you
you become much richer.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:13.740
That's a very nice example.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.730
Yeah?

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:18.442
AUDIENCE: Another option is
savings which depends on how

00:39:18.442 --> 00:39:19.432
much income you have.

00:39:19.432 --> 00:39:22.650
Because the more you save, the
more you invest and the higher

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.135
income producing activities.

00:39:24.135 --> 00:39:26.362
So the poor people have
no money to save so

00:39:26.362 --> 00:39:27.600
they're stuck there.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.570
But as they get more income you
can afford to save more

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:34.530
and invest more and it pushes
your future earnings.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:34.830
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:38.150
So saving is a very interesting
example.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:42.010
Again you could say-- well,
suppose for example, that

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:45.610
people saved some fixed fraction
of their income.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:49.130
Then if I have more income
today I will save more.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.500
Therefore, I will invest more,
therefore, I will be richer in

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.970
the future.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:40:01.400
Now if it was a fixed fraction
of my income, again, I would

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.340
definitely see a relationship
between income today and

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.090
income tomorrow just because
I save more.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:11.110
But if it's a fixed fraction of
my income, what else do I

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:16.100
need for this S-shape to come?

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.000
Yes?

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.362
AUDIENCE: You need for poor
people to not be able to save

00:40:19.362 --> 00:40:20.358
this fraction.

00:40:20.358 --> 00:40:22.848
Because they, for instance,
spend their money on food or

00:40:22.848 --> 00:40:24.840
things that they need
to buy today.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.326
And so are either a fraction
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:28.326 --> 00:40:32.970
income or it's just lower
for poor people.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:33.170
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:36.560
So the first possibility for
an S-shape to appear due to

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.770
savings is that actually people
do not save a fixed

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.360
fraction of their income.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.190
Is that for some reason, the
poor save less than the rich.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:52.530
So if that's the case-- and
let's talk through whether we

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:54.790
have reasons to think that
the poor would save

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.140
less than the rich--

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.550
but let's first take it as given
for a moment, and let's

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.950
assume the poor save
less than the rich.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.130
And if that's the case--

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.710
assume the poor save nothing--

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:10.280
then if you're very poor, you
have no income tomorrow coming

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.820
out of investments.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:14.630
And then if you start saving
when you become a little

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:18.040
richer and that money is
invested, that starts creating

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.200
some return for that money and
you get into this steeper part

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.300
of the S-shape.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.770
So that's a first mechanism
through which savings could

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.390
create a relationship between
your income today and your

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:31.120
income tomorrow that would
have this S-shape.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.530
Now what we do have to explain
is why is it the case that the

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.025
poor would be able to save
less than the rich?

00:41:37.025 --> 00:41:40.920
And that is something that, I
think, we all have in mind.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.730
Say, yes, of course, the
poor don't save because

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:44.460
they have no money.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.930
But one thing I want you to keep
in mind is that the poor

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.000
have no money but they
have a present

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.470
and they have a future.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:54.520
So unless they think that they
will have more money tomorrow

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.020
or unless, for some reason, they
are extremely impatient,

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.270
then the poor should want
to save as well.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:01.930
Because, of course, today
they have very

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:02.670
little money for food.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.580
But tomorrow they'll have very
little for food as well.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.000
So we need to go a little
further than to say, well, of

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.010
course the poor save because
they have no money.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:12.040
Right?

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.830
Again, let's not go into
the details of that.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:16.640
I think there are good reasons
to think that the poor would

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.385
be less able to save
than the rich.

00:42:18.385 --> 00:42:21.570
And we're going to have
a whole set of

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.200
lectures about that.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.600
But just keep in mind that it's
not so obvious that the

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.359
poor would be less
likely to save.

00:42:30.359 --> 00:42:31.750
Another--

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:32.980
sorry, you wanted to talk.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.865
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:33.865 --> 00:42:35.706
access to healthcare
and medicine.

00:42:35.706 --> 00:42:35.934
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:42:35.934 --> 00:42:37.010
So let's go to health.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.830
Let's finish saving
and then I'll go

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:40.380
back to you for health.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.790
Another reason why there might
be a relationship between

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.480
income today and income
tomorrow of

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.730
this form due to savings.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.350
Suppose that the poor and the
rich saved both a proportion

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:55.470
of their income.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:58.220
There could still be a
relationship like that.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:58.927
Yeah?

00:42:58.927 --> 00:43:02.743
AUDIENCE: The rich could be able
to invest their savings

00:43:02.743 --> 00:43:03.700
more effectively.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:04.340
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.930
It could be that the rich have
access to better investment

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:09.390
opportunity.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:13.080
For example, it could be that
the bank is just not

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.500
interested in very small
saving accounts.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.580
And in fact, it's the case
that the banks are not

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.680
interested in very small
saving accounts.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.890
Because as soon as you're a bank
and you take the saving

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:25.900
of someone, the government is on
your back to make sure that

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.490
you don't run away
with the saving--

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:30.830
which is a good idea--
but that costs money.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.300
So maintaining a saving account
for someone costs some

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.800
amount of money.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.470
And regardless of the size of
the account, it still costs

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:40.590
the same money because you need
to do all the paperwork.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:43.680
So as a result, if you come to a
bank with your five rupiahs,

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.450
the bank is going to say, thank
you, but I don't want

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:48.020
your five rupiahs.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.910
Whereas, if you come with your
5,000 rupiahs they're, sure,

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:54.820
I'm going to put it in this very
nice account for you with

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.290
a nice return.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:59.050
So that's one reason
right there.

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:02.565
That the poor might have to save
under the mattress where

00:44:02.565 --> 00:44:04.025
the money might disappear.

00:44:04.025 --> 00:44:05.850
Where it might be stolen.

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:08.200
And so the return on
saving for the poor

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:08.875
might be very low.

00:44:08.875 --> 00:44:10.900
It might even be negative.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:14.990
Whereas, the return for the rich
might be higher, either

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:20.690
because they have access to this
savings account or they

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:25.170
can, for example, start
a small business.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:28.160
For example, when you want to
start a small business, is it

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.300
worthwhile starting a tiny
business with almost nothing?

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:31.730
Maybe not.

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:34.820
Maybe it needs to be large
enough for it to be

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.360
worthwhile.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.680
So even if the poor and the
rich were to save the same

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.310
amount proportionally, there
might still be something

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:44.290
related, not to how much they
save, but what's the

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:47.730
productivity of those savings.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.480
You were talking about
health care.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.980
Why don't you tell us what
you're thinking about

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:51.656
healthcare.

00:44:51.656 --> 00:44:55.086
AUDIENCE: So at lower incomes
you can't really

00:44:55.086 --> 00:44:56.030
buy a lot of medicine.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.870
And maybe you can reach a point
where you can start

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.354
buying medicines or
buying healthcare.

00:45:01.354 --> 00:45:05.286
And maybe towards the end when
you have higher income, it

00:45:05.286 --> 00:45:09.186
levels off because you don't
encounter the health problems

00:45:09.186 --> 00:45:12.162
that you might at low incomes
in the first place.

00:45:12.162 --> 00:45:12.658
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:12.658 --> 00:45:15.095
So healthcare might be another
source of that.

00:45:15.095 --> 00:45:19.720
For example, if you're very
poor, you might not be able to

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:26.240
purchase very simple, relatively
cheap technologies

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.500
that prevent you from
getting sick.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.890
It could be a covering
for your water.

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:33.610
It could be a water filter.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:37.930
It could be a bed net to put on
top of your kids when they

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.160
sleep so that they don't
get malaria.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.550
So all of these things might
all be like some fixed

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.980
investment that, if you
can't afford them, you

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.590
can't afford them.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:51.370
And then you are getting sick
more, therefore you are less

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:56.060
productive, therefore you make
less money, et cetera.

00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:03.620
So that's another source where
we would have this S-shape.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.720
Then we again have to think
about these goods as things

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.860
that are a little bit lumpy.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.070
Like a bed net, for example.

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.360
Or a water filter.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.690
That you can either afford
or not afford.

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:18.450
So if you have enough money you
afford it and then you can

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:19.530
be generally healthier.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:22.430
You don't lose all your calories
to diarrhea and other

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:24.350
nice things like that.

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:27.310
And if you're poor you would
be sick all the time.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.760
Or paying for the doctors,
for example.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:33.640
So for example, if someone is
sick and very poor they might

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.860
not be able to pay
for the doctor.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.540
Then they'll stay sick so
they can't earn money.

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:41.810
And again, a doctor visit is one
big lump investment which

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:44.030
you may or may not be
able to afford.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:47.810
That would be another source
of an S-shape like that.

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:50.160
So the reason why I went through
all of these examples

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.830
is that we are going to have a
lot to say about the exact

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:58.890
story that Pak Solhin told
me about the food.

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:02.140
Whether this was a real story
in this case or whether it's

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:07.190
some stuff that he was telling
himself to explain the

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:09.670
situation he was in but, really,
there was something

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:11.990
else behind his problems
like depression or

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:14.280
something like that.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.690
But the first time it was
formalized was in this context

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:19.820
of nutrition.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:22.820
And it's very natural to think
of it in the context of

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.960
nutrition but it could apply.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:30.290
And a very important part of the
discussion that I want you

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:34.920
to keep in mind is that it's not
enough for there to be a

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.870
relationship between income
today and income tomorrow.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:40.750
To create a poverty
trap it needs to

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:42.670
have this funny shape.

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:46.400
And I want to discuss why.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.380
So the way that we are going to
think of it is we are going

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:55.070
to think about what
is the dynamic of

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:58.170
someone's income over time.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:09.370
So let's start with this picture
which brings inherited

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.760
income on the x-axis--

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.510
so think of it as
income today--

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:17.950
and income from work.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:21.600
What I have plotted here
is this S-shaped curve.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.030
Think of it, for example, as
coming from nutrition.

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:27.290
But any of the examples that you
talked about if you don't

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:29.520
like the nutrition one.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:33.920
And the line that goes through
the diagonal is

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.170
the 45-degree line.

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:41.560
So why is the 45-degree line
relevant and interesting here

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.760
is that, , on the 45-degree
line, income today is the same

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.720
as income tomorrow.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.460
Right, so we're going
to make use of it.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.020
Now I want to try and look at
the dynamic of someone's

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.730
income over time.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:49:00.190
So suppose someone got this
little income, y prime 0.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:03.160
Where do I read their income
in period one?

00:49:10.132 --> 00:49:10.630
Yep?

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:13.660
AUDIENCE: It would be going
from curvy line to the

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:14.680
45-degree line horizontally.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.156
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:49:16.156 --> 00:49:21.170
So to go from income y prime 0
to y1, I go on the vertical

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:22.660
line up to the curve.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:27.410
That tells me this is what
someone who starts his life

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:32.800
with some income, yi0, can make
his decision about how

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:37.190
much to eat, creates some
calories, creates some work

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:39.770
capacity, goes to work,
generates an income that he

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:40.650
takes home.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:43.490
That's the income that we
have on the curvy line.

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:47.450
And then I want to say, well,
that becomes y1, right?

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:51.570
And then y1 is going to become
the y0 of tomorrow.

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:54.370
So to find it, I'm doing exactly
what you're saying

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:56.220
which is I'm going
horizontally to

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.130
the 45-degree line.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:00.840
And I could go down again.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.440
So from y0, I go to y1.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.480
Then horizontally
on the 45-degree

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.320
line gives me y1 again.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.710
And then how do I find y2?

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:17.320
I go vertical again,
that gives me y2.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.510
I go horizontal again to
the degree line and I

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.200
continue like that.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.450
And where will I end up?

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.642
AUDIENCE: Where the two
curves intersect.

00:50:29.642 --> 00:50:32.120
PROFESSOR: I will end up at
the intersection of the

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.680
45-degree line and the
S-shape curve, right?

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.900
At the first intersection.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:42.550
Now what if I start with
a higher income.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:47.500
If I start with the income
y 0 double prime.

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.680
I go vertical to the curve.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.600
That gives me y1 double prime.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.830
I have to go horizontally
to find it when it

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:58.840
becomes income tomorrow.

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:00.830
Again vertically, et cetera.

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:06.920
And I again end up at the
intersection of the 45-degree

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.530
line and the S-shape curve
but now it's a higher

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:11.220
intersection.

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:18.195
Now what happens if I start at
the sixth point in the middle

00:51:18.195 --> 00:51:19.445
over there?

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.122
Which way will that go?

00:51:24.122 --> 00:51:25.600
AUDIENCE: That will go down.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.560
PROFESSOR: That will go down.

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:30.730
If I go to the sixth point,
I go vertical

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:33.130
then left then down.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:39.100
So what is the key point after
which I will start going to

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.620
the high point?

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:42.083
Yeah?

00:51:42.083 --> 00:51:44.861
AUDIENCE: Where it intersects
the 45-degree line again.

00:51:44.861 --> 00:51:47.930
PROFESSOR: So the intersection
from below.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:54.780
So at this point P where the
capacity curve intersects the

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.010
45-degree line from below.

00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:00.440
Anything to the right goes
to the high steady state.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.830
Anything to the left goes
to the low steady state.

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:08.900
So this possibility that there
are two steady states

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:12.790
depending on where you start
from is the formalization of

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:14.450
the poverty curve.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:19.080
Which is anybody who is poorer
than the unstable equilibrium

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.330
over there--

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:28.780
if someone starts with exactly
this income, where do they go?

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.400
If someone starts with exactly
the intersection of the

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.860
45-degree line and the S-shape
curve, do they go down or do

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.272
they go up?

00:52:36.272 --> 00:52:37.660
They just stay there.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:41.800
So it is also a steady state but
it's a very unstable one.

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.965
If anything happens, any
small perturbation.

00:52:43.965 --> 00:52:45.540
If they go slightly
to the left, they

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.785
go all the way down.

00:52:46.785 --> 00:52:50.410
If they go slightly to the
right, they go all the way up.

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:53.100
So we call that an unstable
statistic.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.460
So there is one unstable
statistic and two stable ones.

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.130
And those two stable ones is
what we're talking about.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.206
They could be a poverty trap.

00:53:01.206 --> 00:53:01.699
Yes?

00:53:01.699 --> 00:53:06.140
AUDIENCE: Why are they moving
toward that 45-degree line?

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.810
PROFESSOR: Can someone
explain that?

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.490
You want to know why we are
going horizontal to the

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:12.450
45-degree line?

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:12.900
Yeah.

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.200
Can someone explain that once?

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.810
And then I'll re-explain
it as well.

00:53:19.756 --> 00:53:22.702
AUDIENCE: Because yesterday's
income is going to be your

00:53:22.702 --> 00:53:24.175
today's income.

00:53:24.175 --> 00:53:26.465
And your today's income
is going to be

00:53:26.465 --> 00:53:27.612
your tomorrow's income.

00:53:27.612 --> 00:53:31.540
So if we start with a value
zero, so that value

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.504
can come from work.

00:53:33.504 --> 00:53:38.440
It's going to be tomorrow's
[INAUDIBLE].

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:43.076
So if you get the income from
work, the y-value of that will

00:53:43.076 --> 00:53:47.224
be your incurred income
tomorrow.

00:53:47.224 --> 00:53:50.040
So you have to go to
the 45-degree line.

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.290
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:56.800
The reason why we are using the
horizontal line is that--

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.930
so from y0, I know
that I go to y1.

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:03.470
And then I want to know,
from y1 where do I go?

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:06.470
For that I need to put
y1 on the x-axis.

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:09.730
And the 45-degree line allows
me to do that because the

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:14.190
45-degree line is where the
vertical is equal to the

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:15.350
horizontal.

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:19.350
So I'm going right to find y1
on the horizontal line which

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:22.170
helps me to find it
on the x-axis.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.580
And then I know that from
y1, I go to y2.

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.300
And then again horizontal, and
then again vertical, and then

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.620
again horizontal.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.830
That makes sense?

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:32.400
Is it clear for everybody?

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.440
It would be better if we were
all on the same page.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.650
That we have that here.

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:39.530
This is not obvious.

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.850
It's not meant to be obvious.

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:42.920
Yeah?

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.375
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:44.375 --> 00:54:47.285
y0 or y1--

00:54:47.285 --> 00:54:49.710
PROFESSOR: So, the first
one you mean?

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:51.165
AUDIENCE: Oh, is that
because that's the--

00:54:51.165 --> 00:54:52.620
PROFESSOR: That's the
capacity curve.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.680
Exactly.

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.600
Your y0 is what you
start from.

00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.330
And then the curve gives us
what is the relationship

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:01.090
between income today and
income tomorrow.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:04.220
So think of it with
the food example.

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.460
You start with some income.

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.930
You decide how much to eat--
let's say you eat

00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:10.440
80 percent of it--

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.410
you eat it.

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:13.110
That gives you some strength.

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.500
You go work.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:15.800
That gives you some wage.

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.390
That's your income from work.

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:19.370
AUDIENCE: And then, when we're
determining the distance

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:25.557
between y0 and y1, is that
determined just by the

00:55:25.557 --> 00:55:29.430
distance from the curve
to the 45-degree line?

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:30.020
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:32.390
So y0 goes to y1.

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:35.655
Do you understand the first
vertical step here right?

00:55:35.655 --> 00:55:38.380
y0 goes to y1 for the
first vertical step.

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:44.930
And then we're looking for y1 on
the vertical axis, but now

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:46.580
we need to find a way
to put it back on

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:47.970
the horizontal axis.

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:51.420
And the 45-degree line helps us
to do that because on the

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:55.910
45-degree line the vertical
distance is the same as the

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:57.650
horizontal distance.

00:55:57.650 --> 00:56:01.520
So the horizontal line is just
a trick to help us find where

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:06.260
is y1 on the horizontal axis,
which helps us go to y2.

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:07.270
That make sense?

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:09.470
So from y0, I go to
y1 vertically --

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:11.360
that's just a capacity curve.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.980
Then the horizontal line
is just to the left.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.050
Now what is the new y0?

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:19.410
The new y0 is y1.

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:22.820
And then again, we go
vertically to y2.

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.920
Horizontally to find it on
the horizontal axis,

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.693
vertically, et cetera.

00:56:26.693 --> 00:56:27.659
Yeah?

00:56:27.659 --> 00:56:30.080
AUDIENCE: What's the
unit of time--

00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.840
PROFESSOR: The unit of time is
whatever we think is the right

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.820
unit of time depending on the
problem we're looking at.

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.450
So, for example, if it is food,
that might be the date.

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:42.940
If it's the income of your
children, that may be a

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.250
generation.

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:48.890
In some sense, once we have
decided what problem we are

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:52.320
looking at, the unit of time
doesn't really matter.

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.510
We adjust to it.

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:56.486
Yeah?

00:56:56.486 --> 00:56:57.706
AUDIENCE: How did you determine
which states were

00:56:57.706 --> 00:56:59.910
stable and which ones
were not stable?

00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:03.825
PROFESSOR: Well, look at it,
and for any point, you're

00:57:03.825 --> 00:57:07.780
figuring out whether or not
you're going to stay here.

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:11.160
Whether things tend to bring you
back here or things tend

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.670
to pull you away from it.

00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:15.585
Think of it, for example,
as magnets.

00:57:15.585 --> 00:57:21.100
Either they cling together or
they are trying to go away.

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:28.830
Or think of it as a stick.

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:33.060
Does it stay vertical or
does it fall down?

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:36.600
Suppose that we start with
income and the first income we

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.530
are getting is y3.

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:40.132
That's going to pull you.

00:57:40.132 --> 00:57:42.490
You're going to go vertical
a little bit, horizontal a

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:43.470
little bit, et cetera.

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:44.710
That's going to pull
you exactly

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.550
at that first statistic.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:49.180
Right?

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.150
So now, if you start from the
first statistic and something

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:54.930
slightly pushes you away from
it, it is going to bring you

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:56.000
back to it.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.150
If you are a little bit richer
than the first statistic,

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.940
you're going to, again, go back
to the first statistic.

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:06.520
If you're slightly richer,
it's pulling you down.

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:10.340
If you're slightly poorer,
it's pulling you up.

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:12.770
Now, if you're looking at the
one that's here on top, that's

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:13.840
the same thing.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.570
At the very top, if you're
slightly poorer, it's pulling

00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:17.880
you up towards it.

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.630
If you're slightly richer,
it's pulling you

00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:21.020
down towards it.

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.440
Now if you look at the one where
the line intersects from

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.510
below, if you're exactly
at it, you stay at it.

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:29.870
But if you're slightly poorer,
where do you go?

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:36.060
All the way down.

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.840
If you're slightly richer,
all the way up.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.290
So that one is not stable.

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:42.990
So basically, you follow your
arrows wherever they are going

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:44.680
to take you.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.930
OK?

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.650
Any more question?

00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:50.365
Yeah?

00:58:50.365 --> 00:58:52.305
AUDIENCE: What are the
axis labels for it?

00:58:52.305 --> 00:58:55.700
Like income from work.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.596
I thought we were trying to
connect on a time scale--

00:58:58.596 --> 00:59:00.770
PROFESSOR: Right, so it
doesn't really matter.

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:03.300
Think of it as income today
versus income tomorrow.

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:07.380
Or income that you inherited
versus income

00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:08.940
that you create yourself.

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:11.060
Whatever scales we are
talking about.

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:18.430
So in the food example, it would
be the income you had at

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:20.660
the end of today.

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:24.420
And then, that would be
inherited income you inherited

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.910
from yesterday.

00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:28.570
And then the income from work
would be the income of the end

00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:29.070
of the day.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:31.990
So here the scale would
be one day.

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:36.450
In the education example, you
would go from your income to

00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:38.120
what your children will make.

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.240
That's a whole generation.

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:43.660
So the time scale, it depends
on the problem.

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:46.990
I think in the food example,
it's useful to think of a day.

00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:50.154
In the health example
it might be a month.

00:59:50.154 --> 00:59:52.338
AUDIENCE: Why is there a
tendency to move to the

00:59:52.338 --> 00:59:53.900
intersections?

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:55.800
PROFESSOR: Well, that's where
the arrows are pulling you,

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.400
aren't they?

00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.250
Because the closer of
the intersection

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:03.794
is where you are--

01:00:03.794 --> 01:00:07.080
first, you go from wherever
you start to the curve.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.790
And then the curve is
trying to go back to

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:11.100
the 45-degree line.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.080
So the closer you are
to the intersection,

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.340
the less you move.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.880
Which is why this
is, everything

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.610
pulls you back there.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:19.810
--Not all the intersections.

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:21.280
No, it's the stable ones.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.503
The one to the left and the
one to the right, not the

01:00:23.503 --> 01:00:24.470
middle one.

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:26.093
Which you have a tendency
to go away from.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.974
Any other questions
on how this works?

01:00:33.974 --> 01:00:34.461
Yeah?

01:00:34.461 --> 01:00:36.896
AUDIENCE: How do you guys
actually gather the data to

01:00:36.896 --> 01:00:37.383
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:37.383 --> 01:00:38.850
PROFESSOR: So that's an
excellent question.

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.052
Right now, I've just
asserted that it's

01:00:41.052 --> 01:00:42.710
the form of the curve.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:47.340
And then we have to go back to
the question that a neighbor--

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.590
whose name I don't know-- asked
earlier, which is what

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:55.240
is, actually, the shape
of the curve?

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.990
And that's a key question.

01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:00.230
That's going back to the
questions we were asking in

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:02.930
the case of education,
for example.

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:05.460
Is the relationship between
income today and income

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:10.120
tomorrow due to education?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.820
Is it really of this shape or
is it of another shape?

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.680
That's what we have to
assert empirically.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.730
And it's going to have
to be gathered on a

01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:19.530
case-by-case example.

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:21.500
So for example, for food.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:26.830
To create this shape, to know
what is the form of the shape,

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:29.030
we are going to need
to know two things.

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:32.640
We need to know what is the
relationship between how much

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.380
income you have and how many
calories you consume.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.430
And what is the relationship
between the calories you

01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:40.480
consume and your
work capacity?

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.910
And the product of the two
will be that curve.

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:44.480
And the shape it has--

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.920
God knows, I mean, actually even
we know, but we're going

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.030
to cover that next time.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.550
So this is assuming that
the capacity curve

01:01:57.550 --> 01:01:58.350
indeed has this shape.

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:01.870
Then we can see how the poverty
trap can emerge.

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:05.500
Now, if instead, the capacity
curve had this shape--

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.720
think of your example
of education.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.400
And think that, in fact, the
first few years of education

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:22.090
are very valuable and the next
years you guys are kind of

01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:25.650
wasting your time-- not to speak
of me-- and the next

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:27.410
years of education are
not so valuable.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.710
What is really important is
to learn how to read.

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:32.675
Imagine that's the case.

01:02:32.675 --> 01:02:35.140
Then it means that the
relationship between income

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:39.250
today and income tomorrow
is not as steep anymore.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.500
It starts very high and
then it tapers off.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.080
And so we can play the same
game again that we were

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.450
playing before.

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:51.670
We can say, well, let's draw
the diagonal line.

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:55.050
Let's start with some
income, a1.

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:57.470
To find out income tomorrow
what do we do?

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.470
We go vertical.

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:03.180
We find income, a2.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.280
Then we have to go horizontal to
the 45-degree line to find

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.920
it on the horizontal line.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.550
We go vertical again to
find it on the curve.

01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:13.380
Horizontal again,
vertical again.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.430
Where do we end up?

01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:17.210
q.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:20.200
Now suppose we had started
above q, where

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.850
would we end up?

01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:22.530
q.

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:25.350
Suppose we had started anywhere
in between, where

01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:26.706
would we end up?

01:03:26.706 --> 01:03:27.640
q.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.960
So there is no poverty
trap, in this case.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.030
If there is only one
intersection because the

01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:36.150
returns are first high and then
low, then there won't be

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.960
a poverty trap.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.570
It doesn't mean that there is no
relationship between income

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:41.520
today and income tomorrow.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.870
There is one.

01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:45.950
But the point is, that
relationship is first steep

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:47.690
and then tapers off.

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:54.830
So for example, imagine that
the only type of businesses

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.640
that you can run are businesses

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.340
that you can run yourself.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:03.060
That for some reason, you are in
a business where you can't

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.360
really have employees.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.590
Imagine.

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:09.080
So in that case, your first
investment will be quite

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.890
valuable, right?

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:14.420
But then, eventually, you can't
really add much more

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.865
because you won't have
enough time to sell

01:04:16.865 --> 01:04:18.630
all of these things.

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:27.220
So your first dollars invested
will have a very high return.

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.140
And then less and less
and less and less.

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:31.590
And so in that case, everybody
will end up at the same place.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:41.385
An example that could make it
clear, is going back to our

01:04:41.385 --> 01:04:47.800
Kenyan farmer from the MTV
video, Kennedy fertilizer.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.670
If you put fertilizer
on your crop--

01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:52.860
well when you put just
a little bit, the

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.130
effects are very high.

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:57.990
But when you start putting more,
eventually, the soil

01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:00.210
can't absorb it so the
effects are less and

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:01.820
less and less high.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:05.960
So even if you don't have enough
to put on your entire

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.930
field to start with, you could
imagine that you would first

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:12.110
put it in the most productive
part of your field.

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:14.760
Because the first unit of
fertilizer you are putting is

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.640
very high return.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.910
The second, you need less
because you're going to the

01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:22.980
place of your field that is
less productive anyway.

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.690
At the third, you
need even less.

01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:27.040
The fourth is really not that
productive because, now, you

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.950
end up putting more where
you started from

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:30.420
in the first place.

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.400
So that's not really
helpful anymore.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.260
So in that case, the returns
don't have this S-shape.

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:39.725
They have this inverted
L-shape.

01:05:39.725 --> 01:05:43.360
So in that case, there
is no poverty trap.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.050
And so that is where the
question that you were asking

01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:46.670
is essential.

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:49.510
Which is, how do we know what
the shape of this curve?

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:52.020
Because the shape of this curve
is going to crucially

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.890
determine whether or
not we have a trap.

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:57.690
And what I want you to remember
is that that's more

01:05:57.690 --> 01:05:59.840
than a relationship
between income

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.070
today and income tomorrow.

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.870
It has to be this relationship
of this shape.

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:08.740
So that's the first thing, which
is if the relationship

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.480
is inverted--

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.420
L-shaped like that, which
is the canonical case in

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.730
economics, most of our
economics model--

01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:19.630
what you learn in 14.01--

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:22.090
has production function
of this form.

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:24.870
Where this production function,
which we called,

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:27.030
have decreasing returns.

01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:31.160
Where the first unit invested is
very profitable and then it

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.320
becomes less and less
profitable.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:38.090
We've already discussed a number
of reasons why the

01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:40.590
returns might not would
always be decreasing.

01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:43.480
For example, we discussed the
case of calories where there

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.120
might be an increasing zone and
then a decreasing zone.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.740
We discussed education might
or might not be that way.

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:52.020
We got an interesting example
about businesses where you

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:55.160
might not have a very profitable
opportunity for

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:59.440
your business if you don't
have enough money.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.840
We discussed savings, which may
or may not have this form.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.580
Where nobody wants your
small savings.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.980
So there are reasons
why it may not

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.880
always be inverted L-shaped.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:14.820
But if it is inverted L-shaped
there won't be a poverty trap.

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.790
--You might be very bored with
me repeating the same thing

01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:19.360
for the fifth time now, but
the reason why I insist is

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.590
that this is a confusion that
we hear over and over again

01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:24.690
among policy makers.

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:28.220
In the policy discourse,
whenever they're thinking of a

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.840
double feedback loop--

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.270
for example, kids who have
less education, make less

01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:38.200
money, and parents who have
less money send their kids

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.380
less to school.

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:40.620
Immediately, people think, ha!

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:43.520
If there is a double feedback
loop like that, that creates a

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.700
poverty trap.

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:46.370
And the point is, that that's
not sufficient.

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:48.500
That's necessary but that's
not sufficient.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.260
Because if the double feedback
loop gives you a nice inverted

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.620
L-shape, eventually, everybody
will end up

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.400
nicely in the same place.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.140
OK?

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:03.010
So there is more, which is, here
is another case where we

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:06.070
have an S-shaped curve.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:11.215
But the S-shaped curve is a
little different, it's a

01:08:11.215 --> 01:08:12.390
little higher.

01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:14.540
So why would it be a little
higher, for example?

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:20.640
Why has it moved up compared
to what we had before?

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.890
Why could it have moved up?

01:08:27.024 --> 01:08:30.510
Go back to the food example.

01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:31.160
Sorry?

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.426
AUDIENCE: Lower food prices.

01:08:32.426 --> 01:08:33.270
PROFESSOR: Lower food prices.

01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:35.706
So for example, the productivity
of the land might

01:08:35.706 --> 01:08:38.770
have gone up.

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:42.149
Maybe the government came and
built some irrigation dams and

01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:43.740
the productivity of
land has gone up.

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:48.229
So to produce the same amount of
food you need less effort.

01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:52.024
So the work capacity translates
into a higher

01:08:52.024 --> 01:08:52.750
income for moi.

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:56.529
So for whatever reason,
the curve shifts up.

01:08:56.529 --> 01:08:59.660
So then what happened--

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.189
we gave some person
some income, y0.

01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:08.695
We find y1 by going vertical.

01:09:08.695 --> 01:09:14.160
We find it again on the
horizontal line, y1.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:17.140
Going back to y2, horizontal
again.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.080
Et cetera, et cetera.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.330
Where do we end up?

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:25.830
At the intersection.

01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:28.310
And now there's only
one intersection.

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:32.194
So wherever we start, we are
going to end up at the same

01:09:32.194 --> 01:09:33.320
intersection.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.998
In that case, is there going
to be a poverty trap?

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:41.689
No.

01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:43.550
In that case there is no poverty
trap because, again,

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:45.310
there is one statistic.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.771
So an S-shape is not even a
sufficient condition for a

01:09:48.771 --> 01:09:50.050
poverty trap.

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:53.840
It is necessary but it's
not sufficient.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.365
Let's find another example,
which is this one.

01:09:57.365 --> 01:10:00.830
Where in fact, now it's
the opposite.

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.600
There was some flood
and the land is now

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.500
completely washed out.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.230
So people are very
unproductive.

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:10.680
They have to work very hard
to produce very little.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.000
So what happened to
my poor S-shape?

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.830
It's shifted to the
southwest, right?

01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:31.480
So now if I start from y0--

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.030
quite high-- where do I go?

01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:38.340
So I go up, but then
it's not enough.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:41.690
The 45-degree line
is to the left.

01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:43.700
I have to go left, down
again, down again,

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:44.760
down again, and again.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:49.220
I'm going to end up at the
single intersection where I'm

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:52.290
always pulled up, which
is a very low income.

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:56.210
So in a sense, there is no
poverty trap here either.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.790
Because it's not that if you're
poor, you'll stay poor,

01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:00.120
and if you're rich,
you'll stay rich.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.696
Regardless, you're
going to be poor.

01:11:01.696 --> 01:11:02.530
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:05.030
PROFESSOR: So you could think
it's a universal poverty trap

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:06.920
or you can think that's
just the way is.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:14.190
Because if you ignore the right
side, we almost are in

01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:17.120
the inverted L-shape except
there are stuff that are a

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.470
little bit irrelevant
to the right.

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:21.290
The reason why they are
irrelevant is that,

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:24.900
eventually, everybody's
becoming poor anyway.

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.010
So again, we don't have
a poverty trap.

01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:30.240
So let's look at those
three examples.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:34.110
That's an example with
a poverty trap.

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.790
That's an example that
doesn't have one.

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:39.710
That's another example that
doesn't have one.

01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:43.290
What is different between the
one example with the poverty

01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:45.290
trap and the one which
doesn't have one--

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.570
or two?

01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:46.270
Yes.

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:47.900
Can you tell me your name?

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.310
AUDIENCE: Zachary--

01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.570
PROFESSOR: Zachary.

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.485
AUDIENCE: --it crosses the
45-degree line twice.

01:11:51.485 --> 01:11:52.810
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:54.536
Well, twice or--

01:11:54.536 --> 01:11:55.410
AUDIENCE: Three times.

01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:56.896
PROFESSOR: Three times.

01:11:56.896 --> 01:12:02.500
It crosses the 45-degree
line once from below.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:08.960
So the rule is that you're going
to have a poverty trap

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.280
if the capacity curve--

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.745
or whatever is the curve between
the income from work

01:12:13.745 --> 01:12:15.420
and the inherited income--

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:20.960
crosses the 45-degree line,
at least once, from below.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.640
That is, there is at least one
unstable equilibrium where

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.562
you're crossing from below.

01:12:25.562 --> 01:12:30.290
And that is necessary for
having a poverty trap.

01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:34.760
So what you need, in other
words, is to have a zone where

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.130
income is accelerating.

01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:41.830
And this zone must to be at a
place where the income was

01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:44.750
relatively low to start with.

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:48.490
And it needs to accelerate
enough that it's becoming high

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:49.250
to start with.

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:52.740
In other words, it needs to be
a zone where, if you're below

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.280
the zone, you're making
less tomorrow than you

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.820
started from today.

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.870
And when you're on the right
of the zone, you're making

01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:02.120
more tomorrow than you
started from today.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.790
And you need to have
this point.

01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:07.420
Otherwise, there is
no poverty trap.

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:08.000
All right?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:15.090
So that's the mathematical
expression of it.

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:21.840
And now, in a sense, the game
that we're going to play all

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.350
around this class is
to be looking for--

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:30.810
are we in this situation where
whatever is the relationship

01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:33.060
between income today and income
tomorrow crosses the

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.300
45-degree line from below.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:38.170
Or are we not in
this situation.

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:42.060
And now we are in a much better
position to ask the

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.250
question that Zach asked at the
beginning of the question

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:46.790
which is, are we really
believing that there could be

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:49.540
a poverty trap based on food?

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:52.480
I didn't want to answer his
question to start with because

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.650
I needed some time to specify
the question in a much more

01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:58.250
precise way.

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:01.840
Now we can re-ask the question
and say, is it really possible

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:10.260
that the relationship between
the calories I consume and my

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:15.150
strength has this specific form
where it intersects the

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:17.230
45-degree line from below?

01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:20.720
And how does that intersect with
the fact that I choose

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.820
how much to consume?

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:27.120
Because, of course, if there
is indeed a strong

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.500
relationship between the
calories consumed and the work

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:35.000
capacity, then people should
try and get out of it by

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.040
eating as much as possible
when they are very poor.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.340
So to the extent that people
can choose how much to

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:44.620
consume, how much food to eat,
they should eat more when they

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:48.210
are very poor in order to try
and pull themselves to the

01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:50.270
right of this point.

01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:53.030
And when they are richer then
it wouldn't really matter.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.870
So they would eat less.

01:14:55.870 --> 01:15:01.540
So that would create a force
that goes against an S-shape

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.120
for the capacity curve.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.800
So we have to see--

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.190
and that goes back to
your question, where

01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:07.240
do you get it from?

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.380
Well, we get it from looking at
the data and looking at--

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:15.630
to what extent people who have
more money eat so much more,

01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:17.990
and to what extent people who
eat so much more are so much

01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:19.120
more productive.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.520
And that's what we
are going to do.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.010
We are going to do
it for food.

01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:25.950
But now that we understand the
principle for food, we are

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:27.240
going to do it for education.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.990
We are going to do it for
health, we are going to do it

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:31.082
for savings, for businesses,
et cetera.

01:15:31.082 --> 01:15:31.528
Yeah?

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:33.760
AUDIENCE: To go back to the
example with the start of the

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.600
class, would you say that--

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.960
I forgot his name but-- that
the man was at an unstable

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.080
equilibrium since as soon as he
lost his job, he seemed to

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.560
go down and not be able
to eat enough to get

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.030
another job, et cetera?

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:48.250
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:49.560
So that's a very
good question.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:53.290
What we can try now is to
re-interpret Mister Solhin's

01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:55.690
story in the context of this.

01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:59.020
And you could say, well perhaps,
it was exactly

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.270
something like that.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.500
So what would have
happened to him?

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:11.000
Let's see, I want to--

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.250
oops.

01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:22.990
What would have happened
to him?

01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:25.615
So we discussed that one thing
that might have happened to

01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:29.620
him is that something happened
to the capacity curve, right?

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:34.830
We were saying that coincident
decrease in the wage and

01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:38.130
increase in the food prices
means that the capacity curve

01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:41.590
tends to move to
the southwest.

01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:44.180
So assume that Pak Solhin
was at the high

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:46.720
equilibrium up there.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.000
Right?

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.620
But right there.

01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:51.350
And then the curve moves
slightly to the right.

01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:58.800
Then, with the same income, he
suddenly is now below what

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.590
would correspond to the new
equilibrium and it would start

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:03.610
falling down, down,
down, down.

01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:07.560
And once he starts going down,
there is no going up again.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.250
It could also have
eliminated--

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:13.630
we might also be in a situation
where, at the

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:15.710
beginning there was just
one equilibrium--

01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:19.140
so we were, for example
in this situation--

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:23.200
and then once the curve moves
down, they are now two

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.620
equilibria, including
the unstable one.

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:29.625
So we may have started, in the
former situation, where people

01:17:29.625 --> 01:17:33.440
were productive enough that they
were always moving up.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.680
And then, with the increase in
food prices and the decrease

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.670
in wages, that curve shifts down
and now it creates two

01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:41.170
equilibria.

01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:43.940
So some people get trapped
like he was.

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.850
What was interesting in Pak
Solhin's villages is that, in

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:48.930
the same villages, I
met people who were

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.840
happily eating enough.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:56.920
So it seemed that there was both
kinds, which makes you

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:00.320
think that these two things
were coexisting.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.810
So maybe what happened with him
is that we started from a

01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:06.770
situation like that, and then
we moved left and we end up

01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:08.320
with this double situation.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:18.750
That's possible

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:25.760
So what we had in the
Sachs-Jolie video is--

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.130
we said when we just
started the class--

01:18:29.130 --> 01:18:32.230
lots of examples of
poverty traps.

01:18:32.230 --> 01:18:36.620
And in each case, we could try
and think, well, what makes us

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:39.090
think that there is indeed a
poverty trap in this case?

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:41.630
Or what makes us think that
maybe there is no poverty trap

01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:42.930
in this case?

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:47.700
So one example is what
happened with the

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.950
farmer that they meet.

01:18:52.545 --> 01:18:55.350
So they claim that there
was a poverty trap.

01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:58.970
So what is the implicit argument
that they had in mind

01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:05.000
that would help us think that,
for a farmer, the decision to

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.480
use fertilizer corresponds
to that

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.670
problem versus that problem?

01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:18.210
What do we need to know about
fertilizer and fertilizer use

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:22.640
to try and sort out whether we
are in the situation that they

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.482
talk about or in the
other situation.

01:19:24.482 --> 01:19:26.700
Yeah?

01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.522
You go ahead, I have
a problem.

01:19:28.522 --> 01:19:31.184
AUDIENCE: You need to know if
there is some minimum of

01:19:31.184 --> 01:19:35.310
fertilizer used that becomes
useful for the farmer.

01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.470
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.460
So there could be that, minimum
fertilizer used.

01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:43.800
But why would there be a minimum
fertilizer used?

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.637
Yeah?

01:19:44.637 --> 01:19:47.906
AUDIENCE: Maybe it's super
difficult to acquire small

01:19:47.906 --> 01:19:49.310
quantities of fertilizer.

01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:52.640
PROFESSOR: So for example,
it might be sold by

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.560
the bag or 50 kg.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:01.320
So in that case, what we have
is not so much S-shaped but

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:05.220
something which is a degenerated
S where you get

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.955
nothing if you can't invest
enough and then you get the

01:20:07.955 --> 01:20:11.380
return which are, potentially,
very steep at the beginning.

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:17.890
So instead of a nice little
curvy S, we have a flat part

01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:20.540
and then an inverted L.

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:24.080
But if we have a flat part and
then the inverted L, it would

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.920
still work like an S. Because
there would still be an

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.450
intersection where the curve
intersects from above on the

01:20:32.450 --> 01:20:37.370
flat part, an intersection where
it intersects from below

01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:39.590
at the beginning of the
L-shape, and another

01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:41.840
intersection where it intersects
from above at the

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.490
end of the L-shape.

01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:46.790
So the S doesn't have to be a
proper S. It could be a flat

01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:50.640
part and then an inverted L. So
this example could be one,

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.800
which is you can only buy
fertilizer by the 50 kg.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:59.280
What other situation
could we find?

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.160
Yeah?

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.466
AUDIENCE: The percentage of
chance for success in using

01:21:03.466 --> 01:21:03.955
fertilizer.

01:21:03.955 --> 01:21:09.089
So if you only had [INAUDIBLE]
over a small plot of land, it

01:21:09.089 --> 01:21:11.290
is, like, 20% chance
of actually

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:12.268
improving your crop yield.

01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:15.691
You would have to use a larger
quantity to actually get an

01:21:15.691 --> 01:21:17.670
improved crop yield.

01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:21.650
PROFESSOR: So that could be a
possibility if the chance of

01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:24.630
success depends on
how much you use.

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.540
I think it's not very likely
that it would be a purely

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:31.060
physical thing because
fertilizer is quite scalable.

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:36.550
But one way in which we could
have your story is if, to use

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:39.460
fertilizer it requires
some learning.

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:42.590
And there's no point doing
all that learning--

01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:45.050
and asking all of your neighbors
how they do it, and

01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:46.870
try to understand
how they do it.

01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:50.020
Maybe experiment a little bit,
maybe it won't work first.

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:51.960
--Maybe there is no point to
go through all of this

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:55.740
learning if, at the end of the
day, you know that, no matter

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.730
what, you will always be able
to use just a little bit.

01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:01.940
So that would be one way
in which you would,

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:03.890
again, create this.

01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:07.050
You're not going to use any
fertilizer if you know that

01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:10.240
you, eventually, would be able
to use it on the substantial

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.060
part of your field.

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:11.552
Yeah?

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:14.012
AUDIENCE: I think that the main
point they made in the

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:16.964
video is that there needed
to be an initial push.

01:22:16.964 --> 01:22:19.424
So they needed a lot of
fertilizer and you needed to

01:22:19.424 --> 01:22:22.868
put it on all of the crops for
it to make a big impact.

01:22:22.868 --> 01:22:26.312
And the fact is, if you have a
little bit of fertilizer-- the

01:22:26.312 --> 01:22:30.740
point was why couldn't
they invest?

01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:34.184
So save would be paying for a
little bit of fertilizer.

01:22:34.184 --> 01:22:37.136
And then buy more fertilizer and
then continue to grow it

01:22:37.136 --> 01:22:39.596
until [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:39.596 --> 01:22:42.721
You know, if you started off
with a small amount, you

01:22:42.721 --> 01:22:45.362
couldn't really invest
and grow your yield

01:22:45.362 --> 01:22:47.630
to make more money.

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:47.990
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:51.035
Then the third possibility is
that if you invest just a

01:22:51.035 --> 01:22:52.780
little bit--

01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:56.920
let's say fertilizer scales
nicely, so you can invest just

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.550
a little bit and
you can do it.

01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:02.390
But then, you're going to make
just a little bit more money.

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:05.560
And then we need some other
mechanism which means that

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.090
saving a little bit more money
is not feasible, or people are

01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:10.650
not going to do it.

01:23:10.650 --> 01:23:13.130
So then we need to bring in
something else which is along

01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:14.730
the line of what we
were discussing

01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:16.020
earlier in the class.

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:20.170
We need to bring in something
else which is, the banks are

01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:22.520
not going to take your small
amount of money.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.720
Or if you have a small amount
of money, you are

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:25.660
going to waste it.

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:29.380
But if you have a lot, now
that's enough money to be

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:32.560
worthwhile and you're
going to keep it.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.300
All right.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.300
So we are going to end
here for today.

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:40.430
So make sure you understand this
because we are not ready

01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:42.480
to go back to it formally a lot,
but this is going to be

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.620
with us all the time.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.620
And on Tuesday, we are going
to go through experiments.
