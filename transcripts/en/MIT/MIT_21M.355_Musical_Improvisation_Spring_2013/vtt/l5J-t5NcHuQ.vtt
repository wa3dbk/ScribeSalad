00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:22.949
PROFESSOR: My name
is Mark Harvey,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.890
and I am teaching a
course this semester

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.931
on musical improvisation.

00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:28.416
We have our students
here this evening,

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:31.895
and [INAUDIBLE] the
rest of you [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:33.883
And in conjunction
with the course,

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:35.871
we're running this
concert series,

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.356
which is the last of
four concerts we've had.

00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:41.338
And you see on the
page that you picked up

00:00:41.338 --> 00:00:47.302
at the door, another very
different kinds of programs

00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:48.296
that we've had.

00:00:48.296 --> 00:00:51.278
And we're thrilled to include
in this particular [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:54.757
we call Tre Corda with
Tim Ray over here,

00:00:54.757 --> 00:00:56.745
Greg Hopkins, and
Eugene Friesen.

00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:58.733
So please welcome them.

TIM RAY: Thank you.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.738
Thanks very much.

00:06:33.738 --> 00:06:35.343
And thank you all
for coming out.

00:06:35.343 --> 00:06:40.080
It's great to see a great
audience here at MIT.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.520
We are Tre Corda and
very glad to be here and.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.330
And as Mark mentioned,
the gentlemen

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.560
up here on stage-- on stage?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.000
Do we call this a stage?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.940
It's where we're playing,
so I guess it's a stage.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.640
Anyway, I just
want to remind you

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.150
that is on trumpet and
flugelhorn Greg Hopkins.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.617
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:05.617 --> 00:07:08.296
And on cello, Eugene Friesen.

00:07:08.296 --> 00:07:10.776
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.885
So that first piece you heard
was a composition of Eugene

00:07:25.885 --> 00:07:28.802
Friesen's called
"Shadow Play," which

00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:30.855
of course is an
amazing pizzicato

00:07:30.855 --> 00:07:33.987
technique on the cello.

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:39.370
And we love to jump in on some
of Eugene's pizzicato creations

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.180
as we did on that song.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.050
We're celebrating a new CD.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.890
We have a new CD, the three
of us, called Squeaky Toy.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.242
And we're going to
play-- "Shadow Play,"

00:07:49.242 --> 00:07:50.950
the song we just played
is on the new CD.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.670
And we're going to play some
other ones on the new CD

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.700
as well.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:00.208
And continuing on with
another song from that disk.

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:04.922
This is the first movement of
the sonata for trumpet, cello,

00:08:04.922 --> 00:08:07.860
and piano composed
by Greg Hopkins.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.982
And the title of this
movement is "Sneakers."

00:08:12.982 --> 00:08:15.788
[MUSIC - TRE CORDA, "SNEAKERS"]

00:15:23.612 --> 00:15:27.596

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:43.960
GREG HOPKINS: Thank
you very much.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.350
Yeah, it's such a joy to have
these wonderful musicians play

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.250
the music you're
hearing in your head.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.390
And it comes out like that.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.945
Thank you so much, guys.

00:15:53.945 --> 00:15:55.340
This next one I also wrote.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.070
And it's an homage
to my late cat.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.410
His name was Cargassian.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:06.950
And he was very deft at walking
in the dark up on the mantels.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.750
And you could hear the china
just clinking together.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.290
Nothing ever fell or broke.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.640
But it just tingled
a little bit.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.210
So you knew he was there.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.380
Anyway, so please
enjoy "Cargassian."

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.630
He had blue hair.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.742

the [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:10.112 --> 00:21:11.820
TIM RAY: Eugene and
I had the opportunity

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.014
to work with some of the
students in Mark Harvey's

00:21:15.014 --> 00:21:16.950
improvisation class today.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.886
And that's their assignment.

00:21:18.886 --> 00:21:20.822
They have to play
that for us next week.

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:21.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.726
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:23.726 --> 00:21:25.178
GREG HOPKINS: Get stratching.

00:21:25.178 --> 00:21:26.650
TIM RAY: Get scratching.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.111
So we're going to continue on.

00:21:29.111 --> 00:21:33.996
This is a recent piece that
I wrote, pretty recent.

00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:36.454
GREG HOPKINS: Tim, this is the
first time we're playing it.

00:21:36.454 --> 00:21:37.426
TIM RAY: So I guess--

00:21:37.426 --> 00:21:39.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:42.285
I guess that makes it recent.

00:21:42.285 --> 00:21:47.762
No, this was for the
occasion of my wife

00:21:47.762 --> 00:21:52.590
and I, who's here tonight, for
our 25th wedding anniversary,

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.090
one of the things we
did to mark that was we

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:59.240
bought this clock,
this big chiming clock.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.384
And there's a long story
that goes behind it.

00:22:03.384 --> 00:22:05.648
But basically the ones
that were really cool

00:22:05.648 --> 00:22:07.606
that sound beautiful and
that look really nice,

00:22:07.606 --> 00:22:08.647
we couldn't afford those.

00:22:08.647 --> 00:22:09.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:15.460
So we got this kind of sort
of smallish and the case

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.440
is a little misshapen.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.675
And it's only got one hand.

00:22:20.675 --> 00:22:23.710
And it makes this
horrendous chiming sound.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.690
It's really bad.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.660
Like for the first month
after we got the clock,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.135
every hour the
dogs would run out

00:22:31.135 --> 00:22:32.620
of the room,
because they thought

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.290
something terrible
was about to happen.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.700
But now the dogs are used to it.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.640
And we're used to it.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.660
We actually kind of fell in
love with this clock now.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.330
Another thing I did for
this was I wrote a song.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.220
And the title of
this song is Joy.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.610
And if you listen
at the end, you

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:53.366
will here 25 chimes
for the 25 years.

00:36:34.297 --> 00:36:40.748
That of course, from the opera
Carmen, or our version of that.

00:36:40.748 --> 00:36:43.213
That's also kind of neat for us.

00:36:43.213 --> 00:36:45.663
Actually, Mark, I think
summed it up perfectly

00:36:45.663 --> 00:36:46.329
before the show.

00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:51.300
He said, yeah, that manages to
offend the French, the Spanish,

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.722
and the Cubans all at once.

00:36:53.722 --> 00:36:57.442
I think he's right, too, not
to mention classical music

00:36:57.442 --> 00:36:59.190
in general.

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:01.840

Eugene a breather.

going to do a duet.

we're going to play,

what we're going to play.

to say, composer.

Thank you, Alan.

"Little Rootie Tootie,"
is the name of that.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.018
Written for his
son, apparently he

00:43:36.018 --> 00:43:38.551
called his son
Little Rootie Tootie.

something completely different.

EUGENE FRIESEN: OK, sure thing.

00:43:45.446 --> 00:43:50.040
This shows a little of the
different side of improvising.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.505
This is a piece that was
originally a [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:53.505 --> 00:43:57.960
As we were discussing
this afternoon, some of us

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.435
benefit from launching
into an improvisation

00:44:00.435 --> 00:44:01.920
by kind of limiting
the boundaries

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.128
of the language a little bit.

00:44:03.128 --> 00:44:05.890
In this case, this
was pretty much

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:08.986
a diotronic piece that
was a free improve.

00:44:08.986 --> 00:44:12.280
It was recorded in a beautiful
cathedral, St. John the Divine,

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.256
in one November night in 1986.

00:44:15.256 --> 00:44:17.736
And thank goodness
the tape was rolling.

00:44:17.736 --> 00:44:19.720
It turned out to
be something that I

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.720
wanted to play again and again.

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.970
I call it "First Ride."

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:26.786
And we went back and
transcribed the original improvs

00:44:26.786 --> 00:44:28.694
so we could perform it again.

00:44:28.694 --> 00:44:31.079

job of reinventing

00:44:31.079 --> 00:44:33.068

night some years ago.

00:50:01.791 --> 00:50:03.264
Now I'm trying to decide.

00:50:03.264 --> 00:50:04.877
As you can see, we
have way too much

00:50:04.877 --> 00:50:06.210
music for the time we have left.

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:08.665

choose a little bit here.

Let's do Bartok.

As I'm sure you've probably
figured out by now,

00:50:20.449 --> 00:50:23.886
we're playing a lot
with classical music.

00:50:23.886 --> 00:50:26.579
And we're obviously
influenced by classical music.

00:50:26.579 --> 00:50:28.046
It's a lot of what we're doing.

00:50:28.046 --> 00:50:29.513
And now we're
actually going to try

00:50:29.513 --> 00:50:31.947
to play some classical music.

00:50:31.947 --> 00:50:32.447
I know.

00:50:32.447 --> 00:50:35.870
I know, I thought
the same thing.

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.826
And these guys-- well, anyway.

00:50:37.826 --> 00:50:41.738
But of course, we're not
going to play it straight.

00:50:41.738 --> 00:50:44.518
This is something else, and by
the way, it's on the new CD.

00:50:44.518 --> 00:50:47.392
I was introduced to these piano
pieces, Bartok, Bela Bartok,

00:50:47.392 --> 00:50:51.230
piano pieces back
when I was at college.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.405
And I was immediately
attracted to them

00:50:53.405 --> 00:50:55.321
because the title of
them is "Improvisations."

00:50:55.321 --> 00:50:57.604
Then I thought, cool.

00:50:57.604 --> 00:51:00.568
I get to just make up stuff
and call it classical music.

00:51:00.568 --> 00:51:03.038
But it turns out, it
doesn't work that way.

00:51:03.038 --> 00:51:05.460
You have to play the
notes that are out there.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.060
But they're called
improvisations,

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:08.830
but they're all written out.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:10.315
So I was a little disappointed.

00:51:10.315 --> 00:51:13.285
But nevertheless, I loved these.

00:51:13.285 --> 00:51:15.265
I play these pieces,
and I love them.

00:51:15.265 --> 00:51:19.080
And I kind of rediscovered them
by accident a few years ago.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.190
And I thought this would be
great to, first of all, to try

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.074
with the trio,
and second of all,

00:51:24.074 --> 00:51:26.130
to actually put
some improvisation

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:30.370
into the "Improvisations."

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.720
So with apologies
to Bela Bartok.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.305
We're going to do three-- these
are eight short piano pieces.

00:51:36.305 --> 00:51:38.721
And we're going to do three
of them, number five, number

00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:39.720
three, and number eight.

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:09.746
[MUSIC - TRE CORDA,

01:00:11.978 --> 01:00:16.469
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:29.443 --> 01:00:30.441
Thanks very much.

01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:31.510
Thank you.

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:34.863
So we're going to
do one more song

01:00:34.863 --> 01:00:39.653
and get our in the beautiful
cool air once again.

01:00:39.653 --> 01:00:42.530
But before we do, a
couple of reminders.

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:44.030
If you're interested
in a CD, we've

01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:49.644
got the new CD, the new
Tre Corda CD, Squeaky Toy.

01:00:49.644 --> 01:00:54.870
And I'm told that my merchandise
staff out there gives

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:56.960
huge discounts to students.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.165
Huge discounts for students.

01:01:00.165 --> 01:01:05.390
And Greg Hopkins's new CD is
also out on the table, right?

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:09.016
Greg Hopkins has a new
sextet, a quintet plus one,

01:01:09.016 --> 01:01:11.980
as he calls it, which to
me sounds like a sextet,

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.462
but apparently it's different.

01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:14.022
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:14.022 --> 01:01:15.438
GREG HOPKINS:
You're the plus one.

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:16.521
TIM RAY: I'm the plus one?

01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:17.326
OK.

01:01:17.326 --> 01:01:20.040
So look for that as well.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.680
We also have, for
the new CD, you know,

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.166
we're all old guys,
relatively speaking.

01:01:28.166 --> 01:01:30.158
I'm very proud of myself.

01:01:30.158 --> 01:01:33.644
I actually have download cards
out there, for a discount rate.

01:01:33.644 --> 01:01:35.360
I forget what the
discount rate is.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.370
She'll tell you.

01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:37.952
You can buy a little
download card.

01:01:37.952 --> 01:01:38.910
It's cheaper than a CD.

01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:40.888
That much I know.

01:01:40.888 --> 01:01:43.551
And go download
it from a CD Baby.

01:01:43.551 --> 01:01:45.217
So that's a cool thing
to do if you just

01:01:45.217 --> 01:01:47.247
want the digital,
the ones and zeroes.

01:01:47.247 --> 01:01:50.000
That's a good way to do that.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.998
And mailing list, if you
want to get on email list.

01:01:52.998 --> 01:01:55.746
You can also do
that at the table.

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:59.410
And I think that's it
except for two more things.

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:02.520
Of course I want to
give a big thank you

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.592
to MIT and to the folks
here at Killian Hall

01:02:05.592 --> 01:02:07.300
for providing this
beautiful space for us

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.796
to play in, and particularly
to my good friend

01:02:10.796 --> 01:02:13.724

really glad to be finishing up

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:28.024
the series of improvising
groups here at MIT.

01:02:28.024 --> 01:02:30.350
And we're having a great time.

01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:35.204

want to come find us,

three or four songs here.

Should we-- do you have an idea?

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.520
Oh, you're pointing at Greg.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.728
We could do "Theme Park" or
we could "Church Rhythm."

01:03:28.728 --> 01:03:30.222
Let's do "Church Rhythm."

01:03:30.222 --> 01:03:33.459
OK, we're going to do another--
we started with a Eugene

01:03:33.459 --> 01:03:34.704
Friesen composition.

01:03:34.704 --> 01:03:36.912
We're going to end with a
Eugene Friesen composition.

01:03:36.912 --> 01:03:48.648
This is entitled,
"Church Rhythm."
