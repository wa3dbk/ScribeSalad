00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.270
PROFESSOR: So did
everyone turn in PSET1?

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.770
Yes?

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.220
Good.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.760
OK, so there is a PSET1
critique due in a few days.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.189
My advice?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.215
You already did PSET1.

00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:35.090
You remember what you
wrote out on the proof.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.506
Look at the solution.

00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:38.630
Write one paragraph today,
and you're done with it.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.800
Then you go focus on PSET2.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.334
If you leave it
off until Tuesday,

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.250
you're going to have to
read your proof again,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.370
remember what you're thinking.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.577
It's a lot more work.

00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:49.160
Just do it now, get
it out of the way,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.466
and put PSET1 behind you.

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.340
AUDIENCE: Is the critique
only for the proof?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.784
Or is this for all of them?

00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:55.450
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.399
Just the proof.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.440
So you have to compare
your proof with our proof?

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:02.880
AUDIENCE: Is there an
assignment for that?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.876
Or do we just know to do it?

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:05.610
PROFESSOR: Uh.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.475
PSET1 be Stellar.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.580
Oh, no, sorry.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.413
It's not in Stellar.

00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:13.580
It's on our new grading
site that just went out.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.330
So you have to go to
our new grading site,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.500
and you have to type
in your critique there.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.790
And it's one paragraph.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.220
You should aim
for one paragraph.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.760
If you're doing more
than that, then you're

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.676
doing something wrong.

00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:25.300
And it's LATEX Plus math mode.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.460
So you can use math mode,
and that's about it.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.852
OK, any more questions
about the critique?

00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:32.560
It's a new thing.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.160
We care about it because it will
make our grading life easier.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.360
And because it'll force you to
look at the solutions and see

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.130
what you understood
and what you didn't.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.060
So we care about it.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.960
Don't ignore it.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.638
Yes?

00:01:43.638 --> 00:01:45.304
AUDIENCE: Like, how
much is it weighted?

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:48.294
How much does it count
toward the grade?

00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:49.960
PROFESSOR: If you
don't have a critique,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.394
we will most likely
give you a 0 for proof.

00:01:53.394 --> 00:01:54.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.070
PROFESSOR: If your proof is bad
and your critique of the proof

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.070
is good, then you
might get something.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370
If your proof is bad and
you have no critique--

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.370
actually if your proof
is whatever it is and you

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.619
have no critique, you get a 0.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.032
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [CHUCKLE]

00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:11.740
PROFESSOR: Any more
questions about that?

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.080
OK.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.740
Who needs help remembering
what the document distance

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.960
problem is?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.410
OK.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.350
Everyone who went to lecture
or to [INAUDIBLE] remembers.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.840
That's good.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.360
Who went to lecture last time?

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.290
Cool.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.010
That's good.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.560
So we did insertion
sort and merge sort

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.970
from a theoretical standpoint.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.851
Today we're going to look at
the code for the insertion sort

00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:45.100
and, if we have time, look
at the code for merge-sort,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.660
and use the same strategy as we
did last time to analyze them,

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.290
look at the running time, make
sure the running time matches

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.410
the theory, and see how
pseudocode turns into Python.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.690
So you all have your listings.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.790
Last time in document
distance, we covered Main,

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.570
and we covered most
of the functions

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.450
except for count frequency.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.200
Can anyone remind me what
the call graph looked like?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.700
So the call graph
is the tree that I

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.990
had up on the left,
and it started at Main.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.150
Thank you.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:40.610
So Main calls word frequencies
for file, which in turn calls?

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.470
AUDIENCE: Well, it's
probably line list.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.090
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.042
AUDIENCE: And count frequency.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.150
PROFESSOR: So we pretend we
don't see the read file called.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.360
We assume that the data
is already in memory

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.970
or that the call
takes time that's

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.730
proportional to the running--
to the length of the file.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.036
And we only look at get-word
from line list and count

00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:07.535
frequency.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.390
OK.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.072
Who else does Main call?

00:04:17.072 --> 00:04:18.030
AUDIENCE: Vector angle?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.624
PROFESSOR: And the vector angle?

00:04:28.624 --> 00:04:29.624
AUDIENCE: Inner product.

00:04:38.017 --> 00:04:38.600
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.370
Let's put up the constants
for-- for the document distance

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.720
problem that we used last time.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.780
So we said that the
document has W words.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.170
And then when you take
that list of words

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.330
and you turn it into
a distance vector,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.850
you will get assigned
to a document vector.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.180
You will get L elements, which
basically means L unique words.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.730
So L is the document
vector length.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.530
And we assume we're using a
natural language like English,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.090
so all the words
are bounded in size.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.470
Like 5 to 10
characters, for example.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.210
And to make our
life easier, we say

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:30.430
all the words have the same
size W. So w is the word length.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.810
Using these numbers,
can anyone remind me

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.190
what we said the costs
for these methods are?

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.690
And we didn't analyze
count frequency,

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.740
so it's OK to not
take my word for it

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.800
and not tell me what
I said last time.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.010
But I would like numbers for
word frequencies from file,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.084
get word from line list, vector
angle, and inner product.

00:05:50.084 --> 00:05:51.915
AUDIENCE: Was that mu squared?

00:05:51.915 --> 00:05:53.160
That was last time.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.380
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.150
Which-- which one?

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.410
Does anyone-- does
anyone else want to try?

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.780
Let's not do guessing.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.290
I'll pull them up
if nobody remembers.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.910
I spent an entire hour on
that, and you guys did too.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.574
It was painful.

00:06:11.574 --> 00:06:12.282
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:06:12.282 --> 00:06:14.924
But we had to, like, you
know, add them up, and then--

00:06:14.924 --> 00:06:15.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.340
So we did a lot of
work for those numbers.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.350
So get word from line list
was order of W squared.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.490
Does anyone remember why?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.220
What made it take so much time?

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.900
AUDIENCE: 'Cause you
append it to the word list.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.467
For, like, you add it to
the end to go through.

00:06:39.467 --> 00:06:40.050
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.530
So you add it.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.920
So what?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.922
AUDIENCE: So, like,
every time you need it,

00:06:47.922 --> 00:06:52.260
you, like, do word list equals
word list plus words in line.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.070
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.300
Excellent.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.200
So get words from
line list, line five.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.580
There's a plus there.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.630
And that plus sign messes
up the performance.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.890
So that's why it's w squared.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.800
Count frequency,
we didn't cover it,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.160
you had to take my word for it.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.400
So we will cover it now.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.145
And, inner product.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.610
So suppose you have two vectors
of line-- length L1 and L2.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.700
How much time does it take
to compute the inner product?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.492
AUDIENCE: L1, L2 time.

00:07:34.492 --> 00:07:35.075
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.970
So how much time does
vector angle take?

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:49.317
AUDIENCE: L1 L2 time.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.509
PROFESSOR: L1 L2.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.800
So it makes three calls, right?

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.270
You get the two things.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.450
First, it computes the inner
product of the two lists.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.890
And then it has to compute the
inner product of each vector--

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.359
of each document
vector with itself.

00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:10.525
Because that's what's on
the bottom of the fraction.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.210
So what's the running
time for that?

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.710
AUDIENCE: Plus L1
squared, plus L2 squared.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.880
PROFESSOR: Plus L1
squared, plus L2 squared.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.380
So someone was really helpful
last time and asked me,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.600
can you make this
simpler with some math?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.080
And I said, I don't know
so I don't think I will.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.820
But I looked at-- my, I
looked at my high school math

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.549
afterwards, and it turns out
that these-- so L1 squared

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.830
plus L2 squared are guaranteed
to be greater than L1 L2

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.009
as long as these
numbers are positive.

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:44.550
And we're working
with document list,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.350
so they're always positive.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.155
So this will go away.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.080
So let's assume count frequency
is w squared or smaller.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.310
So the total running time for
word frequencies from file

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.580
is w squared.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.300
What's the running
time for everything?

00:09:13.114 --> 00:09:14.780
AUDIENCE: Would just
be, like, w squared

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.410
plus L1 squared plus L2 squared?

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.160
PROFESSOR: Almost.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.330
AUDIENCE: Actually, it depends
on which one's greater, right?

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.330
PROFESSOR: Well, almost.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:27.580
So here W works, assuming you
get one document with W words.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.230
But word frequencies from
files is called twice, once

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.870
for each document.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.060
First document has W1 words,
second document has W2 words.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.974
So what's the running time?

00:09:38.974 --> 00:09:42.750
AUDIENCE: W1 squared
plus W2 squared.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:48.000
PROFESSOR: W1 squared
plus W2 squared.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.200
So I take this, and I add this.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.590
Right?

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.380
Except when I add this, if
I want to add L1 squared,

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.290
I know L1 is the number
of unique documents--

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.600
of unique words in the document.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.450
And W1 is the total number
of words in the document.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.177
W1 guaranteed to be
greater or equal than L1,

00:10:07.177 --> 00:10:08.260
so it's going to dominate.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.440
I don't need to add it.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.360
Same for L2.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.178
This is it.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.700
OK.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.054
You guys don't seem to
remember the numbers for these.

00:10:18.054 --> 00:10:20.220
So that means I didn't
torture you enough last time.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.830
So let's do more.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.270
Let's look at count frequency.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.750
And let's compute
the cost for that.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.730
So what we did last time was, we
went through each line of code.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.820
We thought, how
much time does it

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.550
take to execute the line once?

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.710
And how many times
does the line run?

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.819
And then we compute the product
of that, add everything up,

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:51.360
and that's the cost
for the function.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.260
First off, before
I put numbers here,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.540
what does the method to do?

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.040
AUDIENCE: It takes
a list of words--

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.730
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.150
AUDIENCE: For each
item in that list,

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.870
checks to see if
it's-- you know,

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:25.407
list of words that
it's-- counted, right?

00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:25.990
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.290
So you're telling me
what the code does.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.070
PROFESSOR: Try to
look at Main or try

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.420
to look at word
frequencies for files.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.540
So look at it top-down, and tell
me what the purpose of it is.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.310
What's the goal?

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:45.108
AUDIENCE: Making a list
of-- and each object

00:11:45.108 --> 00:11:47.400
is a list with a
word and a number.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.220
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.100
Excellent.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.790
So big picture, I have
the first document.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.640
I read it in.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.106
I break it up into words.

00:11:54.106 --> 00:11:55.230
And I have a list of words.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.380
That's what word
frequencies for file

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.920
gives me-- sorry, that's what
you get words from line list

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.190
gives me.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.890
List of words.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:16.000
The fox is in the hat.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.600
And this gets passed
to count frequency,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.700
and count frequency
gives me, you said,

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.430
an object, which is a list.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.180
Of lists, where each
of them has the word

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.590
and how many times it shows up.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:39.510
So I would have "the" shows
up twice, "fox" shows up

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:51.110
once, "is" shows up
once, "in" shows up once,

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:56.110
and-- I need a shorter
example-- "hat" shows up once.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.155
So it takes this and
turns it into that.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.090
So on line 2, I have a
list L that's initialized.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.770
And then, at the
end, it's returned.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.840
So I'm going to guess that L
is going to look like this.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.050
Line 3, for new word in word
list, iterates over the input.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.430
So iterates over this.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.340
And then, line 4 checks
to see, for each new word,

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.150
it looks at the list that
I have under construction.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.950
So exam-- for example, if
I ran through all the words

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.360
and then I'm trying to
put in hat right now,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.250
I wouldn't have it here.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.890
What line 4 does is, it
looks at all the entries.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.710
And it says, if I
can find the words--

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.180
so if I can find the
word hat somewhere here--

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.090
then increment the number.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.642
If I can't, then
make a new entry

00:13:49.642 --> 00:13:52.100
and say that the word shows up
once, because it's the first

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:52.600
I see it.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.590
So this is what the code does.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:01.640
Now let's see how
fast it does that.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:07.450
So line 2 initialize the
output to an empty list.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.071
What's the cost for that?

00:14:10.071 --> 00:14:10.988
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:10.988 --> 00:14:11.862
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:14:11.862 --> 00:14:12.580
How many times?

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.810
For new word in word lists.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:20.310
Cost?

00:14:23.726 --> 00:14:26.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.070
I know the cost is 1.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.330
PROFESSOR: OK, so we are-- here,
it's a bit confusing, right?

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.610
We're saying that, oh, there's
does iteration over a list.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.920
And each step of the
iteration is constant time,

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.210
but the iteration
happens L times.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.510
I'm sorry, not L times.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.400
The length of the list times.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.120
How many-- how many
elements are in word lists?

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.730
I heard a very low W, so
I will pretend I heard it.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.350
Or I hope I heard W. So
word list, the words I

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:06.690
got from the document,
W. How about the if.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:13.570
So, it looks at the
word that I have-- oh.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.680
This code is confusing because
I forgot a line, right?

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.580
Pretend that between line--
oh, no, sorry, I didn't.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.512
New word is-- new word
is assigned in line 3.

00:15:23.512 --> 00:15:29.030
So new word in line 3 is
compared to the first element

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.280
of the entry that's
assigned in line 4.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.960
So hat is compared with
the, fox, so on, so forth.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.530
And if the comparison is
true, it runs line 6 and 7.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.230
And if not, it keeps looping.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:50.300
So line 5, the if how,
many times does it run?

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.498
Just the comparison.

00:15:52.498 --> 00:15:53.810
AUDIENCE: W.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.107
PROFESSOR: W.

00:15:55.107 --> 00:15:56.148
AUDIENCE: Oh, no, no, no.

00:15:56.148 --> 00:15:57.072
No.

00:15:57.072 --> 00:15:58.920
I'm thinking of line 4.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.941
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:15:59.941 --> 00:16:00.440
Yeah.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.260
I'm getting confused too.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.540
So let's start with line 4.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.520
Sorry.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.882
Shouldn't do line 5.

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.059
AUDIENCE: --new word,
then you're not-- like,

00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:09.850
you're not going to
run through that again.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.516
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:16:10.516 --> 00:16:12.530
Let's worry about
that right afterwards.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.760
Let's do line 4 first.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.790
Sorry, I jumped over line 4.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.520
So, line 4 definitely
runs W times

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.970
because it's inside the for
loop from line 3 to line 9.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:29.510
So everything here will
definitely run W times.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.910
But how many times
does it run overall?

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:36.377
So, line 4 iterates over
all the entries here.

00:16:36.377 --> 00:16:37.710
How many times does that happen?

00:16:41.161 --> 00:16:47.570
AUDIENCE: 1 plus W
over-- times 10/2,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:54.588
because it's just worst case,
L-- the length of L increases

00:16:54.588 --> 00:16:56.830
by 1 every time.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.950
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.350
PROFESSOR: OK, so I like that
you started with worst case.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.130
Normally I would
say exactly that.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.619
Worst case or W. But we
had a different constant

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:11.480
for the number of words
that you have in the end.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.230
So let's say something a little
bit better than W. Let's say,

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.880
let's put the lower bound on it.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.036
So yeah, worst case, all
the words are different.

00:17:20.036 --> 00:17:21.619
But what if they're
not all different?

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:25.632
And what if in the end
I know I have L words?

00:17:25.632 --> 00:17:27.653
CLASS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:27.653 --> 00:17:28.569
PROFESSOR: Worst case.

00:17:33.001 --> 00:17:33.500
Almost.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.940
So, I know I have a W
from the outer loop.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.680
For each word in the
outer loop, how many times

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.800
does the inner loop execute?

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.210
How many times do I have
to go through something

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.250
in the inner list?

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.090
So I know here I have
W words, suppose here I

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.480
have L elements in the vector.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.195
For each one of
these, how many times

00:17:58.195 --> 00:18:02.440
do I have to go through--
So how many elements do I

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.946
have to go through here?

00:18:03.946 --> 00:18:05.764
AUDIENCE: Depends on
where you are, though.

00:18:05.764 --> 00:18:07.930
For the first word, you
only have to go through one.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:08.230
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.530
But--

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.590
AUDIENCE: For the second
word, you have to through--

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.870
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.280
But I heard the worst case.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.780
And I like that,
because it's easier

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.071
to reason about the worst case.

00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:17.480
And most of the time it's
sort of like the average case.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.200
AUDIENCE: So then,
length of list-- L.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.530
PROFESSOR: The length of the
list, and that's L. Worst case,

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.976
the first words that I see
will be L different words.

00:18:27.976 --> 00:18:29.350
And then all the
words that I see

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.840
will be the same as the
words that I saw before.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.080
So worst case, the list
will grow to L very fast,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.085
and then I'll keep
seeing L L L. And I'll

00:18:39.085 --> 00:18:40.710
ignore what was there
in the beginning,

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:44.460
and I'll say L times.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.320
So I know the second list
is bounded by L in length,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.470
the first list is
bounded by W in length.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.960
So worst case this
runs L times W times.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.394
And what's the
cost of iterating?

00:18:56.394 --> 00:18:58.854
AUDIENCE: What is the
difference between L and W?

00:18:58.854 --> 00:19:01.965
L is the document vector length,
and W is the number of words.

00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:04.803
But isn't the number of
elements in the document vector

00:19:04.803 --> 00:19:07.799
the number of words?

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:09.090
PROFESSOR: How about this case?

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:09.810
What's W?

00:19:15.134 --> 00:19:16.110
AUDIENCE: 6, yeah.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.790
PROFESSOR: So L is the number
of unique words in a document.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.580
And I heard a
really cool argument

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.160
that I liked last time.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.120
Does anyone remember?

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.840
About L?

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.160
If we're really dealing with a
natural language like English,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.636
how many words do
I have in English?

00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:41.135
AUDIENCE: Well, I
think, at the max,

00:19:41.135 --> 00:19:43.997
there's actually around
250,000, but a lot of them

00:19:43.997 --> 00:19:45.157
are not used anymore.

00:19:45.157 --> 00:19:45.740
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.720
So 250,000, right?

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.820
Max.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.480
So that's a constant.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.930
If I have a document
that contains

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.060
all the writings of all the
authors that were ever done,

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:02.771
and say that's a billion words,
L is still going to be 250,000.

00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:03.270
Right?

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.882
So L can be very
different from W.

00:20:04.882 --> 00:20:06.965
That's why we're keeping
track of them separately.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.910
One W L times W. What's
the cost of iterating?

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.530
So we know how many
times line 4 runs,

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:26.930
but what's the cost of one
step of iterating in the list?

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:27.430
1.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.930
Very good.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.036
Line 5.

00:20:32.036 --> 00:20:33.160
How many times does it run?

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.230
AUDIENCE: W times L?

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.990
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.580
Same as line 4, right?

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.800
The if is run all the time.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.860
And lines 5 and 6 only run
sometimes, but-- sorry,

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:53.750
line 6 and 7 only run sometimes,
but line 5 runs all the time.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.740
What is the cost?

00:21:01.642 --> 00:21:03.280
AUDIENCE: We can
say it's constant.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.780
PROFESSOR: We can
say it's constant.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.560
I like we can say
it's constant, but why

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.020
is it that we can
say it's constant?

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.480
Why don't I just say 1,
if-- this is an empty list.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.280
This is a number.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.340
AUDIENCE: Depends
on the word length.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:14.923
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:14.923 --> 00:21:17.065
It depends on the word
lis-- length, very good.

00:21:17.065 --> 00:21:18.690
AUDIENCE: And we're
assuming that words

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.170
are all the same length.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.637
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:21.637 --> 00:21:22.220
AUDIENCE: And?

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.190
So, 1 times L W. Little w.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.390
PROFESSOR: OK, very good.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.980
So we do assume that all the
words are the same length.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.920
But unless I tell you that
the length is really small,

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.630
which I did, you can't say 1.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.000
So, when you said we can say
it's constant, it's right.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.770
We can say, but we
also have to say why,

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.890
or at least think
why, that's the case.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.760
So it's W-- we're going to use
W here and when we copy it here,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.144
we're going to forget about it.

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.852
AUDIENCE: Can you put
a top bar on the W,

00:21:52.852 --> 00:21:56.830
just so I can tell that
it's not the other W.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:07.950
PROFESSOR: OK But you have to
be responsible for reminding

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:08.770
me to put that.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.160
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.240
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.470
So string comparison,
not constant.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.770
If I have two very
long strings that

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.550
only differ in the
last character,

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.550
I have to go through them
character by character

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.810
by character until I find
the last character that's

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:25.580
different.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.770
Because until I look at that,
the strings might be equal.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.926
So comparing two
long strings takes

00:22:30.926 --> 00:22:33.175
time that's proportional to
the length of the strings.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.130
OK, so line 5 costs
w, tricky part,

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:44.420
runs L times W part--
L times W times.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.350
How about line 6 and 7?

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.280
I didn't ask line 6, I
asked line 6 and 7 together,

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.690
because there is a trick there.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.190
AUDIENCE: I think it's
constant for line 6, right?

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.518
PROFESSOR: Why?

00:23:10.518 --> 00:23:12.858
AUDIENCE: 'Cause it's a number.

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:14.715
And one place in the entry.

00:23:14.715 --> 00:23:16.280
We've already grabbed the entry.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.420
PROFESSOR: So the cost
of running it once is 1.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.700
Good.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.190
I can tell you that that's
the same case for 7.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.560
How many times do they run?

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.490
This is the hard part.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.980
AUDIENCE: Wait, does break
line break out of one loop?

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.605
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:23:35.605 --> 00:23:39.940
Break breaks out of the
loop between lines 4 and 7.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.300
I have a question.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:46.350
AUDIENCE: Is L supposed
to be not in line with if?

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.850
Yes.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.580
PROFESSOR: It is supposed
to be where it is.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.640
I will talk-- yes.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.880
So what happens is, that
else is in line with a for.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.430
And if the for loop
runs to completion,

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:00.860
then it does get executed.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.097
If there's a break
somewhere inside the for,

00:24:04.097 --> 00:24:05.305
then it doesn't get executed.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.650
So the idea behind
that is, usually

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.510
use this for finding stuff.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:15.760
So you iterate over a list,
and when you find something,

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.516
break out of the loop.

00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:19.390
You did something, you
break out of the loop.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.435
If you didn't find it,
you can put an else

00:24:21.435 --> 00:24:23.167
and then say what code happens.

00:24:23.167 --> 00:24:25.000
And you don't have to
write code on your own

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.420
to check if you broke
out of the loop.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.230
So if break executes,
then it's going

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.570
to take us out of the loop.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:35.930
It's going to ignore the else.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.282
And it's going to run
the loop on line 3 again.

00:24:38.282 --> 00:24:39.865
So it's going to do
another iteration.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.280
So line 6 and 7, how many times?

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.120
AUDIENCE: W minus L?

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.450
PROFESSOR: W minus L.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.526
AUDIENCE: Like, if
it's the difference

00:24:50.526 --> 00:24:54.962
in number of words and
number of-- unique words.

00:24:54.962 --> 00:24:55.670
PROFESSOR: Smart.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:25:00.520
You gave the precise answer
right the first time.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.230
W minus L. Very good.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:13.960
And what happens once--
what happens once this runs?

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:21.730
Why do I know-- why do I know
that the if won't be-- Oh.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.660
Sorry, I'm getting
myself confused.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.950
So it's going to run W
minus L times total, right?

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.570
Total times overall
without this W thing here,

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.547
so I should put
an arrow and say--

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.070
Now suppose I
didn't notice this.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.510
Is there another way I
can get the decent bounds?

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.165
So this is the right,
perfect answer.

00:25:45.165 --> 00:25:46.290
You have this, you're done.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.623
You don't need to think further.

00:25:47.623 --> 00:25:49.420
Suppose you don't have this.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.350
What else can you do?

00:25:53.479 --> 00:25:55.070
AUDIENCE: But we
don't have what?

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.770
PROFESSOR: If I didn't
notice that, hey, there

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:03.330
are L words-- There
are L new words,

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.690
W words total, so W minus
L words repeat themselves.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.230
So this is how many times
the if is going to be true.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.330
If I didn't have
that, then I could

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.750
see that line 7 breaks
out of the loop.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.314
So if that if runs
once, then we're done.

00:26:19.314 --> 00:26:20.230
We're out of the loop.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.430
It's not going to run again.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.210
So a bound that's not as
precise as the one you gave me

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:31.265
is 1 times W, because it
runs, at most, once per loop.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.720
Does people see this?

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.810
So this is an easy way
to cop out of thinking.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.230
And I don't like to think more
than necessary, because you

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.100
have finite time on
a test or in life,

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.720
and you don't want to spend
too much time on one thing.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.670
We covered the loop.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.010
Let's look at else and append.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.510
I already got a
helpful question,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.940
so I explained when
the else would run.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.240
The running time for else.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.570
Else is a flow--
control flow statement.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.244
It's like break,
so Python will keep

00:27:10.244 --> 00:27:11.910
track of whether a
loop completed or not

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:12.899
in constant time.

00:27:12.899 --> 00:27:13.690
I'll give you that.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.750
That's in the cost model.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:21.170
How many times does
this else run, at most?

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.840
OK, L. Good.

00:27:25.546 --> 00:27:26.865
Perfect.

00:27:26.865 --> 00:27:27.573
How about line 9?

00:27:36.012 --> 00:27:36.976
Loop stops here.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.200
How about line 9?

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.500
How many times does it run?

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.886
That's easy.

00:27:44.886 --> 00:27:46.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.800
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.820
And what does it do?

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.590
It's an append.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.111
What's the cost for append?

00:27:53.111 --> 00:27:53.902
AUDIENCE: Constant.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.680
PROFESSOR: OK Line 10
runs how many times?

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.554
What's the cost?

00:28:02.554 --> 00:28:03.054
AUDIENCE: 1?

00:28:07.307 --> 00:28:09.390
PROFESSOR: You guys didn't
listen to me last time.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.020
So I was saying you have
to look at the notes

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.270
and you have to practice this.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.480
Because you have to have
this model in your mind.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.160
So that when you're
writing code,

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.710
this has to happen
automatically.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.306
You shouldn't have to
think explicitly about it.

00:28:20.306 --> 00:28:22.180
Because if you do, you're
not going to do it.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.679
AUDIENCE: For the
else, shouldn't it

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:28.612
be W tim-- I mean, it would
be called W times not L times?

00:28:28.612 --> 00:28:30.744
Because you want to look
at the outer loop and not

00:28:30.744 --> 00:28:32.060
the inner loop?

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.942
So it can-- you call all--
once at the end of the total--

00:28:35.942 --> 00:28:37.080
the inner for.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:37.580
Right?

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:43.590
So, so it could be-- happen W
times, maximum, not L times.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:47.960
'Cause the L is the for loop
that the else coincides with.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.502
And the else would
only happen once

00:28:50.502 --> 00:28:53.410
for every total
iteration of that.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.400
PROFESSOR: OK so
you're proposing W

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.070
as the bound for
the else, right?

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.643
Here.

00:28:59.643 --> 00:29:00.939
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:02.980
PROFESSOR: So I could say,
hey, it runs, at most,

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.140
once for outer loop.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.430
So it's, at most, W times.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.020
This is a nice, easy argument.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.680
We have a bound.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.670
L is a tighter bound.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.730
And when I got L,
what happened here

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.630
was the same kind of
thinking that you did earlier

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:18.960
to get this.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.580
So this bound is good,
this bound is tighter.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.260
This bound is good,
this bound is tighter.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.850
And the argument behind
this one is that, hey, this

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.570
else only happens for new words.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.300
If there's no new-- if the
word that I looked at is old,

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.900
then break is going to execute.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.040
And else is not
going to execute.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.330
So that's why I can say L.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.260
The beauty of
asymptotics is that I

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.290
can use either of the
bounds and I'll still

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.950
get the correct running time.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.510
So I'm not going to
fuss over it too much.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.290
I like the tighter ones, because
it means you guys are thinking.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.790
And you're looking
at the algorithm,

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.330
and you're understanding it.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.830
But if you don't
have them, you'll

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.329
still get the correct
running times.

00:30:02.329 --> 00:30:04.640
So I think that's nice.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.540
PROFESSOR: OK, let's get the
running time for everything.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.800
Can someone do it in one step?

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.830
Then let's do it step by step.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.710
So let's compute
partial products.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.660
What are they?

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.118
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:30:22.118 --> 00:30:25.520
W. LW.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.894
L, W, little w-- with the bar.

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:31.840
AUDIENCE: (LAUGHING)
With the bar.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.631
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

00:30:32.631 --> 00:30:39.258
AUDIENCE: W minus L. W. L, L, 1.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.020
PROFESSOR: OK, so if I add them
up, this is all asymptotic.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.530
So the biggest
one will dominate.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.190
In general, I can
just take a max

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.100
instead of doing
actual addition.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.296
So who dominates here?

00:30:54.296 --> 00:30:57.782
AUDIENCE: The fourth one down?

00:30:57.782 --> 00:30:59.780
PROFESSOR: Fourth-- OK.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.680
Yep.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:08.820
So line 5 is the biggest time
consumer in this algorithm.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.430
And I know it's W times w-bar.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:12.940
So now I'm going
to copy it here.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.575
What did I say I'll do
when I'm copying it here?

00:31:16.575 --> 00:31:18.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:18.720
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.640
So I'm assuming English
five- to ten-character words.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.320
W L. And W L is
smaller than w squared,

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.780
so the assumption that
I had before is correct.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.790
I don't have to
change anything here.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:31.597
That is good.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.190
So we noticed last time,
and already forgot by now,

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:46.230
that the biggest problem in
this whole implementation

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:50.800
was the plus in get
words from line list.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.300
Suppose we forgot about it and
we have this big pile of code,

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.100
how do I go about
making it faster?

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.720
Method one, go
through every method.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.680
Do this.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.740
Compute the running times, and
see which one's the slowest.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.190
Does this scale to
1,000 lines of code?

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.730
Not so much.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.700
We're going to be giving you
roughly 1,000 lines of code

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.960
for PSET2, and we're going
to ask it to make it faster.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.560
Do want to understand
everything?

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.350
No.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.590
Instead what you want
to do is run the code

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:25.824
through a profiler.

00:32:25.824 --> 00:32:26.740
So we have a computer.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.770
The computer can
tell you which line

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.877
takes the most time to run.

00:32:30.877 --> 00:32:32.710
So you don't have to
do it on pen and paper.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.940
Whenever we can automate, do so.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.830
So we'll teach you
how to run a profiler.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.110
It's in the notes.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.870
And if you look in
the code outputs right

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:45.080
after [INAUDIBLE], you'll
see a profiler output.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.580
So what that tells you
is for each function,

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.980
how much time does it take--
that's the total time?

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.670
And there's the
cumulative time, which

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.300
is how much does it take
together with its children?

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.380
In this case for word
frequencies from file, order

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.360
of W-- this is how
much time it takes

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.860
including the
functions it's called.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.540
So this is the cumulative time.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.940
Cumulative time is useful if
I'm during runtime analysis.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.120
Is not so useful if
I'm looking at where's

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.745
the slowness in my program?

00:33:18.745 --> 00:33:20.370
Because if you look
at cumulative time,

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:24.510
you might see the slowness
in one of the functions that

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.930
get-- that word frequencies
from file called.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.560
So the cumulative time
for this is really big,

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.140
but the total time-- the
time that's spent inside it--

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.824
is not that bad.

00:33:36.824 --> 00:33:38.240
Instead if you
look at total time,

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.520
you'll see that the worst
function is-- surprise,

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.670
surprise-- get words
from line list.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:48.150
So 5 lines to look at--
hey, there's a plus there.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:50.900
I remember from lecture
that plus copies over lists,

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:54.700
and it's kind of slow, so maybe
I should use something else.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.340
Does d remember what
else we should use?

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.290
We talked about that
last recitation.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.200
Extend.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.580
Document distance 2 .

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.580
The only difference between
it an document distance 1

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.639
is get words from
line list, line 5.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:12.580
That plus turned into an extend.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.330
One character turned to six,
so about eight keystrokes,

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.440
30% runtime improvement.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.500
Very good return on investment.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.530
Everything else is
going to be harder.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.840
So let's look at that line,
because that line dominated

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.770
the running time of get
words from line list.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:32.440
And think what's, then,
your running time for it

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.449
now that I have extend?

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.800
Does anyone remember what get
words from line list does?

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:19.765
AUDIENCE: It gets the
words out of the document.

00:35:19.765 --> 00:35:20.390
PROFESSOR: OK .

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.110
It gets the word
out of the document.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:25.720
So it reads a document that
looks like a regular text file,

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:30.240
and it gets this out of it.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.190
The way it does that is
it goes through each line,

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:36.640
reads the line as a string,
breaks up the string

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.310
into a list of words,
and then combines

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:42.240
all those lists
of words together.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.420
Get words from string,
line 4, returns

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.114
the number of words in a line.

00:35:47.114 --> 00:35:49.030
Sorry, the list of words
in the line, and then

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.510
extend combines
the lists together.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:56.140
Let's add some constants
that we had last time.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:08.220
I think we had that K is the
number of words per line.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:16.850
And Z is the number
of total lines.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:29.492
So this K is actually-- W
over Z. No, I don't like that.

00:36:29.492 --> 00:36:29.992
That's work.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:43.730
So Z is K W over
K. And we argued

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:45.370
that we're not going
to talk about K

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.490
too much, because a document
needs to fit on a screen

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.820
or needs to fit on
a piece of paper.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.740
So the line length has
to be finite, right?

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.069
Otherwise, if I have a document
that has 10,000 character

00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:57.860
lines, I can't even
write it on this board.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.940
Even though it's really long.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.300
So K, the number of words in
a line, is going to be finite.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.270
But we'll need it
for this analysis.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:10.650
So line 4 returns a list
with the words on a line.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.225
How many elements in that list?

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.660
This returns a list
with how many elements?

00:37:28.408 --> 00:37:31.459
AUDIENCE: Could K
[INAUDIBLE] words on line.

00:37:31.459 --> 00:37:33.250
PROFESSOR: So even if
I ask easy questions,

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.249
you guys have to answer.

00:37:34.249 --> 00:37:36.900
Because otherwise I'll
stall until you do.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.240
So 4 gives me a list
with K elements,

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.060
and 5 appends that small
list to the big list of words

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.040
in the entire document.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.310
Before I used plus and
that did something bad.

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.460
Now I'm using extend.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:53.248
What's the cost of
one extend called?

00:37:53.248 --> 00:37:54.706
AUDIENCE: Constant?

00:37:54.706 --> 00:37:55.912
Order of K?

00:37:55.912 --> 00:37:58.120
PROFESSOR: I want to know
your Python implementation.

00:38:02.288 --> 00:38:04.708
AUDIENCE: If Python did
it like a linked list ,

00:38:04.708 --> 00:38:08.477
like doubly linked lists,
could be order constant?

00:38:08.477 --> 00:38:09.810
PROFESSOR: I like your question.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:13.720
So if Python lists were
actually linked lists--

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.060
so if the name
wasn't confusing--

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.320
then yes, merging two
lists would be constant.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.520
But then accessing one element
in the middle of a list

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.160
would not be constant anymore.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.910
Say I want to access
element number

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:29.160
200 in a list of
10,000 elements.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.165
I have to go through
200 elements.

00:38:31.165 --> 00:38:32.540
We didn't do linked
lists when we

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.930
ran it, so don't worry about it.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.230
So they decided that it's
less confusing to have

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.710
lists actually be arrays.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.500
So Python lists, array in CLRS.

00:38:45.175 --> 00:38:47.300
AUDIENCE: That can use
their storage contiguously?

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.200
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.930
AUDIENCE: So when you copy,
why can't you copy a block?

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:52.731
Why do you have to
access each other?

00:38:52.731 --> 00:38:54.720
Does that make sense?

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.930
PROFESSOR: So, you
can copy a block,

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.600
but in order to copy
a block, you still

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.270
have to move everything.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:03.770
So if your block
is 10,000 elements,

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:08.370
you still have to move 10,000
bytes times element size.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:11.490
And the CPU works on 4 bytes
at a time or 8 bytes at a time.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.490
OK.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.150
But this is the
right kind of thing

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.910
to be thinking about when
you're doing the cost model.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:19.300
And this is what you
want to have in your head

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.424
when you're writing Python.

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:21.610
So, good.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.492
I like your question.

00:39:23.492 --> 00:39:24.950
I wanted to say
that at some point,

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:26.366
but I didn't get
the occasion yet.

00:39:26.366 --> 00:39:28.050
Lists in Python are
not lists in CLRS.

00:39:30.561 --> 00:39:31.060
OK.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:35.030
So with that long
explanation, an extend

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.590
is a list-- is a sequence
of appends, right?

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.020
If you have two
lists and you want

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.980
to extend the first
list to the second list,

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.640
extend basically goes through
each element in the second list

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.800
and calls append
on the first list.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.380
The list is length K, the
second list is length K,

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.510
so K appends are
going to happen.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.200
And append is constant time.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.910
Total cost, K.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:58.000
Now many times does line 5 run?

00:40:01.227 --> 00:40:03.265
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:03.265 --> 00:40:04.140
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.200
So what is the
total running cost

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.470
of the algorithm if this
is the line that dominates?

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.970
I don't want to do
every other line,

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.250
so I'll promise that this
is the line that dominates.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.300
What is the total running time?

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.377
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:20.377 --> 00:40:20.960
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.230
Very good.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.390
K times L. And that is?

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:33.160
Oh, K. So I shouldn't have
said K times L, sorry.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.430
L is not the number of lines.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:40.250
L is the number here, so
Z is the number of lines.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:45.720
So it's K times Z. Which
means I'm using bad letters,

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.120
so please bear with me.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.830
We'll forget about
them in a minute.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:50.830
So K times Z equals?

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.470
AUDIENCE: W.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:57.660
PROFESSOR: W. So
what do I write here?

00:41:01.994 --> 00:41:02.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:03.530
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:04.760
Good.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.830
Very good.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.800
What do I write here?

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.862
Word frequencies from file.

00:41:11.862 --> 00:41:13.137
AUDIENCE: W L.

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:13.720
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.335
What do I write here?

00:41:21.407 --> 00:41:21.990
AUDIENCE: W 1.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.237
AUDIENCE: We have to-- put L
1 squared and L 2 squared back

00:41:38.237 --> 00:41:38.950
in.

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:40.160
PROFESSOR: OK, do we?

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.060
Well, the-- No.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.535
W, you want to always be
bigger than L. I hope.

00:41:45.535 --> 00:41:46.160
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.680
So if I put it
in, L 1 squared is

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:53.570
L 1 L 1, which is
smaller than W 1 L 1.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.560
But I have to think about
it before doing that.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.260
I can't ignore this completely.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.210
So this is document distance 2.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:07.207
The asymptotic complexity
improved, the running time

00:42:07.207 --> 00:42:07.707
improved.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.410
Next thing that happens
to make this faster

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:19.180
is-- I'm not giving you
the profiler output,

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:23.040
but you have to take my word for
it that the longest methods are

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.170
count frequency
and inner product.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:29.770
So what I'm going
to do first is I'm

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.320
going to make inner
product faster.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.400
But in order to do
that, I have to make

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.550
word frequencies
for file slower.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.050
And that is because
I happen to know

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:44.030
an algorithm for inner product
that is a lot faster, if only

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:47.575
you can promise me that in this
list, the words are ordered.

00:42:47.575 --> 00:42:48.450
The words are sorted.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:57.000
So what happens in that list
1 is, the moment I see a word,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.510
if it's not in the list
I add it at the end.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.820
So the words here show up
pretty much in the order

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.710
that they show up in the file.

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.680
Well, if instead I
could have something

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:11.090
that looks like-- what is it?

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:12.470
Fox.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:13.731
In.

00:43:13.731 --> 00:43:14.230
His.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.850
Hat is somewhere here.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:22.650
So if these words
would be in this order,

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.210
together with the
word that I'm missing,

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.470
then I can combine two lists.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:31.620
I can do an inner
product a lot faster.

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.130
Let's see how that would work.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:37.360
And I'm already getting confused
my words, so let's do a trick.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.810
Let's say that instead of
words, we'll use numbers.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.570
So instead of saying
"the," I'm going

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:45.060
to say the is the 50th
word in the dictionary.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.957
So I'm going to use number 50.

00:43:47.957 --> 00:43:49.290
Because I want to write numbers.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.940
The numbers are
easier to deal with.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:53.460
So say the first
document that I have--

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:59.840
the fox is in the hat-- as
words number 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.140
And they show up twice,
once, once, once.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.720
9, once.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:17.160
And say I'm trying to compute
the inner product of this

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.370
with a document that
has word number 2

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:23.290
showing up once, word number
3 showing up once, word number

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:28.350
6 showing up once, word
number 7 showing up once,

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.174
word number 8 showing up once.

00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:35.820
OK, the algorithm for inner
product that we talked

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.050
about last time was, go
through each element in one

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:42.710
of the vectors, find an
element with the same word

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.410
in the second vector,
and if you can find it,

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:47.370
then take the number of
times the words show up

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:48.800
and multiply them.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.560
So here I have a 3, 2.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.205
I would find this element
here that has 3, 1.

00:44:54.205 --> 00:44:55.205
I have these everywhere.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:00.370
And I take the 2 and the
1 and I multiply them.

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:03.920
So the 3s have to be the same,
then I think the 2 and the 1,

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.500
and I multiply them.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.270
And for all the elements
where that's case,

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.430
I add up the results
of the multiplication.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:16.930
So step one, go through
each element in a vector.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:20.095
That's not going to get
faster if this other vector is

00:45:20.095 --> 00:45:21.260
sorted, right?

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:27.740
But the step of looking up the
second element can be sped up.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:31.430
The first and easiest way I
can speed this up is, hey,

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:32.250
this is sorted.

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:37.340
If I'm looking up three,
why not do a binary search?

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.640
What would be the
cost if I do that?

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.670
So here I have L1 element,
here I have L2 elements.

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:47.400
What's the cost of doing
one binary search here?

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.940
AUDIENCE: Log of L2?

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.660
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:55.201
And how many times do
I do a binary search?

00:45:55.201 --> 00:45:57.682
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:57.682 --> 00:45:59.640
PROFESSOR: So if I go
through each element here

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.139
and I do a binary search, which
is a nice and easy algorithm

00:46:02.139 --> 00:46:03.800
that I can explain
in 10 seconds,

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.520
I'm already faster than L1 L2.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.680
So it's worth sorting.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.200
Now, the algorithm
that we use in class

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.790
takes time proportional
to L1 plus L2.

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:17.590
So that's even
trickier, and it's

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:19.300
going to take a bit
more time to explain.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:24.250
Does-- did anyone understand
the algorithm for class

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:25.690
and wants to help me explain it?

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.790
Didn't think so.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.140
OK.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:39.230
So idea is that both of
these vectors are sorted.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:46.390
So if I have a 3 here and I
found my 3 here, next time when

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.850
I get to 4, I know
for sure that 4 is not

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:54.370
going to be anywhere here,
because this vector is sorted.

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:57.550
Say I couldn't find
4, then I go to 6.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.850
If 6 is here, when I
have to look for 8,

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:04.260
I know for sure that 8 is not
going to be anywhere up here.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:11.290
So what I do is, I have a
pointer here that remembers,

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:15.684
where's the last element
that I have seen?

00:47:15.684 --> 00:47:16.975
Does this make sense to people?

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:22.500
So when I start here
and I look at 3,

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:26.300
I have a pointer here that says,
I didn't see anything here.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.170
I look at 2, it's not 3.

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:29.050
It's smaller.

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:29.940
I look at 3.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.950
I found it, good.

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:32.720
I do my product.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.610
Then I go look for the
next element here, 4.

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:36.845
I look at 6.

00:47:36.845 --> 00:47:38.840
6 is bigger than 4.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.980
So I know for sure that nothing
below it is going to be 4.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:46.140
So I can stop right here
and keep my pointer here.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.840
Then I go to 6 here.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:48.580
And I look here.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.300
Where did I stop?

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.520
I stop here.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.030
This element matches this.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:53.750
I do my product.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.150
Keep it in.

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:58.030
Now I go to 8 here.

00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:59.310
I was at 6.

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.320
6 is smaller than 8.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.236
7 is smaller than 8.

00:48:03.236 --> 00:48:04.420
8 is equal to 8.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:05.630
I found something.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:06.850
Sweet.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:08.500
I do a product.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.730
And then I stop.

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:12.320
And I look at the next element.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.830
I know for sure that nothing
here is going to be 9,

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.610
so I can keep looking down.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:20.160
I hit the end of my list.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.310
OK.

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:25.069
Whatever I have down here--
it's going 9, 10, 11, 12--

00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:27.360
is not going to be in this
list, because it was sorted.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.475
So I can stop.

00:48:30.475 --> 00:48:34.340
AUDIENCE: How do
you keep going--

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:37.340
What algorithm so you use
to keep looking down on L2?

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.204
PROFESSOR: Plus 1.

00:48:38.204 --> 00:48:39.120
AUDIENCE: So what if--

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.328
PROFESSOR: I keep going down.

00:48:40.328 --> 00:48:46.360
AUDIENCE: What if the left
side was 3, 4, 6, 9243?

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.370
PROFESSOR: 9,000, what?

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:48.470
AUDIENCE: Just a big number.

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:49.136
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:48:49.136 --> 00:48:52.714
Then you have to
increment by 1 each time--

00:48:52.714 --> 00:48:54.130
PROFESSOR: So I'm
not incrementing

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:56.080
the number I'm looking at.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.710
Here, I looked at 6.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:59.610
Then I'm looking for 8.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:03.180
And after I found 8,
I'm looking for 19,000.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:06.800
So I'm going to go down,
either until I find 90,000

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.710
or until I stop.

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:10.382
AUDIENCE: So are you going
to go down one at a time,

00:49:10.382 --> 00:49:11.007
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:49:11.007 --> 00:49:13.840
AUDIENCE: --why not
do a binary search?

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.560
PROFESSOR: Because if
I do a binary search,

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:20.550
the analysis that says it's
fast is not going to work.

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.550
It turns out that this gives
me the optimal running time.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:28.830
If I do a binary search, suppose
I have a list that's like this.

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:33.509
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, all the
way down to 10,000.

00:49:33.509 --> 00:49:36.750
Ugh, I can't write.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.920
And I have another list
that's like this- 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.800
all the way down to 10,000.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.720
1, 1.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:49.830
I do a binary search,
takes log N. I look at 2.

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:53.230
I do a binary search, takes
almost log N. I look at 3,

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:56.352
do a binary search, takes
almost log N. So on, so forth.

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:00.705
So this is--

00:50:00.705 --> 00:50:03.214
AUDIENCE: But if your
left list had been

00:50:03.214 --> 00:50:04.380
PROFESSOR: Log N plus log N.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.034
AUDIENCE: --10,000.

00:50:06.034 --> 00:50:06.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.770
AUDIENCE: You'd
have taken N time.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:10.630
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:13.030
Well, this algorithm
takes N time,

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.800
even if I have to
list like this.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.490
It takes 10,000
plus 10,000 time.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:21.700
Whereas this algorithm will
take time that's actually

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:29.910
proportional to
10,000 log 10,000.

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:30.740
You believe me.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.480
So, a way to look at this
is to do bounds and say,

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.140
for the elements
1 through 5,000,

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:41.470
it's going to do a binary search
for more than 5,000 elements.

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:44.170
So, the time-- the running
time is definitely bigger

00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:48.366
than N over 2 log N over 2.

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.630
Constant.

00:50:52.630 --> 00:51:00.710
This becomes log N
minus 1 and log N.

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:01.900
That is a good question.

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.340
I wondered about that the first
time I saw merge-sort too.

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.810
And I was thinking,
hey, I'm going

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:07.768
to do a binary search
here because it's faster,

00:51:07.768 --> 00:51:10.510
and I'm going to make a faster
algorithm than anyone has ever

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:11.390
seen.

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:13.320
Well, if you do the
analysis, not so much.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.660
But you need to think
about it, and you

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.660
need to know why that's
true or that's not true.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:17.670
So I like your question.

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:20.140
Thank you.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.520
So now let's get down so
the plain old merge-sort

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.860
that everyone-- sorry,
merge that everyone knows.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:30.610
So if we go through
these one by one,

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:33.880
how many times am I going to
be advancing this pointer?

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.498
In total?

00:51:35.498 --> 00:51:36.920
AUDIENCE: L2?

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.160
PROFESSOR: L2 times.

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:42.540
So this pointer can
only go down, right?

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.660
So worst case is going
to go down L2 times.

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.550
And then I'm done
with the list, return.

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:50.580
How many elements am I
going to look through?

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:53.301
So how many times does this
pointer going to advance?

00:51:53.301 --> 00:51:53.842
AUDIENCE: L1?

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.080
PROFESSOR: This one.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.550
AUDIENCE: But I thought, like--

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:03.490
AUDIENCE: Then you get
extra ones in between.

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:05.560
PROFESSOR: What if
L2 is bigger than L1?

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.780
What if--

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.660
AUDIENCE: Oh, right.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.540
OK, never mind.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.499
The reason I said
L2 was because--

00:52:10.499 --> 00:52:13.040
PROFESSOR: You're thinking after
I'm going through this list,

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:13.700
I'm out, right?

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.325
AUDIENCE: Right,
that's what I thought.

00:52:15.325 --> 00:52:17.640
PROFESSOR: So, your answer
works if this list, say, has

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.620
10 elements and this has 10,000.

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.230
And I go through this
one really quickly.

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:25.697
But if this list has 10 elements
and this list has 10,000,

00:52:25.697 --> 00:52:27.280
and they both start
with 1 through 10,

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:31.660
I have to say a 1 because
that's a better bound.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.596
So I have to say this.

00:52:33.596 --> 00:52:35.345
AUDIENCE: Could you
say the opposite value

00:52:35.345 --> 00:52:37.450
of the difference
between the two of them?

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:39.486
Because if you're going
to stop at 1 has 10

00:52:39.486 --> 00:52:43.120
and the other one has
10,000, and let's say

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.579
that only the first
ten are actually equal,

00:52:46.579 --> 00:52:48.870
then you're going to go
through that list, find all 10,

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:50.110
and you stop.

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:51.059
That would be 9,000--

00:52:51.059 --> 00:52:53.350
PROFESSOR: I could say about
that if I'm looking at one

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:56.160
case, but the magic trick
is-- let's-- we're looking

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.680
at the worst case.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.844
So worst case, if
I have 10 elements,

00:52:59.844 --> 00:53:01.760
they'll be all the way
down in the other list.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.010
Or they won't be there at all.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:04.970
And I have to go down
through all the list.

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:07.670
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:09.640
PROFESSOR: So worst
case, L1 plus L2.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.760
Let me see if I
have any time left.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.720
Nope.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:25.050
So, what I would like you to do
is go through insertion sort.

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:27.700
Insertion sort
matches the textbook.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.540
Look at the definition in the
textbook, look at the code,

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.009
convince yourself it's the same.

00:53:32.009 --> 00:53:33.800
Look at the running
time, convince yourself

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.280
it's N squared.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.880
Then look at inner product
and convince yourself

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.360
that this is what it does.

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.820
Go through this line by
line, see where they match,

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.100
put the cost on.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:49.040
Make sure that the
cost is L1 plus L2.

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.810
And last, go through
merge-sort and notice

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:56.660
that merge in [INAUDIBLE]
6 is exactly the same

00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:57.880
as inner product.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.020
So this pointer
magic that I did here

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:02.440
is exactly what's
happening inside merge.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.570
And understand merge-sort.

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.630
Look at the textbook,
look at the notes,

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:08.270
and see how they match.

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.870
OK.

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:10.720
Thanks, guys.
