00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.830
PROFESSOR: If you guys
want me to cover anything

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.300
in particular, is
there anything you

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.508
didn't understand in lecture?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.640
In the last section, I
covered the recursion trees

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.170
because they will
be on the Pset,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.940
and people said they
were a bit unclear,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.312
so we can do that and cover less
of the stuff that I have here.

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:44.770
Or if there's anything else,
you can tell me what you want.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.040
So there I cover recursion
trees because someone said, hey,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.000
can you go over that again?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.310
Is there any pain points?

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.120
No?

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.936
OK.

00:00:57.936 --> 00:00:59.810
So then I'm going to
give you the same choice

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.310
that I gave to people
last time, and that

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.320
is we can go over
recursion trees again,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.630
but if I do that, then I
won't have time to go over

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.129
the code for deleting a node
from a binary search tree.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:12.920
So we'll go through
the theory and you guys

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.070
will have to go through
the code on your own.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.460
But instead, we'll go
over recursion trees again

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.770
and remember how you
solve a recurrence using

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.450
recursion trees.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.120
The alternative is
we don't do that

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.982
and we complete
the deletions part.

00:01:29.982 --> 00:01:31.690
AUDIENCE: I feel like
covering deletions,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.358
since we didn't do that in
lecture, that would probably

00:01:34.358 --> 00:01:36.032
be more helpful.

00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:37.240
PROFESSOR: Let's take a vote.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.730
Who wants to do deletions
in painstaking detail?

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.410
So deletions and not recursion?

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.452
Who wants to do recursion
trees and not deletion?

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:50.580
AUDIENCE: It's about equal.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.205
PROFESSOR: It's equal
and nobody cares.

00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:52.870
I'm really sad.

00:01:58.376 --> 00:02:00.230
AUDIENCE: Let's do
both in half detail.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.310
PROFESSOR: OK, sure.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.080
Who remembers merge sort?

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.490
What does merge sort
do really quick?

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.050
AUDIENCE: It takes some
sort of unsorted array,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.310
splits it in half, and
then continually splits it,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.480
and then once it finally
gets to the point

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.540
where you have arrays of two
elements, then it sorts them,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.088
and then sorts those,
and then sorts those.

00:02:23.088 --> 00:02:24.669
It's a fun thing.

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:25.960
And then it merges [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.680
PROFESSOR: That's so much code.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.360
I don't like to write much code
because for every line of code

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.151
that you write, you
might have a bug in it,

00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:34.530
so I like to write less code.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.950
So the way I do it is when I
get to an array size of one

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.550
element, I know
it's already sorted.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.640
So merge sort.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.380
You have an array,
it's unsorted.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.030
Split it into two halves,
call merge sort on each half,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.780
assume that magically, they're
going to come back sorted,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.300
and then you merge
the sorted halves.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.810
How much time does merging take?

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.460
OK.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.042
So the recursion for the
running time of merge sort?

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:04.536
AUDIENCE: Why does
it take n time?

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:05.161
Just too large?

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:06.869
AUDIENCE: Isn't it
the finger thing where

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.018
you take each element,
and you're like, this one,

00:03:09.018 --> 00:03:12.260
is that greater or less than,
then you put it in the array.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.760
So you get--

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.694
PROFESSOR: Please take my
word for it that it's order n.

00:03:16.694 --> 00:03:18.860
AUDIENCE: I'll explain it
and then I'll be confused.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.985
PROFESSOR: OK, so order n.

00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:24.075
What's the recursion?

00:03:28.422 --> 00:03:30.130
Don't give me the
solution because then I

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.530
can't do the trees anymore,
so give me the recursion

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.675
before it's solved.

00:03:33.675 --> 00:03:37.160
Give me the recurrence formula.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.566
So it starts with T of N, right?

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:43.117
AUDIENCE: It starts with
N over 2 plus N, I think.

00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:47.635
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.690
So you take the array,
you split it into two,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.150
you call merge sort on the
two halves of the arrays.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.670
So you call merge sort twice.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.140
That's why you have a 2 here.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.800
The 2 matters.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.970
Without it, you get
a different answer.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.040
And when you call it,
the arrays that you

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.910
give it are half the
size, and then merge

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.760
takes order and time.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.750
Splitting depends on what you're
using to store your arrays.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.860
Can be constant time or it
can be order N. So the time

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.810
won't change because of split.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.845
How do we solve this recurrence?

00:04:24.162 --> 00:04:25.870
The recursion tree
method says that we're

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.680
going to draw a call graph.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.200
So we start out
with a call to merge

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.910
sort with an array
of size N. Then

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.610
it's going to call
merge sort again,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.000
but after the array is split.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.730
So it's going to call merge
sort twice, size is N over 2.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.680
This guy gets an array of
N over 2, calls merge sort.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.760
Two arrays, sizes
N over 4, N over 4.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.630
This does the same.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.420
So this goes on forever and ever
and ever until at some point

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.240
we reach our base case.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.940
So we're going to
have a bunch of calls

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.460
here where the array size is?

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.521
What's our base case?

00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:11.020
1.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.519
Excellent.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.240
So this is the call graph
for merge sort, and let's

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.930
put the base case here so we
know what we're talking about.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.370
T of 1 is theta 1.

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:27.250
Now inside the
nodes, we're going

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.150
to put the cost for each
call without counting

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.770
the sub-call, so
the children here.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.370
That's this guy here,
except instead of order N,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.160
I will write CN.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.870
Remember how sometimes
we use CN instead

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.500
of the order of notation?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.150
The reason we do that is if I
put in the asymptotic notation,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.930
then we're going to be
tempted to sum them up.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.950
You're allowed to sum terms
using asymptotic notation as

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.200
long as there's a
finite number of them,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.420
but here, it turns out there's
an infinite number of them.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.150
Also, if you go this way,
you can never go wrong.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.030
You always get the
right answer, so that's

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.620
why we switch from
order N to CN.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.980
In order to merge sort
an array of size N,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.100
we're going to merge sort
two arrays of size N over 2

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.690
and then spend CN time
on doing the merge.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.355
What are the costs here?

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.140
To sort an array
of N over 2, what's

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.670
the cost outside
the cost to merge?

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.510
AUDIENCE: C of N over 2.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.860
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.000
C times N over 2.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.410
C times N over 2.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.046
How about here?

00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:42.978
AUDIENCE: C times N over 4.

00:06:42.978 --> 00:06:45.876
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:06:45.876 --> 00:06:48.850
CN over 4.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.610
My nodes are really ugly.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.860
I should have drawn them
like this from the beginning.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.270
CN over 4.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.250
There you go.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.620
How about down here?

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.142
AUDIENCE: C of N
over 2 to the i.

00:07:01.142 --> 00:07:03.490
PROFESSOR: You're
going on step ahead.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.610
We'll do that right next.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.540
AUDIENCE: C of N
over log N, right?

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.220
Because they're
log N levels, so--

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.140
PROFESSOR: Let's not worry
about the number of levels.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.980
You're ruining my steps.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.455
I was going to get to
that two steps after this.

00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:19.564
AUDIENCE: Is it just C?

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.320
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.840
So array size is 1, right?

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.140
So the cost is C. C, C,
C, C. OK, you guys got it

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.179
if you're thinking
of levels already.

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:31.720
The next thing I
want to do is I want

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.740
to figure out how many
levels I have in this tree.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.600
Why do I care about that?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.900
The answer for T of N is the
sum of all these costs in here

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.550
because the cost of merge
sorting an array of size N

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:49.940
is the merge sort plus the costs
for sorting the two arrays.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.890
And the nodes here keep
track of all the time spent

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.840
in recursive sub-calls, so if
we can add up everything up,

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.880
we have the answer to T of
N. It turns out the easiest

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.050
way to do that is to sum
up the cost at each level

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.875
because the costs are
this guy copied over here.

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:13.800
For a level, they
tend to be the same,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.360
so it's reasonably
easy to add them up,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.430
except in order to be
able to add those up,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.980
you have to know how
many levels you have.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.920
So how do I know how
many levels I have?

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.470
Someone already told me log
N. How do I get to that log N?

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.440
So when I get to the
bottommost level,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.460
the number has to be 1, the
number next to the node,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.080
because that's my base case.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.490
When I have a one element
array, it's sorted, I'm done.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.650
I return.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.130
So I can say that
for each level,

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:58.150
the number next to the node is
something as a function of L.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.750
Here, I'm going to
say that this is

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:06.850
N over 1, which is N
over 2 to the 0 power.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:11.480
And this is N over 2, so it's
N over 2 to the first power.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.280
This is N over 2 to the
second, and so on and so forth.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.476
It might not be obvious if
you only have two levels.

00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:20.100
I don't want to draw
a lot on the board

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.180
because I don't have a lot
of space and I'd get my nodes

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.420
all messed into each other.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.690
If it takes more than two levels
to see the pattern, go for it.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.440
Expand for three levels,
four levels, five levels,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.070
whatever it takes to get it
right on a Pset or on a test.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.430
So you see the pattern,
then you write the formula

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:42.140
for the node size at the level.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.770
And assuming this
pattern holds, we

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:50.270
see that the size of a
node at level l, the size

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:56.880
is 2 N over 2 to the l minus 1.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.330
Fair enough?

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.770
You can say N over 2
to the l, and forget

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.730
that there's a minus 1, and then
the asymptotics will save you,

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:09.680
so it's no big deal, but
this is the real number.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:16.310
So that means that at the
bottommost level, at level l,

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.900
this size is going to be 1.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:24.110
N over 2 to the l
minus 1 equals 1.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.620
So now this is an equation,
so I can solve for l.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:31.630
I pull this on the right side,
N equals 2 to the l minus 1,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:37.771
so l minus 1 equals-- anyone?

00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:39.020
The inverse of an exponential?

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.220
AUDIENCE: I wasn't
paying attention.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.390
Sorry.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:50.837
AUDIENCE: Log N.

00:10:50.837 --> 00:10:53.170
PROFESSOR: The inverse of an
exponential is a logarithm.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:58.470
Keep that in mind for
solving 6.006 problems.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:06.289
l minus 1 is log N so l is
log n plus 1, roughly log n.

00:11:06.289 --> 00:11:08.330
I could use log n plus 1
and go through the math.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.580
It's a bit more painful
and, because we're

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.940
using asymptotics, it
doesn't really matter.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.610
So now we know how
many levels we have.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.050
Let's see what's the
cost at the level.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.740
So all the calls
at a certain level,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.640
what's the sum of the costs?

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.400
For this level, what's the cost?

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.100
CN.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.310
And That was the easy question.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.635
Just the root, right?

00:11:33.635 --> 00:11:34.510
How about this level?

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.180
Because I have two nodes, the
cost in each node is CN over 2.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.060
How about this level?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.110
Four levels, each
level CN over 4.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.340
How about the bottom level?

00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:01.680
AUDIENCE: CN.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.486
PROFESSOR: Why is it CN?

00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:08.440
AUDIENCE: Because there
are N arrays of size 1.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.710
PROFESSOR: N arrays of size 1.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.530
Excellent.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.510
A cute argument I heard once
is you start out with N,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.910
you split it into N
over 2 and N over 2.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.520
Then you split this guy
in N over 4, N over 4,

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.980
so this is like
conservation of mass.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:26.380
If you start with N and here,
you don't end up with N total,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.210
then you lost some element
somewhere on the way.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.100
So CN.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.310
CN, CN, CN, CN.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.530
I think I see a pattern.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.540
I think it's reasonable to say
that for every level, it's CN.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.950
And if you write the
proof, you can prove that

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.300
by using math instead
of waving hands.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.420
So CN times the number
of levels, right?

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:56.040
The answer for this guy
is C of N is CN times l.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.586
What's l?

00:12:57.586 --> 00:12:59.289
AUDIENCE: N log N.

00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:00.080
PROFESSOR: Roughly.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:10.240
OK So order of N
log N. C becomes

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.630
order of, l is order of
log N, N stays the same.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.970
Any questions?

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.837
Are people getting it or
did I confuse you even more?

00:13:27.837 --> 00:13:28.670
AUDIENCE: We got it.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:29.897
PROFESSOR: OK, sweet.

00:13:29.897 --> 00:13:31.230
Thank you for the encouragement.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:36.200
So this gets you through
problem one of Pset 2.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.400
So in this case, the
tree is nicely balanced.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.284
The cost at each
level is the same.

00:13:40.284 --> 00:13:42.700
When [INAUDIBLE] talked about
recursion trees in lectures,

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.230
he showed two more
trees, one where

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.350
pretty much all the cost was up
here-- the cost of the children

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:54.000
was negligible-- and one
tree where all the cost was

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.240
concentrated here, so the
cost of all the inner nodes

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.160
was negligible and the leaves
were doing all the real work.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.804
So don't be scared if your
costs aren't the same.

00:14:03.804 --> 00:14:05.970
Just sum them up and you'll
get to the right answer.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.770
Now I'm going to talk
about binary search trees,

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:18.920
except I will make a five
minute general talk about data

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.700
structures before I do that.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.310
So we use the term
"data structures."

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.296
I think we covered
it well, and I

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:25.670
want to give you
a couple of tips

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.280
for dealing with them on Pset 1.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.390
A data structure is
a bunch of algorithms

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:35.380
that help you store and
then retrieve information.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.960
You have two types
of algorithms.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:44.795
You have queries,
and you have updates.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.920
You start out with an
empty data structure,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.870
like an empty binary search
tree or an empty list,

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.370
and then you throw
some data at it.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.840
That's when you update it.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.129
Then you ask it some questions,
and that's when you query it.

00:15:03.129 --> 00:15:05.670
Then maybe you throw more data
at it, so you do more updates,

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.794
and you ask more questions,
so you do more queries.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.460
What are the queries
and the updates

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.200
for the binary search trees
that we talked about in lecture?

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.140
AUDIENCE: A query
would be like, what's

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.977
your right child,
what's your left child?

00:15:23.977 --> 00:15:25.310
PROFESSOR: So that's for a node.

00:15:28.502 --> 00:15:29.960
AUDIENCE: What are
you looking for?

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.460
PROFESSOR: I'm
looking for something

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.812
for the entire infrastructure.

00:15:32.812 --> 00:15:34.520
So for the entire
tree, what's a question

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.090
that you would ask the tree?

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.147
PROFESSOR: Max.

00:15:37.147 --> 00:15:37.730
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:47.250
Min.

00:15:50.914 --> 00:15:51.830
AUDIENCE: Next larger.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:52.460
PROFESSOR: Next larger.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.940
Are you looking at the nodes?

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.860
AUDIENCE: Is there an are
you balanced question?

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.665
PROFESSOR: Well, I would say
that the most popular operation

00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:08.980
in a binary search
tree is Search, which

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.560
looks for-- we call
it Find in the code

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.640
because most code
implementations call it Find

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.359
nowadays, but
binary search tree.

00:16:18.359 --> 00:16:19.650
What are you going to do in it?

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.870
You search for a value.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.920
That's why it has the
Search in binary search.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.580
So queries are operations where
you ask questions to the data

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.540
structure and it doesn't change.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.400
How about updates?

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.940
What did we learn for updates?

00:16:36.712 --> 00:16:37.640
AUDIENCE: Insert.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.740
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.630
So Insert was
covered in lecture,

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.400
and we're doing Delete today.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:53.030
So data structures
have this property

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.460
that's called the
representation invariant, RI,

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.930
or Rep Invariant.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:09.835
Actually, before I get
there, the rep invariant

00:17:09.835 --> 00:17:12.640
says that the data in
the data structures

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.829
is organized in this
way, and as long

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.349
as it's organized in this way,
the data structure functions

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.490
correctly.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.810
Can someone guess
for a sorted array

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.829
what's the
representation invariant?

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.294
AUDIENCE: It can mean sorted.

00:17:27.294 --> 00:17:27.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.350
A sorted array should be sorted.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.690
Sounds like a very
good rep invariant.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.530
So the elements should
be stored an array.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.340
Every element should be smaller
than any element after it.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.370
And as long as the rep
invariant holds, so as long

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.770
as elements are stored in
the right way in the data

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.890
structure, the queries will
return the right results.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.360
If the rep invariant
doesn't hold,

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.364
then God knows what's
going to happen.

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:54.780
What can you do
in a storage array

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.800
as long as the rep
invariant holds?

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:01.927
Sorted array.

00:18:01.927 --> 00:18:04.010
What's the reason why I
would have a sorted array?

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.390
What can I do that's
fast in a sorted array?

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.660
AUDIENCE: Min and Max.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.140
PROFESSOR: I can
do that very fast.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.790
That's good.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.414
What's the running time?

00:18:12.414 --> 00:18:13.290
AUDIENCE: A constant.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.219
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:16.510
Min you look at the beginning,
Max you look at the end.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.140
Yes?

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.210
AUDIENCE: Binary search.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.251
PROFESSOR: Binary search.

00:18:19.251 --> 00:18:21.130
That's the other
reason for that.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.090
So binary search
runs in order log

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.690
N time, doesn't have to
look at most of the array,

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.690
tells you whether an
element is there are not.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.100
Now, what if the
array is unsorted?

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.840
Will the algorithm work?

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.270
It might say
something isn't there

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.353
when it actually is there.

00:18:36.353 --> 00:18:38.790
You can do binary search
on a non-sorted array.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.440
So if the rep
invariant doesn't hold,

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.390
your queries might give
you a wrong answer.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.460
How about updates?

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.370
How do you search
something in a sorted list?

00:18:53.223 --> 00:18:54.764
AUDIENCE: You find
where it should go

00:18:54.764 --> 00:18:55.885
and you move everything.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:56.510
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.110
So you have to move
everything, make room for it,

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.030
and put it there so
that the array is still

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.900
sorted at the end.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.570
You can't just append
things at the end,

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:10.610
even though that would be
faster and lazier and less code.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.467
When you do an update
to a data structure,

00:19:12.467 --> 00:19:14.550
you have to make sure that
the rep invariant still

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.300
holds at the end.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.800
Sort of a correctness proof
for an update algorithm

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.580
says that if the rep invariant
holds at the beginning,

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.900
the rep invariant is
guaranteed to hold at the end.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.640
Why do we care about
this rep invariant stuff?

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.700
Suppose you have a problem,
say on the next Pset, that

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.890
asks you to find the place
that's slow in your code

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.490
and then speed it up.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.336
And suppose you recognize
the data structure there,

00:19:42.336 --> 00:19:43.960
and you say that's
inefficient, and you

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.430
want to implement another
data structure that

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.620
would be more efficient.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.000
You're going to implement it.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.390
You might have
bugs in an update.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.460
How do you find the bugs?

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.570
Queries give you
the wrong answers.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.510
You might do queries a long
time after you do updates,

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.624
and you're not going to
know which update failed.

00:20:04.624 --> 00:20:06.790
The right way to do this
is you implement the method

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.250
called Check RI-- that's
what I call it-- so

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.170
check the representation
invariant.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.630
And that method walks through
the entire data structure

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.960
and make sure that the
rep invariant holds,

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.089
and if it doesn't, it
raises an exception

00:20:19.089 --> 00:20:21.380
because you know that whatever
you try to do from there

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.580
is not going to work, so
there's no reason to keep going.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.110
So at the end of every
update, you add a call

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.050
to this Check RI
method until you're

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.480
sure that your code is correct.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.390
And after you're done
debugging your code,

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.180
you remove this method
and you submit the code.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.310
Why do I want to
remove the method?

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.290
It might be painfully slow
and inefficient, much slower

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.530
than the actual
queries and updates.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.010
For example, let's take a heap.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.610
Do people remember
heaps from lecture?

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.870
What's the query for a heap?

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:55.930
Say you have a max heap.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.567
What's a query?

00:20:58.567 --> 00:20:59.650
AUDIENCE: Where's the max?

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:00.800
PROFESSOR: OK, cool.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.570
So for a max heap, a
query would be max.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:04.200
Running time?

00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:08.457
AUDIENCE: Constant.

00:21:08.457 --> 00:21:09.248
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:21:09.248 --> 00:21:10.360
Constant.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.880
What do you do?

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.122
Look at the top?

00:21:15.122 --> 00:21:16.307
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:16.307 --> 00:21:16.890
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:17.640
Sweet.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:23.430
So what are the two popular
updates in a max heap?

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.600
AUDIENCE: There would
be Insert as well.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.480
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.770
Insert.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.306
And did we teach
you general delete?

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:44.817
Usually Extract Max is simpler.

00:21:44.817 --> 00:21:45.650
That's all you need.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.270
What's the running
time for Insert?

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.390
Do people remember heaps?

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.190
AUDIENCE: I think it was per
N, but I'm not completely sure.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.560
PROFESSOR: Anyone else?

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.250
It's not.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.135
Life would be bad
if it would be N.

00:22:08.135 --> 00:22:09.217
AUDIENCE: N squared?

00:22:09.217 --> 00:22:09.800
PROFESSOR: No.

00:22:13.835 --> 00:22:16.210
It's better than N, so you
guys are doing a binary search

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.660
over the few running times
that I gave you earlier.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.118
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
add to the N,

00:22:20.118 --> 00:22:22.498
and then you compare your
neighbor, and then you

00:22:22.498 --> 00:22:24.245
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:24.245 --> 00:22:26.780
AUDIENCE: If it's an
array, there isn't--

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.272
PROFESSOR: So conceptually,
a heap looks like this.

00:22:29.272 --> 00:22:30.980
And yeah, it becomes
an array eventually,

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.750
but let's look at it this way.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.950
It is a full binary tree.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.290
Binary tree means that each
node has at most two children,

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.160
and full means that every
level except for the last level

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.420
is completely populated.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.770
So every internal node
has exactly two children,

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:53.050
and in here, every node
except for some nodes

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.700
and then some nodes
after it will not have.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.090
Everything to the left
is fully populated,

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.870
and then at some point,
you stop having children.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.150
It turns out that this is
easy to store in an array,

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.660
but I will not go over that.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.660
Instead, I want to
go over inserting.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.980
What's the rep
invariant for a heap?

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.960
AUDIENCE: The max
in the top, right?

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.572
Well, for max heap, and
then the two children

00:23:18.572 --> 00:23:20.456
are less than the next node.

00:23:20.456 --> 00:23:21.330
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.515
So the guy here has to be
bigger than these guys,

00:23:23.515 --> 00:23:25.640
then the guy here has to
be bigger than these guys,

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.980
and so on and so forth.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.990
And if you use
induction, you can

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.212
prove that if this
is bigger than this,

00:23:32.212 --> 00:23:34.170
it has to be bigger than
these guys, and bigger

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.970
than these guys, and bigger
than everything, and it's a max.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.060
That's the reason why we
have that rep invariant.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.480
So the way we insert
a node is we add it

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.280
at the bottom, the only
place where we could add it.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.190
And then if this guy is
bigger than this guy,

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.110
the rep invariant is
violated, so we swap them

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.270
in order to fix that.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.270
Now the guy is here.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.890
If this is bigger than
this, we do another swap.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.400
If this is bigger than
this, we do another swap.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.990
So you're going to go from the
bottom of the heap potentially

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.210
all the way up to the root.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.820
So the running time
of insert is order

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.700
of the height of the heap.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.810
Now, the heap is a
full binary tree.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.445
I said "full."

00:24:17.445 --> 00:24:18.320
I keep saying "full."

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.765
The reason I care about full
is that the full binary tree

00:24:20.765 --> 00:24:24.767
is guaranteed to have a
height of log N. It's always

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:26.350
log N, where N is
the number of nodes.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:35.303
So inserting in a
heap takes log N.

00:24:35.303 --> 00:24:36.469
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:24:36.469 --> 00:24:39.415
Didn't they say that
because it's in an array,

00:24:39.415 --> 00:24:44.230
then to find it-- oh no, I
guess because you can still

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.949
do the swaps.

00:24:44.949 --> 00:24:46.490
PROFESSOR: You can
still do the swaps

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.720
when you have it
serialized in an array.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.450
You know that given
an item's index,

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.894
the parent is that
index divided by 2.

00:24:53.894 --> 00:24:55.810
So you add an element
at the end of the array,

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.100
and then you know
what the parent is,

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.988
and then you keep swapping
and swapping and swapping

00:24:58.988 --> 00:24:59.944
towards the [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:59.944 --> 00:25:01.300
AUDIENCE: You don't
ever have to put it in

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.072
and shift everything over.

00:25:02.072 --> 00:25:02.420
You're only swapping.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.045
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:25:03.045 --> 00:25:04.200
You only swap.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.131
That's important.

00:25:06.131 --> 00:25:06.880
Thanks for asking.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.650
That's important.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.850
So log N. Extract max,
take my word for it,

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:16.380
also log N. What's the
running time for checking

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.760
the invariant in a heap?

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.590
So to make sure that this guy is
a heap, if I had numbers here,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.000
what would you have to do?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.295
AUDIENCE: You'd have
to look at every node.

00:25:31.295 --> 00:25:31.920
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.304
So running time?

00:25:34.304 --> 00:25:36.547
AUDIENCE: Theta of N.

00:25:36.547 --> 00:25:37.172
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.430
So if I'm going to
submit code for a heap

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.410
where the operations
are our order of log N,

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.730
or order 1, but then each
of these calls Check RI,

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.640
that's going to be
painfully slow because I'm

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.650
making the updates be
order N instead of log N.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.160
So you're putting Check
RI calls in every update.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.607
You debug your code.

00:26:00.607 --> 00:26:02.690
When you make sure it's
correct, you remove those,

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.810
and then you submit the Pset.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.530
Make sense?

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:09.760
Sweet.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.070
And we looked a little bit
at heaps, which is good.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.320
Binary search trees.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.000
So a binary tree is a
tree where every node

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.830
has at most two children.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:28.460
When we code this up, we
represent a node as a Python

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:34.810
object, and for a node, we
keep track of the left child,

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:41.880
of the right child, parent,
and then this is a hollow tree.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.100
It's not very useful.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.370
This becomes useful when you
start putting keys in the nodes

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.690
so that you can find them and
do other things with them.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:50.830
So each node has a key.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.390
Let me draw a
binary search tree.

00:27:11.275 --> 00:27:14.360
Can people see this?

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.750
So this is a binary tree.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.360
Can someone say something a
bit more specific about it?

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.400
AUDIENCE: It's unbalanced.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:24.690
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:25.356
It's imbalanced.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.260
So that means that
finding things all the way

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.051
at the bottom is
going to be expensive.

00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:34.550
What else?

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.140
So I said it's a binary tree.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.900
Give me something more specific.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:50.060
So binary tree just means that
every node has two children.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.470
There's a bit more
structure in this guy.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.840
So if I look at the
root, if I look at 23,

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.740
all the nodes to the
left are smaller.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.635
All the nodes to the
right are bigger.

00:28:01.635 --> 00:28:04.320
Now, if I look at 8, all the
nodes to the left are smaller,

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.360
all the nodes to the
right are greater.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:15.750
This additional rep invariant
defines a binary search tree.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.820
This is what we
talked about in class.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.320
BST.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.945
Why would I want to
have this rep invariant?

00:28:24.945 --> 00:28:27.540
It sounds like a pain
to maintain nodes

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.810
with all these
ordering constraints.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.710
What's the advantage
of doing that?

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:33.996
AUDIENCE: Search is fast.

00:28:33.996 --> 00:28:34.620
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.310
Search is fast.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.960
How do I do search?

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.220
If you're looking
for 42 or for 16,

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.440
you'd be like, oh,
it's less than 23.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.640
I'll get on this path.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.880
PROFESSOR: So start at the root,
compare my key to the root.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.089
If it's smaller, go left.

00:28:50.089 --> 00:28:51.130
If it's bigger, go right.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.600
Then keep doing that
until I arrive somewhere

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.590
or until I arrive at a dead
end if I'm looking for 14.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.860
This is a lot like
binary search.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.330
Binary search in an array,
you look at the middle.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.759
If your key is smaller, go left.

00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:05.300
If your key is
bigger, then go right.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.290
Let's look at the
code for a little bit.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.490
Look at the BST Node
Class, and you'll

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.020
see that it has the fields
that we have up here.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.370
And look at the Find method,
and this is pretty much

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.020
the binary search code.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.920
Lines 8 and 9 have the return
condition when you're happy

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.187
and you found the key,
and then line 10 compares

00:29:31.187 --> 00:29:33.520
the key that you're looking
for with the key in the node

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:38.010
that you're at, and then lines
11, 14, 16, and 19 are pretty

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.776
much copy pasted,
except one of them

00:29:39.776 --> 00:29:41.400
deals with the left
case, the other one

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.910
deals with the right case.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.955
What is the running
time for Find?

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.780
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
it be log N, right?

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.440
PROFESSOR: I wish.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.060
If this is all you have
to do to get log N,

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.360
then I would have to
write a lot less code.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.540
So not quite log N. We will
have to go through next lecture

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:20.020
to get to log N. Until then,
what's the running time?

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.900
AUDIENCE: Order h.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.525
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.030
So you told me at the
beginning it's unbalanced.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.135
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:27.135 --> 00:30:29.010
PROFESSOR: So then it's
not going to be fast.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.440
OK, so order h.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.090
The reason why we care
about h, and the reason

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.980
we don't say order
N, is because next

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.415
lecture after we learn
how to balance a tree,

00:30:42.415 --> 00:30:45.040
there's some magic that you can
do to these binary search trees

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.721
to guarantee that the
height is order of log N.

00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:50.220
And then we'll go through all
the running times that we have

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.676
and replace h with log N.

00:30:52.676 --> 00:30:55.050
Now, it happens that in this
case, if you would have told

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:59.260
me order N, I couldn't argue
with you because worst case,

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.790
searches are order N. Can
someone give me a binary search

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:07.071
tree that exposes
this degenerate case?

00:31:07.071 --> 00:31:07.570
Yes?

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.195
AUDIENCE: If it's
completely unbalanced

00:31:09.195 --> 00:31:13.150
and every node is greater
than the parent nodes.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:17.435
PROFESSOR: So give me some
inserts that create it.

00:31:17.435 --> 00:31:18.820
AUDIENCE: Insert 5.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.622
PROFESSOR: 5.

00:31:20.622 --> 00:31:22.390
AUDIENCE: Insert 10.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.222
PROFESSOR: 10.

00:31:23.222 --> 00:31:24.520
AUDIENCE: Insert 15.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.638
PROFESSOR: 15.

00:31:25.638 --> 00:31:27.042
AUDIENCE: Insert 20.

00:31:27.042 --> 00:31:27.980
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.940
And I could keep going.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.540
I could say, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.740
I could say 5, 10, 15.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.000
As long as these keep
growing, this is basically

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.290
going to be a list,
so searching is

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:41.517
order N. This is
a degenerate case.

00:31:41.517 --> 00:31:43.600
Turns out it doesn't happen
too often in practice.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.340
If you have random data, the
height will be roughly log N.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.530
But in order to avoid
those degenerate cases,

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:54.180
we'll be doing balanced
trees later on.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.680
So we covered Find.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.854
We know it's order h.

00:31:56.854 --> 00:31:58.270
How do you insert,
really quickly?

00:32:09.104 --> 00:32:10.520
AUDIENCE: Do you
mean in searching

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.000
when it's balanced
or unbalanced?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.520
PROFESSOR: This guy.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.310
So the trees look
exactly the same.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:18.420
If it's balanced, it's
going to look more

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.380
like that than like this.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.200
Actually, this is balanced.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.550
This is perfectly unbalanced.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.125
This is somewhere in the middle.

00:32:25.125 --> 00:32:27.500
If it's balanced, it's just
going to look more like this,

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.180
but it's still a
binary search tree.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.481
How would you insert a node?

00:32:33.481 --> 00:32:33.980
Yes?

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.944
AUDIENCE: Can't you
start at the root

00:32:35.944 --> 00:32:38.399
and find your way down, and
then the first open child

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:43.686
that you see that's applicable
to your element, state it then?

00:32:43.686 --> 00:32:44.310
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:49.406
So if I wanted to insert
14, which way do I go?

00:32:49.406 --> 00:32:51.280
AUDIENCE: So you'd look
at 23, and you'd say,

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.215
it's less than 23, go left.

00:32:53.215 --> 00:32:54.670
You'd look at 8.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.610
You'd say, it's greater than 8.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:57.565
You'd go right.

00:32:57.565 --> 00:32:58.065
Look at 16.

00:32:58.065 --> 00:33:00.005
You'd say it's less,
so you go left.

00:33:00.005 --> 00:33:00.975
15, it's less.

00:33:00.975 --> 00:33:03.855
Then you have an open spot
so you stick it there.

00:33:03.855 --> 00:33:04.730
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.930
Thank you.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:07.770
Yes?

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:08.936
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:33:08.936 --> 00:33:11.176
What if we want to insert 5?

00:33:11.176 --> 00:33:12.359
Then--

00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:14.025
PROFESSOR: So if you
want to insert who?

00:33:14.025 --> 00:33:14.915
AUDIENCE: 5.

00:33:14.915 --> 00:33:17.590
Or actually no, we can't.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:22.184
I'm thinking, is there any case
in which need to move a node?

00:33:22.184 --> 00:33:23.600
PROFESSOR: How
would you insert 5?

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.100
Let's see.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.552
What would you do for 5?

00:33:25.552 --> 00:33:29.408
AUDIENCE: For 5, then we'd
insert it to the right of 4,

00:33:29.408 --> 00:33:30.860
right?

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.656
PROFESSOR: Smaller,
smaller, greater, 5.

00:33:32.656 --> 00:33:33.155
Right?

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.560
AUDIENCE: So there would
be no case in which we'd

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.360
need to swap nodes or something?

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.084
PROFESSOR: No.

00:33:42.084 --> 00:33:43.000
You're thinking ahead.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.900
We'll talk about that a little
later when we get to deleting.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.720
As long as you follow a path in
the tree, the path that finding

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.720
would get you to, as soon
as you hit a dead end,

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.046
that's where your node belongs.

00:33:56.046 --> 00:33:58.420
Because you know next time
you're going to search for it,

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:02.230
the search is going to follow
that path and find the node.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.800
Yes?

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.924
AUDIENCE: If you have values
are the same, like two

00:34:04.924 --> 00:34:07.620
nodes at the same
number, does it

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.360
matter which side you put it on?

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.991
PROFESSOR: You don't.

00:34:10.991 --> 00:34:11.880
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.670
It's more like you would only
have four 1's in the tree.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:16.440
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.805
So if you're trying to
store keys and values,

00:34:18.805 --> 00:34:20.179
then what you'd
have to do if you

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:21.945
want to allow multiple
values for the same key

00:34:21.945 --> 00:34:23.540
is you have a linked
list going off

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.770
of this, which node
becomes an array of values

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:28.305
aside from the key.

00:34:28.305 --> 00:34:28.929
Smart question.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:29.699
Thank you.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.800
That trips you up every
time you do actual code,

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.889
so that's the right
question to ask yourself

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:36.880
when you're implementing this.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.838
Will I have duplicates?

00:34:37.838 --> 00:34:39.810
How do I handle them?

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:40.489
We don't.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:43.300
We take the easy way out.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.460
So if you look at
Insert, on the next page,

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.440
you will see that the code
is pretty much the Find code

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.869
copy pasted, except
when Self Left is None

00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:55.820
or Self Right is None,
instead of returning,

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.850
it creates a new node.

00:35:02.296 --> 00:35:03.820
Does that make sense to people?

00:35:06.915 --> 00:35:07.415
All right.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.730
So Delete is going to be the
hardest operation for today.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.760
Before we do that, let's
do a warm up operation.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:29.350
Let's say I want to implement
Find Next Larger, also called

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:32.110
Successor in some
implementations.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.930
So I have a node.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:41.130
Say I have node 8, and I
want to find the next key

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.710
in the tree that's
strictly larger than 8

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.190
but smaller than anything else.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:48.770
So if I would take these nodes
and write them down in order,

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:52.400
I want to find the element
that would go right after it.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.026
How do I do that?

00:35:54.026 --> 00:35:54.920
Don't cheat.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:59.588
Don't look at the code, or make
my life easier and do searches.

00:35:59.588 --> 00:36:01.079
AUDIENCE: Go down
one to the right,

00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:03.297
and you try to get down
left as far as you can.

00:36:03.297 --> 00:36:03.880
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.870
Very good.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:11.310
So I have a node, and it
has some subtree here,

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:17.690
so I can go to the right here,
I can go all the way left.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.370
We have an operation
that does this,

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:22.182
and it's called Min for a tree.

00:36:22.182 --> 00:36:24.390
In order to find the minimum
in a binary search tree,

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.870
you keep going left.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.870
For example, in this case,
you get 4, which is good.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:31.970
So the way you would code
this up is if you have Min,

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:33.740
you go to the right
if you can, and then

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.390
you call Min on the subtree.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:41.340
And you can see that lines
3 and 4 do exactly that.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.180
Good guess.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.630
But you can line
1 says case one,

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:50.040
so you have the right
answer for one case.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.760
Now we have to handle
more difficult cases.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:59.490
What if instead, I go
down a bunch of nodes,

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:04.780
and I want to find the successor
for this guy, for example,

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.420
and there's nothing here.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.050
What do I do?

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:17.160
So if I want to find the
successor for 8, what do I do?

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.660
Sorry.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.368
It has an answer.

00:37:18.368 --> 00:37:24.247
What if I want to find
the successor for 4?

00:37:27.229 --> 00:37:28.230
AUDIENCE: Go up one.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.813
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:29.900
Go up one.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.522
Why does that work?

00:37:31.522 --> 00:37:33.370
AUDIENCE: You know it's
going to be greater.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:37.780
PROFESSOR: So I'm
going up right.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.000
So I know that everything here
is guaranteed to be smaller,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.330
everything here is guaranteed
to be greater than this guy.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:48.180
This guy is up right, so this
is guaranteed to be greater

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.040
than this, and
everything here is

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.550
guaranteed to be greater than
this, and so on and so forth

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.270
for the entire tree.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:58.150
So if I go up right, I'm happy.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.030
I definitely found my answer.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:06.040
Now, what if I have something
that looks like this,

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.160
and I want to find the
successor for this guy?

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.730
AUDIENCE: There is none.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.470
PROFESSOR: In this
case, there is none

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.210
if there's nothing else here.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:22.910
What if I have this,
but then I have this?

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:24.300
So I came down this way.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.765
AUDIENCE: Are you saying you're
calling on that last node?

00:38:35.765 --> 00:38:36.390
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:37.473
AUDIENCE: Find the larger?

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.299
I guess you'd just
trace back up.

00:38:44.299 --> 00:38:45.590
PROFESSOR: And where do I stop?

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.110
AUDIENCE: It affects the tree,
so you go up one from there.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.320
You don't stop there.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.890
PROFESSOR: Why
can't I stop here?

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:03.911
AUDIENCE: Because you know
that that-- not necessarily.

00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:06.160
AUDIENCE: You know that
everything in that long branch

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.429
right there is less than
that node [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:09.429 --> 00:39:11.220
PROFESSOR: This is to
the left of this guy,

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:16.620
so this guy has to be
greater than everything here,

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.640
and then you can repeat the
argument that we had before.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.060
So here, we could
stop right away

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.700
because we could branch left.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.340
In this case, you have
to go up until you're

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.580
able to go left and up.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:34.310
If you get to the root,
then what happened?

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:37.025
Then we're in this case,
and you have no successor.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:42.740
So take a look at the code.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.320
The next larger,
lines 1 through 9.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.070
Case two, 6 through
8, does exactly that.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.910
If I can't go to my right
and find the tree there,

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:57.570
then I go up through
my parent chain,

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:00.942
and as long as I have
to go up to the left,

00:40:00.942 --> 00:40:02.900
so as long as I'm the
right child of my parent,

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.120
I have to keep going.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.810
The moment I find the parent
where I'm the left child,

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:07.340
I stop.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.255
That's my successor.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.270
What if I would have to find
the predecessor instead?

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.810
So the element that's
smaller than me

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.734
but bigger than everything
else in the tree.

00:40:19.734 --> 00:40:20.400
What would I do?

00:40:31.624 --> 00:40:33.640
AUDIENCE: It's
just the opposite.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.422
PROFESSOR: Just the opposite.

00:40:35.422 --> 00:40:39.718
So how do I do the opposite?

00:40:39.718 --> 00:40:43.809
AUDIENCE: You can take the
max of the left side tree,

00:40:43.809 --> 00:40:53.400
or traverse up, and
if that's less than--

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.900
PROFESSOR: OK, so if I
have a left subtree, fine.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.070
Call max on it and get
the rightmost node there.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:04.250
If not, I go up,
and when do I stop?

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:10.598
When I go left or right?

00:41:10.598 --> 00:41:13.430
AUDIENCE: You'd
have to go right.

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:14.850
Is that right?

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:15.630
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:20.300
So last time, in this
case, when I was going up,

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.160
if I was going left,
I had to keep going,

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.250
and the moment I went right,
I was happy and I stopped.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.560
What if I want to
find the predecessor?

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.810
It's the opposite, right?

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:34.770
So I will go this way, and
the moment I can go this way,

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:35.960
I'm done.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.624
How do you do this in code?

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:43.765
Slightly tricky.

00:41:43.765 --> 00:41:44.940
Just slightly, I promise.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.616
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:51.616 --> 00:41:53.790
PROFESSOR: It's hard.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.630
What I would do is
copy paste the code,

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:59.725
replace "left" with "right"
everywhere, and replace "min"

00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:03.251
with "max."

00:42:03.251 --> 00:42:05.240
You get it done.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.910
So we talked about how the
tree is symmetric, right?

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:12.670
So every time, instead of
saying "left," you say "right,"

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:14.830
and instead of saying
"min," you say "max."

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:15.860
That's how you do this.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.905
How do we do deletions?

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.910
So suppose I'm in this tree
and I want to delete 15.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:28.710
What do I do?

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:29.570
AUDIENCE: Kill it.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:30.510
PROFESSOR: Kill it.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:31.714
Very good.

00:42:31.714 --> 00:42:32.880
What if I want to delete 16?

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.011
What do I do?

00:42:39.663 --> 00:42:43.797
AUDIENCE: You need to
put 15 where 16 is.

00:42:43.797 --> 00:42:44.380
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.715
So I would put 15 here.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.640
So I had 16.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.085
Suppose I have a big tree here.

00:43:03.087 --> 00:43:04.670
Actually, let's go
for an easier case.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:09.920
Let's say I have this tree here.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.000
So you're here, you
have a big tree here,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.070
you don't have
anything here, and you

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.070
want to delete this guy.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.165
AUDIENCE: You know
that everything less

00:43:19.165 --> 00:43:21.370
than the top node is
going to be less than it,

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.830
so you can just move that up.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:27.769
PROFESSOR: Everything
less than this guy is also

00:43:27.769 --> 00:43:29.060
going to be less than this guy.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.250
So you're saying move
the whole tree up.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:32.992
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:43:32.992 --> 00:43:34.450
PROFESSOR: So the
way we do that is

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:38.290
we'd take this node's left
link and make it point here,

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:42.690
and take this guy's parent
link and make it point here,

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.730
and this guy sort of goes away.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.090
So we have two
cases for deleting.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:53.250
We have if you're a
leaf, we'll take you out.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.100
Sorry.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.190
I got confused.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.350
If you have one
child and that child

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.860
is in the same direction as your
parent, then you can do this.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:21.730
What if you have one child,
but it's a zigzag like this?

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:22.380
What do you do?

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.020
AUDIENCE: It's still greater
than, so you do the same thing.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.250
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:33.800
Same thing.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.269
Just change this guy, change
this guy, and I'm happy.

00:44:40.269 --> 00:44:42.810
So it doesn't matter if you have
a zigzag or a straight line.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.290
It might help you think
about it to convince yourself

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:49.970
that the code is correct, but in
the end, you do the same thing.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:54.840
Now, what if I want
to delete node 8?

00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:10.370
So what if I have a nasty case
where I want to delete this guy

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.833
and it has children both on
the left and on the right?

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.030
AUDIENCE: You have to take
8, compare it to its parent

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:26.605
and compare it to
its right child,

00:45:26.605 --> 00:45:28.667
and see which one
is greater in order

00:45:28.667 --> 00:45:33.857
to figure out which node
gets replaced in its spot.

00:45:33.857 --> 00:45:34.440
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.064
So there is replacing
that's going to happen.

00:45:37.064 --> 00:45:38.230
The answer is really tricky.

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.290
I always forget
this when coding.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:44.130
Try to understand it,
and if it doesn't work,

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:45.300
refer to the textbook.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.270
When you forget it, because
you will, refer to the textbook

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.120
or to the internet.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:54.650
So what you do is I can't just
magically replace this node

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:57.650
with one of the subtrees,
but we talked right

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:07.030
before this about Next Greater,
so finding a node's successor.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:10.560
If this node has both a left
subtree and a right subtree,

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.460
then I know that if I
call Find Successor on it,

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:17.600
I'm going to go
somewhere inside here,

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:23.000
and I'm going to find a node
somewhere in here all the way

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.510
to the left that is
this guy's successor.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:32.340
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:38.030
to delete this node instead, and
then I'm going to take its key

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.990
and put it up here.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.550
So if I want to delete 8, what
I do is I find its successor,

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:53.180
then I delete it, then I take
the 15 that was here-- you

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:53.930
can see it, right?

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:54.638
It's still there.

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.680
Put it here.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:05.470
So the reason this works
is that everything here

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.010
is greater than this guy.

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:11.240
Everything here is
smaller than this guy.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.480
This is the next node that's
greater than this guy,

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.760
but everything else
is bigger than it,

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.590
right, because we wanted
it to be a successor.

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.840
So if I take this value
and I put it up here,

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.500
everything in here is still
going to be greater than it.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.000
This is a successor of this
guy, so everything here

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
is still going to be
smaller than the successor.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.360
Great.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.620
In order to do a delete,
I find the successor,

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.455
and then I call Delete on it.

00:47:50.455 --> 00:47:51.830
How do I know that
this will end?

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:54.210
How do I know that
I'm not going to go

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:58.533
into a loop that runs forever?

00:47:58.533 --> 00:47:59.699
AUDIENCE: Because it's not--

00:47:59.699 --> 00:48:01.947
AUDIENCE: It's acyclic, right?

00:48:01.947 --> 00:48:02.530
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.540
First answer, good.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:11.290
Eventually, worst case, I'm
going to get to the maximum,

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:16.340
and then not going on have to
delete the successor anymore.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.780
Now, another thing
to note here is

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.710
that if this guy is the
successor of this guy,

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:24.300
it can't have anything on the
left, because if it would,

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.800
then whatever is down here
has to be bigger than this,

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.520
and whatever's to
the left of this node

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.560
has to be smaller than this.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.740
But we said that this is
the successor of this,

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.500
so there's nothing here.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.000
So this will be one of the easy
cases that we talked about.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.500
The successor
either has no kids,

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:47.940
or it has only one
child, only one subtree.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.140
So then I can delete it
using one of the easy cases.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:55.170
So in fact, worst case that
happens in a delete is my node

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:56.230
has two subtrees.

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:59.460
Then I find the successor that's
only going to have one subtree,

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.130
I change my links
there, and I'm done.

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:05.660
What is the running
time for Delete?

00:49:15.103 --> 00:49:17.186
AUDIENCE: Is it order h,
because you should do it

00:49:17.186 --> 00:49:19.939
all the way down to the
bottom of the tree, right?

00:49:19.939 --> 00:49:21.480
PROFESSOR: You have
the right answer.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.684
Let's see why it's order h.

00:49:22.684 --> 00:49:23.850
It has to be order h, right?

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:25.433
Otherwise, the tree
would be too slow.

00:49:25.433 --> 00:49:29.130
If it's order N, then it's bad.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:32.490
So why would Delete be order h?

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.350
This was a heap, right,
so I can't use this.

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:39.401
I'm going to write
"delete" here again.

00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:41.900
So the first thing you do is
you have to search for the key,

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:42.630
right?

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:43.610
That's order h.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.960
Now, if it's a happy case,
if it's case one or two,

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.750
you change some links
and you're done.

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:51.830
What's the time for that?

00:49:54.679 --> 00:49:55.470
AUDIENCE: Constant.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:56.810
PROFESSOR: Constant.

00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:59.950
So happy case, order h for sure.

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:00.659
Now sad case.

00:50:00.659 --> 00:50:02.200
If you have two
children, what do you

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.580
have to do after you realize
that you have two subtrees?

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.047
AUDIENCE: Find the successor.

00:50:08.047 --> 00:50:08.630
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:12.378
What's the running time
for finding a successor?

00:50:12.378 --> 00:50:14.270
AUDIENCE: Order h.

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:15.090
PROFESSOR: Order h.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.287
Once I find the
successor, what do I do?

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:29.287
Call Delete on that,
and what happens?

00:50:29.287 --> 00:50:30.620
It's a happy case or a sad case?

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.410
AUDIENCE: It's a happy case.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:35.076
PROFESSOR: Happy case,
a few links get swapped,

00:50:35.076 --> 00:50:36.070
constant time.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:40.010
So worst case, order
h plus order h.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:41.260
Order h.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:45.280
So insertions are order
h, deletions are order h.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.410
AUDIENCE: The first one.

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:47.950
Because the second one is
from finding the successor.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:49.033
What is the first one for?

00:50:49.033 --> 00:50:52.930
PROFESSOR: Finding the
node for a key in the tree.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:55.910
So if I say Delete 8,
then you have to find 8.

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.880
If I give you the node,
then you don't have that.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.506
Good question.

00:50:59.506 --> 00:51:00.380
It's a good question.

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.000
Thank you.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.500
So that's insertion.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.470
That's deletion.

00:51:11.169 --> 00:51:12.585
Let's look at the
code for Delete.

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:18.810
Looks kind of long.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.637
So lines through 21,
happy case or sad case?

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:33.150
Try to do it by
looking at the "if"

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:35.010
instead of looking
at the comments.

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:42.180
So lines through 21 for Delete.

00:51:45.484 --> 00:51:46.900
AUDIENCE: On this tree?

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.258
Which tree, because
there are two deletes?

00:51:49.258 --> 00:51:50.133
PROFESSOR: Oh really?

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:53.940
Sorry.

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.145
Why do we have two deletes?

00:51:56.145 --> 00:52:01.409
AUDIENCE: There's BST Delete and
then there's BST Node Delete.

00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:02.450
PROFESSOR: So BST Delete.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.400
Finds the node, and then
calls Delete on the node.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.460
And then if the node
is a tree's root,

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.480
then it updates the tree's root.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.410
So let's look at
the nodes delete.

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:20.295
Oh, I see.

00:52:20.295 --> 00:52:21.920
I think I was looking
at the wrong one.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:26.580
Thank you.

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.280
My Delete was much
longer than yours.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.760
So lines 3 through 12,
happy case or sad case?

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.290
Look at the "if" on
line 3 and tell me,

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:45.650
what case is it going for?

00:52:51.208 --> 00:52:52.124
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.580
PROFESSOR: If it doesn't
have a left child

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.280
or it doesn't have
a right child,

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.750
is that the happy
case or the sad case?

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:02.480
AUDIENCE: Happy.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.396
PROFESSOR: Happy case.

00:53:03.396 --> 00:53:08.300
So lines 4 through 12
handle the happy case.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:10.990
Lines 14 through 16
handle the sad case.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:17.860
Do lines 14 through
16 make sense?

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.740
Find the successor,
then swap the keys,

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.148
then delete that successor.

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.660
Now, lines 4 through
11 are pretty much what

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:33.960
we talked about here, except I
can't draw arrows on the board

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.472
and instead I have to
change left and right links.

00:53:37.472 --> 00:53:41.130
Line 4 has to see if we're a
left child or a right child,

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:45.240
and then lines 5 through 7 and
9 through 11 are pretty much

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.600
copy paste, swap
left with right.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.166
And they changed the links
like we changed them here.

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:03.150
Do we have any
questions on Deletes?

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:08.440
AUDIENCE: So if the
successor had a right child,

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:15.050
then all you do, you just do
the workaround thing where

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:15.550
you just--

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:17.530
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:19.990
So the case that it
doesn't have two children.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:21.870
As long as it doesn't
have both children,

00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:24.328
you're in the happy case and
you can do some link swapping.

00:54:28.355 --> 00:54:29.870
Are you guys burned out already?

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:33.910
Fair enough.

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.540
I left a part out.

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:43.120
What I left out is how
to augment a binary tree.

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:46.740
So binary trees by default
can answer the question,

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.500
what's the minimum node
in a tree in order h.

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.710
You go all the way to the
left, you find the minimum.

00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:53.260
That's the minimum.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.920
It turns out that if you make
a node a little bit fatter,

00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:03.070
so if instead of storing, say,
23 in this node, I store 23,

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:05.630
and I store the fact that the
minimum in my left subtree

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:10.230
is 4, then it turns out that
I can answer the question

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:13.066
in constant time,
what's the minimum?

00:55:13.066 --> 00:55:15.475
Oh gee, if you store
the minimum here,

00:55:15.475 --> 00:55:18.550
of course you can retrieve
it in constant time, right?

00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:21.940
The hard part is, how do you
handle insertions and updates

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:25.580
in the same time?

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:27.770
So the idea is that
if I have a node

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:33.990
and I have a function here,
say the minimum of everything,

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:40.530
if I have two children,
here they're 15 and 42,

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:42.800
and say the minimum
in this tree is 4

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.850
and the minimum in this tree is.

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:50.076
So if I already computed
the function for these guys,

00:55:50.076 --> 00:55:51.700
how do I compute the
function for this?

00:55:54.039 --> 00:55:55.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
and compare it?

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:56.220
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.190
Take the minimum of
these two guys, right?

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:02.290
There are some special cases
if you don't have a child.

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:06.540
If you don't have a left
child, then you're the minimum.

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.440
But you write down
those special cases,

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.930
and you can compute
this in how much time?

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:17.020
AUDIENCE: Order h, right?

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.250
PROFESSOR: What if I
already computed the answer

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:20.759
for the children?

00:56:20.759 --> 00:56:22.300
How much time does
it take to compute

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.432
the answer for a single node?

00:56:24.432 --> 00:56:25.304
AUDIENCE: Constant.

00:56:25.304 --> 00:56:26.137
PROFESSOR: Constant.

00:56:26.137 --> 00:56:26.720
OK.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.271
AUDIENCE: For a tree, though.

00:56:28.271 --> 00:56:29.770
PROFESSOR: For a
tree, it's order h.

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:30.270
Yeah.

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:32.791
You're getting ahead.

00:56:32.791 --> 00:56:33.540
You're rushing me.

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:34.748
You're not letting me finish.

00:56:34.748 --> 00:56:38.200
AUDIENCE: Are you saying that
we store the minimum value?

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.345
PROFESSOR: So for every--

00:56:39.345 --> 00:56:43.425
AUDIENCE: Each node
has a field that

00:56:43.425 --> 00:56:46.316
says what the minimum
value is in that tree.

00:56:46.316 --> 00:56:47.550
PROFESSOR: Yep, exactly.

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:51.340
So for each node, what's
the minimum in the subtree.

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.740
So if I add a node here,
suppose I add three

00:56:54.740 --> 00:57:01.840
and I had my minimums,
what changed?

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.870
This subtree changed,
this subtree changed,

00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:07.670
this subtree changed, and
then this subtree changed.

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:12.150
So I have to update the
minimums here, here, here, here.

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:13.910
Nothing else changed.

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:16.190
Outside the path where
I did the Insert,

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:19.680
nothing changed, so I don't
have to update anything.

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.790
So what I do is after
the Insert, I go back up

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:25.305
and I re-compute the values.

00:57:25.305 --> 00:57:26.180
So here, I'll have 3.

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:29.774
I go back up 3, 3, 3.

00:57:29.774 --> 00:57:32.980
AUDIENCE: You could when
you're passing down, though.

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:35.818
When you're going
down that column,

00:57:35.818 --> 00:57:37.600
you can just compare
it on the way down.

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.100
You don't have to
go back up, right?

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:40.040
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.480
So the advantage of doing
it the way I'm saying it

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.400
is that you can have other
functions instead of minimum.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.640
As long as you can
compute the function

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.480
inside the parent
in constant time

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:53.850
using the function
from the children,

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:57.379
it makes sense to compute the
function on the children first.

00:57:57.379 --> 00:57:59.420
There's an obvious function
that I can't tell you

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:02.760
because that's on the Pset,
but when you see the next Pset,

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.810
you'll see what I mean.

00:58:05.810 --> 00:58:08.565
So if you have a
function where you

00:58:08.565 --> 00:58:11.190
know the result for the children
and you can compute the result

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:15.820
for the parent in constant time,
then after you do the Insert,

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:21.550
you go up on the path and
you re-compute the function.

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:25.478
When you delete, what do you do?

00:58:25.478 --> 00:58:26.874
AUDIENCE: Same thing.

00:58:26.874 --> 00:58:27.790
PROFESSOR: Same thing.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:35.850
If this goes away, then this
subtree changed, and then

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:37.530
if there would be
something else here,

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:41.240
then this subtree changed,
but nothing else changed.

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.880
So whenever you do an Insert
or a Delete, all you have to do

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.210
is go back up the
path to the parent

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:52.000
and re-compute the function
that you're trying to compute.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.310
And that's tree augmentation.

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:58.370
Does this make sense somewhat?

00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:59.440
That's it.

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.960
So what you'll find
in lecture notes

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:05.850
is a harder way of doing
it that works for minimum,

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:08.990
but what I told you
works for everything.

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:12.790
So don't tell people I told you
how to do this for everything.

00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:15.250
Sure nobody's going to know.
