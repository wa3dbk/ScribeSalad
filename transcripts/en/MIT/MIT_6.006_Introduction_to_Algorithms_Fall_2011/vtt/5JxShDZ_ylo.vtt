00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:23.750
PROFESSOR: I want to
talk about two things,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.139
maybe, depending on
the level of interest.

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:28.430
We can talk a little bit
about PSET five and the things

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.830
that I think are weird in
the coding part of PSET five.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.802
By the way, how many
people started PSET five?

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.367
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:38.450
AUDIENCE: I downloaded it.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.380
PROFESSOR: Hmm, maybe we are not
going to talk about P set five.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.576
You guys need to start early!

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:44.829
AUDIENCE: I did.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:45.620
PROFESSOR: You did.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.460
Yeah.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.020
I guess I can't punish
you for everyone else.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.110
So P set five, and I
can talk about graphs.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560
I can talk about whatever
didn't make sense in class

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.230
and I can talk about
background stuff for graphs.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.400
So how do people feel?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.520
Who wants talk about the
PSET that we haven't read?

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.852
Who wants to talk about graphs?

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:12.816
AUDIENCE: It's really easy.

00:01:12.816 --> 00:01:14.300
We took 604 two.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah, if you took
604 two, nothing here is new.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.720
I mean nothing in the
recitation is new.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.820
We're going to take it to new
heights of graph knowledge,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.460
and you'll be able to
do many more cool things

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.690
that you're able to do before.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.230
OK, so PSET.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.870
For people who
started early, what

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.390
was the gist of the
coding assignments?

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.410
AUDIENCE: So we have
to speed up something.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.559
When I ran the tests-- do I
say what I got as results?

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:53.100
PROFESSOR: The time isn't on
the PSET so you can say what you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.626
got as --

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:53.972
AUDIENCE: Pardon?

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:55.513
PROFESSOR: The time
isn't on the PSET

00:01:55.513 --> 00:01:57.240
so you can say what
you got as a time.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.807
AUDIENCE: OK, the slowest
was like add for me.

00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:04.140
PROFESSOR: You should look
to see add is a valid answer.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.579
Look at the questions and
see if add is a valid answer.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:07.120
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.920
PROFESSOR: It's not like what
was lowest function, right?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.800
There's more text there.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.330
You should read the
rest of the text

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.565
and see if add makes
sense as a valid answer.

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:19.190
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.297
OK.

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:23.130
PROFESSOR: What you're
doing-- big picture--

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.170
is you have some processor,
that's not a real processor,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.830
and it can do arithmetic
with bytes and 16-bit words.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.130
And we give you the
basic operations

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.890
and then they give you a library
for large number arithmetic

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.280
because, guess what?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.160
16 bytes addition, subtraction?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.090
Not going to cut it for
science applications

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.280
are for cryptography,
what we want to play with.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.276
What are the basic operations
that that processor can do?

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:55.650
Front of the PSET,
so even if you

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.840
didn't get to the
coding assignment

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.756
you can still tell me.

00:02:57.756 --> 00:03:01.656
AUDIENCE: Divide,
and zeros, I think.

00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:03.920
Zeros.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.980
PROFESSOR: Plus, minus,
multiply, divide, and mod.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.710
Let's start to these.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.690
So you have two primitives
in that processor.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.100
You have have bytes, which
are basically 8-bit digits.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.490
There's 200.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.640
The range is 0 to 256.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.080
And the word is 16-bit,
from 0 to the 16 minus 1.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.677
If you care to know
this is 6, 5, 5, 3, 5.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.710
So, if you take two bytes
and add them together what do

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.490
you get?

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.454
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.720
PROFESSOR: Not right.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.820
It's a trick question.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.550
You get word.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.260
The processor cannot do
simple math on bytes.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.750
It converts them up to words and
all the math happens on words.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.650
Now if you guess two words,
and add them up together

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.917
what do you get?

00:04:17.917 --> 00:04:19.652
AUDIENCE: Two words?

00:04:19.652 --> 00:04:21.360
PROFESSOR: You do if
we're not that nice.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.310
AUDIENCE: A world in carry bit?

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.270
PROFESSOR: Sorry,
you just get word.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.010
At least nobody said a byte.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.580
I was like, please don't say
byte, please don't say byte.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.922
You said carry bit.

00:04:37.922 --> 00:04:39.380
Why do we care
about the carry bit?

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.380
What is the problem if
you do addition this way?

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.080
AUDIENCE: If you're
going too high.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.975
If the highest bit is
one on both of them.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:49.845
Then it's like
overflow, kind of.

00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:50.470
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.690
Suppose we're trying to add
2 to the 16 minus 1 plus 2

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.960
to the 16 minus 1.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.000
By the way, does anyone
remember hex notation?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.180
Hexadecimal?

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.920
OK, people who started
the PSET remember.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.340
That's good.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.110
It will be easy to write
things hex for the PSET.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.346
If you try to add these numbers
you're going to get 1, F, F, F,

00:05:17.346 --> 00:05:21.200
E. You can use the
math here to see

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.540
that this is more
than the words.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.409
So you would like to know that
this thing overflows, right?

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:28.700
You like to know that there is.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.230
Well we don't give you that.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.860
All you get to this.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.885
So addition happens,
modulo 2 to the 16.

00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:44.510
If you want to be able to detect
overflow what they have to do?

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.170
AUDIENCE: Just tests those bits.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.790
PROFESSOR: That one
way of doing it.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.770
It would take quite a
few instructions, though.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.780
If you want to do
overflow detection,

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.190
the easiest way I think of
doing it this to use this form.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.780
So suppose you have two bytes.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.450
This is the maximum
value in a byte, right?

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.480
255, 2 to the 8 minus 1.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.520
If you have 2 bytes and
you add them all together

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.270
you're going to
get 1, F, E. Right?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.805
It's just like the case here,
except you have a fewer F's.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.000
Where is the carry here?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.260
AUDIENCE: Could be the 1, right?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.170
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.380
This guy here is the carry
and this guy's the low result.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.970
Does anyone know how
these are called?

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.415
If you have a word and
you have two bytes, what

00:06:49.415 --> 00:06:51.916
is the first byte, what
is the second bytes?

00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:54.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.311
PROFESSOR: Most
significant byte,

00:06:57.311 --> 00:07:00.315
M, S, B, and least
significant byte,

00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:03.860
L, S, B. If you want to
figure out your carries,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.140
then you should do
your math this way.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.040
You're going to have
byte 1 plus byte 2.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.500
Add them together.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.825
And then you call L, S,
B to get the byte result.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.660
And then you call M,
S, B to get the carry.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.500
This is addition.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.250
Everyone with me so far?

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.115
By the way, are these
numbers signed or unsigned?

00:07:36.115 --> 00:07:37.085
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:40.817 --> 00:07:42.400
PROFESSOR: No negative
numbers, right?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.820
So no support for
negative numbers.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.300
Everything is going
to be positive.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.320
And we're going to
build everything

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.300
we need off of positive
numbers because they're

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.070
easier to deal with.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:57.770
What if I have two words
and I subtract them?

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.850
What do I get?

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.527
AUDIENCE: Word.

00:08:01.527 --> 00:08:02.110
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:11.840
What if I have 0 minus 1?

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.845
What do I get?

00:08:13.845 --> 00:08:16.220
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.175
PROFESSOR: Not quite.

00:08:19.175 --> 00:08:21.115
AUDIENCE: If you're
not using signs?

00:08:21.115 --> 00:08:24.469
Do you get O, 1?

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:25.385
PROFESSOR: O, 1's, OK.

00:08:25.385 --> 00:08:26.556
AUDIENCE: Ya.

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:27.780
Wait--

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.822
PROFESSOR: So, O 1's
would be this, F, F, F, F.

00:08:33.822 --> 00:08:38.452
AUDIENCE: That's assuming
if you signed then.

00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:40.880
It will overflow.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.340
That's a really big number then.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.145
PROFESSOR: So fancy
CS, 2's complement.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.245
For people who think in
math mode, what is this?

00:08:54.245 --> 00:08:54.995
AUDIENCE: I think.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.730
PROFESSOR: It's minus
1 mod 2 to the 16.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.790
Remember, when we were doing
modular arithmetic before,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.150
to figure out a number's
multiplicative inverse?

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.197
And when we were
doing rolling hashes?

00:09:12.197 --> 00:09:13.530
We didn't want negative numbers.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.446
We made them positive.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.260
So minus 1 lot to the
16 is 2 to the 16.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.860
Minus 1, and comes
out to this value.

00:09:26.517 --> 00:09:28.100
So you get minus 1,
it's just that you

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.155
have to know your basis.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.980
So we got the addition
and subtraction.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.114
Let's talk about multiplication.

00:09:38.114 --> 00:09:39.530
What do you do for
multiplication?

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.390
What can you multiply?

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.820
Two bytes, very good.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.445
Just two bytes.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.290
What do you get?

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:52.820
A word.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.190
Thank you.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.109
You multiply two
bytes, you get a word.

00:09:57.109 --> 00:09:58.150
What if there's overflow?

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.987
It's a trick question.

00:10:10.987 --> 00:10:12.420
AUDIENCE: There's no overflow.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.880
PROFESSOR: There is no overflow.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.500
So two bytes, 2 to the
eighth minus 1 times 2

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.300
to the eighth minus 1,
is 2 to the 16 minus 2

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.230
to the 8th minus 2
to the eighth plus 1.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.250
You can say this safely without
doing the arithmetic, right?

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.470
This is how much you can
hold, in other words.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.835
This is how much you
can holding in a byte.

00:10:40.835 --> 00:10:42.230
AUDIENCE: Why do you minus 1?

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.260
PROFESSOR: Ya, minus 1.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.770
There's a minus 1 here,
and there's a minus 1 here,

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.520
but I can't find it
here, so roughly this.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.996
But there is an overflow.

00:10:49.996 --> 00:10:52.229
AUDIENCE: But where did
you get the minus 1 from?

00:10:52.229 --> 00:10:53.770
PROFESSOR: Where do
you get the-- so,

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.730
this is how much you
can hold in a byte.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.740
Byte has 8 bits, right?

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:03.896
From 0 0 to F F. This is
2 to the eighth minus 1.

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.120
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.500
PROFESSOR: OK, so
multiplication?

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.400
There is an overflow.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.691
I don't have to deal with that.

00:11:08.691 --> 00:11:10.820
You guys have to figure
out how to deal with it.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.880
How about division?

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.740
What can you divide?

00:11:15.488 --> 00:11:16.870
AUDIENCE: Some words?

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.478
PROFESSOR: Almost.

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:19.790
AUDIENCE: Words like--

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:25.060
PROFESSOR: A word
divided by a byte.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.430
What do you get out of it?

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.830
AUDIENCE: Words?

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.210
PROFESSOR: That would be nice.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.426
Nope.

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:37.110
Sorry, you get a byte.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.470
And if you do module,
you also get a byte.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.490
What if there's overflow
in the division?

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.031
What happens?

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.174
What would you expect to happen?

00:11:51.174 --> 00:11:55.158
AUDIENCE: We don't have any
best flowing point numbers,

00:11:55.158 --> 00:12:00.150
so, we shouldn't
get overflow, right?

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:05.810
PROFESSOR: How about 2 to
the 16 minus 1 divided by 1?

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:10.120
So what do get?

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.995
AUDIENCE: Same thing?

00:12:10.995 --> 00:12:12.536
PROFESSOR: Will this
fit in the byte?

00:12:12.536 --> 00:12:13.183
AUDIENCE: Yes?

00:12:13.183 --> 00:12:13.683
No.

00:12:13.683 --> 00:12:14.545
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:14.545 --> 00:12:15.808
No.

00:12:15.808 --> 00:12:18.907
Well, that time I
don't get a word.

00:12:18.907 --> 00:12:20.240
PROFESSOR: You don't get a word.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.830
I promise you get a byte.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.295
What will that byte be?

00:12:26.295 --> 00:12:29.676
AUDIENCE: It's going
to be modulo something.

00:12:29.676 --> 00:12:30.642
Most significant--

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.690
PROFESSOR: That's
reasonable, right?

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.000
Modulo to 56 because
that's what it can carry.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.545
What about modulo?

00:12:44.545 --> 00:12:46.170
What happens there
if you get overflow?

00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:57.397
AUDIENCE: The same thing.

00:12:57.397 --> 00:13:01.293
It's just going to loop, right?

00:13:01.293 --> 00:13:04.116
0?

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:05.490
PROFESSOR: So if
you do a modulo,

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.870
this is going to be,
at most, 255 right?

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.340
If you do modulo
255, the remainder

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.640
is going to be
between 0 and 254.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.450
Will that ever overflow byte?

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:19.997
No overflow.

00:13:19.997 --> 00:13:21.080
No need to worry about it.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.830
Word addition can overflow.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.730
Subtraction can overflow.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.230
Multiplication doesn't overflow.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.980
Division overflows,
modulo doesn't.

00:13:36.228 --> 00:13:40.910
AUDIENCE: What do you mean, like
will it see the space confined?

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:41.795
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:13:41.795 --> 00:13:43.190
It sees the space of the result.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.680
Because here, if you're
adding two words,

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.305
the result exceeds
the space of a word.

00:13:46.305 --> 00:13:49.152
Which is what you get.

00:13:49.152 --> 00:13:54.460
AUDIENCE: Is it just in all
cases it's just [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.450
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.520
So the reason you have to
deal with this weird system

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.510
is this is, pretty much, how
Intel does their arithmetic.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.770
If you look at old school,
16-bit Intel processors,

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.600
you have registers and you
have exactly these operations.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.250
For newer processors, there are
32 bits, but then it's just,

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.645
you write more F's on the board
and you get the same thing.

00:14:17.645 --> 00:14:20.930
AUDIENCE: Is it most significant
bit, or most significant byte?

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.440
PROFESSOR: Most
significant byte.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.020
On a real processor,
you have registers

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.520
that are the size
of a word and then

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.470
you can pull out the
bytes in constant time.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.910
What constant do we have?

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.380
These are the operations.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.470
What constants do we have?

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.800
Only two constants, 0 and 1.

00:14:51.262 --> 00:14:52.970
What if you want to
get something bigger?

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.060
What if you want to get 2?

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.800
How do you get 2?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.770
AUDIENCE: Two 1's?

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.855
1 plus 1?

00:14:58.855 --> 00:14:59.480
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.300
What if you want
to get this number?

00:15:12.696 --> 00:15:14.664
AUDIENCE: Do that several times?

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:16.474
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:16.474 --> 00:15:18.140
PROFESSOR: It's kind
of painful to type,

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.020
even if you copy paste.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.310
There's a method on
Word called from-bytes.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.670
And it takes an M,
S, B and an L, S, B

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.300
and it gives you a word.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.350
So what would I give it?

00:15:38.098 --> 00:15:40.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.725
PROFESSOR: Let's give it
a 1 and let's give it a 0.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:52.100
So this will get 1,
0, 0 and then minus 1.

00:15:58.855 --> 00:15:59.355
Yes?

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.659
OK.

00:16:05.659 --> 00:16:07.200
Intel is pretty nice
about constants,

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.650
but some other
processors aren't.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.620
So I figured, why not
let's get you acquainted

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.846
to these kind of tricks, to too.

00:16:13.846 --> 00:16:17.400
Let's make the PSETS
more interesting.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.650
All right, so any questions
on this fake processor

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.041
that you have to code for?

00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:26.762
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
the last one again?

00:16:26.762 --> 00:16:27.734
PROFESSOR: Here?

00:16:27.734 --> 00:16:29.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah, Word from-bytes.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.310
PROFESSOR: So in Word
from-bytes a word is 2 bytes.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.520
One next to the other.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.150
It gives you the first byte,
and gives you the second byte.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.340
In this case, the
first byte is 1.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.190
The second byte is 0.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:42.690
Right?

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:43.650
So 2 bytes.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.150
A 1 and a 0.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.760
How do you write this in hex?

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.530
1, 0, 0.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.060
One byte, second byte.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:58.500
And then I subtract
1 and I get this.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.089
While I erase the
board, I want you guys

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.040
to think of graph
questions because this

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.550
is the other topic
we're looking at today.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.020
What was unclear
about the lecture?

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.839
What is unclear about
graphs in general?

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.790
Do guys remember the
handshaking lemma?

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:16.560
What does it mean?

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.810
How do you prove it?

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.740
Things of that sort.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.287
What do you guys
want to cover today?

00:17:23.287 --> 00:17:25.924
AUDIENCE: Handshaking,
that's the thing where

00:17:25.924 --> 00:17:30.450
you have a bunch nodes
and they're all connected,

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:36.008
like they're all in a closed
graph, that the number of edges

00:17:36.008 --> 00:17:40.270
is equal to twice the
number of vertices?

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.866
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:41.866 --> 00:17:43.650
AUDIENCE: That's
all it is, right?

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:44.305
PROFESSOR: The
number of vertices?

00:17:44.305 --> 00:17:44.880
No.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.296
AUDIENCE: The
number of handshakes

00:17:46.296 --> 00:17:49.900
that occurred are twice
the number of edges.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.410
You said the number
of vertices, wait--

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.189
PROFESSOR: No, vertices and
edges are not related in here.

00:17:56.189 --> 00:17:57.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, think
of a triangle, right?

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.330
That's three edges,
three vertices.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:05.590
Which is like not two times,
which is what you said.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.301
It's the number of degrees
is twice the number of edges.

00:18:08.301 --> 00:18:10.090
That's what I was
thinking of then.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.620
PROFESSOR: All right, so
let's start with simple stuff.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.208
What's a graph?

00:18:15.208 --> 00:18:16.670
AUDIENCE: Nodes and edges?

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:17.545
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:18:17.545 --> 00:18:18.900
Fancy word for nodes?

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.609
AUDIENCE: Vertex.

00:18:19.609 --> 00:18:20.358
PROFESSOR: Vertex.

00:18:20.358 --> 00:18:21.230
Vertices and edges.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.430
How do I draw vertices?

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.400
How do I draw edges?

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.680
AUDIENCE: Circles and lines.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.516
PROFESSOR: Circles and lines.

00:18:26.516 --> 00:18:27.974
AUDIENCE: 0's and 1's.

00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:31.035
Possibly arrows.

00:18:31.035 --> 00:18:32.160
PROFESSOR: Possibly arrows.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:32.920
I like that.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.386
You want to get fancy.

00:18:34.386 --> 00:18:36.697
[LAUGHTER}

00:18:36.697 --> 00:18:38.530
PROFESSOR: When do I
draw an edge as a line?

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.818
When do I draw it as an arrow?

00:18:40.818 --> 00:18:43.240
AUDIENCE: Directed under.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.532
PROFESSOR: Which one's which?

00:18:44.532 --> 00:18:46.008
AUDIENCE: Directed as an arrow.

00:18:46.008 --> 00:18:46.992
Character number.

00:18:56.014 --> 00:18:56.680
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.455
Let's draw this graph here.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.970
Yeah, looks like a
pretty boring graph.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.442
Is this graph connected or not?

00:19:14.442 --> 00:19:16.960
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.903
PROFESSOR: What's
a connected graph?

00:19:19.903 --> 00:19:21.278
AUDIENCE: I think
that we can get

00:19:21.278 --> 00:19:23.880
to any other node
following some path.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.880
PROFESSOR: There's a path
from any to any other node.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.570
How do I make this
unconnected using

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.830
the least amount of effort?

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.630
It's a bit of a trick question.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.732
Any guess is fine.

00:19:39.732 --> 00:19:41.340
AUDIENCE: What was
the question again?

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.110
PROFESSOR: How do I
make this unconnected

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.084
using the least amount
of effort on my behalf?

00:19:47.084 --> 00:19:48.994
AUDIENCE: Just add a node?

00:19:48.994 --> 00:19:50.410
PROFESSOR: I heard
you move pages.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:55.950
I don't like you racing
because I don't like the-- So

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.170
I like that answer out
of the two I heard.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.560
Now it's not a connected graph.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.310
How many connected
component does it have?

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:09.630
Two and five.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.510
AUDIENCE: Or one
connected component,

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.787
but there are two components?

00:20:13.787 --> 00:20:15.620
PROFESSOR: OK, what's
a connected component?

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.600
AUDIENCE: It's like in that part
of the graph the neck follows

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:33.035
the prognito beacon and puts
them in two parts [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:33.035 --> 00:20:35.510
two connected components--

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.020
PROFESSOR: So, a
connected component

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.510
is a bunch of vertices such
that you can get from one vertex

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.220
to all the other vertices.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.230
If the graph is
undirected, that's

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.020
true for any vertex in the set.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.590
We also want the
sets to be maximal

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.060
because, if we say this
is a connected component,

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.824
it's not very useful.

00:20:55.824 --> 00:20:58.115
Noticing that this whole
thing is a connected component

00:20:58.115 --> 00:20:59.650
is useful.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:00.850
So this is one component.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.060
This is the other component.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.950
Make sense?

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.310
So, we have the world.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.190
We have cities.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.610
You can bike from a city to
another city and that's it.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.140
No other a route
of transportation.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.390
How many connected components?

00:21:19.856 --> 00:21:20.827
AUDIENCE: Seven?

00:21:20.827 --> 00:21:21.410
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.300
Roughly seven.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:24.800
Why?

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.760
OK, so it only seven?

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.967
AUDIENCE: Seven continents?

00:21:30.967 --> 00:21:31.550
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.360
Let's say roughly seven.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.470
So this is what I wanted.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.507
I wanted some thinking.

00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:42.840
If you try to get from a
continent to another continent,

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.765
presumably you'd go
through some patch of sea.

00:21:45.765 --> 00:21:47.765
Otherwise, why are they
calling them continents?

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.010
Does anyone want to
give out another answer?

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:54.510
I asked this in the
previous section

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.270
and some people there give
me some very precise answers

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:58.636
that are not continents.

00:21:58.636 --> 00:22:00.260
This is what I had
in mind, by the way.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.950
As far as I'm concerned,
this is a good answer.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.090
Come on guys, world.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:18.770
Two things, islands and
Europe and Asia are connected,

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.470
so you can go from
one to the other.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.500
They're weird.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.060
Why are they
separate continents?

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.420
I have no idea.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.292
The geography people might--

00:22:26.292 --> 00:22:28.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.148
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:22:29.148 --> 00:22:31.530
AUDIENCE: You roll mountains?

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.002
PROFESSOR: OK, so it would
be a pain bike through them,

00:22:34.002 --> 00:22:35.374
but presumably you can.

00:22:35.374 --> 00:22:37.665
If you have a robot that
doesn't get tired or something

00:22:37.665 --> 00:22:38.764
you can bike.

00:22:38.764 --> 00:22:41.229
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
mind falling off cliffs.

00:22:41.229 --> 00:22:43.270
PROFESSOR: The answer,
depending on my geography,

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.190
we know is somewhere
between 7 and 10,000,

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.330
or whatever the
number of islands is.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.480
There are a lot of tiny
island somewhere, right?

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.570
Anyways, between seven
and a big number.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.500
These are connected
components in the world.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.920
What's the degree of A?

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.855
2.

00:23:03.855 --> 00:23:07.645
What's the degree of the D?

00:23:07.645 --> 00:23:10.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.250
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:11.980
Let's make this.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:22.660
The degrees of F,
G, H are 2, 2, 2.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.690
The degree of C is 2.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.570
The degree of B is?

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:30.500
AUDIENCE: --2.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.390
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.970
And the degree of E is?

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:33.470
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:23:35.817 --> 00:23:38.150
PROFESSOR: If you add up all
these numbers together what

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:38.720
you get?

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.180
18.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.040
I can't do math, so
I couldn't possibly

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.310
have added all these
numbers together, right?

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.340
I used something else.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.900
How many edges do I
have in the graph?

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.610
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.998
Do you see your connection here?

00:24:14.998 --> 00:24:15.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.830
PROFESSOR: This is
the handshaking lemma.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.210
That's all there is to it.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.660
So if you look at
the degrees of a node

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.230
each edge adds one
to two degrees.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.750
For instance, this edge
adds one to C's degree

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.844
and adds one to D's degree.

00:24:32.844 --> 00:24:34.760
If you're a math person
and you write this up,

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.650
you have to write sums.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.580
You have big sums using
intimidating notation,

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.930
so it's not as obvious.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.120
But this is really
all there is to it.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.329
Each edge contributes
one to two nodes degrees.

00:24:49.329 --> 00:24:50.870
If you add up all
the degrees, you're

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.730
going to get to times
the number of edges.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.750
So far so good?

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.890
What if we have directed graphs?

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.570
What if I had this?

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:24.560
A, B, C, D, E, F. What
is the degree of A?

00:25:28.648 --> 00:25:30.755
AUDIENCE: 2?

00:25:30.755 --> 00:25:31.630
PROFESSOR: Not quite.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:32.480
Sorry, that was trick question.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.790
A doesn't have a degree.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.090
If you have directed graphs,
you don't have degrees.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.690
You have in degrees
and out degrees.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.730
Now that I've said that
you have no idea, right?

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.440
What's the out degree of A?

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:54.300
PROFESSOR: Sometimes this is
known as the degree of edges.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.685
This is 2.

00:25:55.685 --> 00:25:57.330
What's the in degree of A?

00:26:00.506 --> 00:26:01.478
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.160
PROFESSOR: So A has two edges
going out, 0 edges going in.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.045
How about D?

00:26:10.045 --> 00:26:11.240
What's the out degree of D?

00:26:14.621 --> 00:26:15.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.970
PROFESSOR: Come on guys.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.200
Don't scare me. (LAUGHS)
What's the in degree of D?

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.630
AUDIENCE: 2?

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:22.982
PROFESSOR: 2, very good.

00:26:22.982 --> 00:26:24.440
PROFESSOR: So what's
the equivalent

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.100
of the handshaking lemma
on oriented graphs?

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.740
AUDIENCE: The sum of the
in degrees and out degrees?

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.090
PROFESSOR: OK, what about them?

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:39.110
AUDIENCE: They're equal to
twice the number of vertices?

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.240
PROFESSOR: Not quite.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.990
They're equal to?

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.460
You had 80 percent
of the answer.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:51.808
AUDIENCE: Oh. (LAUGHS)

00:26:51.808 --> 00:26:57.600
PROFESSOR: So the sum of the in
degrees and the sum of the out

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.944
degrees.

00:26:58.944 --> 00:26:59.985
AUDIENCE: So add them up?

00:27:03.814 --> 00:27:05.230
PROFESSOR: If you
add them up, you

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.530
will get two times
the number of edges.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.470
That is correct.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:13.140
But, I want something more--

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.480
AUDIENCE: They equal each other?

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.105
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.660
This is cooler, right?

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.740
So why is that?

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.300
Does anyone see why
that's the case?

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:33.970
Each edge-- Come on, guys.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.200
So what does each edge do?

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.520
PROFESSOR: So if I
look at this edge here,

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.840
this edge is going to
contribute 1 to B's out degree,

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:48.260
and 1 to D's in degree.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.680
Each edge contributes
1 to an out degree

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.760
and 1 to an in degree.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.040
That means that total
sum of out degrees

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.050
equals the total
sum of in degrees.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:02.560
Both of them are E and
they combined to E. Sorry,

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.784
eyed I don't know why that
didn't click to me right away.

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:08.181
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:08.181 --> 00:28:09.680
PROFESSOR: The
intuition behind this

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.682
is, that for every node,
if you take an edge

00:28:12.682 --> 00:28:14.140
you're going to
get somewhere else.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.129
If the sum of the out
degrees was bigger,

00:28:19.129 --> 00:28:20.670
then you have a
black hole somewhere.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.490
If you go on an edge
you don't come back.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:23.660
Same four in degrees.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.880
OK, how do we represent graphs?

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.125
AUDIENCE: I think we just did.

00:28:37.125 --> 00:28:38.750
PROFESSOR: Sure, if
you're drawing them

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.666
on the board that's what
you do, but if you're

00:28:40.666 --> 00:28:42.220
in Python what do you do?

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.946
AUDIENCE: You can
have a link list.

00:28:43.946 --> 00:28:44.763
PROFESSOR: Of?

00:28:44.763 --> 00:28:50.920
AUDIENCE: Of each node having
its neighbors linked with.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.050
PROFESSOR: OK, so I
have one big link list?

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.960
Or how does this work?

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.520
AUDIENCE: You'd have a
starting point of some sort.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.250
A starting node.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:04.514
Then from that node you can have
its neighbors connected to it.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.304
So it was a link list , I guess.

00:29:09.304 --> 00:29:10.470
PROFESSOR: I wasn't precise.

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.200
That is not trivial to build.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.700
By the time we build that we're
done with this recitation.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.294
What do you get is the
vertices and the edges.

00:29:20.294 --> 00:29:22.960
We want an easier representation
that just looks at the vertices

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.420
and build something,
then looks at the edges

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.295
and builds something.

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:32.486
AUDIENCE: You could
have a table of values.

00:29:32.486 --> 00:29:36.498
Like, A has these
neighbors-- a dictionary.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.560
PROFESSOR: Let's go for that.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.480
So we have a dictionary.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.780
For each vertex
you have the list

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.260
of vertices that
are connected to it.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.400
What's the list for A?

00:29:55.731 --> 00:29:56.480
AUDIENCE: B and C?

00:30:00.329 --> 00:30:01.870
PROFESSOR: OK, what's
the list for B?

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:18.795
AUDIENCE: A, D, and E.

00:30:18.795 --> 00:30:19.670
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.740
For Python this would
be a dictionary, right?

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.650
So how much total
space does this take?

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.477
AUDIENCE: The number of nodes?

00:30:28.477 --> 00:30:29.560
PROFESSOR: The number of--

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.049
AUDIENCE: --nodes.

00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:32.483
Well, then there's also the
space you made for the list,

00:30:32.483 --> 00:30:32.983
though.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.960
PROFESSOR: If these were
actual slots in an array--

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.840
so this would be an array-- I
would have the number of nodes.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.340
You're giving away the
answer to my next question.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.760
So I have these slots here.

00:30:48.142 --> 00:30:49.100
This would be an array.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.477
It's order V just to store this.

00:30:51.477 --> 00:30:53.810
The thing in Python is that
have these dictionaries that

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.850
are fancy hashes where
they grow as you need them.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.880
For example, you
have 10,000 vertices

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.700
but you don't have any edge.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.400
Your dictionary size is going
to be order 1 because it only

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.854
grows as you add edges to it.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.220
So this is assuming that
I don't store empty lists.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.430
If I have a stray
node here, if I

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:20.320
have a node I-- say this is
I-- if I don't store anything,

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.600
I don't have to pay for it.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.020
If I store an empty list here,
then I have to pay for it.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:29.080
There is an order V
component that you mentioned.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.040
AUDIENCE: Let's say, if
there's a graph there,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.470
everything is not connected
so there are a bunch of words

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:35.450
instead.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.362
Then in that case it
would be order V, right?

00:31:38.362 --> 00:31:40.320
PROFESSOR: It's order V
if we store empty lists

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.212
for the nodes that
don't have edges.

00:31:42.212 --> 00:31:43.116
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:31:43.116 --> 00:31:45.330
And if none of the
nodes have edges,

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:47.009
they're all unconnected--

00:31:47.009 --> 00:31:49.300
PROFESSOR: On the other hand,
if I don't store anything

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.383
for the nodes that don't
have edges, it's order 1.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:59.240
AUDIENCE: If you get no
edges do we do an empty list

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.480
or do we not store it?

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.590
PROFESSOR: Depends
on what you want.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.000
So if we store
empty lists you're

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.560
going to have an
order V cost here.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.460
But your code is going to
be simpler, presumably,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.293
because you don't have
to check if something

00:32:10.293 --> 00:32:12.430
is or isn't in the dictionary.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.040
How about this stuff?

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.164
What's the total size
of this stuff here?

00:32:18.164 --> 00:32:19.086
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:21.547 --> 00:32:22.130
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:28.700
Order E. How many elements
do I have in here in total?

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.940
In this thing here.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:41.008
So what's the sum of
the length of the lists?

00:32:41.008 --> 00:32:45.370
AUDIENCE: Average value of E
times the number of vertices?

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:47.660
PROFESSOR: Let's go
over something else.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.950
AUDIENCE: The degree--

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.825
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:32:49.825 --> 00:32:52.350
That's what I wanted to hear.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.870
A lists its neighbors, right?

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:02.780
The number of neighbors that
A has is the degree of A. B

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:08.350
lists its neighbors, so
this is the degree of B.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:13.550
If you sum up over all of them,
what is the sum of all the

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.750
agrees in the graph?

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.190
AUDIENCE: 2, E.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:21.710
PROFESSOR: 2, E. We
learned about this, right?

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.530
The handshaking
lemma, 2, E. So what

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.070
is the total cost for
storing this data structure?

00:33:32.782 --> 00:33:33.734
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.410
PROFESSOR: So V plus E,
assuming empty lists.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:41.910
Let's look at another
data structure

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:46.510
for storing things in a graph.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.780
So instead of using
lists, let's use a matrix.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:58.730
A, B, C, D, E on top, and
A, B, C, D, E on the left.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.190
Let's pretend our graph is
just that component over there.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.360
Otherwise, it just gets big
and there's no extraneous site.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.254
Does anyone know
how this is called?

00:34:09.254 --> 00:34:10.670
If I put numbers
here, does anyone

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.920
know what this is called?

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.320
AUDIENCE: Is that a matrix?

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.131
PROFESSOR: There's
a fancy name for it.

00:34:18.131 --> 00:34:18.964
It ends with matrix.

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.100
OK.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.790
I don't think we taught
it to you, so don't worry.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:32.560
The fancy name is maybe it's
misspelled, but something

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.820
that looks and sounds like
this., adjacency matrix.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:39.580
Misspelled?

00:34:42.595 --> 00:34:45.836
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:45.836 --> 00:34:48.560
PROFESSOR: I hope
someone will help me.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.820
OK so if this is an
adjacency matrix,

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.179
what should this element
between B and A tell me?

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.134
If it's an adjacency
matrix, it better

00:35:00.134 --> 00:35:01.300
tell me if they're adjacent.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.070
They're adjacent if they
have an edge between them.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.527
For A and B, what
does it happen to be?

00:35:08.527 --> 00:35:09.110
AUDIENCE: One?

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:13.480
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:13.980
A and A?

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:14.563
What do we do?

00:35:17.806 --> 00:35:18.880
AUDIENCE: What with 1?

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.130
It's adjacent to itself.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.880
PROFESSOR: What's
easier for the algorithm

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.473
that you're trying to implement?

00:35:23.473 --> 00:35:24.380
AUDIENCE: 1?

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.004
PROFESSOR: So it
doesn't really matter.

00:35:26.004 --> 00:35:28.140
We use 1's most of the
time, but sometimes it's

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.983
easier to use a 0.

00:35:30.983 --> 00:35:33.388
AUDIENCE: Then you can
get to A from A, right?

00:35:33.388 --> 00:35:34.350
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:35.540
So that's why you'd use a 1.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.415
Sometimes, though, you
don't want to in code.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.870
So someone dictate this to me.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:46.220
Or, everyone dictate this to
me so I know it makes sense.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.726
A and C, is there an
edge between them?

00:35:48.726 --> 00:35:49.700
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.866
PROFESSOR: What do I write?

00:35:50.866 --> 00:35:51.589
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:52.380
PROFESSOR: A and D?

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.772
A and E?

00:35:57.772 --> 00:35:59.930
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:00.778
PROFESSOR: B, A?

00:36:00.778 --> 00:36:03.120
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.164
PROFESSOR: B, C?

00:36:04.164 --> 00:36:06.020
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:06.930
PROFESSOR: B, D?

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.160
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.052
PROFESSOR: The E?

00:36:09.052 --> 00:36:10.440
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.600
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.666
C, A?

00:36:12.666 --> 00:36:13.640
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.035
PROFESSOR: C, B?

00:36:15.035 --> 00:36:16.430
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:17.326
PROFESSOR: C, D?

00:36:17.326 --> 00:36:18.024
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:36:18.024 --> 00:36:18.690
PROFESSOR: C, E?

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.590
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.720
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.290
Now I'm going to
use the bits you

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:27.574
gave me to come to get this.

00:36:27.574 --> 00:36:29.540
Let's see if I can
do it correctly.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.122
And D?

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:33.580
I'm not looking at the graph,
by the way, I'm trusting you.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.204
So you better give
me the right answer.

00:36:35.204 --> 00:36:35.931
D?

00:36:35.931 --> 00:36:36.430
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.510
PROFESSOR: How many
1's do I have in this?

00:36:50.272 --> 00:36:51.549
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:51.549 --> 00:36:53.340
PROFESSOR: To see if
you guys are thinking.

00:36:57.678 --> 00:36:59.124
AUDIENCE: 2, E? [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.507
PROFESSOR: Each edge
contributes to two 1's, right?

00:37:05.507 --> 00:37:07.090
And that accounts
for most of the 1's.

00:37:10.024 --> 00:37:17.530
AUDIENCE: O plus V.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.920
PROFESSOR: So this is
how many 1's I have.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:25.270
How many 0's do I have?

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:28.201
AUDIENCE: V squared
minus 2, E plus V?

00:37:34.222 --> 00:37:35.680
PROFESSOR: This is
a non-boring way

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.289
of asking how many elements
I have in this matrix.

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:39.580
This is what I was looking for.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:47.070
So V columns, right?

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.005
Zeros V squared's
total elements.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.870
How much memory do I
need to store this?

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:55.746
AUDIENCE: V squared.

00:37:55.746 --> 00:37:56.870
PROFESSOR: V squared. what?

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.020
If I want to store it as
compactly as possible?

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.860
I want to pack these
as tight as I can.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.962
AUDIENCE: You mean you need
the entire array arranged?

00:38:06.962 --> 00:38:08.420
PROFESSOR: Yes, so
what do I store?

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.512
V squared what?

00:38:09.512 --> 00:38:10.720
AUDIENCE: Oh, you mean units.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.386
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:11.386 --> 00:38:12.650
What's the unit?

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:13.610
AUDIENCE: 1 bit?

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:14.485
PROFESSOR: All right!

00:38:14.485 --> 00:38:25.460
So V squared bits Whereas,
this is V plus E words

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.070
because you have to store
pointers everywhere here.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.770
So sometimes if your
graph is really dense

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:34.670
you might prefer
this representation.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:42.300
Let me see, how much do I have?

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.070
Oh, plenty of time.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.840
Who remembers
breadth-first search?

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.718
Yes?

00:38:48.718 --> 00:38:51.008
AUDIENCE: Basically you
just start at some node

00:38:51.008 --> 00:38:56.560
and you check all its neighbors,
and check all those neighbors.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.514
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:38:57.514 --> 00:38:59.180
In breadth-first
search we have a graph.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.800
What did I draw there?

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:24.480
A. B, E. So suppose
this is our graph.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.920
And I do a breadth-first
search starting at A.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.910
How does that work?

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:36.687
I started with the list of the
nodes that I'm going to visit.

00:39:36.687 --> 00:39:39.020
I initialization it with A
because this is the only node

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.075
that I know about.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.100
What happens next?

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.885
AUDIENCE: It goes with B and C.

00:39:49.885 --> 00:39:50.760
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.200
So I take out of the list
the first thing that I can.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.900
This is my current node.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.540
You said I visit B and C
because they're the neighbors.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.040
Right.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:06.130
I took A out of the list.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:07.460
A was definitely visited.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:12.350
And I'm visiting B and C. What
do I do when I visit them?

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:13.812
AUDIENCE: Put them in the list.

00:40:13.812 --> 00:40:15.145
PROFESSOR: Put them in the list.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:21.420
This means I discovered them and
I'm going to visit the later.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.590
So I discovered them and
I know of their existence.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.725
What happens next?

00:40:26.725 --> 00:40:29.320
AUDIENCE: Check if
B is what you want.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:35.078
PROFESSOR: So B gets out of
the list, and what do I do?

00:40:35.078 --> 00:40:36.950
AUDIENCE: Discover
it's neighbors.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.700
PROFESSOR: All right,
so its neighborhoods

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.552
are A, B, and E. What Now?

00:40:41.552 --> 00:40:42.926
AUDIENCE: If they
haven't already

00:40:42.926 --> 00:40:46.241
been on that list then
add a [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:46.241 --> 00:40:47.615
PROFESSOR: A was
already visited.

00:40:47.615 --> 00:40:48.845
D and E weren't.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:58.350
D and E, then what happens?

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:01.944
AUDIENCE: Then you
check C's neighbors.

00:41:01.944 --> 00:41:03.860
PROFESSOR: Any neighbor's
that I haven't seen?

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.320
Nope.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.548
Then?

00:41:06.548 --> 00:41:07.820
AUDIENCE: D?

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.708
AUDIENCE: D and?

00:41:09.708 --> 00:41:11.829
AUDIENCE: E.

00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:12.370
PROFESSOR:OK.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.596
And then?

00:41:14.596 --> 00:41:16.137
PROFESSOR: I guess
you could go to F,

00:41:16.137 --> 00:41:18.492
but it's not
connected to anything.

00:41:18.492 --> 00:41:20.344
But how did you
get A then, right?

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:21.760
PROFESSOR: So A
is the first node.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.300
I started with A
because I said I'm

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.200
doing a breadth-first
search starting from A.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.490
So BFS starts from somewhere.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.110
A BFS has a source.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.270
We'll see why that
matters in a bit.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:36.166
So you ever get to see F?

00:41:36.166 --> 00:41:37.000
AUDIENCE: No.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.666
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.170
So if I start at A what
are the nodes that I visit

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.920
and what are the nodes
that I don't visit?

00:41:47.609 --> 00:41:50.150
AUDIENCE: Well you visit all
the ones in the connected graph.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:52.410
PROFESSOR: All right, in
the connected component.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.785
So the whole graph can be
connected or not connected.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.520
The nodes that I
visit are the nodes

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.190
in A's connected component
because, by definition, those

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.680
are the nodes that
I can reach from A.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.230
If I have many kind
of the components

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.260
and I use BFS starting
from one node,

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.160
I might not visit
the entire graph.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.260
How do I keep track of what
node that I've discovered

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.294
and haven't discovered?

00:42:18.294 --> 00:42:20.460
What data structure do I
use for these smiley faces?

00:42:27.428 --> 00:42:29.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.950
PROFESSOR:So for
the smiley faces.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:33.376
For this thing I
probably want a queue.

00:42:33.376 --> 00:42:34.750
We'd teach you
something simpler,

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.680
but most of the time when
you write the code you

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.620
actually use queue.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.730
What do I want for
the smiley faces?

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:45.006
When I pull a node out,
say I pulled out B,

00:42:45.006 --> 00:42:48.940
and I see A, D, E, I want
to know that I visited A

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.490
and I didn't visit the D
and E. You guys remember

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:54.420
that we didn't visit D and E,
right, by the time we got to 2?

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.190
OK.

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.560
So I want to be able to check
whether I visited a node

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.990
or not really fast.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:02.294
What data structure should
I use for the smileys?

00:43:02.294 --> 00:43:03.482
AUDIENCE: A hash table.

00:43:03.482 --> 00:43:04.440
PROFESSOR: A has table.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:04.939
Cool.

00:43:04.939 --> 00:43:07.404
What's a hash table in Python?

00:43:07.404 --> 00:43:08.707
AUDIENCE: A dictionary.

00:43:08.707 --> 00:43:09.707
PROFESSOR: A dictionary.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:16.140
All right, so this is
going to be a seen, which

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:22.060
is a dictionary, and it
maps vertices to maybe true.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:28.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:28.960
PROFESSOR:Yep.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.157
Python has a set, right?

00:43:30.157 --> 00:43:30.990
So you can use that.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:40.230
The smileys needs to be
some sort of a dictionary.

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.510
So given that, and
assuming that this

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:46.375
is a queue that we
can extract and you

00:43:46.375 --> 00:43:48.506
can start from in
constant time, what

00:43:48.506 --> 00:43:49.630
is the running time of BFS?

00:43:52.906 --> 00:43:53.780
Let's make life easy.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.900
Let's assume the graph is
connected and let's assume just

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:56.660
doesn't exist.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.515
BFS was the running time.

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:09.014
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] visiting.

00:44:09.014 --> 00:44:10.680
PROFESSOR: So you
visit every node once,

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.030
so it's at least
V. That's a start.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.774
Now what do you do when
you visit the node?

00:44:15.774 --> 00:44:17.690
AUDIENCE: Check out all the--

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.740
PROFESSOR: All the
neighbors, right?

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.930
Given the node, you have
to go to the data structure

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:24.250
that you have that's
either this or this,

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.150
and you have to get
a list of neighbors.

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:29.700
If I have this data
structure, how fast

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.930
do I get a list of
neighbors for a node?

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:34.185
AUDIENCE: Order of the degree?

00:44:34.185 --> 00:44:34.810
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:36.160
Order of the degree of the node.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:36.810
That's good.

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:38.300
How about this data structure?

00:44:43.701 --> 00:44:46.660
AUDIENCE: Same-- oh,
no that's order of V.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.510
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.900
So in this data structure,
for example, C only

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:55.020
has two edges coming out of it.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.540
But I have to go through the
entire lining of the matrix

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.130
to see where I have my 0's
and where I have my 1's.

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:04.890
In order to list the neighbors,
here is straight up order V,

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:11.420
whereas this is order of
the degree of the node

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.020
that I'm looking for.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.229
So for this, where it's
nice and simple, order of V,

00:45:17.229 --> 00:45:18.520
what is the total running time?

00:45:22.384 --> 00:45:25.040
AUDIENCE: Wait, because
it's B plus B. Oh no, it's

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.230
the same one.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.860
PROFESSOR: So for
each node I have to?

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:29.707
AUDIENCE: V squared.

00:45:29.707 --> 00:45:30.290
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.950
So we're up to V
squared already.

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:38.195
What else do we need to do?

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.265
Anything that they need to
do on a node is order of V,

00:45:45.265 --> 00:45:47.390
so V squared is going to
be the total running time.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:48.590
That's it.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:51.980
So if we use an
adjacency matrix we

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:56.340
get order of V squared as
the total running time.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.655
What about if we lists,
what the running time?

00:45:59.655 --> 00:46:00.530
I'll give you a hint.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:03.140
You have to use
amortized analysis.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.230
Shivers anyone?

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.574
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:07.574 --> 00:46:08.990
We know it's order
V because we're

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:11.350
going to visit every node.

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:14.139
And you guys didn't see what
I was going to write here.

00:46:14.139 --> 00:46:15.361
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:15.361 --> 00:46:15.860
OK.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.270
So for every node I go
through the neighbors

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.660
and I do something to them.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:20.160
Right?

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.490
I check if they're in
seen, if not then I

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:25.820
add them to the list.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.814
So for every node the work is?

00:46:29.814 --> 00:46:31.620
AUDIENCE: it's degrees.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.940
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.416
So if I look at all the nodes?

00:46:35.416 --> 00:46:37.035
AUDIENCE: That's E.

00:46:37.035 --> 00:46:37.660
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.180
For every node I have
to look at its neighbors

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.407
and I have to see which
neighbors are in seen.

00:46:45.407 --> 00:46:46.990
For the neighbors
that are not in seen

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:50.890
I have to add to my queue.

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.230
Checking if a neighbor is
in seen or not is order 1.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.620
Adding it to the
queue is order 1.

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.430
So the total work
for a node is order

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:04.390
of neighbors because of the
adjacency list, not matrix.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:06.590
If I look at the
entire graph, here I

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.641
can't do a local analysis
like I did before.

00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:11.015
If I look at the entire graph
and I look at all the nodes

00:47:11.015 --> 00:47:14.740
slash vertices,
then the total work

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.490
is the sum of their degrees.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.670
For each node is degree.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:19.920
For total work,
sum of the degrees.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.503
And I have that nice
handshaking lemma

00:47:21.503 --> 00:47:24.550
that says that the sum
of the degrees is 2,

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.610
E. So order E. So
total running time?

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:32.860
V plus E.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.030
OK, can I say that the
running time is order E?

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.966
With no V's?

00:47:38.966 --> 00:47:41.007
AUDIENCE: No, because you
have to look at every--

00:47:44.935 --> 00:47:46.382
PROFESSOR: Is it?

00:47:46.382 --> 00:47:47.881
AUDIENCE: V greater
than [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:47.881 --> 00:47:50.724
in case of not
connected components?

00:47:50.724 --> 00:47:51.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:01.548 --> 00:48:03.131
AUDIENCE: It's
possible that you could

00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:06.887
have more vertices than edges--

00:48:06.887 --> 00:48:07.470
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:10.920
So it's possible that I have
more vertices than edges.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.220
I agree with that, but I
do anything to the vertices

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.080
that I haven't seen?

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.081
So this is subtle.

00:48:26.081 --> 00:48:28.860
The difference
between this and this

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.770
is a matter of how you
implement everything.

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:34.980
In CLRS they assume that
the seen is an array.

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:38.220
So all of their nodes
have numbers from 1 to V.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.740
So then they initialize an
array, everything is false,

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.880
and then they set
the true elements.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.255
In Python we can
use a dictionary

00:48:44.255 --> 00:48:47.010
and not initialize
it with anything.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.750
So if you do it that way in
Python and code carefully,

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:53.320
you can get to order E.
The parts of the graph

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.930
that you don't discover, you
don't have to pay for them.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.010
If you look at CLRS
code, it is definitely

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:02.210
V plus E. The difference
between this and this

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:04.850
depends on the code.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:07.000
What's the point
of BFS, by the way?

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:07.740
Why do we care?

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.850
What does it give us?

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.870
AUDIENCE: The
shortest word path.

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:19.105
PROFESSOR:The shortest
path from point?

00:49:19.105 --> 00:49:22.450
AUDIENCE: From your start
to where you're going.

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:26.650
PROFESSOR:So it gives you the
shortest path from the node

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:29.610
that I'm starting the BFS from.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:32.590
So only from this node?

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:34.630
If I start BFS at A
it's going to give me

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:38.140
the length of the shortest
path from A to which node?

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:44.209
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:44.209 --> 00:49:45.250
PROFESSOR: All the nodes?

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:45.995
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:45.995 --> 00:49:47.370
PROFESSOR: All
the nodes that are

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:51.450
visited by BFS are reachable
and we have a path from them.

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.860
How do you compute
this distance?

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:57.004
Let's see, so what's the
distance from A to A?

00:49:57.004 --> 00:49:57.729
AUDIENCE: 0?

00:49:57.729 --> 00:49:58.270
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.750
When I start from A and I see
that its neighbors are B and C,

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:08.323
what's the distance from
A to B and from A to C?

00:50:08.323 --> 00:50:09.239
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:11.737 --> 00:50:12.320
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.950
Now I look at B. What's the
distance between A and A?

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:19.694
A is B's neighbor.

00:50:19.694 --> 00:50:20.854
AUDIENCE: With A and A?

00:50:20.854 --> 00:50:21.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.630
So I have three neighbors.

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:26.400
B has three neighbors,
A, D, and E.

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:35.310
So I care about the distances
between A and A, D, E. Distance

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:44.230
A, A, distance A, D, and
distance A, E. This one is 0.

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:48.620
How about the distances
between A and D and A and E?

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.350
They're 2.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:55.375
So the way I would
compute these distances

00:50:55.375 --> 00:50:57.910
is that I start with A being 0.

00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:59.830
The distance from A to A is 0.

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:03.120
And then when I look at a node,
when I discover the neighbors,

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.520
all the neighbors that don't
have smiley faces on them

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.107
get the node's distance plus 1.

00:51:08.107 --> 00:51:10.190
You can get to them by
getting in the current node

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:12.740
and then traversing an edge.

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.150
When you do that it's
important that you don't update

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:17.340
the distances of the nodes
that have smiley faces.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.840
If you do, you're going to say
that the distance from A to A

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.890
is 2 and all hell
breaks lose from there.

00:51:25.521 --> 00:51:27.520
AUDIENCE: Wait, why would
you say it would be 2?

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.820
PROFESSOR: If I forget the
fact that it has a smiley face.

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.360
So if I go through
all these neighbors

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.140
and I say the
distance from A to B

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.180
is one then the distance from
A to all of B's neighbors

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.330
has to be 2.

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:43.004
That would be wrong.

00:51:43.004 --> 00:51:44.420
AUDIENCE: Wait,
from A to all of--

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.500
PROFESSOR: B's neighbors.

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.750
AUDIENCE: From A to all of--
Oh, because A is one Of--

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:49.862
PROFESSOR: B's neighbors.

00:51:49.862 --> 00:51:51.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah OK.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.910
PROFESSOR: The
smileys tell me which

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:56.350
vertices I've already
seen and I've already,

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:58.450
presumably computed
distances for them.

00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:01.960
We don't want to update those.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.230
OK this is BFS in essence.

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:05.960
One question.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.130
Between Facebook and
Twitter, which one's directed

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:09.255
and which one's undirected?

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:15.020
AUDIENCE: Facebook
is undirected.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:15.920
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:23.970
Facebook is undirected.

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:27.662
Why is it undirected?

00:52:27.662 --> 00:52:28.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:29.606
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:36.050
AUDIENCE: When you follow
someone they don't necessarily

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:37.177
follow you.

00:52:37.177 --> 00:52:37.760
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.843
So this is Twitter, right?

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:49.430
Twitter, directed
because of follows.

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:50.980
Has anyone used
Facebook recently?

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.460
Did you guys see
there's a new option?

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.440
AUDIENCE: The little
scroll bar on the side?

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.700
PROFESSOR: Subscribers.

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.170
AUDIENCE: Oh, ya.

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:01.455
PROFESSOR: OK, so how
do subscribers work?

00:53:01.455 --> 00:53:02.455
AUDIENCE: You subscribe.

00:53:02.455 --> 00:53:04.395
It's like google plus.

00:53:04.395 --> 00:53:05.337
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:05.337 --> 00:53:05.920
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.220
Directed are undirected?

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:10.231
If I subscribe to you do
you have to subscribe to me?

00:53:10.231 --> 00:53:11.022
AUDIENCE: Directed.

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:22.671
PROFESSOR: So which one is it?

00:53:22.671 --> 00:53:24.754
AUDIENCE: I guess Facebook
is kind of directed now

00:53:24.754 --> 00:53:28.210
because you can
unsubscribe from people.

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:30.410
PROFESSOR: Is it?

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:33.320
So Facebook has
two graphs in it.

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.020
They happen to have
the same vertices.

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.740
The people are the
vertices in both graphs.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:43.350
But the friends relationship
defines an undirected graph.

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.750
The subscribers relationship
defines a directed graph.

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:48.499
The graphs are
completely different.

00:53:48.499 --> 00:53:49.540
And there are two graphs.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.364
That's the right way
to reason about them.

00:53:52.364 --> 00:53:53.780
that's why it was
slightly tricky.

00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.180
Can someone think of a cool
way to use BFS on Facebook?

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:05.124
AUDIENCE: That's
networks, right?

00:54:05.124 --> 00:54:07.290
Figuring out how many people
are in the first degree

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:09.260
or second degree.

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:10.632
MySpace was really into that.

00:54:10.632 --> 00:54:12.340
PROFESSOR: Lincoln
also does that, right?

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:13.721
How many people
are your friends?

00:54:13.721 --> 00:54:15.470
How many people are
your friend's friends?

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.730
So and so forth.

00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:21.486
Now suppose you want to
get to someone in Facebook

00:54:21.486 --> 00:54:22.860
and you don't know
them directly.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.190
They're not your friends.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.170
Presumably, you
want to get to them

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:29.240
through the minimum
amount of effort.

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.610
So you want to see do you
have a friend that knows them?

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:34.010
If not, do you
have a friend that

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:35.130
knows a friend that knows them?

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:36.590
Do you have a friend
that knows a friend that

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:37.881
knows a friend that knows them?

00:54:37.881 --> 00:54:38.780
So and so forth.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.957
So BFS will give you
that minimum path.

00:54:43.711 --> 00:54:44.210
OK.

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:46.144
do the graphs make sense?

00:54:46.144 --> 00:54:47.560
So by the way, the
BFS on Facebook

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.150
is just the beginning
of a ton of cool things

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:51.833
you can with graph algorithms.
