00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.800
PROFESSOR: We're going to
cover hashing next time.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.580
Now we're Going to
focus on pset three

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.880
because I heard
pset three is hard

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.216
so we're going to look at the
code and try to understand it.

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:33.560
AUDIENCE: This course is hard.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.143
PROFESSOR: I've tried
to make it easy.

00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:36.040
I really tried.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.410
How many people
recognize the code?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.220
Does this look familiar?

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.950
One, two, three.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.190
Everyone else got
stuck on question one?

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.600
I'm not going to give you
the answers to the psets.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.310
We are going to--

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.530
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.370
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.382
We're going to look at
the code and understand

00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:56.590
what it does because once
you understand what it does

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.270
you can understand
how to modify it.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.444
All right, before I do
that, any questions?

00:01:02.444 --> 00:01:04.069
And I might not answer
them right away,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:08.190
but I will keep them in mind
while I go through the code.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.333
Are there any
specific pin-points.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.550
AUDIENCE: The types.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.410
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.520
Covered in five minutes.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.010
Oh well.

00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:30.280
The first thing that
I want to talk about

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.151
is sweep line algorithms.

00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:35.400
We're asking you to implement
the sweep line algorithm

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.140
and we're giving you one
that is horribly inefficient.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.660
Suppose you have some line
segments that look like this.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.530
Sorry, drawing isn't.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.920
They look like this.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.842
And suppose you want to find
the intersections between them.

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:07.730
Now let's figure out
what the algorithm

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.740
that we gave you does.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.400
Did people look at
the trace for that?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.000
Not the good trace, the trace
that's output by the algorithm

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.620
that we gave you.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.598
Does anyone understand
what that does.

00:02:21.598 --> 00:02:23.445
AUDIENCE: I kind of get it.

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:24.028
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:26.444
AUDIENCE: I think what it does
is it just hits through all

00:02:26.444 --> 00:02:29.464
the horizontal lines and it goes
through all the vertical ones.

00:02:29.464 --> 00:02:31.380
First it goes through
all the horizontal lines

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.890
and what does it do with them?

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.020
PROFESSOR: They get bolded
in the visualizer which

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.780
means they're added
to the range index.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.060
So one, add all the
horizontal lines.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.020
And two-- oh you said it goes
through all the vertical lines

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.220
after that.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.306
Any idea what it does?

00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:54.260
AUDIENCE: It looks
for intersections.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.290
PROFESSOR: When he looks
at a vertical line segment

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.990
you'll see some blue
square and you'll

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.800
see some segments
that are green.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.130
This is a query
to the range index

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.710
and the green segments
are the answers

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.516
and the blue square is
the range that's queried.

00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:15.390
First add all the segments
to the range index

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.470
and then do a query.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.420
In principle sweep
line algorithms

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.740
have some geometric inputs.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.790
For example, a bunch of lines.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.610
And conceptually they
have this vertical line

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.990
that they sweep across the plane
all the way from minus infinity

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.870
to plus infinity.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.800
Now if you try to sweep
a line continuously

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.830
from minus infinity to
plus infinity in code

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.800
it might take forever.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.450
We don't really do it that way.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.182
The way we do it
in code is you know

00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:48.910
when something interesting
is going to happen

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.640
and you only simulate what
happens to the sweep line

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.730
at that point.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.760
In this case the sweep line
starts at minus infinity

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.540
and then all the
horizontal segments

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.890
are added to our range index.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.420
And then as the sweep line
goes across the plane, when

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.010
it hits a vertical
segment a query happens.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.165
The only times when
the sweep line stops

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:18.360
is first, at the beginning to
add all the horizontal line

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.920
segments, and then every time
it hits a vertical line segment.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.020
We know this ahead
of time so we can

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.790
compute a list of
all these coordinates

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.670
of interesting things.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.920
And then we can sort them
and then go through them

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.990
and simulate the behavior
of the sweep line that way.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.260
If you look at the code
listing at events from there,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.660
this is the gist of it.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.260
This is what it does.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.790
It compiles a list of events.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.780
The first key in each
event is the x, is that x?

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.610
Yeah. x like this, y like this.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.230
The first case, the
x-coordinate of an event

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.260
and by sorting
that list of events

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.600
it will then process
them in order.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.490
Events from there is responsible
for looking at all the wires

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.420
and compiling events.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.990
How does an event for a
horizontal layer look like?

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.480
Can anyone tell me?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.435
Sorry, for a horizontal wire.

00:05:15.435 --> 00:05:17.143
AUDIENCE: It will run
across [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.330
PROFESSOR: First off it
looks like a list, right?

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.150
It's a regular python list.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.360
And I will try to call it vector
so that we don't confuse it

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.830
with a big list
of all the events.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.610
You said the first thing
is the leftmost point.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.860
Right?

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.990
If this segment, for
example, starts at minus 100,

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.680
this one starts at minus 95,
this one starts at minus 90,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.890
and this one starts at minus
50, by the way not to scale,

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.535
then the leftmost
point is minus 100.

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:54.110
Right?

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.230
This is the first
element in the vector.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.795
And that's computed
on line four where

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:02.170
it goes through
all the segments,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.200
looks at all the X-coordinates
and chooses the minimum.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.227
What's the next
thing in the vector?

00:06:09.227 --> 00:06:10.560
We don't have to understand why.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.180
We'll go through why in a bit.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.656
I'm just interested in what?

00:06:14.656 --> 00:06:15.280
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.946
PROFESSOR: Zero.

00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:17.440
Excellent.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.190
PROFESSOR: After that
there is a wire ID.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.540
Each wire gets a unique ID,
that's a number between zero

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.140
and the number of wires.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.790
Say this is one, two, three.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.760
This is going to be one.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.780
And then I have the string add.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.510
And then I have the
actual wire object.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.270
What does the vector look
like for a query event?

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.032
Sorry, what does it look
like for a vertical wire?

00:06:49.032 --> 00:06:50.490
I'm giving away
some of the answer.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.320
Bad, bad, bad.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.690
All right, vertical wire,
look at the code and.

00:07:03.157 --> 00:07:06.312
AUDIENCE: It keeps
the left [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:06.312 --> 00:07:07.270
PROFESSOR: Of the wire.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.050
OK.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.379
And?

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:11.378
AUDIENCE: It keeps the
x-coordinate [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:16.960
PROFESSOR: A vertical wire will
have the same X-coordinates

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.543
for all the points
on the wire, right?

00:07:18.543 --> 00:07:21.380
I don't really worry about
which coordinate it is.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.320
This wire is at minus 50.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.430
The first element here
is going to be minus 50.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.329
What's next?

00:07:29.329 --> 00:07:30.720
AUDIENCE: A 1.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.270
PROFESSOR: A 1.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.080
OK.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.600
And suppose this is wire ID 4.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.530
I'm going to have 4.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.450
AUDIENCE: Query.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.604
PROFESSOR: Query.

00:07:42.604 --> 00:07:45.160
AUDIENCE: And the wire.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160
PROFESSOR: And the wire.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.250
All right, what happens with
these in the init method, which

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.330
is not shown in
the code listing,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:01.750
is after the list is put
together sort is called on it.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.980
These are all compared
and then reordered

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.520
to be sorted according to
some ordering relationship.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.700
Does anyone know what
the ordering relationship

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.667
is for Python lists?

00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:16.134
Yeah.

00:08:16.134 --> 00:08:18.579
AUDIENCE: It starts from
the first, from zero,

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:24.367
and the next it goes to
sort the same with as X 1.

00:08:24.367 --> 00:08:24.950
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:33.645
Say if I have 1,
2, 3 and 1, 3, 2.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.950
Sorry, and 2, 1, 2.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.870
He's going to look
at the first element

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.340
and if they are different
than the one with the smaller

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.020
element is smaller.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.270
1, 2, 3 as a vector,
sorry, as a list,

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.470
is smaller than
2, 1, 2 as a list.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.430
If this guy becomes
one then they're equal.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.280
Then it has to go
to the next element,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.030
compare them and see if
they're different we have

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.460
an answer, if not
we have to keep

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.090
going all the way until
the end of the list.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.170
This is called
lexicographic comparison

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.730
and this is the same ordering
that you have for the words

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.420
in a dictionary.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.040
Right, if you think
of each letter

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.450
as an element in a list
and the word is the list

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.820
then this is how you look
up words in a dictionary.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.850
The reason events
look like this is

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.210
so that sort would output
them in the right order

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.150
for the next state.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.911
So, yes.

00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:38.994
AUDIENCE: Does that mean
all the horizontal wires,

00:09:38.994 --> 00:09:41.683
does that mean that they start
at same place even though that

00:09:41.683 --> 00:09:42.806
they don't?

00:09:42.806 --> 00:09:43.430
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.700
all the horizontal
wires will be sorted.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.850
All these add events will be
sorted before the query events.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.080
Yup, very good observation.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.990
This is what I'm
trying to achieve.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.405
That's why I have this
special value here.

00:09:56.405 --> 00:09:58.280
I go through some extra
effort to compute it.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.780
I had to write an
extra line of code

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.894
so this is the
motivation for it.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.730
The first key in the
vector is the X element

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.788
on the sweep line.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.370
I could've also had the
very large negative value

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.000
that something that would
behave like minus infinity here

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.790
and that would
work just as well.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.920
By computing the left edge I
don't have to deal with that.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.320
I don't have to worry of
whether my negative infinity is

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.390
small enough, because if
it's not I will fail the test

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.380
and that's bad.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.340
This is the x-coordinate at
which the sweep line stops

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.340
and something happens.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.630
So if all the events are
different the x-coordinates

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.390
then I have my
ordering, I'm done.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.220
Now what if I have two
events at the same time?

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.800
For example, what if I
have two vertical wires?

00:10:54.551 --> 00:10:56.300
The x-coordinates are
going to be the same

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.040
so I need to use something
else to break the ties, right?

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.920
The first thing that I
use to break the ties

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.120
is all add events
have a zero here

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.530
and all the query
events have a one.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.720
And the point of
that is if I have

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.350
two events at the
same x-coordinate,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.940
if I have a query
and an add, I want

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.300
the add to happen
before the query.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.780
If this is the
same this is going

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.630
to be different for
ad versus query.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.250
Does that make sense?

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.610
This is how we order
events relatively

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.770
to each other on the same line.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.010
Now suppose I have
these two wires,

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.470
they're both vertical so they're
both going to be queries.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.270
They're both at the same index.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.520
I need something else, and
that other thing that I have

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.370
is the wire ID which is
guaranteed to be unique.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.620
I know for sure the
comparison will stop here.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.410
And the comparison
had better stop here

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.290
because if the comparison
gets all the way to here,

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.740
wires aren't comparable so
the code is going to crash.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.130
It stops here because the IDs
are unique, everyone is happy.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.650
All right, do the events
make more sense now?

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.180
To complete the
picture if you look

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.360
at compute crossings,
lines nine and ten.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.740
Line nine goes through
the vector-- sorry,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.340
goes through the list of
events that have been sorted

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.750
and processes them
in order so sort

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.480
had better do the right job.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.135
And then it extracts the
x-coordinate, that's here,

00:12:27.135 --> 00:12:30.120
it extracts the event
type, that's here,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.804
and then it extracts
the wire from here.

00:12:32.804 --> 00:12:35.220
These guys really are just
there to help with the sorting,

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.356
they're never read afterwards.

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:39.230
AUDIENCE: Where are the
events actually sort?

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.110
I thought they just
put into order.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:47.135
PROFESSOR: The events are
sorted in an init method that's

00:12:47.135 --> 00:12:47.635
not here.

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.990
It's in the piece of
code but it's not here.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.741
And that may be a hint that
you don't want to change it.

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:55.740
As in you don't need to.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.790
All right, events
look like this.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.480
Any questions about events?

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.639
Everything make sense?

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:12.930
Presumably when you write
your own sweep line algorithm

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.347
you're going to come up
with your own events which

00:13:16.347 --> 00:13:17.430
are going to be different.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.830
You're going to change
these methods to add

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.564
your own events to the list.

00:13:22.564 --> 00:13:24.230
And then it's going
to be sorted for you

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.072
and then you're going to change
compute crossings to process

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:29.280
your events in the way that
they should be processed.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.540
Let's look at the range index.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.995
What do we store
in a range index?

00:13:44.745 --> 00:13:47.304
AUDIENCE: The horizontal wires.

00:13:47.304 --> 00:13:48.470
PROFESSOR: Horizontal wires.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:49.380
Very good.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.070
What's the point of storing
horizontal wires in an index?

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.920
AUDIENCE: That's when
you want to query,

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.820
the area has a line through it.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.890
PROFESSOR: For the
algorithm that we gave you

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.590
how does a query look like?

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:10.070
Suppose I have this wire here
and I'm doing a query for it.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.395
AUDIENCE: Just ask to
list horizontal wires that

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:17.670
are between that Y.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.020
PROFESSOR: Between this guy's
top and this guy's bottom.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:20.520
Right?

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.936
PROFESSOR: A query
would look like this.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.760
Basically all the
horizontal wires

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.450
that have their y-coordinates
between this guy and this guy.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.510
Now if I have a wire that's
way up here or way down here

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.490
I know for sure that it's not
going to intersect this wire.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.990
Right?

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.680
I don't care about it.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.400
The range index helps
me eliminate some wires.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.840
Now, will the range index
eliminate all the wires

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.020
that don't intersect
with this wire?

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.790
No, OK.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.080
Why not?

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.636
AUDIENCE: Well in
this code it doesn't.

00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:06.260
PROFESSOR: OK, in
this code it doesn't.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.718
We're only talking
about this code,

00:15:07.718 --> 00:15:09.360
I'm not talking about
the solution code

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.478
that you guys have to implement.

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:15.852
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
because it never

00:15:15.852 --> 00:15:18.750
removes the horizontal wires.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.420
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:27.880
What's an example of a
query that would give me

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.095
some wires that don't
intersect my wire?

00:15:32.095 --> 00:15:35.065
AUDIENCE: Like if they're
in between the y-axis,

00:15:35.065 --> 00:15:38.287
they're, yeah but
they're not actually.

00:15:38.287 --> 00:15:38.870
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.709
So you mean.

00:15:40.709 --> 00:15:41.334
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:43.974 --> 00:15:46.224
AUDIENCE: Negative infinity
and infinity on the x-axis

00:15:46.224 --> 00:15:49.633
would give you a bunch of
wires and not many of them

00:15:49.633 --> 00:15:52.555
will intersect with
the vertical wires.

00:15:52.555 --> 00:15:55.477
AUDIENCE: If the end were a
vertical wire, [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:59.870
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.580
I understood this because
it matches what I drew.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.910
I didn't understand the
minus infinity plus infinity.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.120
AUDIENCE: Well if you think
about the x-axis on the bottom,

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.722
if you go from all the way
on the left to all the way

00:16:09.722 --> 00:16:12.400
on the right you're going to get
a whole bunch of wires that are

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.100
short that--

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.350
PROFESSOR: Are you
talking about one wire

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.880
that's like that, or many?

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.260
AUDIENCE: If you're grabbing
from your range index.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:28.940
PROFESSOR: The range index
has horizontal wires in it.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.238
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:16:31.238 --> 00:16:34.099
AUDIENCE: Are you assuming
that they're all short?

00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:34.682
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:34.682 --> 00:16:36.650
But it's not necessarily true.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.140
Some of them will be short.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.730
PROFESSOR: You're saying a lot
of short horizontal lines--

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:41.845
you mean like this, right?

00:16:41.845 --> 00:16:42.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.860
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.300
That's what you mean.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.146
AUDIENCE: You have
one intersection and--

00:16:46.146 --> 00:16:47.155
PROFESSOR: A ton of
non-intersections.

00:16:47.155 --> 00:16:47.520
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.080
PROFESSOR: OK, cool.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.580
Thank you.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.460
Doing a range query
on this can give me

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.680
a lot of false positives.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.620
That's why after
I get them I have

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.660
to make sure that
they intersect and I

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.830
can't just blindly output them.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:07.160
These are bad false positives,
these are bad false positive.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.650
Now let's look at how
the range index works.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.492
Can anyone remind me of
what the range index does?

00:17:13.492 --> 00:17:14.700
It's a data structure, right?

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.099
And it has some operations.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:17.390
What are the operations for it?

00:17:25.636 --> 00:17:27.761
AUDIENCE: It returns
everything between two values.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.310
PROFESSOR: You have a list
operation where you give it

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:38.770
two values and it will return
everything inside the index,

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:44.250
in the interval between
those two values.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.720
What else can I do?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.950
AUDIENCE: It can also
tell you how many.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.770
It returns those keys
and how many there are.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.470
PROFESSOR: I have
the count and you

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.330
said that I have some
things in the index.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:03.830
Right?

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.910
How do I get them in there?

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.494
These are queries,
I need updates.

00:18:08.494 --> 00:18:09.535
AUDIENCE: Add and remove.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.820
PROFESSOR: For the code
that they gave you,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.190
what is the running time for
each of these operations?

00:18:30.946 --> 00:18:35.287
AUDIENCE: It would be
constant had to be removed.

00:18:35.287 --> 00:18:35.870
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:36.731
Add calls the pend.

00:18:36.731 --> 00:18:37.230
Right?

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.680
So that is constant.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.810
I will agree there.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.215
AUDIENCE: To remove it you
had to shift everything.

00:18:44.215 --> 00:18:44.840
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.530
Let's start with an example.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.344
Say I have these keys
in my range index.

00:18:54.344 --> 00:18:55.320
5, 8, 11, 13.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.260
Suppose they're magically
inserted in this order.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.570
If I want to remove two,
since this is an array

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.377
I have to shift
everything to the left.

00:19:07.377 --> 00:19:07.960
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.835
PROFESSOR: So that's.

00:19:08.835 --> 00:19:10.540
AUDIENCE: Order and time.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.140
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.298
How about list and counts?

00:19:24.022 --> 00:19:25.480
What's the running
time for counts?

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.532
How does count work?

00:19:28.532 --> 00:19:31.500
AUDIENCE: It's not just
through all of the keys.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.570
PROFESSOR: Count goes
through everything and--

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.650
AUDIENCE: It has to
be order [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.680
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.430
Count goes through all
the keys, evaluates

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.460
the predicate that checks
whether they're in the range

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.860
and then it adds up one to
the sum for the right place.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.610
How about list?

00:19:49.604 --> 00:19:51.919
AUDIENCE: Also [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:53.710
PROFESSOR: OK, that's
a list comprehension.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.687
The code is a bit tricky,
but it pretty much

00:19:55.687 --> 00:19:56.520
does the same thing.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.100
It goes through the list
and it puts all the keys

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.214
that are in the
interval in the list.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.570
Now let's look at
another version

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.720
on the next page of our range
index that is slightly better.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.350
What's the rapid
variance for this?

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:18.554
How is it different
from the first one?

00:20:18.554 --> 00:20:20.207
AUDIENCE: Sorted already.

00:20:20.207 --> 00:20:21.290
PROFESSOR: Sorted already.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.190
Very good.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.778
The keys look exactly like this.

00:20:25.778 --> 00:20:26.278
Right?

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:33.678
What is the running time for--
let's start with add or remove,

00:20:33.678 --> 00:20:35.998
what's the running time
for add and remove?

00:20:35.998 --> 00:20:37.860
AUDIENCE: N, order of N.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.508
PROFESSOR: Why is it order of N?

00:20:40.508 --> 00:20:42.410
AUDIENCE: No, oder log N.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.098
PROFESSOR: Why is
it order log N.

00:20:44.098 --> 00:20:46.912
AUDIENCE: Because if it's sorted
you can look in the middle

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.930
and do a binary search.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.810
PROFESSOR: I can do a
binary search in order

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.351
to find out where
I insert something.

00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:54.240
Right?

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.990
But what if I want to
insert zero in this?

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.726
AUDIENCE: Is it
log N plus order N?

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:01.600
Does that make sense?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.360
Because you have to shift
all of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.270
So worst case if I have
to insert zero here,

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.090
I have to shift everything to
the right to make room for it.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.590
Right?

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.810
So your first instinct was good.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:18.230
Order N. And questions?

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.870
No more?

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:19.842
Cool.

00:21:19.842 --> 00:21:20.550
How about remove?

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.070
AUDIENCE: Order N.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.816
PROFESSOR: Order N.
Why is it order N?

00:21:28.816 --> 00:21:32.530
AUDIENCE: You have to shift
left everything to the right.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.410
PROFESSOR: Is this what
you were going to say too?

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.590
Same reason as before,
if I want to remove 2

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.640
I still have to move
everything to the left.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.180
I can find the key that I
want to remove very fast

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.640
but then shifting
things is still

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:50.400
order N. OK how about count?

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.498
How does count work?

00:21:53.498 --> 00:21:56.480
AUDIENCE: It's the
same thing, isn't it?

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.970
AUDIENCE: Binary
search so it's log n.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.460
PROFESSOR: Binary
search, so it's log n.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.315
If I look at the
count there it's--

00:22:03.315 --> 00:22:04.690
AUDIENCE: It's
not though, that's

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.165
telling you how
many keys between.

00:22:06.165 --> 00:22:07.748
AUDIENCE: So it's a
simple subtraction

00:22:07.748 --> 00:22:09.490
to find the number
of keys between.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.550
PROFESSOR: Count calls
binary search twice

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.104
and then it does a
arithmetic operation, yes.

00:22:18.104 --> 00:22:20.724
AUDIENCE: It would be log n
because with the count where

00:22:20.724 --> 00:22:22.974
the range is that's log n
because you have to actually

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:25.329
sift through it, but
binary search you have two

00:22:25.329 --> 00:22:27.370
other operations and then
you just do a surprise.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:28.453
PROFESSOR: Yep, thank you.

00:22:28.453 --> 00:22:30.330
Very good.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:35.570
This is log n because of
good old binary search.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.930
How about lists?

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.984
I think you were
thinking ahead of lists.

00:22:38.984 --> 00:22:39.650
How about lists?

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.370
AUDIENCE: You have to list every
single thing that you read.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.754
AUDIENCE: You've got the
values you might potentially

00:22:46.754 --> 00:22:48.290
have to [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:52.910
AUDIENCE: Is it log n plus
the length of the list.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.460
I was going to do a
nice long analysis

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.540
and there's the answer.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.850
Log n plus, suppose you return
i values from the list, i.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.450
Why does this matter?

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:11.820
If I have a range query from
minus infinity to plus infinity

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.565
I have to create a new
list, copy all these keys in

00:23:14.565 --> 00:23:15.860
and return them.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.160
That's order n.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.810
I can't just say it's log n.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.620
On the other hand, if the
answers to my list queries

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.320
are small, if
they're one element,

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.470
then it's going to take log
n time to do a binary search

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.700
and then order one to
produce the list if I

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.640
have a constant size list.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.970
If I just say order n
I'm selling myself short.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:41.500
It's a lot better if I
want to have short queries.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.395
What would be the best possible
running time for lists?

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:02.480
If I had a magic algorithm that
works as fast as possible would

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.186
I be able to run
in order one time?

00:24:05.186 --> 00:24:07.310
AUDIENCE: No.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:09.460
PROFESSOR: Super fast
magic algorithm order one.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.645
No, why not?

00:24:11.645 --> 00:24:16.452
AUDIENCE: Because you still have
to find l and h in your array.

00:24:16.452 --> 00:24:18.160
PROFESSOR: Suppose I
have some other data

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.324
structure, a super
magical data structure.

00:24:21.324 --> 00:24:23.896
AUDIENCE: You can do
searches in order one time,

00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:25.170
is what you're saying.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.705
AUDIENCE: You still have
to have the contents of it

00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:29.664
for what you're listing.

00:24:29.664 --> 00:24:30.830
It would have to be order i.

00:24:36.309 --> 00:24:38.225
PROFESSOR: Even if I
have a super magical data

00:24:38.225 --> 00:24:40.950
structure where I can do
everything that I want inside

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.110
in order one time then
when I produce the output

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.680
I still have to
write the output.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.900
This thing is
going to be omega i

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.050
and I can't possibly do
any better than that.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.390
No matter what
running time you have

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.410
for list it has
to include this i.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.680
Unless you're running time
is order i, in which case

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.698
i is smaller or equal to n.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.530
Does this look right to you?

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.120
There is a small
bug in this code.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.990
What if I do count of 4, 11.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.210
Binary search returns,
if there's a key

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.670
there it will give me
the position of that key.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:29.010
And if there's no
key it will tell me

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.870
where I should insert the
key if the key doesn't

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.360
exist in theory.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:39.520
So if this is my array then the
positions are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:47.550
Count of 4, 11 would do a
binary search of 11 and see 4

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:51.430
and then it will do a binary
search for 4 and return 2.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.930
Right?

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.506
Because if I want
to insert 4 I would

00:25:53.506 --> 00:25:56.450
have to put it here and then
shift everything to the right.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:01.556
And 4 minus 2 is 2
therefore it's broken.

00:26:01.556 --> 00:26:03.410
AUDIENCE: Off by one block.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.580
PROFESSOR: Off by
one block, right?

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.870
Well the interesting thing about
it is that I had this code,

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.860
we actually shipped this
code between Saturday morning

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.620
and Sunday evening and
it passed all the tests.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.440
As we go to the next
section keep in mind

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.000
that this is broken
but it would still

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.418
pass the test for our problem
and we'll see why in a bit.

00:26:23.418 --> 00:26:26.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.116
PROFESSOR: Count of 4, 11.

00:26:29.116 --> 00:26:30.824
AUDIENCE: So
confined to them then

00:26:30.824 --> 00:26:34.970
it says that when
you're down 5, right?

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:35.470
Four.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:36.136
PROFESSOR: Four.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.360
Binary search, if
it finds the key

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.874
it returns the
position of they key.

00:26:44.874 --> 00:26:46.707
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
4 divided by x, and 4,

00:26:46.707 --> 00:26:54.150
4 would it have had two?

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.643
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because it
tells me where to insert it.

00:26:56.643 --> 00:26:58.535
AUDIENCE: OK, then it is.

00:27:02.319 --> 00:27:03.302
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:03.302 --> 00:27:05.010
PROFESSOR: Well it
says 4 minus 2, right?

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.920
The last line is high
index minus low index?

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.320
AUDIENCE: Oh, well that's
wrong. [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.400
AUDIENCE: So are you saying that
it tells you where to insert it

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.775
instead of actually
inserting it.

00:27:14.844 --> 00:27:15.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.640
Binary search doesn't
insert the element.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.490
It just tells me this
is where you put it.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:24.450
And then if you look at add,
add inserts it right there.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.158
That's why binary
search is done that way

00:27:26.158 --> 00:27:27.239
so that that would work.

00:27:27.239 --> 00:27:29.284
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a style question?

00:27:29.284 --> 00:27:29.950
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:31.866
AUDIENCE: The underscore
before binary search,

00:27:31.866 --> 00:27:33.915
is that like saying private?

00:27:33.915 --> 00:27:34.540
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.492
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:36.492 --> 00:27:39.230
AUDIENCE: Wait, what
does private mean?

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.390
PROFESSOR: Private
means that it's not

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.540
part of the public
interface of the class.

00:27:46.647 --> 00:27:48.730
If we're in a team and
we're working on something,

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.930
if I mark a method as private
that means if you use my class,

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.290
you're not supposed to call
it because I might change

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.470
it's name, I might
delete it completely,

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.230
I can do anything I want to it.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.590
But if the method is public, so
add, remove, list, and count,

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:06.510
those are the API or the
public interface of the class.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.260
I guarantee that as long as the
blit range index class exists

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.650
it's going to have an
add to remove a list

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:15.802
and the conduct will behave
in exactly in that way.

00:28:15.802 --> 00:28:17.510
Once you have a class
with public methods

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.770
you're not supposed
to change them

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.565
because other people
might depend on them

00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:22.756
and that would make
other people unhappy.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.880
We said that this range
index holds wires.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.380
Right?

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:43.337
So if you have these wires here
they're not really numbers.

00:28:43.337 --> 00:28:44.920
I know how to compare
numbers, I don't

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.080
know how to compare wires.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.040
That's not something that's
readily comparable, right?

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:58.520
We have to bridge the gap
between numbers or things

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.830
that are comparable and wires.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.460
The way we do that is
the key wire pair class.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.180
If you look at key
wire pair class

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.770
it has-- I will
write it as KWP here.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.600
So it has a key and the wire.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.100
Right?

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.850
That's why it's a key wire pair.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.580
And if you look at the
comparison methods,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.040
lines 11 through 26,
but if you look at 11

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.510
through 13 pretty much
everything else is the same.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:30.410
Then comparisons are
done in a certain way.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.300
So the first
criterion is the key.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.680
If you have two key wire pairs
that have different keys,

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.200
then the one with
the bigger key wins.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.390
Now if they have
the same key then

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.820
this field called wire
IDs is used to break ties.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:51.870
So first key and then wire ID.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.900
What's the wire ID set to?

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.507
And where?

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.100
Where would you set a
field in a nice class?

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.552
AUDIENCE: The constructor.

00:30:02.552 --> 00:30:04.260
PROFESSOR: In the
constructor, very good.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.590
Where is it set?

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:08.340
Line number?

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.320
AUDIENCE: 10.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.111
PROFESSOR: Line 10.

00:30:10.111 --> 00:30:13.250
So the wire ID uses the same
object IDs that we had earlier.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.780
So each wire has a unique
ID that's between zero

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:17.850
and the number of wires.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.330
This works when I insert
my wires into the index.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.490
What's the key for
wires, by the way?

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.150
Where are wires inserted into
the index in the algorithm

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.900
that we have and what's the key?

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.650
The algorithm that we gave you.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.450
Yes.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:39.675
AUDIENCE: The y-coordinates.

00:30:39.675 --> 00:30:40.300
PROFESSOR: The?

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.592
Which one, I couldn't hear you.

00:30:41.592 --> 00:30:42.716
AUDIENCE: The y-coordinate.

00:30:42.716 --> 00:30:43.990
PROFESSOR: The y-coordinate.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.115
Can you tell me which line?

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.830
The intuition is very good.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:52.660
You want the wires to be
keyed by the y-coordinate

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.430
so that when you a range query
between this guy and this guy

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.685
you get these wires.

00:30:59.685 --> 00:31:00.560
That's the intuition.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.380
Now what's the code?

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.130
AUDIENCE: Line 13.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.296
PROFESSOR: Line?

00:31:08.296 --> 00:31:09.270
I didn't hear you well.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:09.979
Line?

00:31:09.979 --> 00:31:10.520
AUDIENCE: 13.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.520
PROFESSOR: 13.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:16.150
Wires are added to the
index when an event of type

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:17.390
add is processed.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:18.410
Right?

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.457
Line 12 says if
event type is add

00:31:20.457 --> 00:31:21.790
so that's probably what we want.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.890
And line 13 adds it to the index
and builds the key wire repair

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:28.320
with the key, the
y-coordinate of the wire.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.270
Now let's look back
at the keys and see

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:40.810
that we have two special
key wire repair classes.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:44.280
Key wire pair l and
key wire pair h.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.340
These don't want the wire.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:51.460
Why would I make a wire key
pair that doesn't want the wire?

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.450
Why is that useful?

00:31:56.797 --> 00:32:02.751
AUDIENCE: You have the minimum
and maximum wire at ease.

00:32:02.751 --> 00:32:04.125
PROFESSOR: Very
good observation.

00:32:04.125 --> 00:32:08.080
The wire ID for the
low key pair looks

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.730
like minus infinity and the
one for the high key pair

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.020
look like plus
infinity as long as I

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.840
don't have more than
a billion wires.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.050
What do these things not have?

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.110
They don't have a wire.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.240
So if you look at key
wire pair l and h,

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.590
if you look at the initializers
on lines two and eight,

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.820
they only take a key
they don't take a wire.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.260
This is useful in
which situation?

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.530
Where do I want to create
an index key that's

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:42.487
not associated
with the real wire?

00:32:42.487 --> 00:32:44.362
AUDIENCE: When you want
to make the list when

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:46.540
you want to do a query.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.450
PROFESSOR: When I do a query.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:49.960
Very good.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.770
If I'm querying, if I have
this vertical wire, which

00:32:53.770 --> 00:33:01.780
starts from minus
80 to plus 80 then I

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.530
would like to make a low key
that corresponds to minus 80

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:07.300
and a high key that
corresponds to plus 80,

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.800
but I don't have any wire with
a horizontal coordinate of 80.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.300
Right?

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.800
A hackish solution
would be to make

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.250
fake wires with
those coordinates

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.960
but if I make fake wires God
knows where my system is going

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.460
to break elsewhere.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.720
Instead the clean solution is
to have these key wire pairs

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.880
so that when I insert
wires I have a wire

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.200
and when I don't the
wire is set to none.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.380
And the wire IDs are
these special values,

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.920
minus infinity
and plus infinity.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.250
What's cool about setting the
wire IDs to minus infinity

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.060
and plus infinity?

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.032
AUDIENCE: It's so that
if you have a y of 80

00:33:44.032 --> 00:33:46.024
this y is at negative
infinity so it's

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:53.924
going to take that y also
because its y value is

00:33:53.924 --> 00:33:56.350
[INAUDIBLE].

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:58.070
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.570
Cool.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.410
If I have a real
key wire pair and it

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:05.340
has a wire whose
coordinate is 80

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:12.090
this is going to be bigger
than a key wire pair

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:15.429
l with coordinate
80 and it's going

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:22.159
to be smaller than a key wire
pair h with coordinate 80.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:25.270
If you do a query
using this and this

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:28.000
it's going to grab all the
wires with coordinate 80.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.860
Does this makes sense?

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.840
So what's cool about
this in terms of coding?

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.719
Do I have equal keys
in my range index?

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:51.800
Do I have to handle
multiple equal keys?

00:34:56.264 --> 00:34:58.744
AUDIENCE: No because,
actually in this case yes.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.840
PROFESSOR: Do I?

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.090
AUDIENCE: Because if you
have all the horizontal wires

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.765
then it's possible
that you have two

00:35:09.765 --> 00:35:11.980
horizontal wires at the same--

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.050
PROFESSOR: If I have
two horizontal wires,

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:16.250
say this guy here
and this other guy

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.750
here, this guy here, what's
the key value pair for it?

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:20.470
Key wire pair?

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.700
Let's say the coordinate is
minus 95 and the wire ID is 2.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:34.600
The key wire pair is
they key is minus 95

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.480
and the wire ID is 2, right?

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.926
PROFESSOR: And then
for this other wire,

00:35:38.926 --> 00:35:43.170
suppose the wire ID is
10, the coordinate is

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:48.940
going to be minus 95 then the
wire ID is going to be 10.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.580
So how are they
going to compare?

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.696
AUDIENCE: Then that one
is less than that one.

00:35:53.696 --> 00:35:54.320
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.010
So even though I have two wires
with the same y-coordinates

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.410
of the key as far as the
algorithm is concerned

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.530
is the same, in
the implementation

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.140
the keys are artificially
different because I introduce

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.630
an artificial ordering on
the wires using that wire ID.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.341
In Which case would I have the
same key inserted in my index

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:17.840
twice?

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:26.770
Yes?

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:27.686
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:32.870
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:36.290
If these two wires overlap,
say this guy ends here

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.155
and this guy ends here, and if
I put their keys into the index

00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:40.774
they're still different.

00:36:40.774 --> 00:36:42.773
AUDIENCE: Only if they're
the same wire ID would

00:36:42.773 --> 00:36:45.390
they have the same--

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:48.909
PROFESSOR: OK, and when do two
wires have the same wire ID?

00:36:48.909 --> 00:36:50.867
AUDIENCE: If one of them
was negative infinity.

00:36:56.179 --> 00:36:57.970
PROFESSOR: Let's assume
that the infinities

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.650
were in the right way.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:01.560
Yes?

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.060
No?

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:05.900
Wire IDs are unique.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.790
Every wire has it's own wire ID.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.220
Wires will never have
the same wire ID.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.990
So the only case
in which you have

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.900
two equal keys in the index
is if you insert the same wire

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.160
twice.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.450
Would you ever want to do that?

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.070
Probably not.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:23.700
You're going to the same wire
twice from the range query

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.510
and that's not useful.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.349
When implementing a data
structure for the range index

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:30.890
we don't have to
deal with equal keys

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:34.760
and that is nice because
that's less thinking.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.570
Now when we do a query,
will the keys in the query

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.577
be in the range index?

00:37:41.577 --> 00:37:42.660
AUDIENCE: Not necessarily.

00:37:48.735 --> 00:37:50.110
PROFESSOR: How
would I do a query

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.846
if I want to do a query
from minus 80 to plus 80?

00:37:52.846 --> 00:37:54.887
AUDIENCE: You grab all
the horizontal wires whose

00:37:54.887 --> 00:37:58.540
y-coordinates are--

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.570
PROFESSOR: You're thinking
in the range index.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.490
I'm thinking as the
client of the range index.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.060
So you have this
range index class,

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.960
how would you issue a
query to the range index?

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.317
AUDIENCE: The list on this page.

00:38:12.317 --> 00:38:12.900
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.690
I would call the list method.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:20.000
And-- oh crap, I
thought I was going

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.800
to avoid doing that today.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.520
l and h are keys, right?

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.868
How do I construct my keys?

00:38:27.868 --> 00:38:31.110
AUDIENCE: Use key wire pair.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:34.250
PROFESSOR: Key wire
pair left of 80--

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:39.740
sorry low, and key
wire pair high of 80.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.330
So then I'm going
to get to these--

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.890
I don't have wires for
this 80 coordinate.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:46.990
Sorry, minus 80 to
80 because that's

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.434
what the query looks like.

00:38:48.434 --> 00:38:50.100
I don't have wires
for these coordinates

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:53.024
so I'm going to use
these special values

00:38:53.024 --> 00:38:55.440
and this one is smaller than
all the wires with coordinate

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.210
minus 80 and this one
is bigger than all

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.280
the wires with coordinate 80.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.870
Will these keys ever
be in the index?

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.130
Nope, we're only using
them for updates.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:06.770
If you put this in
the index then when

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:09.666
you're getting it back and you
try to get the wire associated

00:39:09.666 --> 00:39:11.040
with it you're
going to get none,

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.340
your code is going to crash.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.410
If I have a query will
the keys in the query ever

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:18.320
being the index?

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.240
AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.330
PROFESSOR: No.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.870
That means fewer border
cases to consider

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.565
when implementing query.

00:39:25.565 --> 00:39:27.440
All the keys in the
range index are different

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.025
and they keys in the query will
never be in the range index.

00:39:31.025 --> 00:39:32.420
AUDIENCE: When
you do the count l

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:37.070
and h aren't in your range
index you have to count that.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:37.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:42.610
In this case that's why the
code didn't fail any test.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.600
Because I'm not using numbers
I'm actually using this.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.340
So for the number
analogy this is

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:54.120
equivalent to when I'm
doing a count of 4,11 that

00:39:54.120 --> 00:40:05.360
would get rewritten as count of
3, 99 and 11.01 and this works.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.740
This is what these
two values are doing.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.820
Except if you try
to do 0.99 and 0.01

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:19.107
that's brittle because you
might actually have those keys.

00:40:19.107 --> 00:40:20.440
All right, does this make sense?

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.321
Any questions on this part?

00:40:25.321 --> 00:40:25.820
Nope?

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.590
Yes?

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:28.250
Yes.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.250
AUDIENCE: Is this thing
in a count off situation

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:31.636
where you have a
gap in the wires

00:40:31.636 --> 00:40:34.096
but you still have a
[INAUDIBLE] associated with it

00:40:34.096 --> 00:40:37.060
as it's going through it.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.976
PROFESSOR: Sorry,
say that again.

00:40:38.976 --> 00:40:40.767
AUDIENCE: So with that
example right there.

00:40:40.767 --> 00:40:41.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.960
PROFESSOR: Are you
worried about the fact

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.610
that I'll have two equal keys or
are you worried about the fact

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.980
that these wires are crossing?

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.730
AUDIENCE: No that
they're not overlapping.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.076
You have a wire and you
have a wire coming down

00:40:54.076 --> 00:40:55.159
and you have another wire.

00:40:55.159 --> 00:40:56.930
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.670
This is not going
to account for that.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.102
You have to write the
better sweep line algorithm.

00:41:01.102 --> 00:41:03.056
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:03.056 --> 00:41:04.430
PROFESSOR: What
I'm talking about

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:08.010
now will make your
range index faster.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.827
Or it makes your range
index simpler to implement.

00:41:11.827 --> 00:41:12.368
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:14.662 --> 00:41:16.620
PROFESSOR: This is magic
behind the scenes that

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.355
makes your code smaller.

00:41:18.355 --> 00:41:20.730
You still have to implement
the sweep line algorithm that

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.190
makes sure that when
you a range query

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:27.420
it will either return less false
positives or ideally no false

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.610
positives.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:30.870
And then the code
will be faster.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:32.940
But then when you
do that, you'll

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.860
see that it's still slow
because the range index

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.565
that we have here isn't optimal.

00:41:37.565 --> 00:41:39.690
Why isn't the range index
here optimal, by the way?

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:44.910
What can I improve about it?

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:49.230
AUDIENCE: Add and remove.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.850
PROFESSOR: Add and remove.

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:50.350
OK.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.590
We're using the comparison
model because it's

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.340
convenient to use
the comparison model.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.050
You have complex objects to
implement those six methods

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:04.270
that you see in key
wire pair and bam.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:07.860
You can do comparisons, you
can use any data structure

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.730
or algorithm that assume
a comparison model.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.330
What's the penalty of
the comparison model?

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.810
What's the problem with it?

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:15.311
Yes.

00:42:15.311 --> 00:42:17.185
AUDIENCE: It will be
slower, or it will never

00:42:17.185 --> 00:42:18.610
be faster than the [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:19.300
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:24.964
If I want to do a
sort that is n log n.

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:32.946
And if I want to do a
search that is theta what?

00:42:32.946 --> 00:42:33.862
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:38.004 --> 00:42:40.670
PROFESSOR: Now what are the best
bounds that they have for these

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.657
if we can go outside
the comparison model?

00:42:42.657 --> 00:42:44.990
Just to see if you guys are
paying attention in lecture.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.150
So best running
time for sort if we

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.775
don't have to use
the comparison model.

00:42:51.775 --> 00:42:52.740
AUDIENCE: n.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.450
PROFESSOR: n.

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:54.620
OK.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.924
Best running time
for search if we

00:42:56.924 --> 00:42:58.340
don't to use the
comparison model.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.630
AUDIENCE: It's order
one with [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:06.010
PROFESSOR: Order
one, with hashing.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.796
Can you do any better than that?

00:43:08.796 --> 00:43:10.550
AUDIENCE: You can
code it as zero.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.990
[LAUGHING]

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.830
PROFESSOR: Sort has
to output an array

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:18.800
of elements so it can
be faster than order n.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.690
Search has to output yes
or no so it has to output

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:23.940
something so it has
to be order one.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.150
So this is as fast
as it gets, we're

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:30.030
definitely not going
to go faster than that.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.360
We have this extra
log n factor that we

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.100
pay if we use the comparison
model if we don't collect

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.180
more information about our keys.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.730
But in return we
have the convenience

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.204
that all we have
to do is establish

00:43:42.204 --> 00:43:43.245
an ordering relationship.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.140
Does it make sense?

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:50.810
Cool.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:55.830
Let's try to talk about
the list pseudocode, which

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:58.340
you might have seen
on the pset before.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.250
And that's on the
last page here.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:04.160
I can't give you a
proof of why it works,

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.500
but we can work together
to figure out how it works

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.170
and get an intuitive
understanding.

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:11.850
Let's get the keys
here and let's

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:16.325
assume we're using a regular BSD
for implementing a range index.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.085
I'm going to put
my keys in a BSD.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.610
8, 3, 2, 5.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.460
OK.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.050
List those two things.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:46.670
LCA and no list.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:47.170
Right.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:48.330
What's LCA?

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:52.370
Suppose I want to list all
the keys between one and six.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.400
First I'm going to call
LCA and get some answer

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.170
and then I'm going
to call node list.

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:03.800
What's the answer for LCA?

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:07.930
OK.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:08.930
AUDIENCE: Node at three.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.364
Key value three.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.350
PROFESSOR: What is this?

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:15.650
What's LCA?

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:19.254
It's OK to give out an answer
to a dumb question on the pset.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:24.600
So LCA is lowest
common ancestor.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.630
Very good.

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:27.530
It's the lowest common
ancestor of what?

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:39.330
AUDIENCE: Subtree of values that
should be returned nodeless.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:41.560
PROFESSOR: So usually you
have two nodes in a tree

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.560
and you want to return the LCA.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.940
If I want to find out the
LCA of 2 and 5, that is 3.

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:51.780
If I want to find out the
LCA of 2 and 13, that's 8.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:56.254
Now if the keys are not in the
tree what does the LCA give me?

00:45:56.254 --> 00:45:57.713
AUDIENCE: It's
where they would be.

00:45:57.713 --> 00:46:00.129
PROFESSOR: It's where they
would be if they were inserted.

00:46:00.129 --> 00:46:00.820
Right.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:06.885
So 1 would be inserted here
and 6 would be inserted here.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:12.930
And then their LCA is indeed 3.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:13.980
What does that tell me?

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:14.940
Why is that useful?

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.220
AUDIENCE: You can cut off a
bunch of the rest of the tree

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:24.060
so you don't have
to look at that.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.835
PROFESSOR: A bunch of,
or the rest of the tree?

00:46:26.835 --> 00:46:28.287
AUDIENCE: The rest of the tree.

00:46:28.287 --> 00:46:29.620
PROFESSOR: The rest of the tree.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:33.620
So if 1 is here and
6 is here, then I

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:41.730
know that all the keys--
sorry, so 3 is to the left of 8

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:48.810
so all the keys
to the right of 8

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:51.280
are going to be bigger
than 6, for example.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:51.780
Right.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.700
Because 6 is here
and it's under 8.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.050
I can throw this away.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.900
Now if this would be to
the left of something else,

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.959
because 1 is here I
know that all the keys

00:47:02.959 --> 00:47:05.250
to the left side of that
thing would be smaller than 1.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.970
This subtree has to have all
the keys between 1 and 6.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.915
Yes.

00:47:17.915 --> 00:47:19.665
AUDIENCE: You don't
have to move 8, right?

00:47:19.665 --> 00:47:21.265
Where would you move 8?

00:47:21.265 --> 00:47:21.890
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:25.400
So we only look at the
subtree rooted at LCA.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.410
LCA is passed as an
argument to node list,

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:31.845
and node list seems to
do sort of an-- this

00:47:31.845 --> 00:47:34.330
is a pre-ordered traversal.

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.590
You look at the key, you
look at the left node,

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:39.150
at the left subtree, you
look at the right subtree.

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.590
Except there is some magic
there and in some cases

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.999
it doesn't go and look.

00:47:44.999 --> 00:47:47.540
Let's see what would a good case
where it doesn't go and look

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:47.740
like.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:48.780
Let's get the same tree.

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:04.016
Suppose I want to do a
list between 4 and 11--

00:48:04.016 --> 00:48:08.020
sorry between 4 and 10.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.002
We'll the LCA of 4 and 10?

00:48:10.002 --> 00:48:10.668
AUDIENCE: Eight.

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:17.730
PROFESSOR: OK, so node list
would have to start here.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.420
Suppose I'm here and I go to 3.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.920
I know 3 is smaller than 4.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.160
Do I want to go left?

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.170
Everything to the left
of 3 is smaller than 4.

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:32.510
This entire subtree
can be pruned.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:37.790
Now suppose I'm on the right
side and I'm at the 11.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:42.550
11 is bigger than 10,
do I want to go right?

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.620
So if 11 is bigger
than 10 I never

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.220
want to go right
because everything

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:48.030
to the right of that is bigger.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:55.950
OK so this is how pruning works.

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:58.010
Now if I'm at 3, can I stop?

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:05.117
I can't stop and exit completely
because on the right side of 3

00:49:05.117 --> 00:49:06.950
I might have keys that
are bigger than three

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:08.660
and that are in my interval.

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.060
And in this example that
seems to be the case.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:22.150
Let's look very quickly
at the intuitive way

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:26.220
of analyzing the
running time for this.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:30.880
Suppose I have my LCA
up here and suppose

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:36.500
I go on a path from LCA
to L and then-- let's

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.810
not worry about the right,
about h. h is somewhere here,

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.050
the case is going
to be symmetric.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:46.910
When I go down the path, after I
go here would I ever want to go

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:47.410
left?

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:52.660
If this node is before
a right turn then

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.410
I know that l is going to
be bigger than that node.

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:57.080
Right?

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:00.190
So I'm never going
to take a left turn.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:03.420
This subtree be pruned,
this subtree will be pruned,

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.950
this subtree will be pruned.

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:08.325
Now if I go right
here, what happens?

00:50:11.378 --> 00:50:12.365
AUDIENCE: It's node--

00:50:12.365 --> 00:50:13.740
PROFESSOR: All
the nodes here are

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:16.370
going to be between l and LCA.

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:19.720
LCA is smaller or equal to
h so all these nodes here

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:23.840
are guaranteed to be nodes
that come out in my list.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.170
All right, why am I doing this?

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:29.090
I was saying before
that I absolutely

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:31.820
have to have an
order i because I

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.670
have to produce the output list.

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:38.600
If we look at the
lines three and four,

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.430
line four outputs a key right?

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:45.075
Line four is definitely
order i and line three

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:47.030
is an if condition
so we know for sure

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:48.700
that line four is
only going to execute

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.720
four keys that are
between l and h.

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:56.080
This algorithm is going to
visit some nodes in the tree.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:01.860
For example, if I have a list of
4 and 10 it's going to visit 8,

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:06.220
it's going to
visit 3, 5, and 11.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.020
And for some of the
nodes that are visited

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:11.490
it's going to output them.

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:16.290
Right this guy gets output
and this guy gets output.

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:20.300
The nodes that are
outputs are order i.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.407
Those are already
covered in the i term.

00:51:22.407 --> 00:51:24.740
And in order to get the running
time what I need to know

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.090
is, how many nodes do
I visit that are not

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:29.940
part of the output.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.450
Because if I end up visiting
the entire tree then

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:33.720
that's order n plus i.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.160
So order n.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.370
But if I only end up visiting a
few nodes outside of the output

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:42.090
then that might be a lot better.

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:44.700
And here I'm trying to
argue that I will only

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.090
visit a few notes
the outside the path.

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:52.690
In fact, for every
node I'm going

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:57.650
to visit at most of the node
and the node at its left.

00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:01.370
And then everything to the right
of the path is between l and h,

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:04.460
so everything to the right
is going to be output.

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:08.000
Everything here is in
order i and everything here

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.130
is visited in that output.

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:14.600
And potentially everything
on the path as well.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.356
So what's the height of a
path in a binary search tree?

00:52:19.356 --> 00:52:20.480
Regular binary search tree?

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.990
OK, and worst case.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:31.500
So worst case the
height is order n.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:35.160
But we usually call it height
because on average, at least,

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.740
it's log n.

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:42.010
It's somewhere
between n and log n.

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:45.450
What is the running time for
lists in a binary search tree?

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:50.399
If you buy this argument here.

00:52:50.399 --> 00:52:51.440
What is the running time?

00:52:55.024 --> 00:52:55.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.440
PROFESSOR: You could say n plus
i and you're perfectly correct.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:04.200
But we can make it a bit better.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.416
What's the height of this path?

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:08.660
AUDIENCE: h.

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:13.679
PROFESSOR: H. What's
the running time?

00:53:13.679 --> 00:53:14.470
AUDIENCE: h plus i.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.460
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.900
Cool.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.350
Does this make sense at all?

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:23.920
Is this too complicated?

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.920
AUDIENCE: That's the
running time for what?

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.836
PROFESSOR: This is the
running time for lists.

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:36.510
All right so, questions?

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:38.574
Is this too far out?

00:53:38.574 --> 00:53:39.865
Did I lose you guys completely?

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:45.100
Makes perfect sense.

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.088
I like that.

00:53:46.088 --> 00:53:48.528
AUDIENCE: It's oder
n plus i because it

00:53:48.528 --> 00:53:51.456
could have up to any
nodes on it, right?

00:53:51.456 --> 00:53:52.267
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:53:52.267 --> 00:53:54.058
AUDIENCE: And then it's
order i because you

00:53:54.058 --> 00:53:56.336
have to add that
[INAUDIBLE] of nodes anyway.

00:53:56.336 --> 00:53:58.417
It's order h.

00:53:58.417 --> 00:54:01.000
PROFESSOR: I'm saying that it's
a binary search tree of height

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.500
h and if h is better
than n then I'm

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.230
going to do much better
than n and that's

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:07.497
why I'm putting that h there.

00:54:07.497 --> 00:54:08.788
AUDIENCE: OK, that makes sense.

00:54:08.788 --> 00:54:09.218
I think it's just a ltitle
confusing at that part,

00:54:09.218 --> 00:54:12.613
but the [INAUDIBLE] makes
sense because of course

00:54:12.613 --> 00:54:14.196
that's a smaller
node you're not going

00:54:14.196 --> 00:54:15.612
to look at the
left portion you're

00:54:15.612 --> 00:54:18.090
going to look at the
right because it's bigger

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.800
than your smaller
[INAUDIBLE], right?

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.190
So if you go to the
right, that means that--

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:27.210
PROFESSOR: Here I know that
l is on the left, right?

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:30.190
So l is smaller than this key.

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:35.630
Everything to the right of
this key is between l and LCA.

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:38.170
LCA is smaller or equal to h.

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:39.780
Everything here is
between l and h,

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:43.740
so all the nodes here
are going to be output.

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.196
All the nodes here count as i.

00:54:46.196 --> 00:54:48.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:58.820
PROFESSOR: Now when I turn left
here, this is smaller than l.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:02.340
This is smaller than l
because l is on the right.

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.030
This thing is
going to be pruned.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:07.420
So I will visit the parent,
this node, and that's it.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.350
I'm not going to look down.

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:12.562
And this is how the
nodes look like.

00:55:12.562 --> 00:55:14.270
Everything that's to
the left of the path

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.561
is not visited, everything
that's to the right it open.

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:29.990
Any more questions?

00:55:32.889 --> 00:55:34.430
I hope you get it
right on pset then.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:39.740
Thanks guys.
