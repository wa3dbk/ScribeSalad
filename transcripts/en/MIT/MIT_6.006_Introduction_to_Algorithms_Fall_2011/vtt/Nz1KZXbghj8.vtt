00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.660
PROFESSOR: Last
lecture on sorting.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.350
Yay.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.880
And it's one of the coolest
lectures on sorting,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.870
I would say.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.400
We're going to talk about
linear-time sorting, when it's

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.110
possible and when
it's not possible,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.370
and this lecture sort of
follows the tried and tested

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.920
mathematical structure which is
theorem, proof, counterexample.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.370
So we're going to start
with a theorem which

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.490
is that sorting requires n lg n
time at least in the worst case

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.460
and we're going to then prove
that in fact, you can get away

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.020
with linear time sometimes.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.590
Both of these terms are
correct, but they're slightly

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.160
different models of computation.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.890
Remember models of
computation from lecture two?

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.800
So we're going to talk about a
new model of computation, which

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.000
we've sort of been using
for most algorithms lately,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.030
called the comparison model.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.750
And it's a model of
computations that's

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.680
really useful for proving
lower bounds which

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.177
we haven't done much of yet.

00:01:20.177 --> 00:01:22.260
We're going to prove two
very simple lower bounds.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.840
One is that searching
requires lg n time.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.240
This is basically binary
search is optimal.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.430
And the other is that
sorting requires n lg n time.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.950
This is that merge
sort is optimal.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.550
And then we're going to break
outside of that comparison

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.960
model, work in a different
model of computation, our more

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.090
usual RAM model, and show
that in certain situations,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.420
we can get linear time.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.440
So that's the plan.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.605
Let's start with this
comparison model.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.570
So the idea in the
comparison model

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.700
is to restrict what
kind of operations

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.670
we can do to be comparisons.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.090
It's very straightforward.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:16.082
All input items are black
boxes, you could say,

00:02:16.082 --> 00:02:19.920
in that you don't really
know what they are.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.246
And a formal notion
of black boxes

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:23.870
is something we talked
about last class

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.997
at the end, abstract data type.

00:02:25.997 --> 00:02:27.580
So it's a data
structure, if you will.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.860
Every item that you're
given is a data structure.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.630
You want to sort them.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.850
And the data structure
supports a single operation

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.280
which is compared
to another one.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:52.420
Only operation allowed-- I guess
I should say plural actually--

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.145
are comparisons.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.060
I'm going to be nice and I'll
let you do less than, less than

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.490
or equal to, greater
than, whatever.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.030
I guess there's only one other.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.550
Well, there's two more, greater
than or equal to and equals.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.770
So you can do all the
usual comparisons.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.620
You get a binary
answer, yes or no,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.620
and those the only
operations you're given.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.280
And basically the
last four lectures

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.760
have all been about
algorithms in this model.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.590
So merge sort, it
moves items around.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.790
It's changing pointers to
items, but the only way

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.980
it manipulates items
or evaluates them

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.090
is to compare one
against the other.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.540
Heaps and heaps sort
also only compare.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.366
Binary search
trees only compare.

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:44.740
Everything we've been seeing
so far is about comparisons.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.210
And so all the algorithms we've
seen so far are in this model

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.160
and we're going to prove that
they are optimal in this model.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.540
That's the plan.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.960
I should also define the
cost of an algorithm.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.810
Time cost is just going to
be the number of comparisons.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.050
This is the weird part,
I guess, of the model.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.030
So in everything we've done so
far, we've been in, I guess,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.270
pointer machine or
RAM, either way.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.519
We've been showing binary
search trees or AVL trees,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.089
you can do order lg n time,
in the regular notion of time.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.650
But in particular they do
order lg n comparisons.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.774
And what we're going
to show on the-- this

00:04:26.774 --> 00:04:28.940
is only interesting from a
lower bound perspective--

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.439
we're going to show that even
if you just count comparisons,

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.810
you can do whatever other
crazy things you want.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.100
You need lg n time to search.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.210
You need n lg n time to sort.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.220
So that's our goal.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.020
So to prove that we're
going to introduce

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.630
the notion of a decision tree.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.260
So the idea is the following: if
we know that our algorithms are

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.670
only comparing items, we
can actually sort of draw

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.530
all the possible things
that an algorithm could do,

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.400
so any comparison algorithm.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.480
So this focusing
in on comparisons

00:05:33.480 --> 00:06:09.730
lets us take a tree perspective
of what our algorithm does--

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:26.140
all possible comparisons
and their outcomes

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.685
and the resulting answer.

00:06:32.242 --> 00:06:33.950
I think this would be
a lot clearer if we

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:42.500
look at an example--
binary search,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.394
how you search a
simple algorithm.

00:06:44.394 --> 00:06:46.310
Look at the middle
compared to the item you're

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.890
searching for go
left or go right.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:57.820
And our idea-- I
didn't write it here--

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.260
is to look at a
particular value of n,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.000
n being the size of your
problem, so binary search,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.670
you're searching among n
items for another item.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:15.520
And I'm going to keep it
simple, n equals three.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:22.790
I think I'm going to go a little
wide, use the whole board.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:28.800
So n equals 3 we've
got array, say

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.570
index turning at zero-- pretty
simple binary search-- look

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.150
in the middle, go
left or go right.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.280
But I'm going to write out this
algorithm explicitly to say,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:47.490
all right, first thing I do
is compare is A 1 less than x?

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.996
That's in all cases,
no matter what

00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:50.620
the array is as long
as n equals three,

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.570
this is the first
operation you do.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.060
The answer is either yes or no.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:04.250
If the answer is no, that means
x is less than or equal to A 1,

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.670
so it's to the left.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.680
Then we compare with A 0.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.820
Is A 0 less than x?

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.350
Answer is either yes or no.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.170
If the answer is no,
we're kind of done.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.480
We know that x is over
here or it might actually

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.217
be equal to A 0.

00:08:24.217 --> 00:08:25.800
If you want to figure
out whether it's

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.920
equal or less than, there
will be one more step.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.330
But I'll just stop it here.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.510
We'll say, well in this case,
x is less than or equal to A 0.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.409
I'm going to put it in
a box, say that's done

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.970
where the circles
are the decisions.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:38.929
OK?

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.890
If the answer is yes-- there's
no to this question, yes

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.950
to this question-- then you know
that x falls in between here.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.440
Probably need a
wider box for this.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.070
So we have A 0 is less than
x-- that was the yes to this--

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.780
and the note of this means that
x is less than or equal to A 1,

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.310
and so we basically
identified where x fits.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.790
It's in between
those two values,

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.201
possibly equal to this one.

00:09:05.201 --> 00:09:07.450
Again, one more comparison,
you could figure that out.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.220
And then if x is to the right
of A 1, so this is true,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:28.320
then we check x against A 2 and
the answer is either no or yes.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.250
And in the no case-- well I've
conveniently laid things out

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:37.540
here, it's sequential-- in the
yes case, x is bigger than A 2

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.920
so it's outside the array.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.700
It's to the right.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.110
That's the answer.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.860
Set.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.560
Yeah.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.750
And in the other case, it's
in between A 1 and A 2.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.820
It's a tedious process to write
out an algorithm like this

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:05.230
because a binary search-- it's
not so bad-- but if you tried

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.310
to write a sorting
algorithm out like this

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.560
where the answers are
down the bottom, here's

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.190
the sorted order, and all
the comparisons you do here,

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.600
the tree will actually
be of exponential size.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.070
So you don't actually want
to represent an algorithm

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.300
like this unless you're
just trying to analyze it.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.380
But it's nice to think
of an algorithm this way

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.480
because you see all possible
executions all at once.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.870
Let me talk about some
features of this tree

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.410
versus the algorithm.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:45.084
So every internal
node-- actually,

00:10:45.084 --> 00:10:47.020
I'm going to go over here.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:58.640
So we have a
decision tree and we

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.790
have an algorithm that
decision tree represents.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:09.870
And so when we have an internal
node in the decision tree,

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:15.740
that corresponds to a binary
decision in the algorithm.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.835
In this case, we're only
looking at comparisons.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.320
Slight technical
detail, decision trees

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.150
are a little more
general than comparisons.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.740
Could be any binary decision
here and everything I say

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.154
will be true about any
binary decision you make.

00:11:33.154 --> 00:11:35.070
Comparisons are the ones
we kind of care about

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.040
because all of our
algorithms are doing that.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:49.220
And then a leaf in this tree
corresponds to-- it stores

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.755
or it represents that
you've found the answer.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.207
Maybe I'll say found.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.370
When the algorithm terminates,
returns some answer

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.050
to the problem, that's
what we write down here.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:16.616
Here's where x is in this
array and, yeah, we're done.

00:12:16.616 --> 00:12:17.490
What else do we have?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.530
Here's some puzzles for you.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.940
If I just wanted to look
at a single execution

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.600
of the algorithm, what does
that correspond to in the tree?

00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:36.400
Yeah.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.670
AUDIENCE: Going from the root
all the way down to the leaf.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.586
PROFESSOR: Going from
the root down to a leaf.

00:12:40.586 --> 00:12:43.920
This is what I normally call a
root-to-leaf path, technically

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.080
a downward root-to-leaf path.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.600
How about the running
time of that execution?

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.610
How long does it take?

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.515
Keep going?

00:12:57.515 --> 00:12:58.730
AUDIENCE: Lg n.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.754
PROFESSOR: Lg n in binary
search, but in general.

00:13:02.754 --> 00:13:04.170
AUDIENCE: The
length of that path.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.160
PROFESSOR: The
length of that path.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:05.660
Yeah.

00:13:11.365 --> 00:13:13.990
Got to make sure we get n cases
right but I think it's correct,

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.630
so if here is an execution of
the algorithm, when x happens

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.130
to be between A 0 and A 1,
we do one comparison here,

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.810
a second comparison here,
and then we're done.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.310
So the cost was two and indeed
the length of this path is two.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:33.360
So it works out, no
off-by-one errors.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.950
All right, now
exciting one for us,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.880
what we care about all
the time in this class

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.070
is worst-case running time.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.290
This is a feature of
the entire algorithm.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:50.175
What is the worst-case running
time of a given decision tree?

00:13:50.175 --> 00:13:50.675
Yeah.

00:13:50.675 --> 00:13:53.049
AUDIENCE: The height of the
root, the height of the tree.

00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:55.030
PROFESSOR: The height
of the root also called

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.750
the height of the tree.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.250
Yep.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.690
Or the depth of the
deepest leaf, whatever.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.870
So in this case all the
leaves have the same level,

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.590
but in general we care
about the overall height.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.370
How many levels in
this tree are there?

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.140
It's the number of levels
minus one, technically.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.940
But the length of
longest root-to-leaf path

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.780
is the definition of height.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.040
Here it's two.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.380
In general we know for
binary search it's lg n,

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.030
but given an arbitrary
decision tree,

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.780
we just have to figure out
what the height of the tree

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.946
is and we'll figure out the
worst-case running time.

00:14:32.946 --> 00:14:35.510
So this is why decision
trees are interesting.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:39.860
Not because it means they're
pretty I guess, but the reason

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.240
they're going to be useful is we
have this kind of hard question

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.640
which is how much time do
you need to solve a problem?

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.390
And we're translating
it into how low can you

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.210
make your tree, which is a
problem we know a lot about.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.300
Trees are pretty simple.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.910
These are binary trees.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.530
They're rooted, and so we
know lots of good things.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.935
So let's prove
some lower bounds.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.020
So I claim that for
searching-- maybe I

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.200
should define the problem
a little more formally--

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.000
I want to claim a
lg n lower bound.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.355
So let's say for searching
I have n preprocessed items.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:16:05.355
Then finding a given item among
them in the comparison model,

00:16:05.355 --> 00:16:10.079
so all you're allowed to do are
compare items and other stuff,

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:12.370
but the only things you're
allowed to do with the items

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.070
is compare them.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:25.297
Requires omega lg n
comparisons in the worst case.

00:16:25.297 --> 00:16:27.380
It's kind of tedious to
write down these theorems,

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.500
but for our first
lower bounds, I

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.090
thought I'd be super explicit.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.091
I mentioned here that the
items are preprocessed

00:16:37.091 --> 00:16:39.340
to mean you could do whatever
you want the items ahead

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.040
of time, that's for free.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.690
So I can sort them
in particular,

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.200
which lets me do binary search.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.980
I could build them into an AVL
tree, could do lots of things,

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.440
but no matter what I do to find
another item takes lg n time.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:58.850
Can someone tell me why?

00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:04.416
Who doesn't have the lecture
notes right in front them,

00:17:04.416 --> 00:17:08.060
that would make it easy.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:12.599
This is a little
more interesting,

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.460
but we had all the tools
at our disposal now.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.520
We want to show that
this at least lg n.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:21.830
Why?

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:22.330
Yeah.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.579
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
have a no or yes, right?

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:27.079
So it's--

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:27.787
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:17:27.787 --> 00:17:29.117
AUDIENCE: --omega lg n tree.

00:17:29.117 --> 00:17:29.700
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.560
At each step, we only
have a no or yes.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.560
That's a binary tree.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.870
So that makes you think lg n.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.179
AUDIENCE: That's possible,
it could be lg n.

00:17:39.179 --> 00:17:41.470
PROFESSOR: Maximum actually
could be arbitrarily large.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.930
You could do a linear search
and the height will be m.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.790
We care about the
minimum of course.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.040
Why does it have to be-- why
does the height of a tree

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.430
have to be at least lg n?

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.032
There's one more
thing we need to say.

00:17:53.032 --> 00:17:53.531
Yeah.

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:56.130
AUDIENCE: The tree has
to contain all possible--

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.879
PROFESSOR: Because the
tree has to contain

00:17:57.879 --> 00:18:00.110
all possible--
answers, let's say.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.640
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.570
I think that's worth a pillow.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.880
See if I can do this-- oh!

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.010
Ouch.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.090
I knew it was only
a matter of time.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.190
Sorry.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.665
I'll pay you later.

00:18:16.665 --> 00:18:17.165
Damages.

00:18:20.627 --> 00:18:22.460
At least I didn't hit
a laptop or something.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:34.090
All right, so decision
tree is binary--

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.530
that was the first
thing-- and it

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:47.970
must have at least n
leaves, one for each answer.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.310
At least.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.910
Now, at the leaf you have
to know what the answer is,

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.550
but there may be many leaves
that have the same answer.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.430
That's possible.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.830
And indeed that will happen
not for binary search

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.630
but typical algorithm.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.960
There's multiple paths
to get the same answer,

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.990
so there may be
more leaves than n.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:17.670
And in fact, if you want to
know this kind of thing, where

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.649
x fits in this perspective,
there's n plus 1 answers.

00:19:21.649 --> 00:19:23.190
If you want to know
is it equal or is

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.370
it strictly between two things
there's 2n plus 1 answers.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.860
But in all cases, there's
at least n answers

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.860
and that's all I need.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.990
In particular there's--
say x exactly matches one

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.030
of the given items--
there's n items--

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.860
so you need to have
at least n leaves.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.700
Maybe have more, I don't care.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.590
But it I have a binary tree
with at least n leaves,

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.470
the height has to
be at least lg n.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.160
We're done.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.790
The height is the
worst-case running time.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.940
Super, super easy proof.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.660
So easy, it's never been
taught in 006 before.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.765
But I think it's a good warm
up for the next one which

00:20:10.765 --> 00:20:12.150
is sorting.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.630
Sorting is really
the same thing.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:21.280
It's not going to be any harder
except that it's a little more

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.110
math but really not much more.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.730
So now we know-- we just
proved two useful facts--

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:35.200
one is that binary search is
optimal in a comparison model,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.570
the other is that binary search
trees are actually a good way

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.120
to solve a problem.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.620
If your goal is to solve search
and all you're allowed to do

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.270
is comparisons, then
you need lg n time.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:51.030
And so the search or next larger
or next smaller, predecessor,

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.970
successor, in
binary search trees

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.870
need to take at least lg n time.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.190
No matter how you do it,
even if you don't use a tree.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.350
So this justifies why binary
search trees are interesting,

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.160
because again the
comparison model, that's

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.750
the best you can hope to do.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.070
So that's comforting.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.622
That's why I like lower bounds
and theoretical computer

00:21:12.622 --> 00:21:14.830
science in general because
you know when you're done,

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.600
at least in a given model.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.120
Whenever-- we're
never actually done,

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.005
because we can always
change the model.

00:21:22.005 --> 00:21:24.960
At least we understand the
limitations of comparisons.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.988
So for sorting, we claim
a lower bound of n lg n.

00:21:28.988 --> 00:21:31.401
You've heard n lg
n a zillion times.

00:21:31.401 --> 00:21:33.150
You probably know this
is true, but now we

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.420
actually get to
prove that it's true.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.100
So we just follow
the same strategy.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.950
Decision tree is binary.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:45.240
The question is how many
leaves does it have to have?

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.909
So for sorting-- I didn't
draw up an example--

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:52.700
I'm not going to draw
an example of sorting

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.090
because the trees get ginormous.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:55.590
Right?

00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:01.610
Because of the depth is n
log n, the height is n log n,

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.520
then there's binary
branching everywhere.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.610
That's a lot of nodes.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.030
Two to the n lg n is big.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.140
More than two to
the n even, so it's

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.237
hard to draw a picture
even for n equals 3.

00:22:15.237 --> 00:22:15.820
You can do it.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.090
People have done it.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.020
I don't want to.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.590
I'm lazy.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.680
But the internal nodes
look just the same.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.440
You're comparing two
items, A I verses

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.160
A J. I'll just draw
the generic version.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.080
You have A I less than
A J, question mark.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.110
And then you'll
have a no and a yes.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.320
So that's what a typical
comparison looks like.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.010
Swaps don't appear
here, because we're just

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.770
looking at the comparisons.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.980
And then when you get
down to a leaf, a leaf--

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:54.440
this is the interesting part--
the leaf will look like this.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.690
Well I took the original
A 5 and that turned out

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.200
to be the smallest element.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.870
Then-- maybe I'll
write it this way--

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:06.020
then I have A 7, that turned
out to be the next smallest

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:13.020
element, then A 1
then A 0, whatever.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.610
Hey, right at the end, somehow
you know the sorted order

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.154
and you can just write it down.

00:23:18.154 --> 00:23:19.320
We're not charging for this.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.819
We're only charging
for comparisons.

00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:23.730
So however, maybe
you've done swaps,

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.930
in the end you know
what the final order is

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.350
and so you just write it down.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.090
And your goal is to make enough
comparisons that you figure out

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.580
what the sorted order is.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.470
We claim the number
of comparisons

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.860
here has to be at least n lg n.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.210
OK, why?

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:52.650
Because the decision tree is
binary and the number of leaves

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:57.070
has to be at least the
number of possible answers.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.990
Could be more because
each answer could appear

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.450
in several leaves
and it probably will

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.800
in a typical sorting algorithm.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.640
And how many possible
answers are there?

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:08.900
Batter?

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.816
AUDIENCE: n factorial.

00:24:09.816 --> 00:24:12.880
PROFESSOR: n factorial,
number of permutations.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.530
This is a permutation
of the input sequence

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.200
and if all the items
you're given are distinct,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.890
there will be n factorial
permutations of them.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.350
So that's the worst case.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.000
So n factorial.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.870
Now the tricky part
is the algebra.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.430
Say, oh, well then
the height is at least

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.760
lg base 2 of n
factorial-- lg base 2

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.469
because it's a binary tree.

00:24:41.469 --> 00:24:43.260
You can put a parentheses
here if you want,

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.510
they're not necessary.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:49.480
So now I want to claim
that this is n lg n.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.270
How do I do that?

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.010
Maybe you just know?

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:56.510
Yeah.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.676
AUDIENCE: We can either use
Stirling's approximation

00:24:58.676 --> 00:25:03.910
or we could write it
out as a sum [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.150
PROFESSOR: Wow, cool.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.819
All right, you could either
use Stirling's approximation

00:25:07.819 --> 00:25:08.860
or write it out as a sum.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.151
I've never done it with it sum.

00:25:10.151 --> 00:25:13.120
Let's do that, that
sounds like fun.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.800
So, right?

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.507
I like that because you
know Stirling's-- it's like

00:25:17.507 --> 00:25:19.840
you've got to know Stirling
and that's kind of annoying.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.700
What if you don't know Sterling?

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.650
But we all know the
definition of factorial.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:24.940
I mean, we learned
in grade school

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.148
just because it's fun, right?

00:25:26.148 --> 00:25:30.990
Oh, I guess we-- I mean we
did because we're geeks.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:35.800
And then we know the lg of our
product is the sum of the lg's.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:44.380
So this is lg n plus lg n
minus 1 plus lg 2 plus lg 1.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.230
I think at this
point it's easier

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.500
to use summation
notation, so sum of lg i.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.950
OK now we've got to do sum,
this is 1 to n I guess.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.590
Now we need to know something
about lg's, so it's not

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.730
so easy.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.630
It's easy to show-- I mean,
certainly this is at most n lg

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.750
n, but we need show that
it's at least n lg n.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.430
That's a little trickier.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.555
I happen to know it's true.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.630
But I'd know it even
in the summation form

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:23.360
because I know that lg-- lg
looks like this basically,

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.906
and so if you're
adding up, you're

00:26:25.906 --> 00:26:27.530
taking the area under
this curve right?

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:28.696
Oh, look at these integrals.

00:26:28.696 --> 00:26:30.250
Oh, integrals.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.010
Brings back memories.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.555
This is discrete math class,
though, continuous stuff.

00:26:35.555 --> 00:26:37.430
So you're adding up all
these numbers, right?

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.060
This is lg i over all the
i's and basically all of them

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.850
have the same length.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.580
Like if you look at
the last half, that

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.030
would be one way to prove it.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:51.460
Ah, it's fun, haven't done
summations in so long.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.950
Good stuff. [? IS042 ?] material
but applied to algorithms

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.480
and in algorithms it's fun
because you could throw away

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.690
constant factors
and life is good.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.510
We don't need exact
answers really.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.660
You can find an exact
answer, but let's say

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.280
you look at the last half.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.890
Those are all going
to be basically lg n.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.185
You can prove that.

00:27:12.185 --> 00:27:15.120
So this is going to be
at least the sum where

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.550
i equals n over 2 n of lg i.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:24.710
Here I just throw away the
first out of our two terms.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:28.660
And this is going to be at
least sum i equals n over 2

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.720
to n of lg n over 2.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.740
Each of these terms is
bigger than lg n over 2

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.890
so if I just say, well,
they're all lg n over 2 that's

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.060
going to give me
something even smaller.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.370
Now the lg n over 2,
that's just lg n minus 1.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.380
I love this.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.930
It's going to give
the right answer even.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:58.770
So that's an equals and so
this equals n lg n minus n.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.950
That summation I can do.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:05.070
All the terms are the
same, sorry n over 2.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.770
Not quite what I wanted.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:07.360
Close enough.

00:28:10.344 --> 00:28:11.760
Sorry there is
only n over 2 terms

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.580
here, ignoring
floors and ceilings.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.310
So I get n lg n divided by 2.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:22.690
This is omega n lg n
because this n term

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.720
is smaller than n lg n.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.020
So this one dominates.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.550
Doesn't matter if this one's
negative, because it's smaller.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.120
This is omega n lg n.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:31.670
We're done.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.890
Sorting is omega n lg n.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:34.440
Very easy.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.090
Who said summations?

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:37.660
All right.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.160
Why don't you come
collect a pillow,

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.910
I'm not going to throw that far.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.510
Afterwards.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.440
OK.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.620
That's one way to do it.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.078
Another way to do
it, if you happen

00:28:46.078 --> 00:28:50.540
to know Stirling's formula
for n factorial-- n factorial

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:56.560
is about n over e to the n
times square root of 2 pi n.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.740
Right?

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.330
If you do Taylor series
approximation of n factorial,

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.000
the first term, which is the
most important term for us

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.670
because as the
asymptotically dominating

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:09.390
term is square root of 2 pi
n times n over e to the n.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:12.200
Hope I got that right.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.600
Yeah, clearly I've
been studying.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.490
You take lg's of that and
you do the same thing of lg

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.440
of a product is sum of
the lg's and you end up

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:28.150
with-- the right answer is
actually n lg n minus order n.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.980
So I was off by a
factor of 2 here.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.820
The linear term--
it does appear,

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.042
but it's smaller than this
and this is also omega n lg n.

00:29:38.042 --> 00:29:40.250
If you don't care about
constants, it doesn't matter.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.040
If you care about constants,
the constant is 1.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.350
Kind of nice.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.360
Easy to prove a one half.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.620
And if you look at the lecture
notes it works through that.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.300
But I think we've seen
enough of that lower bound.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.580
And that's the end of
our lower bound topic.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.520
Any questions on that?

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.580
So it's really easy.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:05.590
Once you set up this framework
of comparison trees and now

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:08.080
it becomes just a question
of the height of a comparison

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.810
tree.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.180
Comparison trees are binary.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.140
Just count how many leaves
do you have to have,

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.576
take lg of that and you
get a lower bound of that.

00:30:16.576 --> 00:30:21.540
AUDIENCE: What is meant
by n preprocessed items?

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.790
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.710
For searching I was trying
to be careful and say, well,

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:27.950
if I have n preprocessed items.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.510
PROFESSOR: It means you can
do whatever the heck you want.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:33.900
So here's the model.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.890
I give you n items.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:38.120
You can do all pairwise
comparisons between those items

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.180
for free and then I
give you a new item

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.260
and then I start
charging for comparisons.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.270
So another way to
say it is I only

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:50.800
charge between for comparisons
between x and the other items.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.273
And even then you need lg n.

00:30:53.273 --> 00:30:55.675
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
case for sorting, right?

00:30:55.675 --> 00:30:57.800
PROFESSOR: With sorting
they were not preprocessed.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.420
Yeah, I didn't
write the theorem.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.670
It's just sorting and given
items, no preprocessing.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.190
AUDIENCE: What if there
were preprocessing?

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.130
PROFESSOR: If they
were preprocessed,

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.650
you'd be done in
zero comparisons.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:07.640
Yeah, exactly.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.580
This theorem is also true
if I remove preprocessed,

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.244
but in fact then
you need n time.

00:31:14.244 --> 00:31:15.660
Unfortunately this
proof technique

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.670
will only prove a
lower bound of log n,

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:21.070
because even if these items
were not preprocessed, then

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.104
you have to do linear
search basically.

00:31:23.104 --> 00:31:25.020
So if you don't know
anything about the items,

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.670
you need linear time.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.950
But this proof will only
prove a lower bound of log n.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.520
So this technique,
while cool and simple,

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.270
does not always give
you the right answer.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.170
It just gives you a lower bound.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:39.800
May not be the right lower
bound, may not be tight.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.870
So searching always requires lg
n time and what's interesting

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.980
is it requires it even when
you preprocess the items.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.050
Sorting, if you haven't
preprocessed the items,

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.050
then it takes n lg n.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:52.660
Clear?

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.510
Good.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.843
Now we get to the algorithms
part of the lecture, always

00:31:55.843 --> 00:31:56.650
the most fun.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.730
The moments you've
been waiting for.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.040
Let me erase comparison trees.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.770
Henceforth and I mean not
only this lecture, but also

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:10.380
the next three lectures
which are about hashing,

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.480
we will not be in
the comparison model

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.760
because for comparison
model, we're done.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.480
We solved search, we solved
sorting, n lg n three ways.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.770
I mean, how much more can we do?

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:26.350
So it's time to
bump it up a notch,

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.130
increase our model power.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:32.880
We've talked about the RAM
in particular, Random Access

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.660
Machine, where
memory is in array,

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.230
you can access anything in
the array in constant time.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:45.185
We're going to use that power of
the RAM to sort in linear time,

00:32:45.185 --> 00:32:45.685
sometimes.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.550
A more appropriate title for
this section of this lecture

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.850
would be integer sorting.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.120
OK, so far we've been
talking about comparison

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.140
sorting where the items you're
given-- the only thing you

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:11.110
know about them is that you can
compare them in constant time.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.130
But now we're going to
think about the situation

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:16.310
where the things that
you're sorting are integers.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.560
That's a big assumption but it's
a practical assumption a lot

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.220
of the time.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.720
If you're not sorting integers
you can map whatever the heck

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.620
you're sorting into integers.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.210
And usually it's
already been done

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.140
because you're representing
it on a computer.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:33.050
You've already represented your
thing is an integer of sorts.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:33.570
Bad pun.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:38.060
This is an assumption.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:43.390
So we assume-- going to
be a little more precise.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:49.200
The keys you're
sorting are integers.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.720
There's still-- I'm going
to put a little n here,

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.795
remember there's n keys.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.926
I'm also going to assume
that they're in some range.

00:34:01.926 --> 00:34:04.300
And for convenience, I'm going
to assume that they're all

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.500
non-negative-- it's not hard
to deal with negative numbers,

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.719
but it's just
convenient to think

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.350
about non-negative numbers.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.260
So if you start at zero,
there's some maximum value,

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.230
say k minus 1.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.900
So there's k different
values they could be.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.800
K could be anything.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.639
It's a parameter.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.139
We've always had
n as a parameter,

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:24.055
now we're going to also
have k as a parameter.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:36.659
And just for completeness--
and each fits in a word.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:42.442
Remember the machine
word of your RAM machine?

00:34:42.442 --> 00:34:43.900
Words were the
things that we could

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.174
manipulate in constant time.

00:34:45.174 --> 00:34:46.840
Now this is a very
reasonable assumption

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.280
because we've been
assuming so far

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.814
you can compare two keys
to items in constant time.

00:34:52.814 --> 00:34:54.230
To get that for
integers, you need

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.130
to assume that your integers
are fitting in words.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.755
We usually don't
state this assumption,

00:34:57.755 --> 00:34:59.745
but I thought I'd throw
it in just for kicks.

00:34:59.745 --> 00:35:01.120
So we've got a
bunch of integers,

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.119
each one fits in a word.

00:35:02.119 --> 00:35:04.660
I could compare them,
that takes constant time,

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.510
or I could add them or subtract
them or multiply them or divide

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:13.160
them or do whatever
the heck I want.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:24.582
It turns out you can do a
lot more than comparisons

00:35:24.582 --> 00:35:26.040
and it turns out
this will help us.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.150
I don't know if I want to
tell you the answer here.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:49.940
For k-- not too big-- you
can sort in linear time.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:56.500
Believe it or not, this
topic, integer sorting,

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.280
is still a major
area of research.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.070
People are still trying
to solve this problem.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:05.640
One conjecture is that
even in all cases,

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.460
you can sort in
linear time given

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.505
any integers that fit in words.

00:36:09.505 --> 00:36:11.660
This is not yet solved.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.780
Best algorithm is n
times square root lg lg

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.810
n with high probability.

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.420
So it's almost-- almost n.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.540
It's a lot better than n lg n.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:28.620
I'll just write that for fun
case you can't parse in words.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.880
This is the best
algorithms to date.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.500
I would conjecture you can do
linear time in all situations.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.166
We're not going to
cover this algorithm.

00:36:36.166 --> 00:36:37.710
That's a little beyond us.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:42.360
It's in advanced algorithms
if you're interested, 6854.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.160
But we're going to show that
for a lot of cases of interest

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.430
when k is not
ginormous, it's really

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.601
easy to sort in linear time.

00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:51.100
All right?

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:56.010
And our first algorithm to
achieve this is counting sort.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.680
Counting sort does not
make any comparisons.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.980
It only does other stuff.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.760
And it's going to depend on n.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.910
It's going to depend on k.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.820
We'll get some running times not
bad as long as k is not giant.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.500
So as the name might
suggest, what you

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.140
do is count all the items.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:30.570
So imagine I give you a bunch
of keys like 3, 5 7, 5, 5, 3, 6,

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.524
whatever.

00:37:32.524 --> 00:37:33.940
I'd like to run
through this array

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.440
and say, ah, I see there
are two 3's and there

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:44.670
are three 5's and there's one 6,
and one 7, so how do I sort it?

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.930
I'd like to say, well
3 is smallest key

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.430
and there's two of them, so
I'll write two 3's, then there's

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:53.020
three 5's so I'll write three
5's, and then there's a 6

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.810
and then there's a 7.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.030
That's the intuition.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:38:00.170
Now how do I-- how I do
that with an algorithm?

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.700
Suggestions?

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.265
Yeah?

00:38:03.265 --> 00:38:04.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:11.550
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.030
Allocate an array
of memory, which

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.900
is my counters-- I'm
going to count each k.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.840
I need an array of
size k because there

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.790
are k possible keys.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:23.460
Convenient those two terms
start with the same letter.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.290
And then I'll just--
whenever I see

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:27.340
an-- I'm going to run
through the items in order,

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.140
when I see an item, I say,
OK, well that's key 3.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:35.060
I will look at index 3 of this
array, increment that counter.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.620
Then I see 5,
increment that counter.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.470
I see 7, I see 5, I
see 5, and by the end,

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:43.859
I'll know that there are three
5's and two 3's and so on.

00:38:43.859 --> 00:38:44.650
That's how I count.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.185
And then how do
output the items?

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:50.060
You want to keep going?

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:50.935
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah, just
traverse the array

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:03.250
of counters and the
array is already

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:06.940
written in order by key,
so it's really easy.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.220
I mean I could draw this array
for you if you like at 0, 1,

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:10.870
2 3.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:15.270
Here's the 3 position, it
ends up with the value 2.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.360
And if I just go through, a lot
of these will have 0's in them,

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.870
just skip those.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.490
When I find a
non-zero entry, just

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:26.096
write-- oh, that means there's
two 3's there, so I write 3, 3.

00:39:26.096 --> 00:39:27.920
OK, that algorithm
would work but I'm not

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.790
going to even write it down,
not even going to dignify it,

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:35.920
because all it does
is sort integers.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.600
But there's a
subtlety here which

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.300
we're going to need in a moment,
which is why I stress it,

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.750
that really we have n items.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.550
Each of them has a key, but
it might have other stuff

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.290
too that we'd like to
bring along for the ride.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:50.470
We'll see why we care
about that in a moment.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.690
But it's also a
typical situation,

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:57.440
like you have a spreadsheet and
you click sort by this column.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.990
Well every row has a
whole bunch of data

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.440
but you're only trying to
sort by one of those fields,

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.240
that one column.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.202
And that one field
may be an integer,

00:40:06.202 --> 00:40:08.660
but there's all this other
stuff you'd like to bring along.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.910
And when you say, oh,
there are two 3's,

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:15.450
you know there's this
3, which you know maybe

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:17.270
has a cloud around it.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.320
There's this 3 which maybe
has a heart around it.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.840
That's about the limit
of my drawing abilities.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.792
And now say, oh, there
are two 3's but which 3?

00:40:24.792 --> 00:40:27.000
Should the cloud go first,
should the heart go first?

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.541
I mean I don't care
which goes first,

00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:32.330
maybe-- I do, actually--
but I will in a moment.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.110
That's another topic.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:36.084
But I'd like to bring
that cloud somewhere.

00:40:36.084 --> 00:40:37.500
I want to put the
cloud somewhere,

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.970
want to put the heart somewhere.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:42.090
All right, so here's
a way to do all that.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:53.560
Basically the same algorithm
but I'm just going to use lists.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:00.700
Still have an array of k
things but no longer counters,

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.290
now lists.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.620
They could be linked lists,
they could be python lists.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.230
It won't matter for my purposes.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:14.940
And then I'll say for j
and range of n-- that'd

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.940
be super pythonic here-- I
want to look at the list who's

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:32.500
at index a of j
and append a of j.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:39.765
And then the output is going
to be an empty list initially.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.600
And then I iterate through the
array their k values for that,

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:58.170
and I just say output,
extend, list i.

00:41:58.170 --> 00:41:58.730
OK.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.149
This is counting sort or a
version of counting sort.

00:42:01.149 --> 00:42:03.440
In your textbook, you'll find
a different version which

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.006
does not use lists, So it's
probably more practical

00:42:06.006 --> 00:42:07.880
because it uses no data
structures whatsoever

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.370
except three arrays.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:12.110
But it runs in the
same amount of time

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.370
and this is a lot easier
I think to think about.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:18.920
This is more modern
perspective, if you well.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.890
For every item, if
you'd look at them

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.810
in the given order
of your array,

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:24.410
you see what it's key value is.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.700
Maybe that's not exactly
the same as the item,

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.202
so it could be key
of x is just x.

00:42:29.202 --> 00:42:30.910
But you know in python
sort, for example,

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.446
you're given a key function.

00:42:33.446 --> 00:42:34.570
So you take that key value.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:36.630
The key is guaranteed to
be an integer between 0

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:41.240
and k minus 1, so you look at
the list, that numbered list,

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.320
and you just add this
item to the list.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:44.820
OK.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.195
But the item is
not just the key,

00:42:46.195 --> 00:42:49.460
it's everything-- whatever
that data structure is--

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:53.420
and then you just go through the
list and you concatenate them.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:53.920
OK.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.930
How long does this take?

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.140
How long does this step take?

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:01.880
N?

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.990
Nope.

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.660
Constant?

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.110
Nope.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.345
OK.

00:43:07.345 --> 00:43:08.345
Look at all the actions.

00:43:08.345 --> 00:43:09.557
It's order k time.

00:43:09.557 --> 00:43:11.390
To create an empty list
takes constant time.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:12.600
They're k of them.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.400
OK?

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.850
How long does this step
take, just the append?

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.130
Constant?

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:22.070
Good.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:25.120
Remember, append is constant
time from the Python model

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.670
or your favorite
model, anything.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:29.590
We're assuming the key
takes constant time

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:33.370
because that's the word,
so that's an assumption,

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:35.900
but in the normal assumption.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.640
So total time here is order n.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.680
And this thing, well this
takes basically the length

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.360
of Li time.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.910
And so when you add
it up, maybe plus 1--

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:52.660
because to look at an
empty list you still

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.950
need to look at it--
so you add it up

00:43:54.950 --> 00:44:00.662
and you get order sum of all
the Li's is all the items.

00:44:00.662 --> 00:44:02.370
And then you get plus
1 for each of them,

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.380
so you get n plus k. n
plus k is the running

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.050
time of this algorithm.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.380
Add those up.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.610
OK, so counting sort
is order n plus k.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:16.870
So if k happens to be order
n, this is linear time.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:19.890
But as soon as it's a little
bit bigger, you're in trouble.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:21.370
So counting sort's
a good warm up,

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.120
but it's not ultimately
what we want.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:40.350
And a much cooler algorithm
is called radix sort.

00:44:45.467 --> 00:44:47.800
It's going to use counting
sort as the subroutine, which

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.150
is why spent all this time
on a mediocre algorithm.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:56.800
And it's going to get a
much larger range of k

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.740
and it will still
be linear time.

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:01.830
I'll tell you the answer.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.850
K can be polynomial in n.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:18.000
So like if all your integers
are between 0 and n to the 100,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.800
you can sort them
in n lg n time.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.420
That's a lot bigger.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.190
It's not just like 10 n.

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:27.470
I mean you could do 10 n here
as well with counting sort.

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:30.480
And it's not just like n lg
n, but they can go all the way

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.760
to n to the 100,
still be linear time.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.290
So that's what we're
going to achieve.

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:41.330
The idea of radix
sort is simple.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:44.820
It's actually kind of the
Excel spreadsheet approach.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:49.730
We're going to imagine
we want to break

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:51.640
each integer into
a bunch of columns.

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:04.910
How do we do that?

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:07.050
Well, the way we normally
write down numbers,

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:10.040
except not necessarily in
decimal, in some arbitrary base

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.280
b.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.960
So I say, oh, an
integer in base b.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.010
Well then there's the
least significant digit

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:16.593
and then the next
one and the next one

00:46:16.593 --> 00:46:18.720
and the next one, some
sequence of digits.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.560
And if I know that the
maximum value is k,

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.490
I know that the
number of digits,

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:28.210
which I'm going to call--
for each number which I'm

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:37.511
going to call d, is just lg
base b of k plus one, whatever.

00:46:37.511 --> 00:46:40.410
We've got to be
super precise here

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:44.146
because if I'm in base b then
that's what lg is, right?

00:46:44.146 --> 00:46:45.520
So normally we
think of lg base 2

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.460
because we're writing
things in binary.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.450
Computer scientists
normally think that way.

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:52.949
And fine, so now we
decomposed our integer.

00:46:52.949 --> 00:46:54.740
I'm not going to actually
compute this base

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.730
b representation, because
it would take a long time.

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.780
I'd have to spend n times
lg k time to do that.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.830
I don't want to do that.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.950
OK, but just
imagine it that way.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.980
And then the
algorithm as follows,

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:15.350
sort the integers, all of them,
by the least significant digit.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.400
Sort by the next least
significant digit.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:29.000
Dot, dot, dot, sort by the
most significant digit.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.460
So there are d iterations
here, for d digits.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.570
Sort all the integers by
the least significant,

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:39.010
all the integers by
the next, and so on.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.670
It's like in your-- this is
a useful technique in Excel,

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:43.739
if you want to sort
by several columns--

00:47:43.739 --> 00:47:46.030
or your favorite spreadsheet,
doesn't have to be Excel,

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:50.480
sorry-- you click on the least
significant column first,

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.130
and then click on all the other
columns in increasing order,

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.550
you will sort by all
of them, it turns out.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.425
It's kind of magical
that this works.

00:48:00.512 --> 00:48:03.030
I don't have a ton of
time for an example.

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.660
Let me first analyze
the algorithm.

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.160
We'll see if we have
time for an example.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:12.240
So there are d
digits-- oh, and I'm

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:18.535
going to sort each of these
sorts of using counting sort.

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:33.500
This is I guess sort by
digit using counting sort.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.820
So how long does it
take to sort using

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.270
counting sort in this setting?

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:44.770
Normally, it's n plus k.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:51.750
Here it is, n plus b.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:52.250
Good.

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:01.550
Because all of our digits
are between 0 and b minus 1.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.230
So we're just sorting by digit.

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:06.430
Now here is where we're
using this idea of a key.

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:08.710
When we say key, I
wanted our integers.

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.330
What we do is compute
the digit we care about.

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:15.350
So if we're in this
step, the key function

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:17.530
will be compute the least
significant digit, which

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:21.070
is like taking it mod
b to compute the most

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:26.940
significant digits like dividing
by b to the power of d minus 1

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.450
or so.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:29.670
OK but it's a constant.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:32.450
You do one divide and one
mod, the constant number

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:33.570
of operations.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.430
You can extract the
digit in constant time.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:38.630
So the key function is constant
time and so this works.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.210
We don't have to actually
write them all down,

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:44.930
just compute them
as we need them.

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:46.980
Cool I guess we could
compute them ahead of time.

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.680
It's not a big deal.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.370
Fine.

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.890
So that's each digit.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:57.140
So the total time
is just that times

00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.400
d because we have d steps.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:03.094
So it's n plus b times d.

00:50:03.094 --> 00:50:09.840
Now d was that lg
thing, lg base b of n.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.030
I have this b.

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:14.840
What should be b?

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.240
You gotta love the
English language.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:22.510
What should I choose
b to be, or not to be?

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:23.900
That's the question.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.360
Any suggestions?

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.670
I want to minimize this, right?

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:28.760
I want minimum running time.

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.450
So I'd like b to kind of
large to make this base large.

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:35.165
Sorry, this is not n, this is k.

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:37.830
I copied that wrong
out of excitement.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:40.430
Just copying this over.

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:41.840
OK, I'd like b to
be large, but I

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.410
don't want it to be so
large because I don't want

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.890
it to be bigger than n so
what should I set b to be?

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:47.710
AUDIENCE: N.

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:49.510
PROFESSOR: N, good choice.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:51.380
It's a good trick
whenever you have

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.960
a sum of things you
want to minimize,

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.230
usually it's when they're equal.

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:58.700
Occasionally it's the extreme
like when b is 0 or something.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.700
B as 0 not a good plan.

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:05.220
Base 0 is pretty slow.

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.640
So if I set-- I'll
write it here--

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.970
you can prove it with a
derivative or whatever.

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:13.990
This is going to
be minimized when

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:18.980
b is-- I'll be vague-- theta n.

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:26.990
So then it's going to come
out to n times lg base n of k.

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:31.370
And lo and behold, when
k is polynomial in n,

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:36.920
it's k to some constant,
then that will be linear.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.530
So let me write that.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:46.670
If k equals n to the c, or
say is at most n to the c,

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:50.660
then this is going to
be order n times c.

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.070
So if your integers
are reasonably small,

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:54.920
you get a linear time
sorting algorithm.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.550
And reasonably small means
polynomial in n, in value.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:00.810
That's kind of cool.

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:01.824
That's radix sort.

00:52:01.824 --> 00:52:02.740
And we're out of time.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.156
There's an example
in the textbook

00:52:04.156 --> 00:52:05.700
or in the notes how this works.

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.853
You could prove it by
a simple induction.
