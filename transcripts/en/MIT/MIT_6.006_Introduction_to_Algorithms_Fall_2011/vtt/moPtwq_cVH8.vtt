00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.270
PROFESSOR: Today, we are going
to do computational complexity.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.989
This is rather different
from every other thing

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.030
we've seen in this class.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.120
This class is basically about
polynomial time algorithms

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.580
and problems where we
can solve your problem

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.290
in polynomial time.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.130
And today, it's about
when you can't do that.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.880
Sometimes, we can prove
you can't do that.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.020
Sometimes, we're pretty
sure you can't do that.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.140
But it's all about
negative results

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.850
when your problems
are really complex.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.040
And there's a lot
of fun topics, here.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.280
This is the topic of
entire classes, like 6045.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.950
We're just going to get
a 1 hour flavor of it.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.519
So think of it as
a high level intro.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.893
But we're going to prove real
theorems and do real things

00:01:06.893 --> 00:01:09.580
and you'll get a sense
of how all this works.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.680
So I'm going to start out with
three complexity classes--

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.390
P, EXP, and R. How many
people know what P is?

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.760
And it is?

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.990
Polynomial time.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.510
More precisely, it's
the set of all problems

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.060
you can solve in
polynomial time.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.090
This is what the
class is all about.

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:41.110
Almost every
problem we have seen

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.410
in this class-- there's
one exception-- is

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.960
in P. Does anyone
know the exception?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.150
It's a good puzzle for you.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.940
Not NP.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.440
What's next?

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.120
EXP.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.660
How many people
know what EXP is?

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.810
Or you can guess.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.400
Any guesses?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.569
Exponential.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.110
These are all the problems you
can solve in exponential time.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.210
If you want to be formal
about it, in this case,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.200
exponential means 2 to
the n to some constant.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.700
So not just 2 the n, but also
2 to the n squared, 2 to the n

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.199
cubed.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.350
Those are all
considered-- exponential

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.050
and a polynomial is
considered in the class EXP.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.010
Now, basically, almost every
problem you can dream of you

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.170
can solve in EXP.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.370
Exponential time
is so much time.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.705
And this class has always
been about taking things that

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:51.460
are obviously in EXP and showing
that they're actually in P.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.120
So if you want to
draw a picture,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.870
you could say, OK,
here's all the problems

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.070
we can solve in polynomial time.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.287
Here's all the problems we
can solve in exponential time.

00:03:00.287 --> 00:03:01.620
And there are problems out here.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.390
These are different classes.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.070
And we want to sort
of bring things

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.620
into here as much as possible.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.940
I actually want to
draw this picture

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.050
in a different way, which
is as a horizontal line.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.715
So an axis.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.949
I'm going to call this
computational difficulty.

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.740
You could call it
computational complexity,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.930
but that's a bit of
a loaded term that

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.470
actually has formal meaning.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.000
Difficulty is nice and vague.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.040
So I can draw an
abstract picture.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.460
This is not a true
diagram, but it's

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.770
a very good guideline
of what's going on.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.905
So we have-- I'm going to draw--
I believe-- three notches.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.770
No, eventually four, so let
me give myself some room.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.920
We have over here, the
easy problems are P. Then,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.180
we have these problems,
which are EXP.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.930
We're going to fill in
something in the middle.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.910
And then this is
something called R.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.410
So you've got P is
everything, here.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.140
EXP is all the way out to
here, in some abstract view.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.290
The next thing is R. How
many people know what R is?

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.250
This one, I had to look up.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.780
It's not usually given a name.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.805
No one.

00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:31.430
Teaching staff?

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.445
You guys know it?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.900
These are all problems
solvable in finite time.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.910
R stands for finite.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.280
R stands for recursive.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.530
Recursive used to mean
something completely different,

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.863
back in the '30s, when people
were thinking about what's

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.470
computable, what's
not computable.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.390
These are, basically, solvable
problems, computable problems.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.890
Finite time is a reasonable
requirement, I think,

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.105
for all algorithms.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:09.690
And that's R. Now,
I've drawn this arrow

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.106
to keep going because there
are problems out here.

00:05:13.106 --> 00:05:14.605
It's kind of
discouraging, but there

00:05:14.605 --> 00:05:17.080
are problems that
are unsolvable.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.977
In fact, most problems
are unsolvable.

00:05:19.977 --> 00:05:21.060
We're going to prove that.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.340
It's actually really
easy to prove.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.360
Kind of depressing, but true.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.820
Let me start with some examples
before we get to that proof.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.730
So I'm writing examples
of some things we've seen.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.170
So here's an example of
a problem we've seen.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.095
Negative-weight cycle detection.

00:05:52.314 --> 00:05:54.440
I give you a graph--
a weighted graph.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.090
I want to know does it have
any negative-weight cycles?

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.560
What classes is this problem in?

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.050
P. We know how to solve
this in polynomial time--

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.260
in VE time-- using Bellman-Ford.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.650
VE time-- well, that finds
negative-weight cycles

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.540
reachable from s.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.370
But, I guess, if you
add a source that

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.390
can reach anywhere--
zero weight-- then

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.390
that'll tell you
overall that it's in P.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.640
It's also in EXP, of course.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.322
Everything in P is also in EXP.

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:23.280
Because if you can solve
it in polynomial time,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.290
you can solve it in
exponential time.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.230
This is at most
exponential time.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.048
At most polynomial.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.680
Here's a problem
we haven't seen.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.160
But it's pretty cool.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.190
N by n Chess.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.320
So this is the
problem I give you.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.440
So we're in an by n
board, and I give you

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.690
a whole bunch of
pieces on the board,

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.890
and I want to know does
White win from here?

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.660
I say it's White to
move or Black to move,

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.250
and who's going to win
form this position?

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.085
This problem, can be
solved in exponential time.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:02.080
You can sort of play out
all possible strategies

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.210
and see who wins.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.060
And it's not in P. There's
no polynomial time algorithm

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.150
to play generalized Chess.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.250
This sort of captures why
Chess-- even at eight by eight

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.510
Chess-- is hard-- because
there's no general way

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.220
to do it.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.210
So there's no special
way to do it, probably.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.780
Computational complexity is
all about order of growth.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.770
So we can't analyze
eight by eight Chess,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.290
but we can analyze n by n Chess.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.290
And that gives us a flavor of
why 8 by 8 is so difficult.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.000
Go is also in EXP, but
not in P-- lots of games

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.430
are in this category, lot's of
complicated games, let's say.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.130
And so this is a first example
of a problem that we know we

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.930
cannot solve in polynomial time.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.880
Bad news.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.070
I also talked about
Tetris a little bit.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.920
Unlike the Tetris
training, which we saw,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.630
this is sort of
realistic Tetris--

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.340
all the rules of Tetris.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.990
The only catch is that I
tell you all the pieces that

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.470
are going to come in advance.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.442
Because, otherwise,
it's some random process

00:08:08.442 --> 00:08:11.025
and it's kind of hard to think
about what's the best strategy.

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:13.524
But if I tell you
what's going to come--

00:08:13.524 --> 00:08:14.940
say it's a
pseudo-random generator

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.365
and you know how it works.

00:08:16.365 --> 00:08:17.990
You know all the
pieces that will come.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.830
I want to know can I survive
from a given initial board mess

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.980
and for a given
sequence of pieces.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.740
This can also be solved
in exponential time.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.575
Just try all the possibilities.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:45.760
We don't know whether it's
in P. We're pretty sure

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.920
it's not in P. And by the
end of today's lecture,

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.500
you'll understand why
we think it's not in P.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.930
But it's going to be
somewhere in between here.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.110
Tetris is actually right here.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.410
But I haven't defined
what right here is yet.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.460
And then the next one
is halting problem.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.140
So halting problem
is particularly cool,

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.320
as we'll see-- or interesting.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.710
It's the problem of given a
computer program-- Python,

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.540
whatever, it doesn't really
matter what language.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.150
They're all the same in
a theoretical sense--

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.005
does it ever halt?

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.335
Does it ever stop running,
return a result, whatever?

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.600
This would be really handy--
you're writing some code,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.360
and you've run it
for 5 hours, and you

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.120
don't know is that
because there's a bug

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.453
and you've got an infinite loop?

00:10:01.453 --> 00:10:04.000
Or is it just because
it's really slow?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.137
So you'd like to give it
to some program-- checking

00:10:08.137 --> 00:10:09.845
program-- that says
will this run forever

00:10:09.845 --> 00:10:11.532
or will it terminate.

00:10:11.532 --> 00:10:13.160
That's the halting problem.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.080
And this problem
is not in R. There

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.260
is no correct algorithm
for solving this problem.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.270
There's no way to tell,
given an arbitrary program,

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.840
whether it will halt.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.130
Now, in some situations--
take the empty program--

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.630
I can tell that it halts.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.580
Or I take some special
simple class of programs,

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.890
I can tell whether they halt or
determine that they don't halt.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.890
But there's no algorithm that
solves it for all programs,

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.380
in finite time.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.330
In infinite time,
I can solve it.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.540
Just run it.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.340
Run the program.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.340
Given finite time, there's
no way to solve this.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.370
And so this is a little bit
beyond what we can prove today.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.930
It's not that hard
to prove, but it

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.440
takes half an hour or something.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.690
I want to get to other things.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.020
But if you take 6045,
they'll prove this.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.990
What I want to show you
instead is an easier

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:29.800
result-- that almost
every problem is not in R.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.680
I need one term, though,
which is decision problems.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.050
All of these problems,
I set it up in a way

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.556
that the answer is
binary-- yes or no.

00:11:37.556 --> 00:11:38.930
Is there a
negative-weight cycle?

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.090
Yes or no?

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.950
Does White win from
this position in Chess?

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.000
Can you survive in Tetris?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.240
And does this program halt?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.430
For various reasons--
basically convenience--

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.320
the whole field of
computational complexity

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.550
focuses on decision problems.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.370
And, in fact-- so
decision problems

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.080
are ones where the
answer is yes or no.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.920
That's all.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.880
Why?

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.520
Essentially because
it doesn't matter.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.920
If you take a problem
you care about,

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.200
you can convert it into
a decision problem.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.760
We can see examples
of that later.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.290
Decision problems
are basically as

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.989
hard as optimization
problems or whatever.

00:12:17.989 --> 00:12:19.530
But let's focus on
decision problems.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.920
The answer is yes or no.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.590
Claim that most of
them are uncomputable.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.100
And we can prove
this pretty easily

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.390
if you know a bit of
set theory, I guess.

00:12:35.309 --> 00:12:37.350
On the one hand, I have
problems I want to solve.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.520
These are decision problems.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.220
And on the other hand,
I have algorithms,

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.820
or computer programs
to solve them.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.445
I'm going to think
of computer programs

00:12:44.445 --> 00:12:46.640
because more precise
algorithms can

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.230
be a little bit nebulous for
thinking about pseudocode--

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.460
what's valid, what's invalid.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.610
But computer programs
are very clear.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.049
I give you some code.

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:56.090
You throw it into Python.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.500
Either it works or it doesn't.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.552
And it does something.

00:12:59.552 --> 00:13:00.260
Runs for a while.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.750
How can I think about the
space of all possible programs?

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.020
Well, programs are things
you type into a computer

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.400
in ASCII, whatever.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.380
In the end, you can think of
it as just as a binary string.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.060
Somehow it gets
encoded in binary.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.870
Everything is reduced to binary
in the end, on a computer.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:27.340
So this is a binary string.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.430
Now, you can also think
of a binary string

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.280
as representing a
number, in binary.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.870
So you can also
think of a program,

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.960
then, as a natural number-- some
number between 0 and infinity.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.870
And an integer.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:45.850
So usually we represent
this as math bold N.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.470
That's just 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.670
You can think of every
program is ultimately

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.960
reducing to an integer.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.615
It's a big integer, but, hey.

00:13:53.615 --> 00:13:55.770
It's an integer.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.647
So that's the space
of all programs.

00:13:57.647 --> 00:14:00.230
Now, I want to think about the
space of all decision problems.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.474
So how can I define
a decision problem?

00:14:06.474 --> 00:14:08.640
Well, the natural way to
think of a decision problem

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.650
is as a function that
maps inputs to yes or no.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:28.430
Function from
inputs to yes or no.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:32.310
Or you can think
of that as 1 and 0.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.310
So what's an input?

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.220
Well, an input is
a binary string.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.000
So an input is a number--
a natural number.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:51.580
Input is a binary string, which
we can think of as being in N.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:58.570
So we've got a
function from N to 0,1.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:03.000
So another way to represent
one of these functions

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.220
is as a table.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.070
I could just write
down all the answers.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.110
So I've got, well, the input
could be 0-- the number 0.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.969
And then, maybe it's a 0.

00:15:11.969 --> 00:15:14.260
Input could be could be 1
and then, maybe, output is 0.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:21.750
Then, the input could be 2,
3, 4, 5, 1, 0, 1, 1, whatever.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.510
So I could write the
table of all answers.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:28.430
This is another way to
write down such a function.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.110
What we have, here, is an
infinite string of bits.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.290
Each of them could be 0 or 1.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.810
It would be a different problem.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.850
But they all exist.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.060
Any infinite string of bits
represents a decision problem.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.750
They're the same thing.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.950
So a decision problem is
an infinite string of bits.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.676
A program is a finite
string of bits.

00:15:49.676 --> 00:15:52.260
These are different things.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.170
One way to see that
they're different

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.640
is put a decimal point, here.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.630
Now, this infinite
string of bits

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.710
is a number-- a real
number-- between 0 and 1.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.720
It's written in binary.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.627
You may not be used
to binary point.

00:16:07.627 --> 00:16:08.960
This dot is not a decimal point.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.180
It's a binary point.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.970
But, hey.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.040
Any real number can be expressed
by an infinite string of bits

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.820
in this way-- any real
number between 0 and 1.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:31.940
So a decision
problem is basically

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.260
something in R, the set
of all real numbers,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.555
whereas a program is something
in N, the set of all integers.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.360
And the thing is, the
number of real numbers

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.460
is much, much bigger than
the number of integers.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.110
In a formal sense, we call
this one uncountably infinite,

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.060
and this one is
countably infinite.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.830
I'm not going to prove
that here, today.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.010
You may have seen that proof.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.320
It's pretty simple.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.350
And that's bad news.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.829
That means that there
are way more problems

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.550
than there are
programs to solve them.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:12.890
So this means almost every
problem that we could conceive

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.525
of is unsolvable
by every program.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.245
And this is pretty depressing
the first time I saw it.

00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:35.120
That's why we put it at
the end of the class.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.160
I think you get all existential.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.040
I mean the thing is
every program only

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.201
solves one problem.

00:17:43.201 --> 00:17:44.700
It takes some input,
and it's either

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.247
going to output yes or no.

00:17:46.247 --> 00:17:48.580
And if it's wrong on any of
the inputs, then it's wrong.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.010
So it's going to give an answer.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.570
Say it's a
deterministic algorithm.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.950
No random numbers or things.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.670
Then, there's just
not enough programs

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.402
to go around if each program
only solves one problem.

00:18:01.402 --> 00:18:02.610
This is the end of the proof.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.110
Any questions about that?

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.390
Kind of weird.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.390
Because yet somehow, most of
the problems that we think about

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.530
are computable.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.100
I don't know why that is.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.520
But mathematically,
most problems

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.425
that you could think
of are uncomputable.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.974
Question?

00:18:22.974 --> 00:18:23.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:28.750
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.270
It's something like,
the way that we describe

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.990
problems is usually almost
algorithmic, anyway.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.610
And so, usually, most problems
we think of are in EXP.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.300
And so they're
definitely computable.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.820
There's some
metatheorem about how

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.385
we think about problems,
not just programs.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.970
So that's all I'm going to
say about R. So out here,

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.972
we have halting problem and,
actually, most problems.

00:18:57.972 --> 00:18:59.680
You can think of this
as an infinite line

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.980
and then there's just
this small portion

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.840
which are things you can solve.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.880
But we care about this
portion because that's

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.040
the interesting stuff.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.750
That's what
algorithms are about.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:13.560
Out here kind of
nothing happens.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.070
So I want to talk about
this notch, which is NP.

00:19:22.747 --> 00:19:24.080
I imagine you've heard about NP.

00:19:27.252 --> 00:19:30.240
It's pretty cool, but
also kind of confusing.

00:19:34.616 --> 00:19:37.890
But it's actually very
closely related to something

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:42.320
we've seen with dynamic
programming, which is guessing.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.460
So I'm going to give you
a couple of definitions

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.285
of NP-- not formal definition,
but high level definitions.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:57.350
So just like P, EXP, and R,
it's a set of decision problems.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:03.650
And it's going to look very
similar to P. NP does not

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.640
stand for not a polynomial.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.750
It stands for
nondeterministic polynomial.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.330
We'll get to
nondeterministic in a moment.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.436
The first line is the same.

00:20:14.436 --> 00:20:17.740
It's all decision problems you
can solve in polynomial time.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.720
That sounds like P.
But then, there's

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:25.480
this extra line, which is
via a "lucky" algorithm.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.840
Let me tell you--
at a high level what

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.434
a lucky algorithm does
is it can make guesses.

00:20:40.434 --> 00:20:42.475
But unlike the way that
we've been making guesses

00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:44.360
with dynamic programming--
with dynamic programming

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.443
we had to guess something.

00:20:45.443 --> 00:20:47.190
We tried all the possibilities.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.597
A lucky algorithm just
needs to try one possibility

00:20:50.597 --> 00:20:51.680
because it's really lucky.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.860
It always guesses
the right choice.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.440
It's like magic.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.310
This is not a realistic
model of computation,

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:04.470
but it is a model of computation
called nondeterministic model.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.950
And it's going to sound
crazy because it is crazy,

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.080
but nonetheless it's
actually really useful--

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.410
even though you could
never really build

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.576
this on a real computer.

00:21:19.576 --> 00:21:20.950
The nondeterministic
model is not

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.116
a model of real computation.

00:21:22.116 --> 00:21:25.410
It is a model of theoretical
hypothetical computation.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.300
It gets at the
root-- at the core

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.730
of what is possible to solve.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.800
You'll see why, in a little bit.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:39.800
So in this model, an algorithm--
it can compute stuff,

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.682
but, in particular,
it makes guesses.

00:21:43.682 --> 00:21:46.030
So should I do this
or should I do this?

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.790
And it just says-- It
doesn't flip a coin.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.010
It's not random.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.990
It just thinks-- it
just makes a guess.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.800
Well, I don't know.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.390
Let's go this way.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.182
And then it comes
another fork in the road.

00:21:58.182 --> 00:21:59.431
It's like, well, I don't know.

00:21:59.431 --> 00:22:00.410
I'll go this way.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:01.660
That's the guessing.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.160
You give it a list of
choices and somehow a choice

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.910
is determined, by magic--
nondeterministic magic.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:18.970
And then the fun part is--
I should say, at the end

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:24.652
the algorithm either
says yes or no.

00:22:24.652 --> 00:22:25.610
It gives you an output.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:34.590
The guesses are guaranteed--
this is the magic part--

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:43.780
to lead to a yes
answer, if possible.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.800
So if you imagine the space
of executions of this program,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.342
you start here, and you
make some guess and you

00:22:53.342 --> 00:22:55.190
don't know which way to go.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.119
In dynamic programming,
we try all of them.

00:22:57.119 --> 00:22:58.910
But this algorithm
doesn't try all of them.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.580
It's like a branching universe
model of the universe.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.930
So you make some
choice, and then you

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.430
make some other choice, and
then you make some other choice.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.900
All of these are guesses.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.500
And some of these
things will lead to yes.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.120
Some of these things
will lead to no.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.040
And in this magical model,
if there's any yes out there,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.660
you will follow a path to a yes.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.974
If all of the answers
are no, then, of course,

00:23:21.974 --> 00:23:23.640
it doesn't matter
what choices you make.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.100
You will output no.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.940
But if there's ever a yes,
magically these guesses

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.580
find it.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.390
This is the sense of lucky.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.940
If you're trying to find a
yes-- that's your goal in life--

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.290
then this corresponds to luck.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.260
And NP is the class of
all problems solvable

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.800
in polynomial time by a
really lucky algorithm.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.850
Crazy.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:45.350
I know.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.115
Let's talk about Tetris.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.871
Tetris, I claim, is in NP.

00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:01.870
And we know how to solve
it in exponential time.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.280
Just try all the options.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.640
But, in fact, I don't need
to try all the options.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.150
It would be enough just use
this nondeterministic magic.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.420
I could say, well, should I
drop the piece here, here, here,

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.739
here, here, or here.

00:24:15.739 --> 00:24:17.780
And should it be rotated
like this, or like this,

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.170
or like this, or like this?

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:20.910
I don't know.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.210
So I guess.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.775
And I just place that piece.

00:24:23.775 --> 00:24:25.900
I make another guess where
to place the next piece.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.550
Then I make another guess
where to place the next piece.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.520
I implement the rules
of Tetris, which

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.426
is if there's a
full line it clears.

00:24:32.426 --> 00:24:34.980
I figure out where
these things fall.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.080
I can even think about, should
I rotate at the last second.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.894
If I don't know, I'll guess.

00:24:41.894 --> 00:24:43.810
Any choice you have to
make in playing Tetris,

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.280
you can just guess.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.660
There's only polynomially
many guesses you need to make.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.600
So it's still polynomial time.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.440
That's important.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.060
It's not like we
can do anything.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.770
But we can make a polynomial
number these magic guesses.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:59.330
And then at the end, I
determine did I die--

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.070
or rather, did I survive.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.120
It's important, actually.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.980
It only works one way.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.780
Did I survive?

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.555
Yes or no?

00:25:05.555 --> 00:25:06.680
And that's easy to compute.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.120
I just see did I ever
go above the top row.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.640
So what this model says
is if there is any way

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.100
to survive-- if there is
any way to get a yes answer,

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.220
then, my guesses will find
it, magically, in this model.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.370
Therefore, Tetris is in NP.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.200
If I had instead
said, did I die, then,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.120
what this algorithm would
tell me is there any way

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.970
to die-- which, the
answer's probably yes,

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.360
unless you're given a
really trivial input.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.710
So it's important you set up
the yes versus no, correctly.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.980
But the Tetris decision problem
"can I survive," is in NP.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.670
The decision problem "can I
die," should not be in NP.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.494
But we don't know.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.430
Another way to think about NP.

00:26:01.382 --> 00:26:02.950
And you might find
this intuitive

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.800
because we've been
doing lots of guessing.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.330
It's just a little crazy.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:11.490
There's another way that's
more intuitive to many people.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.520
So if this doesn't make
sense, don't worry, yet.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.110
This is another
way to phrase it.

00:26:53.152 --> 00:26:55.110
Another way to think
about NP-- which turns out

00:26:55.110 --> 00:27:01.450
to be equivalent-- is that don't
think so much about algorithms

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.300
for solving a problem,
just think about algorithms

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.437
for checking the
solution to a problem.

00:27:07.437 --> 00:27:09.270
It's usually a lot
easier to check your work

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.980
than it is to solve a
problem in the first place.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.400
And NP is all about that issue.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.540
So think of decision
problems and think

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.270
about if you have a solution--
so let's say in Tetris,

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.790
the solution is yes.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.660
In fact, I need to
say this, probably.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.150
The more formal
version is whenever

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:37.900
the answer is yes,
you can prove it.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.100
And you can check that
proof in polynomial time.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:53.140
This is the more formal--
this a little bit high level.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.130
What does check mean?

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.080
Here's what check means.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.560
Whenever an answer is "yes,"
you can write down a proof

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.900
that the answer is yes.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.400
And someone can
come along and check

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.370
that proof in polynomial
time and be convinced

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.310
that the answer is yes.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.600
What does convinced mean?

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.800
It's not that hard.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.660
Think of it is a
two player game.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.400
There's me trying
to play Tetris,

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.400
and there's you
trying to be convinced

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.100
that I'm really good at Tetris.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:23.060
It seems a little one sided,
but-- it's a asymmetric game.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.420
So you want to prove Tetris is--
I want to show Tetris is in NP.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.790
Imagine I'm this
magical creature.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.160
Actually, it's kind of funny.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.680
It reminds me of a story.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.620
On the front of my
office door, you

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.540
may have seen there's
an email I received,

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.900
maybe 15 years
ago-- oh no, I guess

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.100
it can't be that long ago.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.710
Must've been about
7 years ago when

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.040
we proved that Tetris
is NP-complete.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.660
And the email says, "Dear
Sir,"-- or whatever--

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.349
"I am NP-complete."

00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:55.890
We don't what
NP-complete means, yet,

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.310
but it's a
meaningless statement.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.640
So it doesn't matter that
you don't know what it means.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.940
It might get funnier
throughout the lecture today.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.860
And he's like, I
can solve Tetris.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.534
I'm really good
at playing Tetris.

00:29:09.534 --> 00:29:11.200
I'm really good at
playing Minesweeper--

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.210
all these games that are
thought to be intractable.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.810
He gave me his
records and so on.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:20.230
It's like how can
I apply my talent.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:26.230
So I will translate what he
meant to say was, "I am lucky."

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.017
And this is probably
not true, but he

00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:30.100
thought that he was lucky.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.940
He wanted to convince
me he was lucky.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.610
So how could we do it?

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:36.540
Well, I could give him a
really hard Tetris problem.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.870
And say, can you
survive these pieces?

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.450
And he says, "yes,
I can survive. "

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.450
And how does he prove to
me that he can survive?

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.150
Well, he just plays it.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.420
He shows me what to do.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:53.740
So proof is sequence
of moves that you make.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.870
It's really easy
to convince someone

00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:00.290
that you can survive a
given level of Tetris.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:04.380
You just show what the
sequence of moves are.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.860
And then I, as a mere mortal
polynomial time algorithm

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.780
can check that that
sequence works.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.064
I just have to implement
the rules of Tetris.

00:30:12.064 --> 00:30:13.980
So in Tetris, the rules
are easy to implement.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.120
Its the knowing what
thing to do is hard.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.840
But in NP, knowing
which way to go is easy.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.340
In this version,
you don't even talk

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.820
about how to find the solution.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.486
It's just a matter
of can you write down

00:30:26.486 --> 00:30:29.280
a solution that can be checked.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.000
Can prove it.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.420
This is not in polynomial time.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.710
You get arbitrarily
much time to prove it.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.540
But then, the check has to
happen in polynomial time.

00:30:41.047 --> 00:30:41.630
Kind of clear?

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.450
That's Tetris.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:49.220
And every problem that you
can solve in polynomial

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.049
time you can also,
of course, check it.

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:53.090
Because if you could solve
it in polynomial time,

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.590
you could just solve
it and then see

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.320
did you get the same
answer that I did.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.790
So P is inside NP.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:04.910
But the big question
is does p equal NP.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:08.600
And most people think no.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.060
P does not equal NP--
most sane people.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.910
So this is a big problem.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.900
It's one of the famous
Millennium Prize problems.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:27.030
So in particular, if you solved
it, you would get $1 million,

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.080
and fame, and probably
other fortune.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.060
You could do TV spots.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.160
I think that's how people
mostly make their money.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.280
You could do a lot.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.020
You would become the most famous
computer scientist in the world

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.020
if you prove this.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.270
So a lot of people have tried.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.070
Every year, there's an
attempt to prove either

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.500
what everyone believes
or, most often,

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.742
people try to prove the
reverse-- that they are equal.

00:31:49.742 --> 00:31:50.450
I don't know why.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.250
They should bet the other way.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.360
So what does P does
not equal NP mean?

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.040
It means that there are
problems, here, that are in NP

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.240
but not in P. Think
about what this means.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.810
This is saying P are the
problems that we can actually

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.680
solve on a legitimate computer.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.950
NP are problems that we can
solve in this magical fairy

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:14.370
computer where all of
our dreams are granted.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.120
You say, oh, I don't
know which way to go.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.510
It doesn't matter because
the machine magically

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.400
tells you which way to go.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.210
If you're goal is
to get to a yes.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.930
So NP is a really powerful
model of computation.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:29.690
It's an insane model
of computation.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:32.100
No one in their right mind
would consider it legitimate.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.250
So obviously, it's
more powerful than P,

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.727
except we don't know
how to prove it.

00:32:37.727 --> 00:32:38.310
Very annoying.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.450
Other phrasings of
P does not equal

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.870
NP is-- these are my
phrasings, I them up-- you

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.090
can't engineer luck.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.160
You can believe in
luck, if you want.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.410
But it's not something
that we can build out

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.960
of a regular computer.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.545
That's the meaning
of this statement.

00:33:07.545 --> 00:33:09.485
And so I think most
people believe that.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:19.520
Another phrasing would
be that solving problems

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.460
is harder than
checking solutions.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.645
A more formal version is that
generating solutions or proofs

00:33:30.645 --> 00:33:37.510
of solutions can be
harder than checking them.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.860
Another phrasing is
it's harder to generate

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.550
a proof of a theorem
than it is to check

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.780
the proof of a theorem.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.400
We all know checking
the proof of a theorem

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.000
should be easy if you
write it precisely.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.420
Just make sure each step
follows from the previous ones.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.152
Done.

00:34:00.152 --> 00:34:01.610
But proving a
theorem, that's hard.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:02.550
You need inspiration.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.740
You need some clever idea.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:04.920
That's guessing.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.020
Inspiration equals luck equals
guessing, in this model.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.370
And that's hard.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.880
The only way we know is
to try all the proofs.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.270
See which of them work.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.350
So what the heck?

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:27.510
What could we possibly say?

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.020
This is all kind of weird.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.520
This would be the
end of the lecture

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.770
if you say, OK,
well we don't know.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:37.350
That's it.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.524
But thankfully-- I kind
of need this board.

00:34:41.524 --> 00:34:43.690
I also want this one, but
I guess I'll go over here.

00:34:48.364 --> 00:34:50.280
Fortunately, this is not
the end of the story.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:55.340
And we can say a lot
about things like Tetris.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.930
See I drew Tetris not
just in this regime.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.330
We're pretty sure Tetris
is between NP and P.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:06.480
That it's in NP minus P.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.830
So let me write that down.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:16.640
Tetris is in NP minus P. We
don't know that because we

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.070
don't know-- this
could be the empty set.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:26.040
What we do know
is that if there's

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:32.040
anything in NP minus P--
if they are different,

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.900
then-- if there's
anything in NP minus P,

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.060
then Tetris is one
of those things.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.760
That's why I drew
Tetris out there.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.800
It is, in a certain sense,
the hardest problem in NP.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.690
Tetris.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:49.550
Why Tetris?

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.809
Well, it's not just Tetris.

00:35:50.809 --> 00:35:53.100
There are a lot of problems
right at that little notch.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:57.220
But this is pretty interesting
because, while we can't figure

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.920
this out, most people
believe this is true.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.982
And so as long as you
believe in that-- as long

00:36:01.982 --> 00:36:05.920
as you have faith--
then you can prove

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.160
that Tetris is in NP minus P.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.650
And so it's hard.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.880
It's not in P, in this case.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:19.739
In particular, not in
P. That's kind of cool.

00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:21.780
How in the world do we
prove something like this?

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.910
It's actually not that hard.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:25.830
I mean it took us
several months,

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:29.640
but that's just months, whereas
this thing has been around

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.170
since, I guess, the '70s.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.030
P versus NP.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.760
Why is this true?

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.960
Because Tetris is NP-hard.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.420
What does NP-hard mean?

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:54.640
This means as hard as
every problem in NP.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.010
I can't say harder than
because it's non-strict.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.910
So it's at least as hard
as every problem in NP.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.580
And that's why I drew
it at the far right.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.340
It's sort of the
hardest extreme of NP.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.030
Among everything in NP
you can possibly imagine,

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.000
Tetris is as hard
as all of them.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.430
And therefore, if there's
anything that's harder than P,

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.350
then Tetris is going to be
harder than P because it's

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.700
as far to the right as possible.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.490
Either P equals NP, in which
case the picture is like this.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.920
Here's P. Here's NP.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.300
Tetris is still at the
right extreme, here.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.430
But it's less interesting
because it's still in P.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.590
Or the picture looks like
this, and NP is strictly

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:41.020
bigger than P. And then, because
Tetris is at the right extreme,

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.290
it's outside of P. So
we prove this in order

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.110
to establish this claim.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.630
Just to get some
terminology, what

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.940
is this NP-complete business?

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:09.550
Tetris is NP-complete,
which means two things.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.470
One is that it's NP-hard.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.960
And the other is
that it's in NP.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.340
So if you think of the
intersection, NP intersect

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.210
NP-hard, that's NP-complete.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:26.490
Let me draw on the picture
here what this means.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.140
So I'm going to
draw it on the top.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:39.720
This is NP-hard.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:46.040
Everything from here to
the right is NP-hard.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.922
NP-hard means it's at least
as hard as everything in NP.

00:38:48.922 --> 00:38:50.380
That means it might
be at this line

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.390
or it might be to the right.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.130
But in the case of Tetris,
we know that it's in NP.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.494
We proved that a
couple of times.

00:38:57.494 --> 00:38:59.535
And so we know that Tetris
is also in this range.

00:38:59.535 --> 00:39:01.850
And so if it's in this
range and in this range,

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:03.690
it's got to be right here.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:04.940
Completeness is nice.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.370
If you prove something
is something complete--

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:09.920
prove a problem is some
complexity class complete--

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.550
then you know sort of exactly
where it falls on this line.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.750
NP-complete means right here.

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.520
EXP-complete means right here.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.880
Turns out Chess is EXP-complete.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.710
EXP-hard is anything
from here over.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:30.670
EXP is anything from
here, over this way.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.335
Chess is right at
that borderline.

00:39:32.335 --> 00:39:34.512
It is the hardest
problem in EXP.

00:39:34.512 --> 00:39:35.970
And that's actually
the only way we

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:37.970
know to prove that it's not NP.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.970
It's is pretty easy to
show that EXP is bigger

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:43.770
than P. And Chess is the
farthest to the right in EXP--

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:47.800
of any problem in EXP-- and
so, therefore, it's not in P.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.350
So whereas this one-- these two,
we're not sure are they equal.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:55.190
This line we know is
different from this one.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:58.720
We don't know about
these two, though.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.550
Does NP equal EXP?

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.240
Not as famous.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.850
You won't get a million
dollars, but still a very big,

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.550
open question.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.590
What else do I wanna say?

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.020
Tetris, Chess, EXP-hard.

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:16.369
So these lines, here--
this is NP-complete

00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:17.410
And this is EXP-complete.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.015
So the last thing I want to
talk about is reductions.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.980
Reductions-- so how do you
prove something like this?

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.710
What is as hard as even mean?

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.230
I haven't defined that.

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:51.270
But it's not hard to define.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:53.130
In fact, it's a concept
we've seen already.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:21.380
Reductions are actually a
way to design algorithms

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.354
that we've been using
implicitly a lot.

00:41:24.354 --> 00:41:25.770
You may have even
heard this term.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.010
A bunch of recitations have
used the word reduction

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:29.970
for graph reduction.

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:31.770
You have some problem,
you convert it

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.590
into a graph problem, then you
just call the graph algorithm.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.830
You're done.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:36.760
That's reduction.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.820
In general, you have
some problem, A,

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.830
that you want to solve.

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:44.030
And you convert it into
some other problem, B,

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.182
that you already
know how to solve.

00:41:46.182 --> 00:41:47.890
It's a great tool
because, in this class,

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:50.630
you learn tons of algorithms
for solving tons of problems.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:55.070
Now, someone gives you,
in your job or whatever,

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.950
or you think about
some problem that you

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.180
don't know how to solve,
the first thing you should

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.000
do is-- can I convert
it into something

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.930
I know how to solve
because then you're done.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.721
Now it may not be the
best way to solve it,

00:42:04.721 --> 00:42:06.410
but at least it's
a way to solve it.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.015
Probably in polynomial time
because we think of B as things

00:42:09.015 --> 00:42:10.390
you can solve in
polynomial time.

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:13.160
Great.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:20.730
So just convert
problem A, which you

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:27.615
want to solve, into some problem
B that you know how to solve.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.370
That's reduction.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.460
Let me give you some examples
that we've already seen,

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.065
just to fit this into your
mental map of the class.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.060
It's kind of a funny one
but it's a very simple one.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.460
So how do you solve
unweighted shortest paths?

00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.810
In general?

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:00.670
Easy one.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.794
Give you a graph with no
weights on the edges and I

00:43:02.794 --> 00:43:04.466
want to the shortest
path from s to t.

00:43:04.466 --> 00:43:05.390
AUDIENCE: BFS

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:06.180
PROFESSOR: BFS.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.600
Linear time, right?

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.050
Well, that's if
you're smart or if you

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.250
feel like implementing BFS.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.380
Suppose someone
gave you Djikstra.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.125
Said, here, look, I've
got Djikstra code.

00:43:16.125 --> 00:43:17.375
You don't have to do anything.

00:43:17.375 --> 00:43:18.940
There's Djisktra
code right there.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.100
But Djikstra solves
weighted shortest path.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.160
I don't have any weights.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.960
What do I do?

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.140
Set the weights to 1.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.630
It's very easy, but
this is a reduction--

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.460
a simple example of reduction.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.330
Not the smartest of reductions,
but it's a reduction.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.780
So I can convert
unweighted shortest paths

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.750
into weighted shortest paths
by adding weights of 1.

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:44.320
Done.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.070
Adding weights of
0 would not work.

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.170
But weights of 1.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:47.900
OK.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.492
Weights of 2 also works.

00:43:49.492 --> 00:43:51.950
Pick your favorite number, but
as long as you're consistent

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:52.780
about it.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.520
That's a reduction.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.570
Here's some more
interesting ones.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:03.920
On the problems set--
problem set six--

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.205
there was this RenBook problem,
"I Can Haz Moar Frendz?"

00:44:08.205 --> 00:44:09.580
That was the name
of the problem.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:14.640
And the goal was
to solve-- to find

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.884
paths that minimize
the product of weights.

00:44:17.884 --> 00:44:19.300
But what we've
covered in class is

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.910
how to solve a problem when
it's the sum of weights.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:23.890
How do you do it?

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:26.070
In one word, or less?

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:26.990
Logs.

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:28.920
Just take logs.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.597
That converts
products into sums.

00:44:31.597 --> 00:44:32.930
Now you start to get the flavor.

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:37.150
This is a problem that you could
take Djikstra or Bellman-Ford,

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:39.390
and change all the
relaxation steps

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:42.470
and change it to work
directly with products.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:46.570
That would work,
but it's more work.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.200
You have to prove that
that's still correct.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.500
It's annoying to think about.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.660
And it's annoying to program.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.590
It's not modular,
blah, blah, blah.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:56.720
Whereas if you just
do this reduction,

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.990
you can use exactly the
code that you had before,

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:01.960
at the end.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.220
So that's nice.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.670
This is why
reductions are really

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.562
the most common algorithm design
technique because you don't

00:45:07.562 --> 00:45:10.020
want to implement an algorithm
for every single problem you

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:10.700
have.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.200
It would be nice if you could
reuse some of those algorithms

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.630
that you had before.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:17.100
Reductions let you do that.

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:21.680
Another one, which was on the
quiz in the true-false-- quiz

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.532
two-- was converting longest
path into shortest path.

00:45:25.532 --> 00:45:26.990
We didn't phrase
it as a reduction.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:29.730
It was just can you
solve longest path using

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:30.910
Bellman-Ford.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:31.832
And the answer is yes.

00:45:31.832 --> 00:45:33.165
You just negate all the weights.

00:45:33.165 --> 00:45:34.900
And that converts a
longest path problem

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.660
into a shortest path problem.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.310
Easy.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:43.030
Also on the quiz-- maybe I don't
need to write all of these down

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:45.200
because they're a little
bit weird problems.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.370
We made them up.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:50.220
There was the-- what was
the duck tour called?

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:50.990
Bird tours?

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.950
Bird tours?

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:52.700
Aviation tours?

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.610
Whatever.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.990
You want to visit a bunch of
sites in some specified order.

00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:58.990
The point in that problem
is you could reduce it

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:02.900
to a single shortest
paths query.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.682
And so if you already
have shortest path code,

00:46:05.682 --> 00:46:06.890
you don't have to think much.

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:08.400
You just do the
graph application.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.970
Done.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.600
Then there's the
leaky tank problem,

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.570
which is also a graph
reduction problem.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:16.570
You could represent all
these extra weird things

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.640
that were happening
in your car by just

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.202
changing the graph a little bit.

00:46:20.202 --> 00:46:21.660
And it's a very
powerful technique.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.860
In this class, we see it
mostly in graph reductions.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:28.120
But it could apply
all over the place.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.810
And while this is a powerful
technique for coming up

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.310
with new algorithms, it's
also a powerful technique

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:41.380
for proving things
like Tetris is NP-hard.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.830
So what we proved
is that a problem

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:49.600
called 3-Partition can
be reduced to Tetris.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:58.610
What's 3-Partition?

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.000
3-Partition is I
give you n numbers.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.930
I want to know can I
divide them into triples,

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.450
each of the same sum.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:07.780
So I have n numbers.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.170
Divide them into n
over 3 groups of 3,

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:14.030
such that the sum of
each of the 3s is equal.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:15.780
Sounds like an easy
enough problem.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.230
But it's an NP-complete problem.

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:22.950
And people knew that since
one of the first papers.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.790
I guess that was late
'70s, early '80s, by Karp.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.800
So Karp already proved
this is standing

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.410
on the shoulders of giants.

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.360
Karp proved 3-Partition
is NP-complete,

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.060
so I don't need to
think about that.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.210
All I need to
focus on is showing

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:43.470
that Tetris is harder
than 3-Partition.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.270
This is what I mean by harder.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:48.990
Harder means-- so when
I can reduce A to B,

00:47:48.990 --> 00:48:02.090
we say the A-- B is at least
as hard as A. Why's that?

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:05.820
Because I can solve A by solving
B. I just apply this reduction

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.570
and then solve B. So if I
had some good way to solve B,

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:11.110
it would turn into a
good way to solve A.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.940
Now 3-Partition-- which
is A, here-- we're

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.440
pretty sure there's no good
algorithm for solving this.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:22.900
Pretty sure it's not in P.
And so Tetris better not be P

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.430
either because if
Tetris were in P, then

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:27.140
we could just take
our 3-Partition,

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.990
reduce it to Tetris, and then
3-Partition would be in P.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:33.210
In fact, all of the
NP-complete problems,

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:36.470
you can reduce to each other.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.820
And so to show that something
is at that little position,

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.900
NP-complete, all
you need to do is

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.120
find some known
NP-complete problem

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.520
and reduce it to your problem.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.400
So reductions are super useful
for getting positive results

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.580
for making new
algorithms, but also

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.110
for proving negative results--
showing that one problem is

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:57.310
harder than another.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.080
And if you already
believe this is hard,

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.621
then you should
believe this is hard.

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:12.060
I think that's all I
really have time for.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.480
I'll give you a couple
more NP-complete problems.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.930
Kind of fun.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:18.896
Traveling salesman problem,
you may have heard of.

00:49:18.896 --> 00:49:20.020
Let's say you have a graph.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.040
And you want to find out
the shortest path that

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:25.770
visits all the vertices,
not just one vertex.

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:28.680
That's NP-complete.

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.680
We solved longest common
subsequence for two strings,

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.280
but if I give you
n strings that you

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.238
need to find the longest
common subsequence of,

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:37.730
that's NP-complete.

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:41.560
Minesweeper, Sudoku, most
puzzles that are interesting

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.990
are NP-complete.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:45.360
SAT.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:53.120
SAT is a-- I give you a Boolean
formula like x or y AND NOT

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.050
x-- something like that.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.499
I want to know is there some
setting of the variables that

00:49:57.499 --> 00:49:58.790
makes this thing come out true?

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:01.634
Is it possible to
make this true?

00:50:01.634 --> 00:50:02.800
That's NP-complete complete.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.310
This was actually
the first problem

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:05.610
that was shown NP-complete.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:06.880
There's this issue, right?

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.754
If I'm going to show
everything's NP-complete

00:50:08.754 --> 00:50:10.910
by reduction, how the
heck do I get started?

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:12.360
What's the first problem?

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.620
And this is the first problem.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.580
You could sort of prove it
by definition, almost, of NP,

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:19.480
here.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.760
But I won't do that.

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.610
Three coloring a graph.

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:25.280
Shortest paths.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.010
This is fun.

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:27.840
Shortest paths in
a graph is hard.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:30.620
But in the real world, we
live in a three dimensional,

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:31.880
geometric environment.

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.338
What if I want to
find the shortest

00:50:33.338 --> 00:50:35.620
path from this point,
where I am, to that point,

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.500
over on the ceiling
or something.

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.020
And I can fly.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.669
That's NP-complete.

00:50:41.669 --> 00:50:42.460
It's kind of weird.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.160
Shortest paths in a two
dimensional environment

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:44.743
is polynomial.

00:50:44.743 --> 00:50:47.532
It's a good thing that we are
on ground because, then, we

00:50:47.532 --> 00:50:48.990
can model things
by two dimensions.

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:50.470
We can model things by graphs.

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:53.500
But in 3D, shortest
paths is NP-complete.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.139
So all these things where
a problem-- knapsack,

00:50:56.139 --> 00:50:56.930
that's another one.

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:58.221
We've already covered knapsack.

00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.990
We saw a pseudo-polynomial
algorithm.

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.390
Turns out, you can't do
better than pseudo-polynomial

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:07.030
unless P equals NP because
knapsack is NP-complete.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.160
So there you go.

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.313
