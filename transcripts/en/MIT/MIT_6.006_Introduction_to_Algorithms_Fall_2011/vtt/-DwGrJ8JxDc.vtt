00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:22.510
PROFESSOR: The things we
can talk about today, we

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.000
can talk about this code.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.370
We can talk a little bit more
about the hash functions.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.170
And we can talk a little
bit more about amortization.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.519
What to do guys want to hear?

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.980
AUDIENCE: Amoritizaiton.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.920
PROFESSOR: OK, so one
vote for amortization.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.690
So who wants to look
at the PSET code?

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.810
Who wants to talk about hashes?

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.726
Who wants to talk
about amortization?

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:51.850
Two, three, four, five, OK.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.810
So then let's try this.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.970
Let's look at the PSET code then
talk about amortization a bit

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.920
at the end.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.570
I do have to talk a
little bit about hashes

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.489
though, because I owe someone
a question from last time.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.300
And the question was,
we have rolling hashes,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.210
so the hashes look like this.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.170
K where K is a big
number, modulo p.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.340
And we argue that it's
really nice if p is a prime.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.130
And then the question was, what
if instead p is 2 to the w,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.900
and is not prime, as long
as the base that we're using

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.070
is co-prime with p?

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.930
Does this work?

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.760
And the answer
is-- I didn't want

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.630
to say yes without making sure
that I don't say something

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.130
stupid-- but the
answer is yes, this

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.000
works just fine, because the
way a compute multiplicative

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.310
inverse is is you
use so something

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.745
called the extended
Euclid's method.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.350
And if we have b and p, then
if we compute their GCD,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:17.470
the that's the greatest common
divisor-- so GCD is greatest--

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:32.580
If you use extended Euclid you
get something like xb plus yp

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.340
equals GCD of b and p.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:48.500
So if this is 1, then you
have xb plus yp equals 1.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.250
And if you're working
modulo p, whatever that is,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.410
then you have that
xb is 1 mod p.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.100
So there's your
multiplicative inverse.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.840
Well so now that's
nice math, right?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.860
But that doesn't tell me
why are we not using this.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.465
So with the multiplicative
inverse would work,

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:12.840
but there's
something else that's

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.941
wrong with using 2 to the w.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.170
Will this give me a
good hash function?

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.300
OK, the fact that it's
p might be confusing.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:34.032
So let's say h equals
K mod 2 to the w.

00:03:34.032 --> 00:03:38.540
And remember that the K is
some digits in base b, right?

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.322
It's a big number made
out of digits in base b.

00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:52.390
So K is d1, d2, d3, all the way
up until d length in base b.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.550
And I'll make things easier
and say that b is 2 to the 8,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.810
because we're working with
ASCII characters, or colors,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.330
or something that
fits nicely in a bit.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.214
So what could go
wrong with using this?

00:04:11.214 --> 00:04:14.430
AUDIENCE: Well if your series
of-- if your K is bigger than

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.111
2-- if it's K is bigger
than 2 to the w--

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:18.444
PROFESSOR: It will be, for sure.

00:04:18.444 --> 00:04:20.694
AUDIENCE: Yes, that's the
problem, because then you'll

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:21.490
loop.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.060
You'll get the same hashes for--

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.430
So you will get-- So hashing
takes a lot of possible inputs

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.790
and maps them to a relatively
small set of outputs.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.230
Inputs hash output.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.650
And we argued last
time that we're

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.316
going to have collisions
no matter what,

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:47.540
because we have a ton of inputs
and not that many outputs.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.250
For example, if
we're hashing strings

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.650
that are a million
characters then this

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.600
is going to be 2 to the 8 to
the 1 million possible strings.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.740
And then the number
of possible values

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.890
is, if we're using the
word size, 2 to the 32.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.045
There is no way we can
design a function that

00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:09.500
will take this many inputs,
map them to this many outputs,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.270
and not do collisions.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.560
But instead, what do we want?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.893
What makes a good hash function?

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.770
Say my hash function
is 0 for all the K's.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.393
Is that a good hash function?

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:29.382
AUDIENCE: It's an
excellent hash function.

00:05:29.382 --> 00:05:30.715
PROFESSOR: What's wrong with it?

00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:32.655
AUDIENCE: You would
put everything in one

00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:36.050
so that it's searching, or
it would take a long time?

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.922
PROFESSOR: Yeah, searching
takes a long time.

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:40.630
And we've don't do
sorting with this yet.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.580
Searching takes a long
time, string sub-matching

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.121
will take a long
time, it's horrible.

00:05:46.748 --> 00:05:49.690
AUDIENCE: So what
would that distribute--

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.470
like [INAUDIBLE] over all--

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.220
PROFESSOR: All right,
so we want something

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.560
that looks sort of random.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.980
The ideals hash function
takes an input then

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.127
gives it a random output,
and then stays consistent.

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:04.210
So when it sees an input,
returns the same output.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.060
So I think distribute
is the keyword here.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.960
What's wrong with
this hash function?

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.650
If it takes random
data, it's going

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.820
to distribute it randomly.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.153
That's true, so that's all good.

00:06:24.153 --> 00:06:27.260
But what data that we
might see in real life

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.786
will make it behave badly?

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:34.690
AUDIENCE: The K is a series
of characters, right?

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.620
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.120
AUDIENCE: It just
could be anything.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.760
But we know for sure that
L will be larger than w.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.270
PROFESSOR: Say L is a million.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.495
AUDIENCE: OK, well that sucks.

00:06:46.495 --> 00:06:47.245
PROFESSOR: Oh, no.

00:06:47.245 --> 00:06:48.920
That in itself,
that doesn't suck.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.010
That's what let's us do
sub-string matching really

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.746
fast, even if we
have large strings.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.370
AUDIENCE: --say for
2 to the w, though,

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.909
because then it will be much
larger, like the number of--

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:58.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but that's OK.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.410
So I'm OK with doing this as
long as all the values here

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.375
are distributed sort
of uniformly here.

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:07.000
So that's fine.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.900
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.370
PROFESSOR: But there's-- I'm
arguing that there are some

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.660
values which will make this
hash function behave badly.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.770
And that those values are so
simple that we might see them

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.390
in real life.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.410
OK, what if all these
numbers are-- what

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.670
if all the digits are even?

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.820
So d is 0 mod 2.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.480
What happens to K?

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:47.880
AUDIENCE: Well, you're saying
that instead of 2 to the w,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.120
we're just using 2.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.392
PROFESSOR: So no, the
modulo is 2 to the w.

00:07:52.392 --> 00:07:55.070
Say it's 2 to the 32.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:01.630
So d are the digits that
make up my K. So what

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.160
if the base is 2 to the 8?

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.850
So I have digits from
0 to 255, 256 of them.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.990
And all the digits
are 0 modulo 2.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.640
For my sub-string
matching example,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.930
what if all the characters
in the sub-string are even?

00:08:22.698 --> 00:08:24.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.900
PROFESSOR: Not the same thing.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.850
But there's a problem.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.240
They will hash to-- so
if all the digits are

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.640
0 modulo 2 then
what about the K?

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.015
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
0 modulo 2--

00:08:39.015 --> 00:08:39.640
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.805
So it's just like when you
have numbers in base 10.

00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:50.520
10 happens to be divisible by 2.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.480
So if your last digit is even,
then the entire number is even.

00:08:57.451 --> 00:08:58.450
That makes sense, right?

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.820
That's math.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.230
Please nod, tell me
that I'm making sense.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.010
OK, so here, the base is 256.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.310
And it's also divisible by 2.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.010
So if your last digit
is divisible by 2,

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.100
then the whole number
is divisible by 2.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:19.090
So then if I take this
K modulo 2 to the 32

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.180
then the hash is also
going to be divisible by 2.

00:09:29.084 --> 00:09:32.048
AUDIENCE: Why does it matter
if the hash is divisible by 2?

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.550
PROFESSOR: So it
matters because this

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.430
is supposed to be
my universe, right?

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.490
These are supposed to
be all the outputs.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.344
And I'm saying that if
my inputs look like this,

00:09:46.344 --> 00:09:48.760
then the hash function will
not distribute them uniformly.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.470
Instead, if this is my
possible set of outputs,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.123
the hash function will always
put outputs in this half.

00:09:56.123 --> 00:09:58.200
So the outputs will
always be here.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.220
And these are the numbers
that are divisible by 2.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.297
So these are even,
and these are odd.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.140
And this area gets no love.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.070
Absolutely no number
will hash here.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.820
So--

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.900
AUDIENCE: Wait, what about
something with all odds?

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.902
AUDIENCE: Something
with all odd digits?

00:10:22.902 --> 00:10:23.860
AUDIENCE: Because
you're asking--

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.443
AUDIENCE: You have
all A's rather than

00:10:25.443 --> 00:10:28.597
all B's in your sub-string
or in your string.

00:10:28.597 --> 00:10:31.002
AUDIENCE: Or because
your last digit was odd.

00:10:31.002 --> 00:10:32.838
PROFESSOR: If all of
our digits are odd

00:10:32.838 --> 00:10:34.590
then the last digit is odd.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.341
And then you'd also get
something odd, right?

00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:38.966
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:38.966 --> 00:10:40.445
AUDIENCE: So there's a pattern.

00:10:40.445 --> 00:10:44.390
But there's an
even distribution.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.050
PROFESSOR: Well if your
hash function is always odd,

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.940
then it's not an
even distribution.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:51.728
It's--

00:10:51.728 --> 00:10:53.162
AUDIENCE: Wait,
our hash function?

00:10:53.162 --> 00:10:55.074
I thought we were
talking about--

00:10:55.074 --> 00:10:58.420
AUDIENCE: Isn't it
even if your K is even?

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.332
And if it's odd [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:00.332 --> 00:11:02.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that's bad.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.520
Because if all your K's
happens to be even--

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.130
say if you're doing
the nucleotides,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:15.020
and the nucleotides
are A, C, G, T.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:20.391
If they happen to be
encoded as, say, 0, 2, 4, 6,

00:11:20.391 --> 00:11:21.390
then these are all even.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.620
So the hash function
will always be even

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.889
and I'm wasting the last bit.

00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:30.930
So if I'm building a hash
table, half the entries

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:31.580
will be wasted.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.080
They'll never get
anything in there.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.390
I'm just wasting memory.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.090
AUDIENCE: So if
you could guarantee

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:43.887
that your inputs would
be evenly distributed--

00:11:43.887 --> 00:11:45.470
PROFESSOR: So if our
inputs are random

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.530
then the hash function--
most hash functions will

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.900
do a good job of
producing a random output.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.600
The problem is real life
inputs are not random.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.970
For example, if you
get-- asides from this--

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.960
if you get data from a camera,
so if you get your color pixels

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.880
from a camera, then
because of noise those

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.340
might have the last few bits,
always be the same thing.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.290
Also it seems like in
real life-- [INAUDIBLE],

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.585
in his book, argues about this.

00:12:13.585 --> 00:12:15.085
It seems like in
real life there are

00:12:15.085 --> 00:12:17.380
a lot of sequences that look
like that, that would make

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.006
your hash function
behave poorly.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.940
So again, the keyword
is distribute.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.340
If some non-random
property in the input

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.946
is reflected in the output,
then that's a bad hash function.

00:12:33.547 --> 00:12:35.130
AUDIENCE: Would you
gain a lot of time

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.460
from your mod operation?

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:45.580
Because in mod 2 to the n
you just truncate any bits

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.920
to the left of the n.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that's
why we would do this, right?

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.440
That's why we're even
considering this case.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.930
AUDIENCE: Because that'd be
really nice to be able to not--

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.705
PROFESSOR: So modulo is faster,
but in return my hash function

00:12:57.705 --> 00:12:59.780
is crap here.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.260
So usually we prefer-- it turns
out that in practice nicer hash

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.650
functions give better
speed improvements overall.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.992
So if you think of how a
hash is laid out in memory,

00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:13.450
you'll see that
because of caching.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.225
And everything gets better
to take more time on the mod

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:21.320
function and use up all your
memory for the hash table.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.740
So this is why we don't
use the and we use this.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.150
Not because of this argument.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.770
So a good question required a
lot of talking and remembering

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.620
what's a good hash function,
what's a bad hash function.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.120
Thank you.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.850
OK, let's look at the
code a little bit.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.520
Everyone looked at it, right?

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.490
So this time we have modules.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.490
We don't have everything
in one big file.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.240
Can someone tell me what are the
modules we care about, and why?

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.080
AUDIENCE: The problem
with the one's

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.070
we have to code ourselves.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.340
PROFESSOR: OK, let's
start with that.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.830
AUDIENCE: Sub-sequence hashes--
interval sub-sequence hashes.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.530
PROFESSOR: OK, so these
are all in DNA seq, right?

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:16.560
So the module is-- so
yeah, the PSET hopefully

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.030
says that you need to upload
this file because it's

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.250
the only file you'll
need to modify.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.650
So everything that we
need to write is here.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.130
Now pretty much everything
that's in that file

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.150
needs to be modified.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.870
So I'm not going
to list them out.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.526
What else do we want
to read in that PSET?

00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:37.390
AUDIENCE: Rolling [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.985
PROFESSOR: OK, where
is rolling hash?

00:14:38.985 --> 00:14:40.151
AUDIENCE: In the [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:58.195
PROFESSOR: So what's different
between the API in rolling hash

00:14:58.195 --> 00:15:00.230
and the API that we
talked about last time?

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.340
Yes?

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.732
AUDIENCE: Them having
the [INAUDIBLE] pop,

00:15:08.732 --> 00:15:09.708
or it would skip.

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:12.148
And that's something else
[INAUDIBLE] just has a slide,

00:15:12.148 --> 00:15:14.588
it puts everything
in one operation.

00:15:14.588 --> 00:15:19.160
PROFESSOR: All right, so
we have append and skip.

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:23.870
And we built some
beautiful code with that.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.060
And we looked at some
fancy math because of it.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.610
But it turns out
that for this PSET

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.740
we can get away with slide.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.270
And we started from slide
and built these two methods

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:35.800
last time.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.070
So I'm not going to
explain slide again.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.680
It's exactly what
we had in the code

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.550
before we started
breaking them up.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.760
OK so this is the rolling hash.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.470
It is good.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.810
Do we care about anything else?

00:16:00.099 --> 00:16:02.390
AUDIENCE: I guess you can
look at the rest of the code,

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.812
if you feel like it.

00:16:03.812 --> 00:16:05.770
PROFESSOR: You can look
at the rest of the code

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.350
if you feel like it, yep.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.325
So I highlighted one file
that might be useful,

00:16:10.325 --> 00:16:11.200
and that's Kfasta.py.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.540
That file has a
FASTA sequence class,

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.890
and that's reads from a
file and returns something.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.470
And the important thing is
it doesn't return a list.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.200
If you remember the doc
dists, doc dist 1 thorugh doc

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.460
dist 8 dot PI, fun times.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.070
What we had there was
we took the input file,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.199
and we read it all a list.

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:41.490
This time we're not doing that.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:45.250
We're writing, what, 20
lines of code instead of what

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.900
could be five lines of
code to read the input.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.332
Why is that?

00:16:49.332 --> 00:16:51.020
AUDIENCE: Less memory?

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.600
PROFESSOR: Less memory, OK.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.000
So if we're doing
it this way, chances

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.140
are that if we tried to shove
the whole input into memory,

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.657
it wouldn't fit.

00:17:00.657 --> 00:17:02.240
And it would crash
and you would get 0

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.406
on the test because of that.

00:17:03.406 --> 00:17:05.109
So that's not good.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.890
So what do we use instead?

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.609
Does anyone know what
this thing is called?

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:11.509
What this class is called?

00:17:11.509 --> 00:17:13.109
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.400
PROFESSOR: Iterator, very good.

00:17:27.873 --> 00:17:30.867
AUDIENCE: Why do
they call it FASTA?

00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:33.745
Because it goes faster?

00:17:33.745 --> 00:17:36.210
PROFESSOR: I think the
letters are a bio acronym.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.740
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.224
PROFESSOR: Does anyone,
does anyone do bio here?

00:17:42.224 --> 00:17:43.140
I've seen that before.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.319
So it's a bio thing.

00:17:44.319 --> 00:17:45.360
Let's not worry about it.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:45.901
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:49.464 --> 00:17:51.760
Or, your can use that
for any type of file.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.290
Like, you don't have to
use it just for bio files.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.090
PROFESSOR: Well,
presumably it's reads,

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.680
it takes advantage of the
format that they're stored in,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.320
and gives you a list
instead of something else.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.270
So how does an iterator work?

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.020
Suppose you're building
your own iterator.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.076
What do you have to implement?

00:18:08.076 --> 00:18:09.510
AUDIENCE: Iterator [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.760
PROFESSOR: OK, let's start
with next, that's the fun one.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.924
What does next do?

00:18:19.726 --> 00:18:22.530
AUDIENCE: It's like pop.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.390
PROFESSOR: OK, so it's
like pop in what way?

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.180
AUDIENCE: It gives you
the next character.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:27.763
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.465
And what happens when you're
at the end of the list?

00:18:38.465 --> 00:18:41.456
AUDIENCE: It stops.

00:18:41.456 --> 00:18:42.931
PROFESSOR: How do you stop?

00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:44.374
AUDIENCE: It raises
an exception?

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.430
PROFESSOR: So next will
either return an element,

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.740
that's the next
element in the sequence

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.870
that you're iterating over.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.410
Or it will raise a stop
iteration exception

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.720
error to stop iteration, cool.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.100
So what's the other method?

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.815
Someone said it
before, say it again.

00:19:12.815 --> 00:19:13.440
AUDIENCE: Iter.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.106
PROFESSOR: Iter.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:19.810
What does this do
in an iterator?

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.227
AUDIENCE: It returns itself.

00:19:26.227 --> 00:19:27.560
PROFESSOR: All right, very good.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.308
In an iterator this is how you
will implement it all the time.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:39.325
Does anyone know what's
the point of iter?

00:19:39.325 --> 00:19:41.177
AUDIENCE: So you can
return an iterator?

00:19:41.177 --> 00:19:44.110
Because that's what it
told us to do in the PSET.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:47.050
PROFESSOR: OK, so iter
returns and iterator.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:51.830
But it doesn't-- you don't
have to start from an iterator.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.680
You can start from any object.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.120
And if it has a
method iter, then it

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.560
should give you an iterator
that iterates over that object.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:05.570
So if you have something like
a list-- 1, 2, 3, 4-- then

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.670
if you call iter on this,
you'll get an iterator for it,

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.260
hopefully, right?

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.930
And this is what Python
uses when you say for i in.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.430
So behind the scenes, whatever
object you give it here,

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.890
gets an iter call.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.840
And then that
produces an iterator.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.060
And then Python calls next
until stop iteration happens.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.100
So you can write
an iterator that

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.550
almost behaves like a list.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.310
You can use it in these
[INAUDIBLE] instructions,

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.380
and it works as
if it was a list,

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.160
except it uses a lot less
memory, because it computes

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.140
the elements.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.267
Hopefully every
time next is called,

00:20:49.267 --> 00:20:51.600
you're computing the next
element that you're returning.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.808
If you're storing everything
in a list then returning

00:20:53.808 --> 00:20:56.365
the elements that way, that's
not the very smart iterator.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.150
OK let's look at the last page.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.100
So the last page has
an iterator on top.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.450
And the iterator
computes-- given a list,

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.550
it computes the
reverse of that list.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.101
And you can see that it
doesn't reverse the list

00:21:16.101 --> 00:21:17.850
and then keep the
reversed list in memory.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.430
Instead, every
time you call next,

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.790
it does some magic
with the indexes--

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.410
I think the magic
is called math--

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:28.020
and then it return something
for as long as it can.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.640
So this is how you
implement reverse

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.140
without producing a new list.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:37.360
If the original list was
order, say had n elements, then

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.260
if you'd produce a new list,
you'd consume order and memory.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.439
This think consumes
order 1 memory,

00:21:42.439 --> 00:21:44.480
and the running time is
the same, asymptotically.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.340
OK, any question on iterators?

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:57.690
AUDIENCE: So it's going
from the very end,

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:02.590
oh, to the very beginning,
and then it's stepping back.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.360
PROFESSOR: So
reverse, if I give it

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:09.055
the list 1, 2, 3, 4, I want
reverse to give it back 4, 3,

00:22:09.055 --> 00:22:10.826
2, 1.

00:22:10.826 --> 00:22:12.450
Except it's not going
to return a list,

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.210
it's going to return
something that I can use here.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.290
AUDIENCE: Mm hm, ah, OK.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.348
PROFESSOR: OK, yes.

00:22:19.348 --> 00:22:21.838
AUDIENCE: Is it ever
possible to, sort of,

00:22:21.838 --> 00:22:25.324
rewind the iterator to
like, sort of, reset it?

00:22:25.324 --> 00:22:28.544
PROFESSOR: OK, is it?

00:22:28.544 --> 00:22:29.476
AUDIENCE: No.

00:22:29.476 --> 00:22:30.410
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.050
So Python iterators are simple.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.155
All you can do is go forward.

00:22:34.155 --> 00:22:34.999
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:34.999 --> 00:22:36.540
PROFESSOR: The reason
that is good is

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.330
because you can use
them for streams.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.380
So if you get data from a
file, or if you can get data

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.350
from the network, you can
wrap it in an iterator.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.140
If you wanted to support
resume on data that you

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.544
get from the network, you'd
have to buffer all the data.

00:22:50.544 --> 00:22:52.002
AUDIENCE: So you
would have to call

00:22:52.002 --> 00:22:53.670
the iter about that again and--

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.710
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.700
Yeah, if you want to rewind,
get another iterator.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.530
OK, that's a good
question, thank you.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.280
So these are iterators.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.450
Now we're going to go over
some Python magic, which

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.730
is called generators.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.050
So look at the iterator
code, and then look

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.980
at the equivalent
code right below it.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:20.270
So 12 lines of Python turned
into three lines of Python

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.310
that do exactly the same thing.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.340
So the reverse method
will return an object

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.650
that is an iterator, and
that you can use just

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.620
like the iterator in
the reverse class.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.480
Do people understand
what that code does?

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.180
If you do I'm so out
of here, we're done.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.630
AUDIENCE: What does yield do?

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.270
PROFESSOR: What does yield do?

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.855
All right, that's the hard
question, what does yield do?

00:23:53.855 --> 00:23:57.180
I will probably spend the rest
of the session on the answer

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.070
to that question.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.370
You're asking all the
had questions today, man.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:06.820
So yield, does anyone know
conceptually what yield does?

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.940
Not in detail, just
what's it supposed

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.840
to do so that the rest
of the code works?

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.639
Yes.

00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:13.180
AUDIENCE: If you're
driving someplace

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.150
and there's a yield
sign, you pause.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.290
PROFESSOR: OK, Python yield.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.270
So I like the word
pause in there.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.420
The word pause is useful.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:26.140
So say, instead of
implementing this,

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.330
say we're implementing
sub-sequence hashes.

00:24:32.494 --> 00:24:35.392
AUDIENCE: It kind of spit
something out, but keeps going.

00:24:35.392 --> 00:24:37.807
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:24:37.807 --> 00:24:39.586
AUDIENCE: Returns [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:39.586 --> 00:24:41.460
PROFESSOR: OK, so suppose
you're implementing

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.420
sub-sequence hashes.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:47.678
What's the worst, worst possible
way you could implement this?

00:24:47.678 --> 00:24:48.885
AUDIENCE: Return a list.

00:24:48.885 --> 00:24:50.990
PROFESSOR: OK, so the worst,
worst way is to go all the way,

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.900
brute force, don't use
the rolling hashes,

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.170
don't use anything.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.210
The next best way is
to make a list, right?

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.030
So you're going to start
with an empty list.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:09.670
Then you're going to use the
rolling hash in some way.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:16.540
And in some loop you're
going to say list.append e.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:21.120
And then you're going
to return the list.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.440
Does this makes sense?

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.265
OK, what's the problem
with this code?

00:25:26.265 --> 00:25:28.570
AUDIENCE: You're going
to have a huge list.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.510
PROFESSOR: Going to
have a huge list.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:36.900
So the way we fix it with
iterators is we remove this,

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:46.240
we replace this with yield
e, and we remove this.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.010
And now it's a generator.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:51.520
And now this consumes a
constant amount of memory,

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.400
instead of building a list.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.870
And as long as you only want
an iterator out of this method,

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.557
you'll get the right thing.

00:26:00.557 --> 00:26:02.640
Your code will still work
in exactly the same way.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.460
OK, so the big question is
what does this guy do, right?

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.870
This is where the magic is.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.190
So I already said,
as a first hint,

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.920
that this guy will
return an iterator.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:27.690
So can someone try to imagine
their Python, and see this?

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.540
So suppose it's your
Python, you see this.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.530
What do you do?

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.454
AUDIENCE: You wait for some sort
of command of some sort, right?

00:26:35.454 --> 00:26:37.120
PROFESSOR: No, let's
try something else.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.480
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.880
PROFESSOR: So the
execution of this pauses.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.620
What happens?

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.260
So we're looping
somewhere, we got a yield.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.261
We stop, what's the
first thing we do?

00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:52.620
AUDIENCE: Spit out e.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.974
PROFESSOR: So you're saying
you return e from this guy?

00:26:55.974 --> 00:26:58.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
out e [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.473
PROFESSOR: So I want
to return something--

00:27:01.473 --> 00:27:03.950
I want to return
something else from this.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.460
So I want to use this as
if it was a list, yes?

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.496
AUDIENCE: We store e somewhere.

00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:09.870
PROFESSOR: OK,
store e somewhere.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.682
AUDIENCE: Do you return
the pointer of e?

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.240
PROFESSOR: Almost, so
there's a word for the object

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.260
that I'm returning.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.350
So I want to use it
as if it was a list.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.180
So I want to pretend that I had
returned list in this method,

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.100
right?

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.424
So what's the closest thing
to a list that I can return.

00:27:30.424 --> 00:27:31.398
AUDIENCE: An iterator.

00:27:31.398 --> 00:27:33.920
PROFESSOR: An iterator,
thank you, all right.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.665
So we will grab some
information from here.

00:27:39.756 --> 00:27:42.190
We'll put it in a nice box.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:48.590
And that box will
behave like an iterator.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.890
OK, so the first thing,
someone said put e away,

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:58.900
so that's when we call next
we're going to spit that out.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.570
What else do I need to put away?

00:28:07.304 --> 00:28:08.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.750
PROFESSOR: Yep, so
this is a lot of magic.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.830
This tiny box actually
has a lot of magic in it.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.320
Because when I call
next, I want to get e.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.310
But I want to come back
here and keep going, right?

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.030
So I have my code that's
using the iterator.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.860
And there's this code
here, that's sort of

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.330
in a frozen state.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.960
Did you guys see any movies
where people are frozen up

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.710
and then, in the
future, they're unfrozen

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.582
and they start moving again?

00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:38.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] movies.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.530
PROFESSOR: All right, cool.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.450
So this is like that, this
takes up the whole function,

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.540
freezes it up and
puts it in a box here.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.350
And it returns an iterator that
can use the box in the future.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.380
So when you call
next, it gives e,

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.740
which is the guy
that you put in here.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.760
And then it take the
function out of the box,

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.460
unfreezes it, and
lets it run again

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.000
until it hits yield again.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.060
Then what happens the
next time it hits yield?

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.980
So, you're looping, and
you're yielding again.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.135
And say this time
you're yielding.

00:29:15.135 --> 00:29:16.510
AUDIENCE: Just do
the same thing?

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.218
AUDIENCE: Do you put
it in that iterator?

00:29:18.218 --> 00:29:19.600
Or do you make another iterator?

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.040
PROFESSOR: Same iterator.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.260
So while this is
looping, the code outside

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.780
should get the values
that it's yielding.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.210
So this has to behave
as one iterator.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.690
So the code is
unfrozen, it's allowed

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.840
to execute until it
says yield again.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.180
And then it says yield
with a new element.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.440
I put this guy in the box.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.390
Then I return the old guy as
the return value for next.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.147
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:29:45.147 --> 00:29:46.730
PROFESSOR: And then
it's frozen again.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:50.049
So this guy's still
in a frozen state.

00:29:50.049 --> 00:29:52.090
In the movies, I think
you're only unfrozen once.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.170
And then you keep going, right?

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.295
And there's a happy ending.

00:29:54.295 --> 00:29:56.000
Where here, every
time you call yield

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.560
you're frozen again,
until someone calls next.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.480
Does this make sense?

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.760
AUDIENCE: It's kind
of like Groundhog Day.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.980
PROFESSOR: Yes, except
you're allowed to go forward.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.141
So this keeps going forward.

00:30:12.141 --> 00:30:13.140
AUDIENCE: --up, thought.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.645
So it's looping.

00:30:14.645 --> 00:30:16.421
It's the same day, really.

00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:17.920
It's doing different
things, though.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.586
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:18.586 --> 00:30:20.920
But all your state is saved.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.330
So there, some of the
state is rolled back.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.072
Here all the state is saved.

00:30:25.072 --> 00:30:26.056
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:26.056 --> 00:30:29.410
PROFESSOR: OK, but if that
analogy helps, keep it.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:32.700
AUDIENCE: When you call
next, are you computing e

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.895
or e prime to be returned?

00:30:33.895 --> 00:30:35.520
PROFESSOR: So when
you're calling next,

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.952
you're computing e
prime and returning e.

00:30:38.952 --> 00:30:41.657
AUDIENCE: So the value you
get from next is pre-computed?

00:30:41.657 --> 00:30:43.490
PROFESSOR: So the value
you get form next is

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:46.386
what you yielded before.

00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:50.210
AUDIENCE: Wait, so you would
just take some sequence hashes

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.300
instance of that, and then
just by putting in yield,

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.410
now it's magically
become an iterator

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.090
and you can call
that next on it?

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:57.920
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.787
And inside, you don't have to
know that it's an iterator.

00:31:00.787 --> 00:31:02.620
So you don't have a
method next here, right?

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.940
I don't implement
next or iter here.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.230
I write this as if it's
printing stuff to the output.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.640
You can think of
yield is a print.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.500
If you wanted an
iterator, then pretend

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.740
you're printing what you
want to iterate over.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.990
And instead of saying
print you say yield.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.090
And then you use that.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.502
OK, now what happens
when we're done?

00:31:22.502 --> 00:31:23.960
What happens when
this loop is done

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.410
and you return from this method?

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.650
We said there's no return value.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:30.750
AUDIENCE: It raises a stop?

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.430
PROFESSOR: So when
we return, it's

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.330
going to keep in-- have to
remember that it's done, right?

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.180
And the first time, it
has some element here

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.760
that it has to return.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.230
So every time you call yield we
put a new element in the box,

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.580
and return the old one.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.620
So now we would
return the old one.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:01.730
We've returned e prime, take it
out, and put done in the box.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.310
So in the future, if
next is called again,

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:11.510
raise stop iteration.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.680
No more freezing, unfreezing,
because we're done.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.304
We're returned.

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:21.470
AUDIENCE: So if you called next
it would just give you nothing?

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.762
PROFESSOR: It has to
raise this exception.

00:32:23.762 --> 00:32:26.220
AUDIENCE: So you mean,
like-- oh, so it-- oh, I see.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.257
It would give you red text then?

00:32:28.257 --> 00:32:30.007
PROFESSOR: If you
called it directly, yes,

00:32:30.007 --> 00:32:32.140
it would give you red text.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:32.930
Yes?

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:37.603
AUDIENCE: So this takes
a sequence or a list,

00:32:37.603 --> 00:32:40.561
not another iterator, ever?

00:32:40.561 --> 00:32:42.045
PROFESSOR: This?

00:32:42.045 --> 00:32:43.530
What's this?

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.520
This other code here?

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:46.995
PROFESSOR: Not necessarily.

00:32:46.995 --> 00:32:49.410
AUDIENCE: Or you could
give it a procedure.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:50.910
PROFESSOR: I can
give it an iterator

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.050
if I'm iterating
over it using for-in.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:55.540
AUDIENCE: Like, for something
in one iterator, yield

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.532
that something, and
then [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:57.532 --> 00:33:00.329
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:33:00.329 --> 00:33:01.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a good point.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:04.114
I'll get to that
later, when we talk

00:33:04.114 --> 00:33:05.780
about how we're going
to solve the PSET.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.570
No, we're not solving
the PSET for you.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.661
But we'll talk about
it a little bit.

00:33:09.661 --> 00:33:10.910
But yeah, that's a good point.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.210
So there's no
reason why you can't

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.250
have an argument here that,
either a list or an iterator,

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.070
and then you're
iterating over it.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.345
And then you have
nested generators.

00:33:20.345 --> 00:33:23.160
So you have generators
returned in other generators,

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.080
and you have a whole
chain of things

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.492
happening when you say next.

00:33:26.492 --> 00:33:28.325
AUDIENCE: Wait, so this
is a generator then,

00:33:28.325 --> 00:33:32.330
because it produces-- well
it is an iterator though?

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.770
PROFESSOR: So a generator
returns an iterator

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:36.680
from this method.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.960
So a generator acts
like an iterator,

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.050
except when you call next,
it unfreezes this code here,

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.724
and it let's it run.

00:33:43.724 --> 00:33:46.045
AUDIENCE: But I mean, it's
basically an iterator then?

00:33:46.045 --> 00:33:46.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.695
AUDIENCE: But we're just
calling it a generator because--

00:33:48.695 --> 00:33:50.240
PROFESSOR: Because
there's a lot more magic.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:50.820
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.980
PROFESSOR: So an iterator
just says next and iter.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.250
This is all that an
iterator is, nothing more.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.520
Any object that has these
two methods is an iterator.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.940
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:07.080
PROFESSOR: Now a generator
is a piece of Python magic

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.310
that let's you write
shorter iterators.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.580
So three lines, as
opposed to 13 lines.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.980
And we came up
with a way to turn

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.110
in a code that
would build a list,

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.980
and easily turn it into a
code that uses a generator,

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.717
and that uses constant memory
instead of building that list.

00:34:24.717 --> 00:34:27.113
AUDIENCE: OK, now I know
how an iterator functions.

00:34:27.113 --> 00:34:27.904
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.820
OK, do generators
make sense now?

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.659
Yes.

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:36.450
AUDIENCE: If you wanted
to loop through all

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:38.752
of the values in a
generator, do you just

00:34:38.752 --> 00:34:40.480
wait until the
exception's raised?

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.880
Or should you, like, keep
track of how many things

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.902
are going to be
in that generator?

00:34:44.902 --> 00:34:46.610
PROFESSOR: So, when
you have a generator,

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.777
you'd have no idea how
many things there are.

00:34:48.777 --> 00:34:49.610
That's a good point.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:53.716
So you're wondering if I have
an iterator, say any iterator,

00:34:53.716 --> 00:34:56.340
not necessarily a generator, how
do I know how many things it's

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.390
going to return, right?

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.200
Do I have ln?

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.060
I do not have ln.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:05.410
So an iterator does not have ln.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:08.850
So you have to
iterate through it.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:14.760
And most importantly, some
iterators can never return.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.070
So you can have an iterator
that streams data for you

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.500
across the network.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.550
Or you can have an iterator
that iterates over the Fibonacci

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:22.572
numbers.

00:35:22.572 --> 00:35:24.030
That's an infinite
sequence, right?

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.030
It's never going to end.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:28.700
So ln would not even
be defined then.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.335
Good question, I like it.

00:35:30.335 --> 00:35:33.897
AUDIENCE: Is there an is-next
method for either iterators

00:35:33.897 --> 00:35:35.090
or generators?

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:36.456
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:35:36.456 --> 00:35:39.497
This is what you get,
if there is no in.

00:35:39.497 --> 00:35:40.930
AUDIENCE: If that
is mature then--

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:42.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.990
So in Java you have
this belief that you

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:46.477
shouldn't get exceptions.

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:48.310
You should be able to
check for them, right?

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:49.860
So maybe that's
why you're asking.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.565
So if people coming from Java
know that any time a method

00:35:52.565 --> 00:35:53.940
raises an exception,
there should

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.110
be another method that tells
you whether this first method is

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.920
going to raise an
exception or not.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.820
In Python the exception
is just raised.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.470
So exceptions are not
a lot more expensive

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.950
than regular instructions,
because we're

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.060
using an interpreted
language, and it's already

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.150
reasonably slow.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.280
So it can do exceptions
for free, yay.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.340
So this is how it works.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.706
This is how for-in works.

00:36:14.706 --> 00:36:16.830
Every time you do a for-in,
an exception is raised.

00:36:19.517 --> 00:36:21.350
AUDIENCE: We don't have
to catch that, then?

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.430
PROFESSOR: Nope, the
for-in catches it for you.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.710
AUDIENCE: That's tricky stuff.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.820
PROFESSOR: But it's
nice because then you

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.360
can build any iterator
that acts like a list.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.600
And then you can do
even more fancy stuff,

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.650
and build a generator.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.710
And you're using constant memory
instead of order and memory

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:45.140
for producing an
order and size list.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:45.900
Yes?

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:52.280
AUDIENCE: So if we get
passed in an iterator

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:57.696
and then just yielded
what we passed in, yielded

00:36:57.696 --> 00:36:59.986
the iterator, would
that just, essentially,

00:36:59.986 --> 00:37:04.054
delay everything by one?

00:37:04.054 --> 00:37:06.470
PROFESSOR: So you're yielding
the iterator as next, right?

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:07.240
AUDIENCE: What?

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:07.520
Yeah.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.890
PROFESSOR: You want to
yield the iterator as next.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.760
Because if you yield
the iterator object,

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.676
you're going to return
that object every time.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.802
So you're thinking
of something that--

00:37:16.802 --> 00:37:18.260
AUDIENCE: So you
need to increase--

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.550
PROFESSOR: You'll
yield up next, right?

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.270
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.290
PROFESSOR: You can have a method
that says this is the method.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.664
And then you take
in an iterator.

00:37:23.664 --> 00:37:25.780
And then you yield it up next.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.102
But then you'll, basically,
get the same thing.

00:37:28.102 --> 00:37:29.143
AUDIENCE: The same thing.

00:37:29.143 --> 00:37:31.744
But is it delayed by one or no?

00:37:31.744 --> 00:37:32.454
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:37:32.454 --> 00:37:35.070
No, so you have to
work through this

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.616
to convince yourself
that it's not delayed.

00:37:37.616 --> 00:37:38.990
So if it would be
delayed by one,

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.330
what's the first thing
that you're yielding.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:41.330
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.865
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so no delay.

00:37:42.865 --> 00:37:43.770
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.320
PROFESSOR: OK, cool.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.990
So let's see, what do
we have to implement

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:52.280
in DNA seq, sub-sequence hashes.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.830
Do people have an idea of
how to implement that now?

00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:59.030
Yes?

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.380
Does it make sense for everyone?

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.230
So you build it as if
you were building a list,

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:07.570
and then you use
yield to make it fast.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.400
And by fast I mean less memory.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.305
OK, how about interval
sub-sequence hashes?

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.551
The one below.

00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:19.380
AUDIENCE: Is that just
like rolling hash,

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.826
except you, like, have
a step in your range?

00:38:22.826 --> 00:38:25.920
PROFESSOR: OK, so it's like
having a step in your range.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.240
So how can you do that?

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.600
What's one way of doing it?

00:38:34.012 --> 00:38:35.488
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] hashes?

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.160
PROFESSOR: Did anyone
solve the PSET yet?

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.840
Yes, OK how did you guys do it?

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.180
Wait, no.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.100
That's a bad question because
you guys can answer too much.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.200
So interval sub-sequence hashes
versus sub-sequence hashes.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.780
Did you copy paste the code?

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.520
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.205
PROFESSOR: OK, so one
way of doing it is copy

00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:01.422
and pasting the code.

00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:03.630
The problem if you copy
paste the code is then you're

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:04.290
not DRY.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:09.360
There's this engineering
thing-- DRY means do not

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.630
repeat yourself.

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:12.750
So if you're not DRY,
if you copy paste,

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.280
then suppose you
find the bug later.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.530
Suppose you run the big test
and it crashes somewhere.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.600
And you fix a bug in
sub-sequence hashes.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.190
AUDIENCE: Oh, we're
supposed to, like,

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:24.175
call sub-sequence hashes from
interval sub-sequence hashes,

00:39:24.175 --> 00:39:24.675
right?

00:39:24.675 --> 00:39:27.656
PROFESSOR: That's another
way of doing it that is DRY.

00:39:27.656 --> 00:39:29.530
So this way you're not
copy pasting the code.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.272
AUDIENCE: We're
inlining the code.

00:39:32.272 --> 00:39:34.560
PROFESSOR: You're inlining
it manually, right?

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.430
All right.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:38.672
So the problem, if you
do this on a large scale,

00:39:38.672 --> 00:39:40.130
like when you go
work somewhere, is

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:43.010
that you end up with 20
copies of the same code.

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:46.970
And then five of them have
bug fixes and the other 15

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:50.120
don't, because people
forgot where they are.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.760
So ideally, try to
keep your code DRY.

00:40:00.086 --> 00:40:03.466
AUDIENCE: So, basically,
a list of tuples, right?

00:40:03.466 --> 00:40:04.924
PROFESSOR: OK, so
a list of tuples.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.488
What does a tuple have?

00:40:10.488 --> 00:40:16.940
AUDIENCE: The index at which
the sub-sequence operates?

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.040
PROFESSOR: So two
indexes, right?

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.780
The index in the first
sub-sequence, say--

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:31.110
PROFESSOR: OK, say i1 and then
the index in a second sequence,

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.926
for the same
sub-sequence, r right?

00:40:32.926 --> 00:40:40.686
And then i1, i2 prime, i1, i2
second, so on and so forth.

00:40:40.686 --> 00:40:42.060
So you have the
same sub-sequence

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.650
in the first sequence matches
more things in the second one.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.594
This is how you're
supposed to return them.

00:40:48.594 --> 00:40:50.550
AUDIENCE: Does the order matter?

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.496
PROFESSOR: I hope not.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.700
OK, any questions on this?

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.080
We went through generators fast.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.580
You guys are smart.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.080
Yes?

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.480
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
how the imaging works?

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.840
Like, how they create the
[INAUDIBLE] on tuples.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.800
PROFESSOR: No.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.280
PROFESSOR: Sorry, I do not know.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.360
AUDIENCE: Wait, which part?

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.415
AUDIENCE: So we
yield the tuples.

00:41:20.415 --> 00:41:24.027
But I don't really get how they
come up with the image from it.

00:41:24.027 --> 00:41:25.110
AUDIENCE: From the tuples?

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:29.011
Oh, I mean, I guess
they're probably values.

00:41:29.011 --> 00:41:30.386
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
because I thought

00:41:30.386 --> 00:41:36.720
if you compared two strings of
DNA that had the exact same,

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.360
I thought it would be
like a diagonal line down,

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.980
not just a small black box.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.140
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.516
AUDIENCE: So I don't
think I'm understanding

00:41:46.516 --> 00:41:49.980
how they, like, image it.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:56.590
PROFESSOR: So you're
supposed to get--

00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:01.120
your image has some
things here, and a match

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.480
is going to give you a
big diagonal line that's

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.020
stronger than
everything else, right?

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.010
AUDIENCE: It's
really fanned out.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.676
PROFESSOR: Well I
don't have thin chalk.

00:42:09.676 --> 00:42:12.830
AUDIENCE: No, no, there's like
one really dark black box,

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.310
that's like really black.

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:18.510
So I thought that meant that
all the tuples are there,

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.218
and everything else
is just kind of gray.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.090
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:27.580
I will have to
think about that--

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.955
AUDIENCE: --supposed
to be there.

00:42:28.955 --> 00:42:30.664
Is it like a
notation thing, or--

00:42:30.664 --> 00:42:33.080
PROFESSOR: I think that black
box is supposed to be there.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.180
Did anyone try comparing
two things that

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.680
shouldn't match, like
the dog and the monkey?

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.488
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:39.488 --> 00:42:41.594
And the entire
thing was like dark.

00:42:41.594 --> 00:42:42.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.190
AUDIENCE: --against, like,
two same DNAs everything

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:47.019
was very light.

00:42:47.019 --> 00:42:50.674
And there was like a very,
very light gray line.

00:42:50.674 --> 00:42:53.890
But I thought that
would be like black.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:56.630
PROFESSOR: So I think
how black it is means

00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:00.134
relative to all the
sub-sequences, how long it is--

00:43:00.134 --> 00:43:02.050
how long the sub-sequence
you're recording is.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:06.290
Either that or how many.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.873
There is a function
somewhere in there

00:43:07.873 --> 00:43:11.180
that computes the intensity
of a pixel, that's

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.085
square root of order
4 of something.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:21.261
OK, and I can look at
that now and tell you.

00:43:21.261 --> 00:43:22.704
AUDIENCE: It's OK.

00:43:22.704 --> 00:43:25.110
It's not super important.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.390
PROFESSOR: Or we can talk about
amortized analysis for a bit.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:29.040
Yay!

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.110
Let's talk about
amortized analysis.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:35.660
So this is what you're supposed
to get, that's what matters.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:36.535
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:00.160
PROFESSOR: OK, so
amortized analysis,

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.385
what's the example that
we talked about in class?

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.160
AUDIENCE: It's like
list expansion?

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:13.500
PROFESSOR: OK, so you
have-- you have a list.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.073
And we know that the list is
stored as an array, right?

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:24.740
So this means that you can
do indexing in constant time.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.900
So if you want to get the
first element, order 1.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.680
If you want to get the
millionth element, order 1.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.790
This is not true if you
had a link list instead.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:37.380
The millionth element
would be order a million.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.706
So this is an array.

00:44:39.706 --> 00:44:41.300
What do we implement?

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.530
What's the operation that
we implement on this list?

00:44:46.278 --> 00:44:47.710
AUDIENCE: Insert--

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.635
PROFESSOR: Insert, append, push.

00:44:49.635 --> 00:44:54.480
Let's go for append, because
that's what Python calls it.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.060
OK, so append puts an element
at the end of the list, right?

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.170
So how does append work?

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.356
AUDIENCE: The array is not full.

00:45:05.356 --> 00:45:07.636
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:07.636 --> 00:45:11.040
So say I have some
count variable here.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:23.060
So if the length of the
array is bigger than count

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.943
then what do I do?

00:45:24.943 --> 00:45:26.942
AUDIENCE: Then we
can directly insert.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.426
And because we're
looking up in an array

00:45:32.426 --> 00:45:34.730
and we're doing constant time.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.472
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:37.472 --> 00:45:39.430
AUDIENCE: And so an order
amount of information

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:42.230
in x [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.980
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.870
AUDIENCE: Order amount of
information of x [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:45.598
Or do we just--

00:45:45.598 --> 00:45:47.389
PROFESSOR: Let's say
this is our reference,

00:45:47.389 --> 00:45:48.347
so it's constant time.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.420
AUDIENCE: Otherwise we don't
have enough room in our array.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.112
So we need to make it bigger.

00:45:56.112 --> 00:45:56.695
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:06.030
So we have array 2
becomes new array

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:14.810
of size 2 times count, right?

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:16.587
Copy everything from--

00:46:16.587 --> 00:46:17.920
AUDIENCE: --length of the array.

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.962
I guess they're the same.

00:46:18.962 --> 00:46:20.420
PROFESSOR: I hope
they're the same.

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.270
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.116
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I'd say that.

00:46:23.116 --> 00:46:35.420
So copy from array to--
let's do this-- to array 2.

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:40.130
And then array 2 becomes array.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.710
And then this code
here goes here, right?

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:49.540
So there's a better way
to write this if statement

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.210
so the code isn't duplicated.

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:57.180
OK, so if the length is bigger
than how many elements I have,

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.470
if I still have room in
the array, what's the cost?

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:02.360
What's the running time?

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.201
Constant.

00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:05.589
Oh, let's put it on the left.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.168
OK, if I have to resize
the array, what's the cost?

00:47:13.168 --> 00:47:14.043
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.630
PROFESSOR: So, if I did an
operations, what then, right?

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.980
N is the size of the array.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.970
If the only operation
I have is append,

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:28.030
then I can say n
operations will cause

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.120
the array of grow to size n.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.860
So n where n is the
number of operations.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.636
AUDIENCE: You mean,
like, re-adding to the--

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.340
PROFESSOR: So an operation is
a data structure operation,

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:49.930
like a query or an update.

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.260
This is my update
and this is my query.

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:02.220
AUDIENCE: Wait, but like,
it's order n though, because--

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.301
AUDIENCE: I know, it's order n.

00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:06.510
But because we
have like an array,

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.010
and then you have
to make a new one,

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.699
and you have to move all
those old items over, right?

00:48:10.699 --> 00:48:11.324
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:48:11.324 --> 00:48:12.680
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.745
But, I mean, sometimes
like, if your actual array,

00:48:17.745 --> 00:48:21.192
if you expand it before--
like, let's say you notice

00:48:21.192 --> 00:48:23.566
you're getting full and you
decide to like make it bigger

00:48:23.566 --> 00:48:27.182
at that point, is
it still order n,

00:48:27.182 --> 00:48:28.994
as in the number of
elements that are--

00:48:28.994 --> 00:48:30.660
PROFESSOR: It depends
on how you decide.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:33.760
There's a problem on the PSET
that asks you about that.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.210
So, depends on when
you make the decision

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:39.064
and how you make the decision,
the answer is either yes,

00:48:39.064 --> 00:48:40.480
you're still
constant time, or no.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.360
So if you understand the
amortized analysis then

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.690
you can argue of whether
it still holds or not.

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:47.180
If this breaks
down at any point,

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:48.790
not going to be constant time.

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:49.290
Yes?

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:51.870
AUDIENCE: So the only cost
is really copying everything

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:52.970
from the old array
to the new array?

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:53.410
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:55.330
AUDIENCE: Actually
allocating that space is--

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:56.875
PROFESSOR: We assume
that allocating the space

00:48:56.875 --> 00:48:57.630
is constant time.

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:00.740
Good question, because you can't
take that for granted, right?

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.440
So we assume that this is
order 1, copying is order n.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:08.970
And then the insertion is
order 1, just like before.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.310
So allocating may
not be constant.

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:14.050
In real life,
allocating is actually

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.340
logarithmic either of the
size that you're asking for

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.670
or logarithmic of how many
buffers you've allocated.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.900
And you can make a
constant time allocator.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.990
But that's lower than a
logarithmic allocator,

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.800
because the constant
factor behind it is so big.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.820
But even if this
allocation would

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:35.040
be order n, which
would be terrible,

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.440
it would still
get absorbed here.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.550
So the overall model works no
matter what the allocation is.

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:43.370
It's reasonable, from a
theoretical standpoint,

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:47.210
to say that
allocation is order 1,

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:50.640
from a theoretical standpoint.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.950
So this is the real cost
copying the elements.

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:57.910
And this makes an append
order n worst case.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:01.180
So if you look at this
data structure then

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:04.260
suppose we want to compute
the cost of an append.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:12.040
So say we have code
like this, 4, 1, 2, n.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:17.630
First we have L
be an empty list.

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:24.840
Then we want to compute
the cost of this.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:32.570
So if we do it without
amortized analysis,

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.250
line by line
analysis, just like we

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:38.380
learned in the first lecture,
what's the cost of this,

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.870
making a new list constant?

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:46.060
What's the cost of one append?

00:50:48.916 --> 00:50:49.868
AUDIENCE: Constant.

00:50:49.868 --> 00:50:51.390
PROFESSOR: One append.

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:55.730
So an append can either
branch here or branch here.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.975
So what's the cost
of one append?

00:51:01.975 --> 00:51:04.016
AUDIENCE: It would be
showing with an empty list?

00:51:04.016 --> 00:51:04.932
AUDIENCE: Depends.

00:51:04.932 --> 00:51:06.840
PROFESSOR: It depends.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.547
So worst case.

00:51:07.547 --> 00:51:08.880
We have to look at a worst case.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.260
So this is line
by line analysis.

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:13.836
We're going to get
one number for this.

00:51:13.836 --> 00:51:14.336
AUDIENCE: N.

00:51:14.336 --> 00:51:15.200
AUDIENCE: An n.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:15.825
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.964
So in the worst case,
the list will be full.

00:51:21.964 --> 00:51:23.380
And you'll have
to make a new one.

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.440
And then you're going on
this branch of the if,

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.900
so the cost is order n.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:34.120
So order n, worst case.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.610
So the cost of one call
is order n, worst case.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:39.000
How many calls do we make?

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:47.010
So what is the total
cost of this thing?

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:48.594
AUDIENCE: It's not
actually n squared.

00:51:48.594 --> 00:51:50.426
PROFESSOR: Yes, it's
not actually n squared.

00:51:50.426 --> 00:51:52.020
But if we do line
by line analysis,

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.350
before we learn
amortized analysis,

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:56.830
all we can say it's
order of n squared.

00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:59.340
And this is correct, it's not
bigger than n squared, right?

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.990
So O is correct.

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:03.020
But it's not the tight bound.

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.882
So if we had a multiple
choice, and you selected this,

00:52:05.882 --> 00:52:08.090
you wouldn't get the score
because we usually ask you

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:10.930
what the tightest
bound that you can get.

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:13.050
OK, so line by line analysis.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.880
We worked through that
a lot in doc dist.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.305
Doesn't work all the time.

00:52:16.305 --> 00:52:17.680
When it doesn't
work, we tell you

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.780
to use amortized
analysis instead.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.850
So what's the goal of
amortized analysis?

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:23.020
What do we want?

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:26.510
You guys are yelling at me that
this is not n squared, why?

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.385
I mean not why, what?

00:52:27.385 --> 00:52:28.310
What is it instead?

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:30.522
What do we want from
amortized analysis?

00:52:30.522 --> 00:52:32.932
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:32.932 --> 00:52:36.306
AUDIENCE: It's a
[INAUDIBLE] that's an n.

00:52:36.306 --> 00:52:38.810
PROFESSOR: So we want
amortized analysis

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:43.040
to say that this is order
1 amortized, and this is--

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.816
[ALARM SOUNDING]

00:52:44.816 --> 00:52:46.070
PROFESSOR: Am I out of time?

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:46.570
Yeah.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.937
OK, so there's a difference
between the worst

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:55.020
case and amortized, right?

00:52:55.020 --> 00:53:03.210
We can argue that this
is order 1 amortized.

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:05.100
And if this is
order 1 amortized,

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.020
then this is order n amortized.

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.790
So does the difference between
worst case and amortized

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:12.520
make sense now?

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:18.162
So this is what I want,
the rest is fancy math.

00:53:18.162 --> 00:53:19.870
If you forget the
fancy math after you're

00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:21.640
done with this class, that's OK.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.030
If you remember that this
is order 1 amortized,

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:26.362
and that's order n
amortized, that's good.

00:53:26.362 --> 00:53:28.070
That's all you need
to know to write code

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:30.470
if you don't design algorithms.

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:34.307
So this is an important piece
of knowledge on its own.

00:53:34.307 --> 00:53:36.640
OK, so questions about the
difference between worst case

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.300
and amortized?

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.660
OK, what does amortized mean?

00:53:44.784 --> 00:53:46.310
AUDIENCE: Average.

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:48.750
PROFESSOR: Yep, averaged out
over multiple operations.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.100
So instead of doing
line by line analysis,

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:54.470
we have to look at what happens
over multiple operations,

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:56.760
right?

00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.580
So there are two methods that
I think are useful in CLRS.

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:02.330
There are three in
total, but the last one

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:04.002
is horribly complicated.

00:54:04.002 --> 00:54:05.960
So there's something
called aggregate analysis.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:14.450
And there's something called
the cost based accounting.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.200
So last time when we looked
at the costs for append,

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:30.150
we argued that, hey, it's
order 1 for a lot of times.

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:34.900
And then it's only
order n for an operation

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.090
that's a power of 2.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:43.690
So if we're looking
at the K-ith append,

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:50.290
then this is order K
for K equals 2 to the i.

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:52.640
And it's order 1 otherwise.

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.460
Right?

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:04.110
So if we sum up
all these costs, we

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:20.400
get-- plus sum over log
n of O of 2 to the i.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.450
And this is clearly order n.

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:29.350
And if you do the math
here, this is also order n.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.480
So this is aggregate analysis.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.600
This is what we
taught you in lecture.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.820
Does this make sense?

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:48.680
So the key here is that whenever
we are increasing the array,

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.960
we're increasing it to 2 times.

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.450
And we start with a
size of 1, count is 1.

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:58.040
We start with an
array with 1 element.

00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.790
So the size of the
array will first

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:06.716
be 1, then 2, then 4, then
8, then 16, 32, 64, 128,

00:56:06.716 --> 00:56:07.340
so on so forth.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.550
It increases exponentially.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:11.880
So on the first append
I'll have to do a resize.

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.230
On the second one, resize.

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:14.380
Fourth one, resize.

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:17.530
Eighth, resize, so
on and so forth.

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:20.480
So if I'm adding up the
cost for n operations,

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.830
each operation is
order 1 because I'm

00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:25.060
inserting everywhere.

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:30.020
And then all these
operations are all order n.

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.160
But there's few of them.

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.560
They're few and far out.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:35.110
So if you write the sum this
way, and you do the math,

00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:37.120
you get that it's order n.

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.110
So aggregate analysis
says, look at n operations

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:42.220
and add the costs up together.

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.840
And last time we had that good
example of walking over a tree,

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:48.310
and in order traversal where
we drew arrows across edges.

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.450
So that's aggregate analysis.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:52.710
And then you should look
at the cost method in CLRS

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:56.030
because that's also
useful sometimes.

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:57.500
Does this help?

00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.660
Any questions?

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:00.910
No, everyone wants to go home.

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:01.680
AUDIENCE: Wait--

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.430
PROFESSOR: Almost.

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:06.370
AUDIENCE: For log n, so you're
starting from log n going to--

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.174
PROFESSOR: So I'm starting
from 1 going to log n.

00:57:09.174 --> 00:57:13.610
AUDIENCE: Oh, oh, so [INAUDIBLE]
after you're buffering.

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:15.750
PROFESSOR: So this is
fancy math for saying only

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:18.504
add up powers of two.

00:57:18.504 --> 00:57:20.670
So that's what I'm trying
to say, add these guys up.

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:22.000
AUDIENCE: Well that's
your step [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:22.666
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:22.666 --> 00:57:23.800
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.000
Oh, I like that.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:25.600
OK.

00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.710
PROFESSOR: OK.
