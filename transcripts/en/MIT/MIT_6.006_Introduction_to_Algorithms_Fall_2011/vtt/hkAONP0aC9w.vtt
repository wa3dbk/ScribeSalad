00:00:21.184 --> 00:00:23.600
PROFESSOR: So you guys know
the quiz is cumulative, right?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.590
Everything all the way
back from lecture one,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.620
so I would look at all the
lectures and all the P sets,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.390
and look at all the
stuff that we taught you,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.590
so data structures,
algorithms, everything.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.420
And at least be able to
know, for every one of them,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.910
what's the name, what it does,
and wants the running time.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.360
Proofs and how it does
it might be harder,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.410
but these be able to
call it as a black box

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.800
and argue about
the running times.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.680
So I have a dp problem, and
I have a non-dp problem.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.320
Which problem would you
like me to start with?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.820
OK.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.630
Do you guys know the saying, if
a woodchucker would chuck wood,

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.620
how much wood would
a woodchucker chuck?

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.640
Today we're going to chuck wood.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.200
So you have a piece of
wood that is l meters long,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.390
and they have n markings.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.560
So say the first
mark is at 3 meters,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.620
the second mark is at 5
meters, so on, so forth.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.400
And 3, and 4, all
the way up to mn.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.870
So we want to cut this piece
of wood at all the markings.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.150
The thing is the woodchucker
doesn't work for free.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.140
If you give it a piece
of wood of length l,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.710
and you ask it to cut
it at some marking,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.930
you're going to get two pieces
of wood, length l1 and l2.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:15.730
The price for this
is l1 times l2.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.200
So we like woodchucker,
but woodchuckers would also

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.020
like our wallets.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.590
So we want to cut
this up by paying

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.820
the minimum amount of money.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.270
Rings a bell?

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.540
So I'll let you guys
think for a minute,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.150
then I'll give you the running
time, then we'll start talking.

00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:40.350
So we usually give you
running times on quizzes.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.935
The running time is why you
should know all the problems

00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:45.560
in their matching running times,
because the moment we give you

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.450
a running time you can
automatically eliminate all

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.450
the things that don't match,
and just focus on a few things.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.930
So you're going to have to
cut it at all the markings,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.120
eventually, but the order in
which you cut is important.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.550
So if I cut here first, then
I'm going to pay three times l

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.310
minus 3, whereas if I
cut in the middle first,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.120
I'm going to pay whatever this
is, and 3 times l minus m3.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.400
So we're trying to
decide the order.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.220
Does this look like
any familiar problem?

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
using dp, right?

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.960
PROFESSOR: dp, that is good.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.490
I did say that we're going
to start with a dp problem,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.371
so this is dp.

00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:45.120
It's a good start.

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:55.452
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:55.452 --> 00:03:58.404
PROFESSOR: What?

00:03:58.404 --> 00:03:59.880
Not exactly.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.880
PROFESSOR: So, it is
not like any problems

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.275
on the recitations.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.900
So far recitations did
prefixes and suffixes.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.209
We're going to solve this
using a running time of n

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.700
cubed, which is like
the parenthesis problem.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.430
It should be what you said, but
I don't know how to spell that,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.013
so we're going to
go for this instead.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.604
So running n
cubed-- the moment I

00:04:33.604 --> 00:04:35.270
said this you guys
should know that this

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.940
is the n cubed problem that
we have in lecture notes.

00:04:40.712 --> 00:04:42.670
So make sure to have
those on the cheat sheets,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.010
and try to understand
them, right?

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.040
OK, so given that
I've said this,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.020
you should know
the solution now.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.330
To make sure
everyone is with me,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.280
we're going to go through
the solution, whole.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280
So what is a subproblem?

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:06.300
AUDIENCE:Smaller piece of wood.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.738
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:07.738 --> 00:05:09.960
AUDIENCE: Like how to cut it up.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.680
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.700
So this is how you
think of it informally.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.930
When you write it up,
I want to see this.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.650
I want to see dp of
something means something.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.240
So how you fill
out your dp table.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.040
It's really useful to
write this up on your exam

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.140
before, because one, this will
help you write the recursion

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.240
correctly, and two, if
the grader sees this

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.410
they might skim over the
recursion completely.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.040
And then you might
have bugs there.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.150
We might not see them.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.250
Good for you.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.630
So this says how you're
going to fill out the table.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.810
Right? dp of something
equals something.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.150
What's in a dp table?

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.460
Numbers.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.140
It's never how to do something.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.570
It's always the
numbers, so it's always

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.680
the maximum profit,
or the minimum cost,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.290
or the shortest distance,
or the longest something.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.050
So it's always a number.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.760
So what we do here?

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.037
AUDIENCE: Start and dp, start
location to the end location is

00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:12.620
PROFESSOR: OK, so we're going
to get the mean distance, right?

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.390
We usually do i j k and
whatever else it takes.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.620
So start to end is?

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.030
AUDIENCE: The minimum
cost of cutting that up.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:35.020
PROFESSOR: Minimum cost of
cutting up the wood board

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.460
from marking i, all
the way to marking j.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.560
There's a tiny problem here,
that the initial-- there's

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.990
no problem for this big
piece of wood, right?

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.380
If I can only consider
the board from i to j,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.980
so if I can only consider
the board from marking 1

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.580
to marking n, then
I get to this.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.720
So this part and this
part get left out.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.420
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.700
We add fake markings.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.170
Then 0 is 0, and
mn plus 1 equals l.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.670
Very good.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
equally spaced?

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.450
PROFESSOR: No.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.100
So these are numbers.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.250
If they were evenly spaced,
I think there's an algorithm.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.180
You might come up with a
math and say, you always

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.030
cut it up like this.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.970
So while we solve this,
you guys have candy, right?

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.390
You should eat the candy and
be energetic and everything.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.980
So min cost of
cutting up the board

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.360
from marking i to marking j.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.280
I like this.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.966
Have this on your
exam if possible,

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:57.590
because this will
make our life easier,

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.214
and it's going to
make your life easier

00:07:59.214 --> 00:08:00.720
when you get to the
next step, which

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.590
is how do we compute dp of i j?

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:11.930
So suppose I'm looking at
the subboard from m1 to m4

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.650
so I'm looking at only this.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.820
How do I compute the best way
to cut the board from m1 to m4?

00:08:33.147 --> 00:08:33.980
What are my options?

00:08:36.698 --> 00:08:38.510
AUDIENCE: The locations
you can cut it.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.630
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.110
So in order to cut
this up, I can either

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.230
make a first cut at m2.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.220
So say I make my first
cut here, and then I

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.880
recursively cut
this, and cut this.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:59.750
Or the other alternative
is take the same guy-- m1,

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:07.110
m2, m3, m4-- cut it at m3,
and then recursively cut this,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.730
and recursively cut this.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:15.790
So I'm iterating over all the
markings inside the board.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.505
Now suppose I'm
cutting it-- yes?

00:09:17.505 --> 00:09:21.176
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] cutting
both, or actually, never mind.

00:09:21.176 --> 00:09:22.550
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
when I recursed,

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.470
that takes care of it.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.900
So suppose I'm looking
at m1 through m4,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:35.470
and I'm cutting it at m2.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.220
What's the total cost?

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.670
So what's the best way
to cut, given that then I

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.562
know I'm going to cut there?

00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:46.470
AUDIENCE: The sum of the dp's.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:56.580
PROFESSOR: OK, so it's the
best way to cut m1 through m2,

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:07.050
plus best way to
cut m2 through m4,

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.520
plus the price I'm paying
for this cut, right?

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.910
Not just the sum of the dp's.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.890
One more term.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.105
What's this term?

00:10:16.105 --> 00:10:17.560
AUDIENCE: 4 minus 1?

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.634
Or the location of 4
minus the location of 1.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.300
PROFESSOR: So,
not quite, almost.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.340
So if I'm cutting a
board into two pieces,

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.840
the cost is the product of
the length of the two pieces.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:46.050
m2 minus m1, times yes.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.580
OK, why did I bother doing this?

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.410
Some people think better
with concrete numbers.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.050
If that's the case, then
give yourself an example.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.310
Write some numbers on
your sheet of paper,

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.680
then see what
letters match to what

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.940
numbers, and copy
it up using letters.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.220
And there you go, you've
solved the problem.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.680
So where are i and j here?

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.200
AUDIENCE: i would be 1.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.438
PROFESSOR: OK, so this is i.

00:11:16.438 --> 00:11:19.130
AUDIENCE: That's j.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:24.400
PROFESSOR: Cool, so let's
try to write it up, now.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:31.040
So in order to cut the board
from i to j, what am I doing?

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.010
So what am I computing?

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.670
Usually the first word in
your subproblem definition

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.080
is the function that
you're going to use.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.008
So it's minimum, and I'm
going iterate over something.

00:11:43.008 --> 00:11:50.770
AUDIENCE: dp of i to--
it has to be all of j.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.260
dp of i, j, and
you're looking to--

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.380
PROFESSOR: So I'm
computing dp of i j.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.380
AUDIENCE: I know, of
j minus [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.620
AUDIENCE: j minus i, then
k j minus [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.980
PROFESSOR: There's a k, right?

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.980
I need a new variable for where
I'm going to cut up, right?

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.680
So fortunately, we have a lot
of letters in the alphabet,

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.030
i, j, k, so on and
so forth, l, m.

00:12:13.622 --> 00:12:14.930
AUDIENCE: i plus k.

00:12:17.209 --> 00:12:19.250
PROFESSOR: So let's say
that k is the place where

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.410
we cut, to make our life easy.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:26.270
So I'm going to have dp of

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.269
AUDIENCE: Well i is
the starting point.

00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:28.810
PROFESSOR: OK

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:34.280
AUDIENCE: And then, the
endpoint is i plus k, right?

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.267
PROFESSOR: So what's k here?

00:12:36.267 --> 00:12:37.600
AUDIENCE: k is an actual number.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.350
It's not the offset,
it's the actual number,

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.840
so it should be i to k.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.484
It depends how you define k.

00:12:43.484 --> 00:12:45.900
PROFESSOR: So I'm going to
make my life easy, and define k

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.735
as exactly the marking
at which I cut.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:51.680
k is this 2 here.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.380
And this is easier, trust me.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.042
OK, plus?

00:13:01.042 --> 00:13:01.625
AUDIENCE: k j?

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.866
PROFESSOR: OK, and?

00:13:08.866 --> 00:13:16.156
AUDIENCE: Cost of m--

00:13:16.156 --> 00:13:23.910
AUDIENCE: j minus i, m of
k minus m of i times m of j

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.470
minus m of k.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:26.394
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:13:26.394 --> 00:13:28.060
Yeah, other way
around-- doesn't matter.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:35.430
So now where does k go?

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.374
We have to come up with
numbers for the loop, right?

00:13:40.912 --> 00:13:42.160
AUDIENCE: Between i and j.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.522
AUDIENCE: j minus i.

00:13:44.522 --> 00:13:48.490
AUDIENCE: Just for k in i to j.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.624
PROFESSOR: So if I have
the board from 1 to 4,

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:54.400
do I cut at 1?

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.854
I can, but that's kind of weird.

00:13:56.854 --> 00:13:59.580
Because I'm recursing
on the same subproblem.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.880
By the way, if you recurse
to the same subproblem,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.150
what are you going to
get as your running time?

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.450
Infinite.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.430
So let's not do that.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.470
So we're going to go from?

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.014
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:14.014 --> 00:14:15.680
PROFESSOR: So going
from i would be bad.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.991
So i plus 1.

00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:17.490
2?

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.430
AUDIENCE: j minus 1.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.750
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:26.480
AUDIENCE: Would it be m over
i plus 1, because [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.650
PROFESSOR: So k is which
marking I'm cutting at.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.020
I never want to cut
inside a marking.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.760
However, I don't even
know these are integers.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.890
AUDIENCE: They wouldn't
be called [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.975
PROFESSOR: So k is
which marking, i, j,

00:14:39.975 --> 00:14:41.975
and k are which
marking I'm cutting at.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.330
These are the only
discrete things I have.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:51.132
This board is all filled
with real numbers.

00:14:51.132 --> 00:14:52.590
So if I want to
cut somewhere here,

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.480
that's a real number--
I don't like that.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.900
I want to have integers.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.040
So my markings help
me get integers.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.530
I only want to cut
at the marking,

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.370
so I always look at my problem
in terms of which marking I'm

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.080
cutting it.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.650
So this always
iterates over markings.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:16.790
So this looks very much like
the parentheses problem, right?

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.740
Same subproblems, roughly
the same recursion.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.500
Turns out that these
problems, where

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.550
you're not considering
suffixes or prefixes,

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.100
but rather you're
considering substrings,

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.600
are reasonably hard to come by,
and reasonably hard to solve.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.840
So if we give these
to you, chances

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.890
are they're going to be exactly
like the parentheses problem,

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.990
except for the cost function.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:42.050
This isn't what we had in the
parentheses problem, right?

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.220
So you should be prepared
to solve problems

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.070
that look exactly like
the paren problem,

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.780
but might have a
different cost function.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.960
And this is how we solve it.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.460
OK.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.668
AUDIENCE: When you say that
the complexity determines

00:15:55.668 --> 00:15:58.245
which type of dp
example we use, does

00:15:58.245 --> 00:16:03.260
that mean that a
problem can be solved

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.514
using any of dp examples?

00:16:08.514 --> 00:16:13.760
It's just that the only thing
that changes is the complexity.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.310
PROFESSOR: I don't
think you can map

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:16.840
every approach
onto every problem.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.450
For example, if you tried
to map prefixes onto this,

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.050
you'd come up with
a solution that

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.370
doesn't look at all
the possible choices,

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.540
so your answer would
be sub-optimal.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.330
So you'd come up with a fast,
but incorrect algorithm.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.750
However, if you take the
problem of find the longest

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.900
increasing sub-sequence,
you can definitely

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.230
apply this technique to it.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.290
It's more general than
suffixes or prefixes.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.200
So it's going to work, but
it's going to be slower.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.610
So in theory, what
you should do is,

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.510
you have all these techniques.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.450
Given a problem, you
try all the techniques.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.720
You see which ones apply,
and out of those, you

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.460
see which one gives you
the best running time.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.620
In practice, if we give
you the running time,

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.360
you match it to the techniques
that match the running time.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.700
You start backwards from
the stuff that you know.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.869
OK.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.730
Does this problem make sense?

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.180
Sweet.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.680
Now let's do a hard problem.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.819
Do people remember hashing?

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.589
You have one minute
to remember hashing

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.640
while I erase the board.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.530
[LAUGHING]

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.940
So suppose we want
to implement the set.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.590
The way we're going to implement
the set is, we have n elements.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.680
We're going to put
them into the set,

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:50.020
so for i goes from
1 through n, we're

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.700
going to insert element
i, so first we're

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.730
going to insert all the
elements into the set.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:02.140
And then after that, given a
random number, we want to see

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.810
is it in the set, or not.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:09.190
So for some other number--
I used n before, so let's

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:15.450
use-- for some other number f,
we want to see is f in the set,

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.068
or is f not in the set?

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.400
What data structure would
you use normally for this?

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.560
A hash table, right?

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.080
You stick everything
into a hash table,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.820
then you try to
find the elements.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.880
If you find them,
then you say yes.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.980
If not, then you say no.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.710
Well, it turns out
that this would

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.160
take more memory
than what we have.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.720
So instead, we're
going to do this.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.850
We're going to have a
hash table of m bits.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.840
So these are m bits.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.670
And say we have a
hash function that

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.410
satisfies with uniform
hashing, so given any element,

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:07.784
the value is anywhere
from 0 to m minus 1,

00:19:07.784 --> 00:19:08.950
and they're all independent.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.600
So the way we're going
to insert an element

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:23.040
is-- this table is T-- we're
going to say that T of h of ai

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.690
equals 1.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.600
So this is a table of bits.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.570
For every element
we hash the element,

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.610
and we set the
corresponding bit to 1.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:38.230
So we're going to have some 1s,
and some zeros in the table.

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:43.680
Say if this is ai, it
hashes somewhere here.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.530
OK so the question
is, we inserted

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.560
n elements into a
table of size n.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:55.110
Given a new element, f, where
f stands for false positive-- f

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.395
is not one of the
elements that we inserted.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.490
I want to know what's the
probability that the set will

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:08.700
say that the element is
in the set, so basically,

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.674
the probability of
a false positive.

00:20:11.674 --> 00:20:14.660
AUDIENCE: So what are we
doing about [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.595
PROFESSOR: Nothing.

00:20:15.595 --> 00:20:18.612
AUDIENCE: Is it chaining,
is it open addressing?

00:20:18.612 --> 00:20:21.604
Does it even matter?

00:20:21.604 --> 00:20:23.520
PROFESSOR: So we're not
inserting the elements

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.200
into the table.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.890
This table only has bits.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.800
The elements are lost
completely after we insert them.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.200
So the tradeoff is
uses a lot less memory.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.050
Instead of having to
store entire elements,

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.050
you just store bits.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.927
On the downside you're going
to have false positives.

00:20:40.927 --> 00:20:42.510
Because if I have a
different element,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:47.090
say f, if it hashes
to the same location,

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:51.360
then the set is going to
say, yeah, it's in the set.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.041
So you get false positives.

00:20:53.041 --> 00:20:54.290
Would you get false negatives?

00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.730
No, right?

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.790
Because you start out
with a table of 0's,

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.680
and you only set
the table to ones

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.570
for the numbers
that match to hashes

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.340
of elements that are in the set.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.954
Did you have a question?

00:21:14.954 --> 00:21:15.453
OK.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.680
OK, do we understand
the problem,

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.584
before we attempt to solve it?

00:21:23.584 --> 00:21:27.250
AUDIENCE: Is it probably 1/m?

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.880
PROFESSOR: You'd wish, but no.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.245
AUDIENCE: It's less than n/m.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.560
PROFESSOR: OK, I like that.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.410
So what are you thinking?

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.410
AUDIENCE: If there are
no collisions previously,

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:48.730
then it would equal to n/m, but
there are collisions, probably

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.566
collisions.

00:21:50.566 --> 00:21:52.940
PROFESSOR: OK, I'm going to
open up a window in your head

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.770
and tell everyone else the small
steps you took to get here.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.940
So we have this new number f.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.200
How are we going to check
if it's in the set or not?

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.300
We're going to compute
h of f, and we're

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.580
going to check if t
of h of f is 0 or 1.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.870
f is different from
all the other elements.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.920
So its hash value is independent
from all the other hash values

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.640
we had before.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.480
We don't really care
about this anymore,

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.900
after we have the
independence assumption.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.400
So h of f is just some
random position in the table.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.080
So the question is, given some
random position in the table,

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.090
will that be a 0 or a 1?

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:42.570
How do you know?

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.910
If I knew how many 1's
I have in the table--

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.530
if I have k 1's in the table,
and automatically this means n

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:56.190
minus k 0's-- then what's the
probability that h of f will

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.060
point to a 1?

00:23:06.332 --> 00:23:08.265
AUDIENCE: k/m.

00:23:08.265 --> 00:23:08.890
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.580
So the hash takes
m possible values.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.090
k of them are 1's.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:18.750
So the probability that the hash
is going to guess a 1 is k/m.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:23.820
So if we knew how many 1's we
have, then this is the answer.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.520
We know that we're going to
have at most n 1's-- that's what

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.200
you're thinking, right?

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.950
So k is definitely
smaller or equal to n,

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:39.900
so the answer definitely has to
be smaller or equal than n/m.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.930
Now if you're in a
rush, you might say,

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.960
well, we inserted n
elements, so we're definitely

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.030
going to have n 1's here.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.320
That is not true.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.060
The hashes of all the
elements are independent.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.440
So there is some probability
that two elements will

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.210
hash to the same value, and as
the number of elements grows,

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.785
that probability also grows.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.510
OK, so now by
looking at this, we

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.650
got rid of this
part of the problem.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.372
We don't care that
there's a new element.

00:24:10.372 --> 00:24:12.080
We don't care that
it's a false positive.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.270
All that we care
about is how many

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:18.080
1's do we have in the table
after inserting n values.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:23.760
Well, what's that?

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:41.810
That's m times the probability
that a slot in the table is 1.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:46.820
Right, the probability that the
slot in the table is 1 is k/m.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.390
So if we know this probability,
and we multiply it by m,

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.130
then we get k.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.240
People still with me?

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.470
AUDIENCE: And what does
that variable represent, h?

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.050
PROFESSOR: This is k.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.050
Represents that my
handwriting sucks, basically.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.530
AUDIENCE: I mean, why do we
do m times the probability.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:15.208
That's the the expected
number of 1's in the table?

00:25:15.208 --> 00:25:15.874
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:24.330
Yeah, this is E of k, I guess.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:30.194
So then our final answer
is this thing divided by m.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:40.390
So the answer is the
expected value of k,

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.830
or you can just think of it as
the average value of k, divided

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:44.396
by m.

00:25:44.396 --> 00:25:53.300
So this is m times this
probability, divided by m.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.450
So it is exactly
this probability.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:59.920
So the thing that
we want to focus on

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:07.710
is, what's the probability
that a random slot in the table

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.210
is a 1?

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.858
AUDIENCE: It's equal to
1 minus the probability

00:26:18.858 --> 00:26:21.290
that it was never fixed.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:26.090
PROFESSOR: Exactly,
the first thing we do.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:30.570
1 minus the probability
that a slot is 0.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.560
This is easy, right,
like it looks easy.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.210
But this makes a
huge difference,

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:42.660
because once we're here,
well, a slot is zero

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.246
if none of the
insertions made it a one.

00:26:46.246 --> 00:26:47.870
And the insertions
are all independent.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:54.030
So this is like,
you're flipping a coin.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.380
What's the probability that
after you flip it n times,

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.470
you never get a head?

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.384
So this is 1 minus

00:27:04.384 --> 00:27:07.950
AUDIENCE: 1 over m
to the something.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:11.420
PROFESSOR: That--
So a slot is 0 means

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.260
that no number was
inserted in it.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.990
We're inserting n numbers,
so it's the probability

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:27.940
that a single number
was not necessarily

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:36.350
in the slot, raised
to the power of n.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.720
So we have n independent
experiments, right?

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.390
Every time you insert a
number into the hash function,

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.380
that's one experiment.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.790
The hash function gives
you independent values

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.560
for all the elements.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.530
So all the insertions are
independent of each other.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:58.140
If, in a single insertion,
you've hit that slot,

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.460
then you've made
it a 1-- game over.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.670
So the slot is only a zero
if none of the insertions

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:05.420
make it the 1.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.670
So you take the probability
that the insertion doesn't

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.810
make it a one, and you
raise it to the power n,

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:12.129
because that has to
happen n times in order

00:28:12.129 --> 00:28:13.670
for the whole thing
to be successful.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.200
And the probability
that the number was not

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.520
inserted in a slot is
1 minus the probability

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.440
that it was inserted.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.820
Right, we're doing this again.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:39.710
1 minus probability
that a number hit.

00:28:44.081 --> 00:28:45.205
Well what this probability?

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.760
Uniform hashing.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.865
AUDIENCE: 1/m

00:28:49.865 --> 00:28:50.490
PROFESSOR: 1/m.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:29:01.690
So this whole thing is 1 minus 1
minus 1, over m to the power n.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:07.470
1 minus m minus 1,
over m to the power n.

00:29:13.398 --> 00:29:15.868
AUDIENCE: Can we go
through this again.

00:29:15.868 --> 00:29:20.067
From 1 minus probability
of a slot is 0, to 1

00:29:20.067 --> 00:29:25.260
minus probability of a number
was not inserted in a slot?

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.200
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.120
So first off, the
point of the problem.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.570
It's our problem, right?

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.284
Don't panic, don't be angry.

00:29:31.284 --> 00:29:33.450
You're not going to have
some this hard on the exam.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.984
The point of this is, I want
to go through probabilities

00:29:35.984 --> 00:29:37.900
a little bit, and I want
to go through hashing

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.220
and the math behind hashing.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:43.140
Because remembering
that will be useful.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:48.970
OK, so now you said you're
having trouble with this step?

00:29:53.474 --> 00:29:55.470
OK, so let's see.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.100
Let's do this here.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.540
So we have this
table here, right?

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:08.550
And we have n elements-- e1,
e2, e3, all the way through en.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.140
How do we put them in the table?

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.720
We hash each of them,
and each of them maps

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.570
to a random slot in the table.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:22.060
If these are the slots,
then e1 might map here,

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.260
e2 might map here,
e3 might map here,

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.220
e4 might map here,
so on and so forth.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.460
So I have arrows, right?

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:38.162
Every time I do a hash, that's
going to set something to a 1.

00:30:38.162 --> 00:30:40.370
The numbers don't necessarily
map to different slots,

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:44.820
because each number, on its
own, maps to a random slot.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.240
So these are all
going to be ones.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.480
And everything
else becomes zero.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.840
If no number maps
to a slot, it is 0.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.490
OK, let's look at
one slot, any slot.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:01.590
So let's say I'm looking
at this slot over here.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.870
Can you guys see, by the way?

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.420
OK, so let's look
at this guy here.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.940
What's the probability
that it's a 0?

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.935
So the probability
that the slot is

00:31:14.935 --> 00:31:21.180
a 0 is the probability that
the first number didn't

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:27.560
map to it-- otherwise
it would be a 1-- e1

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.490
didn't hash to that slot.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:37.950
e2 also couldn't match
to that slot, right?

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:43.180
So it's the probability that
e1 didn't hash to the slot,

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:54.940
and e2 didn't hash
into slot, and e3

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.100
didn't hash into the slot,
so on so forth, right?

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:04.600
All the way up until en
didn't hash to the slot.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.510
This makes sense?

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.240
Now these are all
independent events,

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.440
because all the hashes
are independent,

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.100
by the uniform
hashing assumption.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.860
So then I can turn
ands into products.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.880
So I can say that this
equals to the probability

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:28.500
that e1 didn't hash into the
slot, times the probability

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:34.990
that e2 didn't hash into the
slot, times the probability

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.240
that e3 didn't hash into the
slot, so on and so forth,

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.915
all the way to the probability
that en didn't hash.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.970
So since I'm dealing with
the same hash function,

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:56.920
turns out that all the
probabilities are the same.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.810
So there, the probability
that some fixed number

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:06.700
didn't hash, to the power n.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.300
So this is how I got
from here to here.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.900
Probabilities and the
properties of hashes and hashing

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.930
assumptions.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.700
So you guys should have
those on your cheat sheet,

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.521
and maybe if you have time,
review probabilities a bit.

00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:26.896
AUDIENCE: What is
the probability

00:33:26.896 --> 00:33:29.540
that any given one
doesn't hash, 1/m?

00:33:32.697 --> 00:33:34.985
So if e1 doesn't
hash in that spot,

00:33:34.985 --> 00:33:37.690
isn't that probability 1/m?

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.590
PROFESSOR: Not quite.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.520
You're close, but not quite.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.550
So you're saying that
the probability that e1

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.722
doesn't hash to
this slot is 1/m?

00:33:47.722 --> 00:33:49.180
AUDIENCE: I guess
it's 1 minus 1/m.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.750
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.590
The probability that
it would hash here

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.480
is 1/m, because it has
to pick that one slot out

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.630
of n possible slots.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.470
But if you're just
saying, all I want

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.920
is that it doesn't
hash here, well, it

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.290
means it can hash anywhere else.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.680
So it has m minus 1 options.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.850
It can go to any of
those m minus 1 places,

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.520
just not to that one place.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.111
So m minus 1 over m.

00:34:19.845 --> 00:34:22.250
AUDIENCE: It's interesting
it went the other direction.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:25.050
Instead of saying, it's
1, it's 1 minus it.

00:34:27.387 --> 00:34:29.053
Wouldn't it have been
just as easy to go

00:34:29.053 --> 00:34:30.409
the other direction, or no?

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:32.510
PROFESSOR: No.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.460
Not doing this makes
the problem hard,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.489
so that's why we're doing it.

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:40.100
This kind of flipping is
easy to do conceptually,

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.152
but it might make a hard problem
into a really easy problem,

00:34:43.152 --> 00:34:44.610
or at least into
a do-able problem.

00:34:49.923 --> 00:34:52.338
AUDIENCE: Isn't it
this the same thing?

00:34:52.338 --> 00:34:55.474
I guess maybe not totally.

00:34:55.474 --> 00:34:57.890
PROFESSOR: So it is exactly
the same in terms of the math,

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.875
but computing this without
turning it into this

00:35:01.875 --> 00:35:05.240
is really hard.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.070
AUDIENCE: Any given
slot is 1, isn't it

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.125
kind of like what we just
said, except if the probability

00:35:10.125 --> 00:35:17.020
of any one mapping is 1/m,
mapping to a 1, right?

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.550
And then you take
1 over m raised

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:23.636
to the n, that's the
probability of it being a 1

00:35:23.636 --> 00:35:27.479
at that one place, right?

00:35:27.479 --> 00:35:28.520
PROFESSOR: No, not quite.

00:35:37.304 --> 00:35:40.250
Yeah.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.610
OK, so are we getting this?

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:46.000
Somewhat?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.555
Yes?

00:35:46.555 --> 00:35:48.500
AUDIENCE: So the probability
of a false positive,

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.666
you're saying that's what's
the probability that you

00:35:50.666 --> 00:35:54.004
get the 1, if you actually
should [INAUDIBLE] the 0.

00:35:54.004 --> 00:35:57.479
It's because multiple things
mapped to that one slot, right?

00:35:57.479 --> 00:35:59.520
PROFESSOR: So the probability
of a false positive

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:04.420
is the probability that, given
a new element, when we hash it

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.260
we get the 1.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.927
The hash of that new element
is independent of all

00:36:09.927 --> 00:36:10.635
the other hashes.

00:36:12.898 --> 00:36:14.814
AUDIENCE: Then why is
it simple in probability

00:36:14.814 --> 00:36:17.877
that you get the 1?

00:36:17.877 --> 00:36:19.460
PROFESSOR: So if I
have a new element,

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.350
I'm going to compute
its hash, and I'm

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:22.970
going to look in the table.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.801
If I see a 1, I'm
going to say, oh.

00:36:24.801 --> 00:36:26.176
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's
a new element.

00:36:26.176 --> 00:36:26.240
OK.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.656
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so it's something

00:36:27.656 --> 00:36:29.230
that was not in the set.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:30.714
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:30.714 --> 00:36:31.630
PROFESSOR: Okay, cool.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.080
OK, so let's see if we can
do a harder version of this.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.030
So this probability isn't
great, but if we do one trick,

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:49.390
we can make this really nice.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:52.430
And this puts together a trick
called bloom filters that

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.490
is used in all
sorts of situations.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:07.220
So for Bloom filters, we
still have n elements,

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.175
and we still have
a table of m bits.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:19.230
What changes this time is
instead of having one function,

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.510
we have k hash functions.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.120
So when we take an
element and insert it,

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.930
we're taking element i.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.640
The way to insert
it is we're going

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:43.980
to compute its hash value
using all the hash functions,

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.500
and set all the
corresponding bits to 1.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:38:06.350
So insert ei becomes,
for j in 1 through k,

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.530
the table bit corresponding
to the hash function, j,

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:13.970
of the element is 1.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.030
So each element
sets k bits to 1.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.330
Now how do we check if an
element is in the table?

00:38:26.395 --> 00:38:27.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.180
PROFESSOR: Since,
for every element,

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.980
we set all the corresponding
k bits to 1, now when

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.850
we have a new
element, we're going

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:44.900
to compute to the k positions,
and if any of them is a 0,

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.540
then we couldn't have possibly
put that in the table.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:39:03.830
So all T of h j
of f have to be 1.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.070
So for every element,
we hashed it k times,

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.990
and set the corresponding bits.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:17.730
If we have a new element, and
by hashing we get here and here,

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:21.370
but we also get here,
and this guy was a zero,

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.137
we know we definitely
didn't put this in.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.480
So now what's the probability
of a false positive?

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.384
AUDIENCE: My first intuition is
just raising that to a power.

00:39:41.324 --> 00:39:44.222
AUDIENCE: The probability
that when you check--

00:39:44.222 --> 00:39:46.430
PROFESSOR: Oh, I forgot to
say something, by the way.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:50.320
The k hash functions-- I think
they satisfy simple uniform

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.285
hashing.

00:39:51.285 --> 00:39:52.910
I'm not sure if that's
the right thing,

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:55.345
but they all have independent
values from each other.

00:39:55.345 --> 00:39:56.470
So they're all independent.

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.170
So for any number you
give, any hash function

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.000
returns a value that's
independent of all

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.551
the other hash functions,
and they're all 0

00:40:10.551 --> 00:40:11.300
through n minus 1.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.780
AUDIENCE: Why is not that
just raised to something?

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.321
Because we know the
probability-- OK,

00:40:22.321 --> 00:40:25.290
actually we need to
recalculate that.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.581
AUDIENCE: Because it's the
probability that all of them

00:40:27.581 --> 00:40:30.606
are 1, even though you
haven't hashed yet.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.130
PROFESSOR: So the false
positive, the probability

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.280
of false positives
is the probability

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:46.995
that all the k slots that
correspond to f are 1's, right?

00:40:54.760 --> 00:41:01.620
So, since the hash functions
are all independent,

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.730
this is the probability
that one slot

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.810
is the 1, raised to the power k.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:08.940
Right, because they're
all independent slots.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:14.160
So it's the probability
that one slot

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.740
is a 1, raised to the power k.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.510
OK, so now what's
the probability

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:22.500
that one slot is a 1?

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.170
It looks a lot like
this problem, right?

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:27.850
Except there's a tweak.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:30.294
How many times did we
put the 1 in the table?

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:38.010
So here, we put a 1 in the
table for every element.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:42.920
So we have n sets, right?

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:49.220
So n times we're going to
set t of something to 1.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.160
Right?

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.690
For every element,
we have one set.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:57.049
We set one bit to 1.

00:41:57.049 --> 00:41:59.340
It might have been said
before-- that's something else.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:41:59.840
Yes?

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.570
AUDIENCE: So here it's
raised to the m k?

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.790
PROFESSOR: Yeah, pretty much.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.440
So here, for every element
we hash it through all the k

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.210
functions, and set the
corresponding bits to 1.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:20.370
So one element generates
k set operations,

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:25.230
and we have n elements,
so we set n k bits to 1.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.274
Does this make sense?

00:42:36.274 --> 00:42:39.754
AUDIENCE: Can two hash functions
point to the same slot?

00:42:39.754 --> 00:42:40.420
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:42:43.216 --> 00:42:44.840
But they're all
independent, and that's

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.840
the only thing that matters.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.000
So every time we set the
bit, which bit was set

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.380
is independent of all
the other bits we set,

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.500
because all the hash
functions are independent,

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.560
and all the values are
independent of each other.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:05.410
So this time, the table size is
still m, so that didn't change.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.750
This time we set n bits to 1,
this time we set n k bits to 1.

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:12.420
So then the right thing
to do is copy this answer,

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.790
and replace n with n k.

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:17.330
And if you have to
write the proof,

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.969
you'd copy-paste the proof
and replace n with n k.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:32.900
So this is 1 minus m minus
1, over m, times n k.

00:43:35.815 --> 00:43:37.940
And of course you should
go through the whole thing

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.324
in your head and convince
yourselves that this is true.

00:43:40.324 --> 00:43:42.490
AUDIENCE: Does that say one
of the elements is what?

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:44.460
k, something?

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.460
AUDIENCE: Sets.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.270
PROFESSOR: Bit sets.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:51.920
So one element sets k bits
in the table, not necessarily

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.400
different bits, just
independent bits.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.350
So if you have n
elements altogether,

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:57.913
they set n times k bits.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:14.880
This thing gets run n times
k times, whereas here,

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:21.180
the set operation gets
run n times in total.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.930
That's the difference
in the two problems.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.560
Right here you have one
function for each element,

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.055
here you have k hash functions.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.500
This is hard, right?

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:50.060
Well, it's the hardest
hashing problem

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.530
that I could think
about and that

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.430
makes us go through
probabilities and through all

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:55.990
the hash stuff.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:59.200
The problems on the exam will
be easier, so one, don't panic.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.720
Two, review hashing,
review probabilities.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.160
When I said, from the
theory, this is what you get,

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.540
if you didn't understand that
then please review the theory.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.550
AUDIENCE: Why is
it raised to the k?

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.590
Because we did down there,
if we replace n with n k,

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:18.310
then we'd just get
everything except.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:22.510
PROFESSOR: So this thing
in here is the answer

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:28.500
to the previous problem,
except you take an n

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.640
and you replace it with an n k.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:36.560
So this is the probability
that one bit is set to 1.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.430
But here, when you're
given an element,

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.450
you're going to hash it through
the k functions-- you take

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:44.550
this guy-- you're going to hash
it through the k functions,

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.580
and you're going to
check all the bits.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.450
So you're going to check k bits.

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:53.130
So as long as any of the
k bits is a zero, not

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:55.140
a false positive.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.812
So we need all the
k bits to be a 1.

00:45:58.812 --> 00:45:59.645
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:46:02.579 --> 00:46:04.977
AUDIENCE: What if the hash
functions are dependent?

00:46:04.977 --> 00:46:06.435
PROFESSOR: Then
become intractable.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.530
AUDIENCE: And what if they are?

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:19.770
I think the in this problem,
the way they are being hashed,

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:21.566
that becomes
dependent, because I

00:46:21.566 --> 00:46:24.670
think there were some problems
where, if something is being

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:27.694
hashed somewhere,
then the probability--

00:46:27.694 --> 00:46:29.110
there could be
hash functions that

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:33.980
would put the other
thing in the next slot.

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:36.770
PROFESSOR: Yes, so you want
to reduce these problems

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:37.870
to independent hashing.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.050
If you look at the
proofs, all the proofs

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.890
assume uniform hashing,
simple uniform,

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:45.722
whatever it takes to get the
math down to independence.

00:46:45.722 --> 00:46:47.305
Because this is the
only thing that we

00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:49.310
know how to solve
with probabilities.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.090
If everything is
independent, then things

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:54.700
multiply and add up in the right
places, and everything is easy.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.720
If things are
dependent, then proofs

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.890
become really, really hard.

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.750
So whenever you have
dependent things,

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.397
you want to find a way to reduce
that to independent things.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.860
Is everyone tired,
or do you guys really

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.830
not like this problem?

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:23.180
By the way, really
cool trick-- so this

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.260
turns out to be a
lot better than that,

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.280
and I think the
optimal value of k

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.150
is around square roots of log n.

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:34.220
And that gives you some
filters with a really low

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.244
false positive rate.

00:47:36.244 --> 00:47:38.680
AUDIENCE: What do
you mean by optimal?

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.080
PROFESSOR: Minimize
the false positives.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:47.840
So given n and m, pick a case
so that this thing is minimized.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.370
AUDIENCE: What was
the answer again?

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:52.812
Or actually, regardless
of that, what's

00:47:52.812 --> 00:47:55.540
the percentage of
false positives?

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.270
PROFESSOR: It depends on
what your n and m are, right?

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:00.040
The more bits you can afford

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.510
AUDIENCE: But if
maximize your k,

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:06.100
you said you came up with
some k that's maximized

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.079
PROFESSOR: I think k is

00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:08.370
AUDIENCE: Square root of log n.

00:48:10.964 --> 00:48:12.660
AUDIENCE: So then
if you use that.

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.206
PROFESSOR: Let's
not do the math.

00:48:14.206 --> 00:48:15.595
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:15.595 --> 00:48:16.900
It's really, really good.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:21.540
So these are used for all sorts
of practical problems, all

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:25.268
the way from branch predictors
in processors, to databases.

00:48:25.268 --> 00:48:26.836
AUDIENCE: So is
it better than 1%?

00:48:26.836 --> 00:48:27.960
Do you know that, at least?

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:33.210
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, for
practical uses, this gets you,

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:36.030
I think to 1% of 1% of 1%.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.110
So usually, put a Bloom filter
before a really expensive

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:48.300
check, and the Bloom
filter gets rid of most

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.264
of the false positives.

00:48:50.264 --> 00:48:51.680
And then you have
a few more where

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.206
you do the more expensive check.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.952
Okay, does this make sense?

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:11.910
Any questions?

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:19.812
AUDIENCE: Do you more optimal
if you repeated this Bloom

00:49:19.812 --> 00:49:22.040
filter independently
of the other one,

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:25.330
with more hash functions
in that memory structure?

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:31.090
PROFESSOR: I think doubling
the memory size is better.

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:33.600
So two filters is the
same as having two n bits.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.150
I think doubling gives you
better results, always.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.650
OK, so general stuff.

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.610
We're going to have a lot
of conceptual questions,

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:55.300
so please make sure, again,
make sure that for everything

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.130
that we did, go
through the problem.

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:00.760
Understand the problem, know
that there is a solution.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.430
Know the running
time, maybe know

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:03.880
how to implement the solution.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.905
Don't worry so much
about the proof.

00:50:05.905 --> 00:50:07.530
We're going to have
some problems where

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.150
you have to come up with
new things on your own,

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.950
so get a good night's
sleep before the exam.

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:14.495
Really, if you have
five hours left,

00:50:14.495 --> 00:50:16.620
then you have to choose
between sleeping five hours

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.985
or reading notes
for five hours--

00:50:18.985 --> 00:50:21.060
AUDIENCE: Drink caffeine.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.480
PROFESSOR: It's
not going to help,

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.300
so caffeine actually
helps you stay up,

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.280
but it decreases
your performance.

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:30.030
And so if you're on caffeine,
you're not going to think.

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:33.530
You can regurgitate stuff,
but you can't think.

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.556
So caffeinating yourself is a--

00:50:36.556 --> 00:50:39.670
AUDIENCE: I thought it was like
it gives you concentration.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:42.460
PROFESSOR: So there's an optimum
amount of sleep and caffeine

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.080
combination.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.240
If you don't sleep and
caffeinate yourself,

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.720
I guarantee that
you will not solve

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.246
any of the problems that
require new algorithms.

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:51.620
AUDIENCE: Caffeine just squirts
adrenaline in your brain.

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.870
It doesn't do anything else.

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.370
PROFESSOR: So the thing is the
memory is going to be better.

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.270
If all you're doing
is memorization stuff,

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.230
then it's going to be better.

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:03.850
So you're going to do well on
the pattern matching stuff.

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.290
But when your
brain is panicking,

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:07.540
you're not going to come up
with new solutions, right?

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:10.030
Usually, you have a
problem, a hard problem.

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.370
You're thinking about it,
and then at some point

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.495
when you're relaxed, like
when you're in the shower

00:51:14.495 --> 00:51:18.380
or when you wake up you're
like, crap, I found a solution.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.470
So the brain finds
solutions when it's relaxed,

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:23.160
not when it's like, holy
shit, holy shit, holy shit.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.570
And adrenaline gets
it in that mood.

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:27.700
That's what it does.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.920
And that's what caffeine
does in the end.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.970
So a little bit of caffeine
might help you get up

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:35.250
and get you running,
but don't caffeinate

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.990
yourself to not sleep
the entire night.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:40.520
That's probably going to make
you bomb the hard questions.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.550
Good luck on Friday.

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:43.140
Eat candy.
