00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:23.450
PROFESSOR: Are people
understanding AVLs?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.960
That's good, because if
everyone raised their hands,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.690
we'd be done and out of here.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.270
So we're not covering new
material in this recitation.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.320
We're talking about AVLs
again, except this time

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.210
you'll tell me
how we'll do them,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.140
and we'll look at
the code and see

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.780
how the theory matches the code.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.150
And I need one of these.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.800
Thank you.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:53.260
So let's start simple.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.610
What's a BST?

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.110
AUDIENCE: Binary search tree.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.930
PROFESSOR: OK,
binary search tree.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.080
It's binary because every
node has at most two children.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.686
Why is it a search tree?

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:09.627
AUDIENCE: It's easy to search.

00:01:09.627 --> 00:01:10.210
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.279
Why is it easy to search?

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.945
AUDIENCE: Because you
start [INAUDIBLE],

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:15.195
is my number greater than
this key or is it less than,

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:16.410
and then you go from there.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.993
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:20.600
So if I would have to state
this as a formal rep invariant

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.016
thing, what would I say it is
so that I can do that operation?

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:26.268
AUDIENCE: Node at
right is greater than

00:01:26.268 --> 00:01:30.910
node at key, which is
greater than node at left.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.140
PROFESSOR: OK, excellent.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.190
So it turns out I can use
this argument recursively

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.830
to say that for a given
node, everything that

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.740
is to the right of
that node is greater,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.710
and everything that is
to the left is smaller.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.480
And this allows us
to do search quickly

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.180
because if you're
looking for a key,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.480
say you have numbers in your
tree and you're looking for 5.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.770
If you arrive at a node whose
value is 4, you go right.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.820
If you arrive at a node whose
value is 7, you go left.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.420
OK So what do we know
how to do on BSTs?

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.325
What are the operations
that we know?

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:17.580
AUDIENCE: Minimum, maximum.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.965
PROFESSOR: Min, max.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.210
AUDIENCE: Left, right, parent.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.640
PROFESSOR: So those
are for the node.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.300
I want the queries and the
updates for the BST type.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.717
AUDIENCE: Insert and delete.

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:32.300
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.052
Insert, Delete.

00:02:39.052 --> 00:02:40.036
AUDIENCE: Next larger.

00:02:42.897 --> 00:02:43.480
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.026
And then in here, the S in BST.

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:57.626
Someone give me the
S so we can move on.

00:02:57.626 --> 00:02:58.800
AUDIENCE: Find.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.254
PROFESSOR: Find,
search, depending

00:03:03.254 --> 00:03:04.420
on what code you're reading.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.260
What's the running
time for these guys?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.550
AUDIENCE: Order h.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.220
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.350
So everything has the
same running time.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.030
Nice and easy to remember.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.900
Order h.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.636
What's h?

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:23.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.190
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.120
How do we define this height?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.269
What's the height for this tree?

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.185
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.720
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.880
What's the height for this tree?

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.883
What's the height for this tree?

00:03:48.883 --> 00:03:49.466
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.020
PROFESSOR: So now for
a more general case,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.320
where this is the height, and
the height of my left subtree

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.880
is hl.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.940
The height of my
right subtree is hr.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.672
What's h?

00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:11.001
AUDIENCE: It's the maximum
of hr times hl plus 1.

00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:17.660
PROFESSOR: Nice save.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.118
I heard a "plus 1"
somewhere there.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.480
Very good.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.070
This is r.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.060
So if we look at the
first part of the code,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.840
lines one through eight,
lines seven and eight

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.280
implement the definition
that we talked about here.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.440
So in our Python
implementation, each node

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.550
knows the height of the
tree that he's the root of.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.900
And since we're
storing that, we need

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.150
to update it every once in
awhile when we make changes

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.870
to the tree, like
when we insert nodes.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.810
And the way we do that
is update height, which

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.970
uses the formula that
we came up with here.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.120
Now, there is a hack on
lines two, three, four, five.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.750
Can anyone tell me
what the hack is?

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:22.470
AUDIENCE: The negative 1.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.240
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.140
How does that work?

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.980
Why do I need it?

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.170
AUDIENCE: That's so if
you're at the root node,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.510
you can still
calculate the height.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.820
PROFESSOR: Depends on how
the root node looks like.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.039
AUDIENCE: If it has no children.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.080
PROFESSOR: That's a leaf.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.880
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.670
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.390
So if I'm in this case or
in this case, what's hl,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.140
what's hr?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.130
In this case, I have
this node of height zero,

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.400
so I can make a small mistake
here and it'll save me,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.990
but here, I have no
children, so hl and hr have

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.560
to be set in such a way that
this formula evaluates to 0.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.890
If I set them to minus 1,
I'll have minus 1, minus 1.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.756
The maximum is minus
1 plus 1 equals 0.

00:06:11.756 --> 00:06:15.650
AUDIENCE: It's just to
check the nodes for AVLs.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.090
PROFESSOR: We use that
to update the height.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.950
For AVLs, we need
to know the height

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.650
of a node instantaneously.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.200
We can't afford to
go down the tree

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.590
and compute the height
every time we need it,

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.750
so every node gets
to store its height.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.885
There's a small field in each
node that has the height.

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:35.010
So we need to update that
every once in awhile when

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.770
we do insertions and deletions.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.590
This is how we update
it, and in order

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.320
to update it for this case,
where we're at a leaf,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.230
we have to say that the
height of a non-existing tree

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.516
is minus 1.

00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:49.810
Of course, in theory
and in real life,

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.540
there are no non-existing
trees, so this is a clever hack

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.470
to reduce code size.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.220
So we said binary search trees
would look something like this.

00:07:16.408 --> 00:07:17.430
Is this guy an AVL?

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.696
Does anyone think it's an a AVL?

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:31.660
Does anyone think
it's not an AVL?

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.205
Can one of you tell me why?

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:39.300
AUDIENCE: The tree with 5
as its root is not balanced.

00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:45.695
PROFESSOR: So this guy
here is not balanced.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:48.670
Why is it not balanced?

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.790
AUDIENCE: Because it has two on
its right and zero on its left,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.290
so the difference
is greater than 1.

00:08:00.214 --> 00:08:02.380
PROFESSOR: You're saying
that there's something here

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:08.100
that's two, and something
here that's-- OK, so height.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.890
So then it's almost like that.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:17.770
It's 1 here and minus 1 here.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.470
So the reason I
asked you to clarify

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.300
is that first you
said two and zero,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.940
and that's the
node count, and AVL

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.660
doesn't care about node count.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.650
AVL cares about height.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:35.949
So for example, if I
have something like this,

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.619
this is a happy AVL.

00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:39.809
Three nodes, here one node here.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.460
The difference in node
count is greater than 1,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.200
but the difference
in height is 1.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.360
Therefore, this is a good AVL.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.360
So what's a rep
invariant for an AVL?

00:08:56.024 --> 00:08:58.973
AUDIENCE: The height of the
left subtree for every node

00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:02.950
is within 1 of the height
of the right subtree.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:03.825
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.030
AVL.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:15.050
The core property is
that for every node,

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:20.850
the left height and the right
height differ by at most 1.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.300
What else?

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.560
If we want to be
completely rigorous,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.140
what else do we have to say?

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:29.530
It's a BST.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.145
So an AVL is a
special kind of BST,

00:09:36.145 --> 00:09:38.470
and that's why when
we write the AVL code,

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.030
we inherit from the BST and
we use some of its methods

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.530
heavily.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.760
Why do we like AVLs?

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.140
What's so good about them?

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.140
AUDIENCE: It's faster because
it ensures the minimal height

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.640
of the entire tree because most
of our complexities are o of h,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.670
so it would have to be smaller.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.110
PROFESSOR: So we
care about this.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.660
In a regular binary tree,
the worst case that you have

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.560
is this.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.740
Ignoring this part, this is a
worst case binary search tree

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.880
where it's basically a
list, so height is order n.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.510
In an AVL, you're
saying it's better.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.480
So the reason why we
care about AVLs is

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:36.570
that height is order of log n.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.265
Now, did people understand from
lecture why that's the case?

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.660
Can anyone tell me
why that's the case?

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.588
AUDIENCE: Well, it's
just like every level

00:10:49.588 --> 00:10:55.715
you go down, if you split off
that many times, of course

00:10:55.715 --> 00:10:58.260
it's log n.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.690
If you have n nodes and
they're filled up to the edge,

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.140
there's going to
be log n of them.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.230
AUDIENCE: It's close to a
full binary tree, right?

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.260
PROFESSOR: For some
definition of "close."

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.010
So here's what I
use to remember,

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.810
and I think I can persuade you
that the height is log n using

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.949
the argument that
I'll show you here.

00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:23.490
Let's start building
a tree this way.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.750
Let's say I have a
fixed height, and I

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.620
want to have as few
nodes as possible.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.280
If I have a tree with a big
height and very few nodes,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.740
h is going to be bad when you
write it as a function of n.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.670
So those trees are unbalanced.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.000
Big height, small
number of nodes.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So say we're trying to build
an AVL with the smallest

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.720
number of nodes
and a fixed height.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.860
What if the height is 0?

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.660
What does that tree look like?

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.930
It's not too complicated, right?

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.610
This is an AVL of height 0.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.740
It's the only possible
AVL of height 0.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.260
Now, what if we're trying
to build an AVL of height 1

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.855
that has as few
nodes as possible?

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.890
This is what it
looks like, right?

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.510
Height 0, height 1.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.080
I could add another
node here, but I

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.370
don't want to because I want
as few nodes as possible.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.720
Now, what if I tried to
build an AVL of height 2

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.295
that has as few
nodes as possible?

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.010
Can I do this?

00:12:31.735 --> 00:12:34.353
AUDIENCE: So at the worst
case, you have h minus 1

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:36.160
and then h minus 2 there.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.890
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.840
You're moving ahead.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.280
You're forcing me to move
faster, but you're right.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.320
And the reason is
this is unbalanced.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.590
The height at the left has
to be the height of the right

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:49.810
plus or minus 1.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.680
Can't be anything else.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.980
So at the very least, I have to
build a tree of height 0 here,

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.240
and I know that the
best tree of height

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.000
0 that I have is this guy.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:04.540
Cool.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.940
So for height 3, I
would have to do this.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.168
And then you're saying, what
would I use at the left?

00:13:11.168 --> 00:13:16.148
AUDIENCE: You'd use whatever
height's on the right minus 2.

00:13:16.148 --> 00:13:18.444
The height on the
right minus 1 per side.

00:13:18.444 --> 00:13:20.360
PROFESSOR: So on the
right, I have a height 2.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.000
On the left, I have a height 1.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.940
If I want to go up to height
4, I do the same thing.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.470
So if I want to
build an AVL tree

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.890
with as few nodes as
possible and height h,

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.960
I start with the root,
then at the right,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.350
I build an AVL tree of height
h minus 1, and at the left,

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.970
an AVL tree of height h minus 2.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.420
And if these have the
minimum number of nodes,

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.040
then it turns out
that the whole thing

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.487
has the minimum number of nodes.

00:13:52.487 --> 00:13:54.570
I don't want to build a
tree where the heights are

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.500
equal because that would
mean more nodes here,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.040
so this is the best I can do.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.095
This is the best way I
can build a tall tree

00:14:02.095 --> 00:14:03.345
with as few nodes as possible.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.150
Suppose I want to write
the number of nodes

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.270
as a function of height.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.970
You're telling me what it is.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:21.420
When I was here, you were
giving me the answer for this.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.940
So suppose I have
a height, and I

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.090
want to know how many nodes
I have in my tree that

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.370
has a minimum number of nodes.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.657
What is it?

00:14:28.657 --> 00:14:39.635
AUDIENCE: It's N h minus 1,
and then plus N h minus 2.

00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:45.649
There might be a constant.

00:14:45.649 --> 00:14:47.190
PROFESSOR: There
might be a constant.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.840
N h minus 1 is this tree,
N h minus 2 is this tree,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.399
so what's the constant?

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:57.315
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:57.315 --> 00:14:57.940
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.195
This guy.

00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:04.355
AUDIENCE: Doesn't he
have height 0, though?

00:15:04.355 --> 00:15:06.119
AUDIENCE: We're talking
number of nodes.

00:15:06.119 --> 00:15:06.660
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.888
Number of nodes, yeah.

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:12.710
PROFESSOR: I'm not
going to solve this now.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.876
We learned how to solve
recurrences a long time ago,

00:15:14.876 --> 00:15:16.879
so I'll pretend I still
remember how to do that,

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:18.670
and I will tell you
that the solution looks

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.480
something like this.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.080
N of h is roughly 5, which is
the magic number that we talked

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.760
about in lecture--
roughly, which

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:34.880
means there might be some things
there that I forgot-- to the h.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.280
What really matters is that
it's an exponential in h.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.830
If you look at these guys,
this is close to the Fibonacci

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.720
number formula except
there's a plus 1 here.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.350
So these guys are bigger
than the Fibonacci numbers.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.670
This is definitely
bigger than whatever

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.045
the formula for
Fibonacci numbers

00:15:52.045 --> 00:15:58.160
is, which is 5 to the h minus
something over something.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.700
What really matters is the
minimum number of nodes

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.240
in an AVL of height h is an
exponential as a function of h.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.110
If you invert that, you
get that the maximum height

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:20.160
for a tree with N nodes
is log N. This is a way

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.270
to construct an AVL that
shows you that the height has

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.400
to be logarithmic as long
as we can keep this rep

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.657
invariant true.

00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:31.094
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:16:31.094 --> 00:16:35.884
I didn't quite follow how you
got h minus 2 and h minus 1

00:16:35.884 --> 00:16:37.330
there.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.020
PROFESSOR: Here, here, here?

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.836
AUDIENCE: There.

00:16:40.836 --> 00:16:43.110
The tree down.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.930
This one?

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:44.630
This one?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.780
AUDIENCE: This one, yeah.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.363
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:16:46.363 --> 00:16:49.030
So suppose I'm at height 4 here.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.790
What's the best way to
construct an AVL that

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.720
has as few nodes as
possible but height 4?

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.990
If this guy has
to be at height 4,

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:06.180
then it has to have a child at
height 3, at least one child.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.880
Otherwise, it's not
going to be height 4.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.609
Now, I need to build something
here that has height 3.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:14.000
What should I build?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.430
The best AVL tree that I know
that has height 3, right?

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.940
I have to get to height 3
using as few nodes as possible,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.490
so I'm going to use this guy
because it has as few nodes as

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.230
possible and it has height 3.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.990
So this covers my right side.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:35.430
Now, for my left side, what
am I going to use here?

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.990
Another AVL tree that has as
few nodes as possible, right?

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.810
So I'm definitely keeping that.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:45.628
But what's going to
be the height of that?

00:17:45.628 --> 00:17:47.753
AUDIENCE: So we want the
difference to be less than

00:17:47.753 --> 00:17:48.384
or equal to 1?

00:17:48.384 --> 00:17:49.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.820
Otherwise, it's not an AVL.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.330
AUDIENCE: So it
would be of height 4.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.690
PROFESSOR: So I know for sure
that this guy has height 4.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.446
The difference has
to be plus, minus 1.

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:01.570
AUDIENCE: So it would be 2.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.590
PROFESSOR: 2, 3, 4.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.362
I know for sure I
don't want it to be 4,

00:18:06.362 --> 00:18:08.070
and now I have to
choose between 2 and 3.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.354
A tree of height 2
will have fewer nodes

00:18:10.354 --> 00:18:11.770
than a tree of
height 3, so that's

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.140
why we're doing it this way.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.870
So to build a tree of height
4, build a tree of height 3,

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.280
build a tree of height
2, connect them together.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.000
That's how we get to
this, and then this.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.500
Cool.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.660
Do people remember how to
do insertions and deletions

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.920
in a regular binary tree?

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:35.580
Yes?

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.540
How do I insert 6.5
here in this one?

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.910
AUDIENCE: You take 6.5, you're
like, oh, it's greater than 4,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.410
then you move to 5.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.410
Then you're like, oh,
it's greater than 5.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:53.920
Go to 6.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.230
Oh, it's less than 6, and
then it goes to the left of 6.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.586
I mean-- sorry.

00:18:59.586 --> 00:19:02.460
I meant left of 7.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.110
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.788
So it's bigger than--

00:19:04.788 --> 00:19:06.500
AUDIENCE: Testing you all, guys.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.920
Oh yeah.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.168
6.5 is bigger than 6, so
then it goes to the left of 7

00:19:12.168 --> 00:19:13.581
because it's less than 7.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.899
PROFESSOR: I thought I had my
example wrong for a second.

00:19:21.899 --> 00:19:22.940
AUDIENCE: I'm just tired.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.060
PROFESSOR: Me too,
so don't scare me.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.390
All right.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.740
So suppose we have heights
stored in the nodes here,

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.480
because we want to
do that for AVLs.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.960
We'll figure out why in a bit.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.520
The height of this guy used
to be 0, 1, 2, 3, right?

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.649
0, 1, 2, 3.

00:19:50.649 --> 00:19:52.190
What happened when
I added this node?

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.924
AUDIENCE: You added 1 to
everything [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:57.924 --> 00:19:58.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.340
So I went down on
my insertion path

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.960
to find out where to insert
a node, and then I added it.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.080
I just chose my
case conveniently,

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.810
but in some cases,
all the heights

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.990
of the nodes on that
path have changed.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.090
So in an AVL,
after we insert, we

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.720
have to make sure
that the height

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.000
of every node on
the path is updated.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.600
Does this make sense?

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.500
So the heights
will be 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.440
So the way we
implemented the AVLs is

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.690
that we do regular
insertions and deletions,

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.360
and then at the end, we say,
well it used to be an AVL.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.860
Now we added or
removed the node,

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.360
so it might be a
slightly unbalanced AVL,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.340
which means it's not an AVL.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.320
And we have the
rebalance procedure.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.042
So if you look at on the
second page of the code,

00:20:56.042 --> 00:20:59.620
insert and delete are
really tiny, lines 20 to 22

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.380
and 24 to 28.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.980
And they're really tiny
because they call the old code

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.500
and then they call Rebalance.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.200
So all the magic in an
AVL is in Rebalance.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.650
The first thing that
Rebalance does, if you see,

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.410
it has a while loop there, and
the first thing that it does

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:20.150
in the while loop is it updates
the height, and this is why.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.540
The height might have
changed after the insert,

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.210
so any decision based on
the old height is bad.

00:21:28.391 --> 00:21:29.640
That's why we have that there.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:33.780
Make sense so far?

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.440
So if you look at rebalance,
don't try to understand it

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.530
quite yet, but
what it does is it

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.307
calls Rotate Left
and Rotate Right.

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:48.640
Well, Left Rotate, Right Rotate.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.980
All the magic is in Rebalance,
and the tools that it uses

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.930
are Left Rotate
and Right Rotate.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.800
Now, I'm going to show you
what a rotation is supposed

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:16.950
to do in-- and the children
of these nodes are a, b, c, d.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:23.860
Also, this node is hanging
off of something here, e.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.630
If I want to do a
Right Rotate here,

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:33.360
so if I want to rotate the tree
like this, then after rotating,

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.806
it's going to look like this.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:57.240
So notice that c got moved
from B to A, but it got

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.320
moved in such a way that the
whole thing is still a BST.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.050
These guys show up in the
same order as children,

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.700
and these guys show
up in the same order,

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.404
so search will still work.

00:23:08.404 --> 00:23:10.570
This is how it's supposed
to look like as a picture.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.830
Let's try to write the
pseudocode for achieving this.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.160
AUDIENCE: First, you
identify the parent node.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.935
Step one.

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:26.320
PROFESSOR: Well,
let's say we have it.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.790
AUDIENCE: I mean from B.
You say, A is my parent.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.477
That's now going to
become my right child.

00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:33.060
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.740
So what do you want to change?

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.400
By the way, this whole thing
has to happen in constant time,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.150
so we're not allowed to go
anywhere inside here, here,

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.370
here, or here.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.870
We're allowed to
change these links,

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.510
but if you go
inside and try to do

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.500
more complicated
restructuring, that's

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.297
going to block the running time.

00:23:55.297 --> 00:23:56.880
We're only allowed
to change the links

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.570
that you see on the board.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:04.150
AUDIENCE: I know in the BST, not
BST node but BST, the delete,

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:08.050
if you're deleting the root,
they make up the pseudoroot.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:10.440
PROFESSOR: Let's
not worry about it.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.970
So Delete already did
that magic for you, right?

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:16.221
So the pseudoroot would be
here, so this node has a root.

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:16.720
We're happy.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.553
AUDIENCE: That's not
what I'm talking about.

00:24:18.553 --> 00:24:21.720
I'm saying that you could do
the same with B because you're

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.100
going to have to break a
link with lowercase c onto B

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.520
in order to flip it.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.510
So I'm saying you could have
a placer, some sort of place

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.607
to put it so you don't lose it.

00:24:35.607 --> 00:24:36.190
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:40.330
Let's see if we do that.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:44.650
AUDIENCE: The new right
child of B will be A,

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:50.840
and the new left child of A will
be C, and the new parent of c

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.750
is A.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.145
PROFESSOR: OK,
let's move slower.

00:24:54.145 --> 00:24:55.660
I have to write them down.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.131
So the new right child of B is?

00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:03.690
AUDIENCE: Is A.
Also, you probably

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.601
should do temp
variables to store them.

00:25:05.601 --> 00:25:07.100
AUDIENCE: I don't
think you have to.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.432
You can just swap the one
connection and swap the other.

00:25:15.064 --> 00:25:17.230
PROFESSOR: Let's do it
without worrying about temps,

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.150
and then we can figure
out temps later.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:26.000
So B's right becomes A. So
it's going to be like this.

00:25:30.674 --> 00:25:32.090
Let me erase this
confusing error.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.785
AUDIENCE: And A's
left child is c.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:52.250
PROFESSOR: A's left child is c.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.150
OK.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:56.790
AUDIENCE: C's parent is A.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:02.980
PROFESSOR: C's parent
is A. OK, very good.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.104
So I changed the child,
then I changed the parent

00:26:05.104 --> 00:26:06.270
so that they would match up.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.285
So if B's right is A, then
what should I do with--

00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:19.264
AUDIENCE: A's parent is B.

00:26:19.264 --> 00:26:20.680
PROFESSOR: Always
do them in pairs

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.790
so you don't lose track of them.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.516
And?

00:26:24.516 --> 00:26:29.592
AUDIENCE: B's parent is
e and e's subchild is B.

00:26:29.592 --> 00:26:30.300
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.606
B's parent is e, right?

00:26:32.606 --> 00:26:33.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:36.492 --> 00:26:40.170
PROFESSOR: So B's
parent is e, and--

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.090
AUDIENCE: e's left.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.470
PROFESSOR: Child is--

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:44.390
AUDIENCE: B.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.796
PROFESSOR: Because I
drew it like this, right?

00:26:46.796 --> 00:26:49.940
But if I drew it like this?

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.150
AUDIENCE: e's--

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.330
PROFESSOR: It would have
to be the right child,

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.931
so we have to look
at both cases.

00:26:57.931 --> 00:26:59.879
AUDIENCE: If B is
greater than e,

00:26:59.879 --> 00:27:04.749
then it would be right child,
and if B is less than e,

00:27:04.749 --> 00:27:05.977
it would be left child.

00:27:05.977 --> 00:27:06.560
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:18.540
So if B is greater than
e, then e's right is B.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:23.680
Otherwise, e's left is B, right?

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.540
Now, suppose comparisons
are expensive

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.874
and they don't want to do a
comparison to find this out.

00:27:27.874 --> 00:27:29.415
I want to play with
the tree instead.

00:27:29.415 --> 00:27:29.990
What do I do?

00:27:37.372 --> 00:27:41.880
AUDIENCE: Can you see which
one A was before that?

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.670
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.885
AUDIENCE: If A used
to be the right child,

00:27:45.885 --> 00:27:47.100
now B is the right child.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:47.766
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:47.766 --> 00:27:51.150
I haven't changed the child
yet, so I can do that.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.355
AUDIENCE: That's still a
comparison though, right?

00:27:54.355 --> 00:27:56.730
PROFESSOR: But now I'm doing
a pointer comparison and not

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.510
a key comparison.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.270
AUDIENCE: If e.r is A, then--

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:08.270
PROFESSOR: If e.right is A,
then it becomes B. Otherwise.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.707
OK, this looks good.

00:28:13.707 --> 00:28:15.290
So there's the issue
of temp variables

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.969
and assigning these
in the right order

00:28:16.969 --> 00:28:19.010
so you don't have too many
temp variables and too

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.310
many lines of code, and the
Python code in the handout

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.650
takes care of that.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.380
But this is the
logic that you want.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.890
So if you have to
write it from scratch,

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.270
you don't have to memorize that.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.760
Remember that you want
to get from here to here,

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.210
and do exactly the thought
process that we have here.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:42.060
What if I want to do a
left rotation instead

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.450
of a right rotation?

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:49.136
AUDIENCE: You just have
to change the r's to l's.

00:28:49.136 --> 00:28:50.010
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.090
Copy, paste.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.770
Swap l's and r's and we're done.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.120
Why do we need rotations?

00:29:02.902 --> 00:29:04.110
AUDIENCE: To rebalance stuff.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.200
PROFESSOR: To rebalance stuff.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:05.700
OK.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.069
Why do we rebalance stuff?

00:29:08.069 --> 00:29:10.001
AUDIENCE: Because you
don't want your code

00:29:10.001 --> 00:29:12.635
to crash when you add nodes
that are sequentially larger,

00:29:12.635 --> 00:29:16.042
and then you try to find
something, and then it crashes.

00:29:16.042 --> 00:29:16.625
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:29:16.625 --> 00:29:17.742
Why would it crash?

00:29:17.742 --> 00:29:19.283
AUDIENCE: Because
the recursion depth

00:29:19.283 --> 00:29:21.602
is exceeded because
you're going down

00:29:21.602 --> 00:29:23.040
the line trying
to find something,

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.517
and you go down too far.

00:29:24.517 --> 00:29:25.100
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.650
So pretending we don't have
a recursion depth issue,

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:30.670
then it's going to be slow.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:33.990
So you start from a nice AVL,
and if you don't rebalance,

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:37.430
you get to a BST that's
slow, slow, slow,

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.240
and then you'll fail our
tests and still get a 0.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:40.740
Yes?

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:47.560
AUDIENCE: But if you just
had a carrot-like tree,

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.470
or if you added, for instance,
4, and then you added in 5,

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.960
and then you added in 3,
and then you added in 6,

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.300
and then you added in 2,
you'd just get a carrot.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:02.930
So then I feel like AVL
wouldn't cover that case.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.970
PROFESSOR: Let's do
them in sequence.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.047
So what are we inserting?

00:30:12.047 --> 00:30:12.630
So you said 4.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.450
AUDIENCE: So you start with
4, and then you insert 5,

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.760
then you insert 3.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.700
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.402
4, 3.

00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:28.530
AUDIENCE: Then you insert
6, then you insert 2,

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:34.150
then you insert 7, and then 1.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:35.650
AUDIENCE: You've
got to rotate that.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:36.970
AUDIENCE: Well, the thing is--

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.515
PROFESSOR: Well, is this an AVL?

00:30:38.515 --> 00:30:40.032
PROFESSOR: Well, it's balanced.

00:30:40.032 --> 00:30:40.740
PROFESSOR: Is it?

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.454
AUDIENCE: No, it's not.

00:30:42.454 --> 00:30:43.390
5 is unhappy.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.140
AUDIENCE: That height
of the tree is only one

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.270
greater than the other height.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.015
PROFESSOR: So the
height here is 1.

00:30:53.015 --> 00:30:56.442
What's the height here?

00:30:56.442 --> 00:30:58.400
There's nothing here, so
the height is minus 1.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.060
AUDIENCE: I mean, but the
other side of the tree.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.820
PROFESSOR: So if you're
looking at this guy,

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.510
things look balanced,
but in an AVL,

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.572
this has to hold for every node.

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:16.780
If there's one node where
the heights are unbalanced,

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.434
the whole thing is unbalanced.

00:31:18.434 --> 00:31:20.350
Otherwise, the construction
that we did before

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.070
wouldn't make sense.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.320
AUDIENCE: It's all [INAUDIBLE]
within the [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.220
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.820
So now that we're going to
look at rebalancing, which

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.350
is the magic behind
AVLs, we have

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.920
to make sure that after we
start with something that's

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.329
slightly imbalanced, when
we rotate things around,

00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:37.412
we have to make sure that
everything gets balanced

00:31:37.412 --> 00:31:42.320
at the end and happy, so that's
a good thing to keep in mind.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:42.820
Good.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.730
Any other questions?

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.254
AUDIENCE: Is it
obvious that you can

00:31:50.254 --> 00:31:53.040
put any number of
nodes in an AVL tree?

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.700
PROFESSOR: Point
any number of nodes?

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.513
It's obvious that you can do
one node, or two nodes or three

00:31:59.513 --> 00:32:05.020
nodes, but is it true that
for any number of nodes,

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.030
you can arrange
into an AVL tree?

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.644
Does that make sense?

00:32:08.644 --> 00:32:09.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.030
So if you want to have
any number of nodes,

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.142
you call Insert, AVL Insert,
and then you'll get an AVL.

00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:16.808
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:32:16.808 --> 00:32:19.100
But what I'm trying
to say is, is it

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:23.230
possible to construct an
AVL tree out of 13 nodes?

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.230
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.158
AUDIENCE: Or 17 nodes?

00:32:26.158 --> 00:32:28.616
AUDIENCE: Is there a limit for
where that property will not

00:32:28.616 --> 00:32:29.115
fit?

00:32:29.115 --> 00:32:29.830
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.587
Is there some set of nodes--

00:32:31.587 --> 00:32:32.920
PROFESSOR: I like this question.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.160
I like this question.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:39.720
So what would be the
perfect binary search tree?

00:32:42.684 --> 00:32:44.999
AUDIENCE: An element
of log N height.

00:32:44.999 --> 00:32:46.540
PROFESSOR: An element
of log N height

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:54.200
and the complete tree, so
something that looks like this.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.665
Where did we see
this thing before?

00:33:04.665 --> 00:33:05.595
AUDIENCE: In the heap.

00:33:05.595 --> 00:33:06.470
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:08.650
So a heap looks
exactly like this,

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:13.620
except the values inside don't
fulfill the BST requirement.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.675
Otherwise, we'd know how
to build perfect BSTs.

00:33:15.675 --> 00:33:17.780
It so happens that we don't.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.350
But is this an AVL?

00:33:25.895 --> 00:33:26.478
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:34.082
AUDIENCE: That
example or in general?

00:33:34.082 --> 00:33:35.790
PROFESSOR: Let's start
with that example.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:36.415
Is this an AVL?

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.360
AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.600
The node just to the
left of the root--

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.250
PROFESSOR: This guy?

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.130
AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:52.032
That one's of height two,
so it has height one.

00:33:52.032 --> 00:33:53.240
PROFESSOR: This is beautiful.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.890
This is as good as it could get.

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.740
This is an optimal
binary search tree.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.190
This is perfect.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.100
It better match the
definition of AVL,

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.270
because otherwise, it would mean
AVL doesn't like perfect trees.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.830
So the good news is
that any complete tree

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:10.159
is going to be an AVL
because everything

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:14.989
is perfectly balanced or
almost perfectly balanced.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:18.690
The only thing that's not
complete is the last level.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.790
So all the paths from the
roots to the last level

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:25.810
are either height log N
or height log N minus 1.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.810
So wherever you do
the height comparison,

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.219
you're going to get
a difference of 1,

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:35.739
and we can keep
adding nodes to this.

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:39.179
This is how I'd build a BST
of as many nodes as we want.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.489
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:46.600
For the fixed heights, why
we try to minimize the nodes?

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.079
Wouldn't a better way to
build a more efficient tree

00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:55.120
is to try to
minimize the height?

00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:00.205
So instead of adding nodes
up, just fill in the tree?

00:35:00.205 --> 00:35:01.080
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.080
So you're thinking of how to
build an efficient tree, how

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.870
to build a good tree.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.760
Here, I'm trying to
prove the property

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.480
about the maximum
height of a tree.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.520
So here I'm playing
devil's advocate.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.980
I'm thinking, what is
the worst case for AVLs?

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.720
How do I make AVLs look
as bad as possible?

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.840
That's why I started this way.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.641
So usually, we're
the good guy coding,

00:35:22.641 --> 00:35:24.140
but after you're
done coding and you

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.050
know how your algorithm runs, if
you want to have peace of mind

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.200
and go to sleep well and
get full points afterwards,

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.300
it sometimes helps to
think as devil's advocate.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.200
How would I break
this algorithm?

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.410
What's the worst thing
that I could do to it?

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:38.680
And if you can find
something that breaks it,

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.560
well, you probably
know how to fix it.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.890
If not, you can
sleep well at night

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.776
and know that your
algorithm is sound.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:55.216
AUDIENCE: In that example
on the board, where we said

00:35:55.216 --> 00:36:00.250
the height of the tree on
the left side was h minus 1,

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:03.220
and then the other
side had the h minus 2.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:11.920
For that h minus 2
tree, every node in that

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:16.107
has to be h minus 2
height, every leaf.

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:17.190
Is that what we're saying?

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.810
Otherwise, it falls apart
because there would be one

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:20.310
that's--

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.518
PROFESSOR: So we're saying
that the root of this tree

00:36:22.518 --> 00:36:24.900
has to be h minus 2.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.970
And the way we do this
is we copy this guy over,

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.740
so this guy's lopsided, too.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:34.105
So it's not every path to
the bottom, just one path.

00:36:34.105 --> 00:36:34.646
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:34.646 --> 00:36:37.001
So it could be an incomplete.

00:36:37.001 --> 00:36:37.960
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:43.020
In that case, is that balanced?

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:48.310
PROFESSOR: So this was an
AVL of height 2, right?

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:51.530
If I stick it here, it's still
going to be an AVL of height 2.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.432
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:36:53.432 --> 00:36:55.140
PROFESSOR: This thing
will have height 2.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.518
This thing will have height 3.

00:36:58.518 --> 00:37:00.446
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:00.446 --> 00:37:02.743
So it's not everything
on the same level,

00:37:02.743 --> 00:37:04.784
necessarily, that needs
to be of the same height.

00:37:04.784 --> 00:37:06.230
It's only the children.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.210
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:10.340
So the two children, so two
nodes on the same level,

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.137
might have their heights differ
by one, but not more than one.

00:37:14.137 --> 00:37:15.720
If they could differ
by more than one,

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.480
you could have a link list.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.740
Because they differ by one,
then it's sort of sane.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:24.190
It's almost balanced.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.110
Good.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.130
I like the questions.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.820
It means you guys are thinking.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.903
I really like it.

00:37:28.903 --> 00:37:30.045
Yeah?

00:37:30.045 --> 00:37:31.550
AUDIENCE: If they differ by one.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.280
So you have an
ideal tree up there,

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.200
and then you have the
worst case possible.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.080
That wouldn't affect
performance at all, right,

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.520
if you have the worst case?

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.600
PROFESSOR: So what we know
what performance is we

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.090
have this guarantee.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:48.640
It's at worst a
constant times log n.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.240
This is constant times log n.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.530
The constant happens to be 1.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.890
This is a constant times log n.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:58.515
The constant happens to be
something bigger than 1.

00:37:58.515 --> 00:38:00.692
I think it's somewhere
between 2 and 3.

00:38:00.692 --> 00:38:02.952
AUDIENCE: That just
varies by the constant.

00:38:02.952 --> 00:38:03.856
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:03.856 --> 00:38:06.525
And since we only care about
asymptotics in this class,

00:38:06.525 --> 00:38:08.020
we're happy.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.760
But we don't know
how to build this.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.210
This is just something pretty
that we draw on a board,

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.940
but we don't have an algorithm
that efficiency builds

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:21.380
this out of a random series
of insertions and deletions.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.740
I hope we don't.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.090
Otherwise, I look bad.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:27.360
What do I want to delete?

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.164
AUDIENCE: Instead
of a binary search

00:38:34.164 --> 00:38:35.870
tree as the base
of the AVL, if you

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:39.785
wanted to have four
children per node,

00:38:39.785 --> 00:38:42.470
would this change
that much except you'd

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:46.606
just have twice
as many variables?

00:38:46.606 --> 00:38:48.230
PROFESSOR: That's a
good exam question.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.270
So it turns out that
there's this tree called

00:38:56.270 --> 00:39:01.490
a B tree, which has
1,000 or more nodes.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:02.486
AUDIENCE: B tree?

00:39:02.486 --> 00:39:03.897
Doesn't that stand for binary?

00:39:03.897 --> 00:39:04.480
PROFESSOR: No.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:10.972
It's B. Just B. That's
used for databases on disk.

00:39:10.972 --> 00:39:13.430
So there, you want to make the
height as small as possible,

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.763
because every time you get a
node, you do a disk access,

00:39:15.763 --> 00:39:17.140
and that's expensive.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.970
But once you do a
disk access, the nodes

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.430
can be as big as you want.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:25.730
You can read a few bytes off the
disk at roughly the same cost

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.870
as you can read a megabyte,
so you're better off

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:28.859
reading a megabyte.

00:39:28.859 --> 00:39:31.150
I might be exaggerating a
bit, but for a few kilobytes,

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.090
that's true.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:34.560
So B trees have
thousands of children,

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.880
and they keep them sorted.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.630
It's sort of like that,
but the fan out is huge.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.570
And it turns out
everything is still log n

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:44.256
as long as the number of
children you have is constant.

00:39:44.256 --> 00:39:46.434
AUDIENCE: But for this
rotation thing, though.

00:39:46.434 --> 00:39:47.350
PROFESSOR: Oh god, no.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:48.820
We don't have to rotate.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.640
It gets a lot more complicated.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.475
We haven't gotten to
rebalancing yet, right?

00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:56.350
Wait until you see how
rebalancing looks like

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.920
with two children,
and then imagine

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.920
trying to figure out the
cases for 1,000 children.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.560
That's not sane.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.450
In B trees, they
use something else

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.800
to make them balance
the right way.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.710
And of course, they're
harder than this.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:15.910
So let me try to get through
rebalancing somewhat quickly.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:29.080
This is where I forget
what I need to do.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:29.580
Rebalancing.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:27.450
So suppose we call
Rebalance on this guy,

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:30.930
and we know that the nodes
here have heights k minus 1,

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.600
this is k minus 1
or k, and this is k,

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.730
and I want to call
Rebalance here.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.040
Let's first figure out
if it's an AVL tree

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.030
or if there's something
wrong with it.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:44.675
What's the height here?

00:41:44.675 --> 00:41:47.221
AUDIENCE: k plus 1.

00:41:47.221 --> 00:41:49.220
PROFESSOR: So no matter
what the height is here,

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.400
the height here
has to be k plus 1.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.736
What's the height here?

00:41:53.736 --> 00:41:56.570
AUDIENCE: k plus 2.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:57.610
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.780
What else can you tell
me about this node?

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.980
If I call Check RI
on it, it's going

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.440
to crash because the
rep invariant for AVLs

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.970
does not hold here.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:13.900
This child at the
top of this tree

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.430
will have height k minus 1.

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.250
This will have height k plus 1.

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:18.980
The difference is more than 1.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.650
Not good.

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:22.544
So this is unhappy.

00:42:22.544 --> 00:42:23.710
How do we fix the situation?

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.200
AUDIENCE: Rotate
left around k plus 1.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.255
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:42:30.255 --> 00:42:33.520
So it better be a rotation,
because we spent so much

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.016
figuring out how to rotate.

00:42:36.016 --> 00:42:37.890
Let's see what happens
if we rotate this way,

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.370
and the way to
keep track of this

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.556
is I'm going to label my nodes.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:53.090
B, A, left child of A
has height k minus 1.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.316
This guy is k minus 1.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.480
So what's the height of A now?

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.432
AUDIENCE: k.

00:43:06.432 --> 00:43:07.896
Oh wait, that's not a node.

00:43:07.896 --> 00:43:10.840
Just k minus 1 or k.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.420
PROFESSOR: So this is a
tree of height k minus 1.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.310
This is a height of
tree k minus 1 or k.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:18.640
The height of this guy is?

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.140
AUDIENCE: k.

00:43:22.486 --> 00:43:23.920
AUDIENCE: k plus 1.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.520
PROFESSOR: Or k plus 1.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.300
The height of this
guy is definitely k.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.665
The height of this
guys is k or k plus 1.

00:43:30.665 --> 00:43:31.290
Is that an AVL?

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:32.510
Is it happy now?

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.430
So this is the easy kind of
rebalancing, one rotation

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.418
and you're done.

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:43.334
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the difference between k

00:43:43.334 --> 00:43:44.749
minus 1 and k minus 1 over k?

00:43:44.749 --> 00:43:46.290
PROFESSOR: It's not
k minus 1 over k.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.820
It's either k minus 1 or k.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.186
Bad notation.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.310
Thank you for the question.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.220
You saved everyone
from confusion.

00:44:00.028 --> 00:44:02.370
No, there's no
fractional heights.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:03.390
Anything else?

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.890
Thank you.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:04.490
That was good.

00:44:09.461 --> 00:44:09.960
All right.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.030
So this is easy, right?

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:12.270
This is the easy rotation.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.560
Let's do the hard one now.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:40.664
What's the height here?

00:44:40.664 --> 00:44:42.152
AUDIENCE: k plus 1.

00:44:47.112 --> 00:44:50.584
PROFESSOR: What's
the height here?

00:44:50.584 --> 00:44:53.580
AUDIENCE: Plus 2.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.550
PROFESSOR: AVL, not AVL?

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.310
AUDIENCE: No.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.810
PROFESSOR: k minus
1 on the left child,

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.650
k plus 1 on the right child.

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:04.350
The difference is more than one.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.120
Not an AVL.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.160
How do we fix this?

00:45:14.132 --> 00:45:17.620
AUDIENCE: Make a right
rotation [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.560
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.560
AUDIENCE: Make a right
rotation on k first.

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.378
PROFESSOR: So make a
right rotation where?

00:45:23.378 --> 00:45:25.242
AUDIENCE: On k
[INAUDIBLE] plus 1.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.665
PROFESSOR: Let me
break this up so we

00:45:32.665 --> 00:45:34.870
could see how that
would work out.

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.720
So these two are k
minus 1 and k minus 1,

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:48.140
and these nodes are
A, B, and C. So you're

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:52.450
saying do a right
rotation here, right?

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:54.940
Let's see what that gets us to.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.360
So A is the same,
and then here I'm

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:04.140
going to have C instead of B,
and B. The right child of B

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.700
is the same as it was before.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:14.920
The left child of
B is k minus 1.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.170
Then the left child of
C is another k minus 1,

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:21.510
and this guy is k minus 1.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:23.992
OK, what's the height at B now?

00:46:23.992 --> 00:46:25.920
AUDIENCE: k.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.320
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.759
What's the height here?

00:46:29.759 --> 00:46:33.140
AUDIENCE: k plus 1.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.022
PROFESSOR: And the height here?

00:46:35.022 --> 00:46:37.760
AUDIENCE: k plus 2.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.110
PROFESSOR: Is this an AVL?

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.936
So we're not done, but what's
the good news about this?

00:46:43.936 --> 00:46:47.664
AUDIENCE: Now you can
rotate it left around C.

00:46:47.664 --> 00:46:48.596
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:46:48.596 --> 00:46:49.530
Exactly.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:55.980
That is this, and we know
how to fix this in one step.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.630
You said exactly
the right thing.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:59.910
This is exactly what we do.

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:03.640
First, rotate here so
that we get to that,

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.390
and then we're in
the happy case.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.990
So intuitively, the difference
between the happy case

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:13.330
and the harder case that's
going to be happy eventually

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:16.860
is where the heavy
path is, so where

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.370
you have the bigger height.

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:24.500
In this case, k
plus 2, k plus 1, k.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:29.230
So the heavy path
is this thing here.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.160
It's a straight line.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.400
Because of that, we can
rotate here and then

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.290
redistribute the
weights uniformly.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:39.410
In this case, the
heavy path is this.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:44.920
It's a zigzag, so one
rotation won't fix it.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.570
Instead, we do one
rotation here so

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:50.570
that we make the
weights be distributed

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:52.610
in a straight line, and
then one rotation here,

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:55.230
which makes
everything look good.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.979
Yes?

00:47:55.979 --> 00:47:57.770
AUDIENCE: So that's
just a general pattern.

00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:59.694
And you redistribute
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.870
PROFESSOR: So the first thing
we do is say you're at a node

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:05.964
and you need to rebalance.

00:48:05.964 --> 00:48:07.380
First thing, you
check the heights

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.980
and see if it's
already balanced.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.120
If it's not balanced,
suppose your heavier node

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.700
is on the right.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:19.260
Then you go and see if
the right child is heavier

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.810
or the left child is heavier.

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:24.660
So you see if the height
distribution is a straight line

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:26.680
or is exact, and then
you decide whether you're

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.429
going to do one rotation
or two rotations.

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:35.050
So this is all nice and
good except for one thing.

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:39.105
The heights keep
changing here, and we're

00:48:39.105 --> 00:48:42.250
storing the heights
in each node.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:44.150
So if we're doing
all this rotating

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:47.830
without updating the
heights, then we're

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:49.924
going to have something
that looks like an AVL

00:48:49.924 --> 00:48:51.840
but doesn't keep track
of the heights anymore,

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.980
so eventually, we're going
to make bad decisions.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.440
So we need to
update the heights.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.254
Where do we update the heights?

00:49:00.254 --> 00:49:01.670
You can look at
the code and cheat

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:05.457
or you can try to think and
tell me the answer, either way.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:17.630
So this only does
rotates, right?

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:20.649
If rotates would be able
to update the heights,

00:49:20.649 --> 00:49:21.690
everything would be good.

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:23.520
I wouldn't have to
worry about this.

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:29.520
Pretend I hadn't deleted
the original case here,

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:38.050
which I think was A, B,
C, and then some children.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.720
What heights changed here?

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:50.640
When I did this rotation,
what heights changed?

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.040
AUDIENCE: B's height changed.

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:58.320
AUDIENCE: B, A, and
C is greater than B.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.240
PROFESSOR: B and potentially
A. If I'm not sure,

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.300
then I'm going to try to
update the height anyway

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.630
to make sure that I
have the right height.

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.790
After I do this, I have
to update the height on B

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:15.225
and update the heights
on A. Is this correct?

00:50:21.472 --> 00:50:22.960
AUDIENCE: And B.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.210
PROFESSOR: And all the way up.

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:26.240
Let's assume that happens.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.242
Does this look right?

00:50:28.242 --> 00:50:31.220
AUDIENCE: Don't you also
have to update for C?

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:31.940
PROFESSOR: For c.

00:50:34.886 --> 00:50:37.840
Did I change anything under c?

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.290
AUDIENCE: I think he's
talking about capital C.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.980
PROFESSOR: Oh,
capital C. Yeah, OK.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.185
So the children are the same.

00:50:50.185 --> 00:50:53.900
They were a and b before,
they're a and b afterwards,

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.586
so I don't have to
worry about this guy.

00:50:55.586 --> 00:50:56.960
The heights here
haven't changed,

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.705
so the height here
hasn't changed.

00:50:59.705 --> 00:51:01.080
But you're thinking
of a problem,

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.121
and that is good because
there is a problem here.

00:51:06.251 --> 00:51:09.632
AUDIENCE: What if there's a
subtree instead of small c?

00:51:09.632 --> 00:51:13.220
PROFESSOR: A subtree
instead of small c?

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:14.610
OK, so yeah, this is a subtree.

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.960
After rotating, this
subtree moves over here.

00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:23.236
AUDIENCE: Wait.

00:51:23.236 --> 00:51:25.580
You have to update A
first, and then update B.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.300
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.510
So the height starts
from the bottom.

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.260
The bottom height
zero, the next one

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.400
up, the next one
up, the next one up.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.920
Keep that in mind.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.640
Nothing changed below this guy,
nothing changed below this guy,

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:42.090
nothing changed here, so I
don't have to update these.

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:44.540
But when I compute the
height, update height

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.490
at the beginning of
the listing assumes

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:49.450
that the height of the
children is correct.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:51.116
So when I compute the
height of my mode,

00:51:51.116 --> 00:51:53.000
the height of the children
has to be updated.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.117
So if I call Update
Height of B first,

00:51:55.117 --> 00:51:56.950
I already know that
this might have changed,

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:59.420
so whatever answer
I get is bogus.

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:03.575
So this doesn't work
and I have to do this.

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:14.480
This is rotation.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.380
That's rebalancing.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.240
One more trick to rebalancing.

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:23.200
So we talked about rebalancing
the subtree at one node.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.660
What's missing
from this picture?

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.010
AUDIENCE: So you check
it on all levels?

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:32.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.560
So I made some changes here.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.830
My tree might look happy
starting from here on,

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:41.090
but if I did an
insertion or a deletion,

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:43.570
heights changed all
the way up, so I

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:46.635
have to go all the way up and do
more rebalancings potentially.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:51.600
And that's it.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.787
These are AVLs.

00:52:52.787 --> 00:52:53.620
Any other questions?

00:52:58.574 --> 00:52:59.490
Did you guys get them?

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:00.993
Do they make more sense now?

00:53:00.993 --> 00:53:01.820
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.030
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:04.300
Good.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:08.134
You'll have to play with
them on the next Pset.

00:53:08.134 --> 00:53:10.004
AUDIENCE: By "play,"
what do you mean?

00:53:10.004 --> 00:53:12.170
PROFESSOR: Well, you're not
writing it from scratch.

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.914
You have to modify
existing code.

00:53:13.914 --> 00:53:17.614
AUDIENCE: What are we
going to make it do?

00:53:17.614 --> 00:53:20.030
PROFESSOR: So you'll have to
keep track of something other

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.850
than heights.

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:22.670
You'll have to keep
track of a new value.

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:24.503
AUDIENCE: Oh, like the
minimum or something?

00:53:24.503 --> 00:53:26.020
PROFESSOR: Or something, yeah.
