00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.980
PROFESSOR: So we're going
to do a problem that

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.330
looks like the guitar problem.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.912
But it's a bit cooler.

00:00:31.912 --> 00:00:33.620
At the same time,
there are fewer states,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.370
so I think it's
easier to manage.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.286
How many people know
how to play DDR?

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:39.190
AUDIENCE: Well.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.980
OK.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.832
How many people know the
rules of playing DDR?

00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:46.040
Because otherwise I won't
be able to lift my hand up.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.970
OK.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.640
OK, so let's go through
an algorithmic model.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.510
So, you have a board that
basically looks like this.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.090
And you have four
touch sensitive pads.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.140
Up, down, left, right.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.230
And then you have
a center position.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.340
You also have a sheet of notes
that looks something like this.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:23.700
Say, up, up down, down, up
down, up, up down, left right,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.039
left, left right, right.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.830
So on and so forth.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.760
So when you see an
arrow of up, that's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.130
a constraint that
says one of your feet

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.310
has to be on the up arrow.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.410
Has to tap the up
arrow, actually.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.470
There's no constraint
for the other foot.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.770
So your other foot can be
anywhere else on the board.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.340
It doesn't matter.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.980
You are also allowed to tap
the board some extra times.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.130
So if you don't have
a note showing up,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.780
you can still hit the board.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.340
And there's no penalty.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.340
So you can hop around as
many times as you want,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.260
or as many times as you can,
until you run out of breath.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.550
So up basically means, it's
actually one foot has to be up.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.100
The other one center.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.589
Also, of course, because
of the design of the board,

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.130
it doesn't matter
what foot is where.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.251
So what are possible
goals for this game?

00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:25.000
AUDIENCE: Not to get an F.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.240
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.711
AUDIENCE: Hit all
the arrows when

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:32.637
they line up with the top row.

00:02:32.637 --> 00:02:33.220
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.680
So there are two different
ways of doing it.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.660
One, you said,
"not to get an F."

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.020
So I would say, given some
limited set of skills.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.220
So given a set of skills,
or your skill level

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.980
maximizes your score. right?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.606
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:53.230
PROFESSOR: This is
dynamic programming,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.115
so we always want to
maximize something.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.160
Now, if you're really good,
then another possible goal

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.740
is hit all the notes with
a minimum amount of effort.

00:03:13.495 --> 00:03:15.120
If you're going to
be in a competition,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.703
and you're going to
be doing 10 songs,

00:03:16.703 --> 00:03:19.890
you don't want to die after
the first song, right?

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.370
So, assuming you can do
everything reasonably well,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.830
this is another possible goal.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.804
Any other goals?

00:03:28.804 --> 00:03:29.970
So we're brainstorming here.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.210
This isn't set in stone.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.150
We've already seen the formal
solution for this problem.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.430
So I want to play with it
for a little bit, right?

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.910
We brought a DDR pad, so
I want to play with it.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.990
What else could you hope
to maximize or minimize

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.205
for with dynamic programming?

00:03:51.262 --> 00:03:54.590
AUDIENCE: Not look ridiculous.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.470
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.961
AUDIENCE: I guess we're looking
at the cost of each move,

00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:00.460
right?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.180
PROFESSOR: So,
hit all the notes.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.685
Minimum effort, or otherwise
say best appearance.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.230
So every move looks somewhat
good or somewhat bad.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.269
And you want to do the moves
that look as good as possible.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.410
So this maximizes
entertainment, right?

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.830
if you're on TV, you
probably want this.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.590
Now suppose you are
in a competition

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.640
and you only have
one track to play.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.254
AUDIENCE: Well, you know
where all the notes are.

00:04:45.254 --> 00:04:45.920
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.919
Like, we assume that we
know this ahead of time.

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.032
So you've memorized this.

00:04:49.032 --> 00:04:50.990
And you're trying to
compute the best strategy,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.031
so you can memorize that.

00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:53.980
Then when you go and
play, you dominate.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.769
PROFESSOR: So, if
you have one track,

00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:58.560
then I would say that
what you'd want to do

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.950
is minimize your
probability of failure.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:01.450
Right?

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.459
So given the probability of
failure for each possible move.

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:07.750
You want to minimize the
overall probability of failure

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.170
so your teammates
won't hate you.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.386
So, hit all the
notes and minimize.

00:05:24.037 --> 00:05:26.370
So this one's a little bit
different from the other ones

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.953
because all the other
ones are already

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:30.390
set up as a nice problem
where you add up things.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.880
So you can solve
them with graphs

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.770
or with dynamic programming.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.580
If you want to minimize
the probability of failure,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.320
then you want to maximize
the probability of success.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.840
The probability of
succeeding on all your moves

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.550
is the product of
the probability

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.321
of succeeding on each move.

00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:46.820
All right?

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.110
So if you have five
moves, then you

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.590
have five individual
probabilities.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.540
You multiply them up.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.820
And that's the probability that
you execute the whole sequence

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.930
correctly, and not stumble.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.430
So we have products
instead of sums.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.760
Yes?

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.093
AUDIENCE: Isn't it related
to the maximizing score goal?

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.240
PROFESSOR: You can.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.210
Well, not necessarily
because this one

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.520
says that you only have
some possible moves.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.450
I think in the end, all of
them, except for this last one,

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.840
can be solved using the
recursion depth we have for it.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.840
The last one, you have
to do a bit of massaging.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.339
And we're going
over that right now.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.610
So, you have products
instead of sums.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.695
How do you turn
products into sums?

00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:32.910
AUDIENCE: Logs?

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:33.850
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.220
So, for this one, I
would want to use logs,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.450
so that I can say that
I want to maximize

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.200
the log probability of success.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.660
Which is just the sum of the
log probabilities for each move.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.580
And then it looks like
dynamic programming, as usual.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.550
Now, if I wouldn't
want to use logs,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.920
if I'm using the DP formulation,
where I'm doing recursion,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.790
I can incorporate
products there.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.290
But it turns out,
I didn't practice.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.331
If you have a lot of
numbers that are close to 1,

00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.070
or that are close to 0,
so all the easy moves

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.920
are going to be really
close to 1, for example.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.310
If you have a lot of numbers
that are close to 1 or close

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.460
to 0, if you
multiply them up, you

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.830
get numerical instabilities.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.000
So we get the number
that's really close to 1.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.100
So for example, if I'm choosing
whether to do, say I'm here,

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.230
and I'm thinking, do I
want to move like this?

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.260
Or do I want to move like
this, and then like this?

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.970
These are both
pretty easy moves.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.785
So, in both cases, we're
looking at probabilities

00:07:35.785 --> 00:07:38.560
of success of 99.991%.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.010
And maybe 99.992%.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.445
So if you have numbers
with probabilities

00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:46.820
that are really close to 1,
and if you have a lot of them

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.960
and you try to
multiply them, you're

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.990
going to get a bad result.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.440
So all the products are going
to start looking the same.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.140
So we're going to get
a random solution,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.530
instead of what you want.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.640
This is a practical thing.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.100
It's called numerical
instability.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.310
And it's a practical
reason why you'd

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.789
want to use logs, instead
of multiplying things up.

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:08.330
So it's not just a
theoretical thing.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.200
It also makes life
nice in practice.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:12.700
OK.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.270
So we have a goal
that looks like this.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.630
Say, let's go for this one.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.820
Hit all the notes,
minimize the effort.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.480
And all the other ones can
be reduced to this one.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.490
We need to define effort, right?

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.300
Let's say that we have a
function called delta, that

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.280
takes two foot locations--
so, where both of my feet

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.500
are-- from and to.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:48.470
And it gives me a number from
0 to 1, where 0 is really easy.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.980
And 1 is really hard.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.480
So from would look something
like, my left foot is up.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.230
My right foot is centered.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.230
To would look something like,
my left foot is centered

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.550
and my right foot is up.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.730
So basically going
from here to here.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.427
So from left foot up.

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:13.330
Right foot center.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:13.960
To here.

00:09:16.432 --> 00:09:18.140
So there is some
difficulty there, right?

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.830
We have to jump, so it's not 0.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.230
I'm burning some calories here.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.530
So any move that I make
has some difficulty.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.300
And I want to solve the
game so that overall I

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.450
have a reasonably
small total difficulty.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.130
OK, are we understanding
the problem?

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.610
So we have three
possible avenues here.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.040
We can start solving it
using dynamic programming.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.550
We can start solving
it using graphs.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.670
Or we can have someone else
play the DDR again so that we

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.120
can get more hands
on experience,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.860
and look at what a good strategy
or a bad strategy looks like.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:58.860
So you guys get to vote.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.790
Who wants to solve this using
the dynamic programming?

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.550
Who wants to solve
this using graphs?

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.380
Who wants to get more
hands on experience?

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.160
Damn.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.280
I was hoping that DDR would win.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.620
You guys are boring.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.832
So, graphs, right?

00:10:20.832 --> 00:10:21.915
We're going to have notes.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.820
Notes represent states, right?

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.300
So a state is where you are
at some point in the game.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.510
And we'll have to define
what where you are means.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.550
And then, when you
jump, you make a move.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.150
So moves go between states.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.370
So in any game, you
have states and moves.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.980
A state is very
hard to put in time.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.021
And then you make a move.

00:10:45.021 --> 00:10:45.620
Like in chess.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.270
Your state is your
board position.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.200
And whether you're
moving, or your opponent

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.865
is the next to move.

00:10:50.865 --> 00:10:53.490
And the move is when you take a
piece and put it from one place

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:53.989
to another.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.710
So your vertices are states.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.270
And your edges are moves.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.110
So what's in a state?

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.050
This is our problem.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.740
Whether we're solving
it with graphs

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.140
or with dynamic
programming, this

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.937
is what everything
comes down to.

00:11:17.937 --> 00:11:18.770
What's in the state?

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.440
AUDIENCE: So your current
state is how much difficulty

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.920
have you-- what is the problem?

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.672
Are those representing
the probabilities,

00:11:36.672 --> 00:11:37.380
the difficulties?

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.400
Or.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.460
PROFESSOR: So this is the
difficulty for one move.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.000
Does it depend on
previous moves?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.797
AUDIENCE: No, but.

00:11:44.797 --> 00:11:45.380
PROFESSOR: No.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.530
So it's a nice thing to
note that the difficulties

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.779
for each move are independent.

00:11:58.746 --> 00:12:01.216
AUDIENCE: Would it be
dependent in real life?

00:12:01.216 --> 00:12:02.698
You'll get tired at the end.

00:12:02.698 --> 00:12:05.168
And he's able to
have less energy.

00:12:07.545 --> 00:12:08.170
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:12.060
So, in real life, we might
want to say that this actually

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.870
depends on how much energy
you've expended so far.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.740
And if we have time,
let's solve that problem.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.680
So the nice thing
about this problem

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.950
is there are many directions
in which we can take it.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.920
This is one of them.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.000
I'm fine.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.780
And I think we'll learn
a lot by doing that.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.340
So back to the original problem.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.100
Suppose that it doesn't
matter how tired you are.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.720
You're pretty
good, so you're not

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.413
going to be tired
enough to go [GASP].

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.020
So, mostly independent
difficulties for each move.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.240
What's in a state?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.417
AUDIENCE: The sum of the
difficulties up to that point.

00:12:56.417 --> 00:12:57.000
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.500
So.

00:13:09.666 --> 00:13:11.765
AUDIENCE: Your
appearance factor,

00:13:11.765 --> 00:13:12.885
if we're including that.

00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:13.610
Or are we only doing--

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.901
PROFESSOR: So we're doing this.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.801
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was just.

00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:18.763
Oh, effort.

00:13:18.763 --> 00:13:19.930
OK, we're minimizing effort.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.804
PROFESSOR: So the way
I like to think of this

00:13:21.804 --> 00:13:23.590
is, what is does a
solution look like?

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.458
It's made up of
decisions, right?

00:13:25.458 --> 00:13:26.416
What are the decisions?

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.500
AUDIENCE: To make that move
or don't make that move?

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.470
PROFESSOR: We'll see.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.040
But once you know what
the decisions are,

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.456
then you have to think, what
do I need to make a decision?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.650
AUDIENCE: The note.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:51.840
PROFESSOR: So, a
note is one of these.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.000
For some reason,
they're called notes.

00:13:58.717 --> 00:14:00.300
AUDIENCE: So you
know that somehow you

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.950
have to hit all of them?

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.116
Like, you can have
steps in between.

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:05.740
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.864
AUDIENCE: Moves in between.

00:14:06.864 --> 00:14:08.480
You have to hit all of them.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.420
PROFESSOR: OK, so I like this.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:15.640
So, every one of these is going
to have to generate a move.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.430
And there might be
some moves in between.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.950
Well, each move is going
to map to some edge.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.160
And I'm going to need vertices.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.510
So, as an algorithms program
where when I hear that, oh.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.040
I can have some moves in
between, I get really uneasy.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.424
Like, what is this?

00:14:37.424 --> 00:14:38.840
How many moves am
I going to have?

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.340
Is this going to
become really huge?

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.950
And am I not going to be able
to run any algorithm on it?

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.200
So let's think about that.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.910
How many moves would
I have in between?

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.409
And, what would I
achieve with them?

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.760
AUDIENCE: I guess you'd have
a max of, like, four, right?

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.584
I mean, you can put your
right leg someplace,

00:14:58.584 --> 00:15:00.250
and you can put your
left leg someplace.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.870
That's like a max of two.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.370
Right?

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.350
Or no?

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.350
PROFESSOR: So, let's
think of an example.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.670
You want to go, say,
I want to go, what?

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.930
From here to here, right?

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:13.980
AUDIENCE: Um-hmm.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.110
PROFESSOR: And
you're thinking what?

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.750
They can do this, oh sorry.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.430
So I can do this as one move.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.420
And this is one move.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:22.548
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:22.548 --> 00:15:24.236
Or you can just do
one jump, right?

00:15:24.236 --> 00:15:25.645
So it's-- oh, yeah.

00:15:25.645 --> 00:15:27.570
I guess that's more than one.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.090
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.660
So looking at this,
if I'm considering

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.240
whether to go from here to here.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:41.387
If I want to go either this way,
or if I want to go this way.

00:15:41.387 --> 00:15:42.970
So let's write this
down on the board.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:54.050
So I'm going from up
down to left right.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.120
And I'm considering, do
I want to go directly

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.690
or do I want to
go up right first.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.980
And then left right.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.980
Let's not do these arrows
because they're confusing.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.060
So, do I want to
transition like this?

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.990
Or do I want to
transition like this?

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:19.700
Well, I claim that, since
my moves are independent,

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.990
going from here to here,
if it's beneficial to go

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.990
this way instead of
this way, I would

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.070
want to go this
way all the time.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.330
So I would just say that, look.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.372
Inside my delta here, I
would say that, actually,

00:16:32.372 --> 00:16:34.371
if you know what you're
doing, whenever you have

00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:36.780
to go from here to here,
you're going to go like this.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.650
And the delta is going to report
to the total delta for this.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:49.150
So, if the problem is
that they have one note,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.550
and then I have my next note
like this, between these two

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.610
notes, I can always
go in one move.

00:16:58.544 --> 00:16:59.960
AUDIENCE: So you're
saying 1 would

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.550
like, including in our
difficulty function,

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.150
it'll also tell
us, like, what move

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.900
we should make to get there?

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.300
PROFESSOR: How to get there.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.270
The best way to get from
one state to another.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.770
Well, like when
you're learning DDR,

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.990
these are the
basic steps, right?

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.680
Like, you practice until you
know how to get from one place

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.410
to another.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.960
There is something else where
you need intermediate steps.

00:17:26.218 --> 00:17:27.634
AUDIENCE: Or if
you're holding one

00:17:27.634 --> 00:17:30.685
and then you've got
to move to another.

00:17:30.685 --> 00:17:31.185
Right?

00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:36.810
PROFESSOR: So, let's
not worry about holds.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.393
Let's say that we
would just represent

00:17:38.393 --> 00:17:43.390
holds as-- so if you have
a hold in a game, then

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.370
we're just going to
represent it like this.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.244
We're going to cheat.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.946
So we don't have
to deal with it.

00:17:50.946 --> 00:17:52.820
In real life, you would
have to deal with it.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.361
Like if you're actually writing
a program that trains people.

00:17:55.361 --> 00:17:59.970
AUDIENCE: What happens if you
have, like, right, left, up

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:00.780
or something.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.200
So let's say you start off
hitting your right foot

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:10.836
on the top, and then you have
to hit the right one again.

00:18:10.836 --> 00:18:12.420
And then you have
to hit up again

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.670
and then you have to transfer.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.700
So I guess anytime you
have to through the middle.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.700
You have move your foot.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.540
PROFESSOR: So I like the idea
of going through the middle.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.954
Why or how do you, why would
you go through the middle?

00:18:27.954 --> 00:18:32.099
AUDIENCE: To avoid crossing
your leg over or something.

00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:34.265
PROFESSOR: Well, what if I
have something like this?

00:18:37.791 --> 00:18:40.540
If there are DDR experts, I
know this isn't the right way

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.040
to do it.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:49.595
But one way of doing it is
left, right, left, right, left,

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:51.640
right.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.950
So then, I have some states
that account for the fact

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:54.741
that I'm centering.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.080
So, some people like
to do this, right?

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.070
Some people like to go to the
center as much as possible,

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.500
if they have time
between the moves.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.060
So then, I would need
at least one state

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.167
in between where I'm
allowed to center, right?

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:13.000
In order to represent
what I just did there,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.570
I need one move.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.610
So, one way I could meet
this is I have left center.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.980
And then left right.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.729
And then left right,
left right, left right.

00:19:30.729 --> 00:19:31.520
So on and so forth.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.160
But this would mean that
instead of doing this, which

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.091
is reasonably easy, I
would have to do this.

00:19:38.091 --> 00:19:38.590
This.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.940
And then jump, jump,
jump, jump every time.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.900
Harder.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.930
Not good.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:43.870
Not good for my knees.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.196
Not good for my score.

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:46.320
So I don't want to do this.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.200
I want to have an intermediate
state so I can say,

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.340
I start here and
then I get back here.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.540
Then I do this.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.610
Then I get back here.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.690
Then I go here.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.630
And then I go back here.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:03.510
And then go back.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.131
Do guys see how this works?

00:20:06.131 --> 00:20:07.964
AUDIENCE: You could
also rock back and forth

00:20:07.964 --> 00:20:10.882
to because they don't require
both feet to be on the ground

00:20:10.882 --> 00:20:12.269
the entire time.

00:20:12.269 --> 00:20:13.560
PROFESSOR: Rock back and forth.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.309
Hold that thought.

00:20:17.169 --> 00:20:18.210
That might come in handy.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.270
Assuming we have enough time.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.550
So, if we only do one move
every time we see a note,

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.720
we're stuck with this.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.180
In our to allow
re-centering, we have

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.550
to add states between the notes.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.210
We need to add an
intermediary state.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.530
And you can either think about
it, or take my word for it,

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:43.570
but if you represent the notes
using the trick that I said

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.460
above, and you want to represent
centering, then all you need

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.070
is one extra state.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.960
So one extra move
between every two states.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.210
Between two notes.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.070
And that's enough.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.270
Because that one extra
state allows you to center.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.610
And it allows you to do pretty
much everything a beginner

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.170
like me would know how to do.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.876
AUDIENCE: So you only need one
extra state between each note?

00:21:13.876 --> 00:21:14.500
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.690
That is the inside.

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.840
That is where I'm
thinking, right?

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.490
So I have to do both
this trick, to see

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.300
that I don't need an
infinite number of steps.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.320
And come up with the
need for centering

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.291
to see why I need one
intermediate step.

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:34.950
By the way, does
anyone know what's

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.594
the right way of doing that?

00:21:36.594 --> 00:21:38.260
What's the right way
of doing this move?

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.780
You said, rock back and forth.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.860
So I wouldn't rock back and
forth in this case, right?

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.940
Because that
wouldn't be helpful.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.648
How would I rock?

00:21:46.648 --> 00:21:48.156
AUDIENCE: Well,
you hold down one

00:21:48.156 --> 00:21:49.530
and then you go
to the other one.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
rock left and right.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.338
OK.

00:21:52.338 --> 00:21:54.530
AUDIENCE: I said back and
forth, I meant rocking--

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.238
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:21:55.238 --> 00:21:57.170
I thought back, forth.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.090
So, the optimal
way of doing this

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:04.690
is left, right, left,
right, left, right.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.497
So what am I doing?

00:22:06.497 --> 00:22:07.830
AUDIENCE: You have another move.

00:22:11.281 --> 00:22:15.460
You have, like, one
state for your foot where

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.400
it's not touching the ground.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.110
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.160
It's an interesting, and
important, distinction.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.160
So if I wanted to hit
both of them, if I'm here,

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.200
and I need to hit both of
them, I need to hit them.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.770
If I only need to hit
one of them, if I'm here,

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.430
I can hit it like this.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.180
If I'm here, though,
and I want to hit it,

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.659
I have to lift myself up.

00:22:34.659 --> 00:22:36.450
So the difference is
whether I'm like this.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.409
Or like this.

00:22:37.409 --> 00:22:38.200
Where is my weight?

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.860
So if I want to allow
for these moves,

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.800
if I want to go past the
stage of very beginner,

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.190
aside from keeping track
of where my feet are,

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.750
I have to keep track of whether
my weight is on my left foot

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.920
or on my right foot.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.570
So, I would actually
have l, r, and W,

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.210
where W is either l or r.

00:23:07.138 --> 00:23:11.265
AUDIENCE: So your state now
has what you're currently

00:23:11.265 --> 00:23:13.810
putting more weight on.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.770
PROFESSOR: And where
each of the feet are.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:16.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.890
Where your two feet are.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.146
And then also, the
song difficulty.

00:23:22.146 --> 00:23:24.070
So it's everything
in your state, right?

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.470
PROFESSOR: Ah, yes.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.470
I didn't think about it.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.159
I was just talking
about foot position.

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:29.950
But we need to get back
to the state thing.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.270
So that's a good point.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.360
So before we get to that, how
many feet positions do we have?

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.610
If we don't include where
do I have my weight,

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.230
how many possible positions
for both of my feet do I have?

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.370
So I have two feet.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.910
Each of them can be in any
of these five squares, right?

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.043
So how many total positions?

00:23:54.043 --> 00:23:57.256
AUDIENCE: 5 choose 2.

00:23:57.256 --> 00:23:58.620
Using 2.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.358
PROFESSOR: So I can do this.

00:24:00.358 --> 00:24:00.983
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:24:00.983 --> 00:24:02.340
Why not?

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.616
PROFESSOR: Well, if I have
5 choose 2, then you--

00:24:04.616 --> 00:24:05.430
AUDIENCE: Oh, then that
doesn't quite work.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:06.096
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:06.096 --> 00:24:07.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.978
PROFESSOR: So flip.

00:24:12.978 --> 00:24:13.734
AUDIENCE: Times 2.

00:24:13.734 --> 00:24:14.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.980
So you have two feet.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.260
Each foot, five possibilities.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.110
Now, what if we have weight?

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.670
If we are tracking on
where I keep my weight.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.275
How many possible positions?

00:24:31.006 --> 00:24:31.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.480
Oh no, because there's only two.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.700
PROFESSOR: So,
for each of these,

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.470
there's two possibilities now.

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:39.370
So 50.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.170
AUDIENCE: You also have to be
so your weight is like this.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:41.880
PROFESSOR: In the middle?

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.287
PROFESSOR: You can.

00:24:44.287 --> 00:24:46.620
Based on that what I've been
reading, you never want to.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.370
Because if you're
weight is in the middle,

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:53.229
then you're extending a lot
of effort to move either foot.

00:24:53.229 --> 00:24:55.270
So you always want to have
your weight somewhere.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.895
So that, at least
for one of your feet,

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.849
it's easy to move it.

00:24:58.849 --> 00:25:00.582
AUDIENCE: Could it be the back?

00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:02.290
PROFESSOR: If that's
not true, then yeah.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.569
We'd need to have a center.

00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:06.610
Oh, so, like, whether I'm
like this or like this?

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:06.852
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:06.852 --> 00:25:08.554
If you were, like,
doing the same thing.

00:25:08.554 --> 00:25:09.530
Rocking back and forth.

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.946
PROFESSOR: So, if
I have two feet,

00:25:10.946 --> 00:25:13.100
then this says my weight
is on my left foot.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.070
My weight is on my right foot.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:20.070
So l and r is which foot,
not where on the board.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.900
AUDIENCE: So, did you not do
center because it was optimal?

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.250
PROFESSOR: Because I claim
that, in an optimal strategy,

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.240
you wouldn't have it.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.060
But you don't have to
take my word for it.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.060
If you don't believe
me, then you add center.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.110
And you just have
more possibilities.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.220
And if it happens to
not be an optimal thing,

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.260
then the dynamic
programming will ignore it.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.860
So how many positions do
I have if I add center?

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.099
So if I have left, center,
right for each position.

00:25:44.099 --> 00:25:44.640
AUDIENCE: 75.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.806
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.395
Yes.

00:25:51.395 --> 00:25:53.453
AUDIENCE: So why is it 25?

00:25:53.453 --> 00:25:56.945
You wouldn't actually have
both of your feet on the right.

00:25:56.945 --> 00:25:57.570
PROFESSOR: Why?

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.720
Maybe, well especially, for
maximizing this one actually.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.800
Especially for
maximizing entertainment.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.515
Then it's way cooler
to do this, right?

00:26:10.515 --> 00:26:12.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:13.580
You get the point.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.746
AUDIENCE: --possible weight.

00:26:14.746 --> 00:26:16.757
Like combinations
for like, where is

00:26:16.757 --> 00:26:18.340
you should have your
feet at one time.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.764
Like, not necessarily what
the game is asking you to do.

00:26:20.764 --> 00:26:21.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:25.040
So this is where my feet are.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.964
The game will always
ask something like this.

00:26:26.964 --> 00:26:29.130
So the game won't always
care about both of my feet.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.930
Sometimes it'll only
care about one foot.

00:26:33.241 --> 00:26:33.740
So, yeah.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.406
There are two different
concepts, right?

00:26:35.406 --> 00:26:37.900
There's the position of my feet.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.479
And then there's the
note on the screen.

00:26:40.479 --> 00:26:42.520
And my feet have to match
the note on the screen.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.500
And we'll have to
capture that somehow.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.370
So what's in a state?

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.169
What are my decisions?

00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:50.710
Come on, now.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.780
We should be in a good shape
to know what my decisions are.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.990
What do I decide every time?

00:26:57.906 --> 00:27:00.034
AUDIENCE: What move to make?

00:27:00.034 --> 00:27:00.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.950
How am I going to jump, right?

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.510
Where my feet are going
to be in the new position.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:12.570
So every time, I'm deciding
what's the new foot position.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.810
AUDIENCE: Aren't you also
deciding weight position,

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.157
where you're going
to hold to, right?

00:27:17.157 --> 00:27:17.740
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:21.240
So when I say foot position,
it's a cheat for everything.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:24.880
So yeah.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.650
Good observation.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.560
OK.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.680
What do I need to know, in
order to make this decision?

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.450
OK.

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.450
I would need to know
where I was before

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.620
if I want to compute
the difficulties.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.750
But aside from that-- what?

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:48.540
AUDIENCE: Sir, it came
up with this polynomial.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.450
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.899
AUDIENCE: Is that a hint to what
the run time of this will be?

00:27:53.899 --> 00:27:55.190
PROFESSOR: It's not on purpose.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.600
But yes.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.950
So, yeah.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:59.730
That makes sense.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.220
Probably not good.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.303
I should probably not have
my screen up without me

00:28:02.303 --> 00:28:04.570
looking at it.

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:05.510
OK, so.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.720
Back to decisions.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.530
I think I want to know what's
going to be on the screen

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.350
when I land, right?

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.120
Because if the screen says,
yo, you need to go up and down.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.872
Then maybe I shouldn't
do this, right?

00:28:17.872 --> 00:28:18.830
That would not be good.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.460
So I need to know what the note
is going to be when I land.

00:28:27.131 --> 00:28:27.630
Note.

00:28:31.318 --> 00:28:33.725
AUDIENCE: Is that
the same as the next?

00:28:33.725 --> 00:28:34.350
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.360
Next note.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.480
Yes.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.050
So the next note
here on the screen.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.880
So, my position in
this list, basically.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.296
AUDIENCE: So it's kind of like
the knapsack problem, where

00:28:45.296 --> 00:28:48.005
it's like which thing we're
considering picking up.

00:28:48.005 --> 00:28:51.470
But in this case, it's
coming [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.720
PROFESSOR: So it's
close to knapsack.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.970
But the difference
is, in knapsack, I

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:02.680
have to decide, do I choose
this or do I ignore it.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:11.779
So, if I'd be like, if I
can only do a few things

00:29:11.779 --> 00:29:13.320
and I want to maximize
my score, then

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.870
maybe I would choose, all right.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:15.450
This is easy.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:16.241
I'm going to do it.

00:29:16.241 --> 00:29:16.870
This is hard.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:17.370
Screw it.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:17.860
This is easy.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:18.651
I'm going to do it.

00:29:18.651 --> 00:29:20.780
So then my decisions are 0, 1.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.610
Pick or not pick.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.520
In this case, every
time my decision

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.870
is a new state of my feet.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.046
So it's not 0, 1.

00:29:27.046 --> 00:29:27.860
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.260
PROFESSOR: That's
the difference.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.310
And then, because
of that, the state

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:32.570
is going to look different.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.520
And the recursion's will
look a bit different.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.240
OK.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.710
So I want to know the
note that I'm landing at.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:46.845
I want to know
the sum of-- well,

00:29:46.845 --> 00:29:48.970
we'll see if I want to know
the sum of difficulties

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.230
up to this point.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.730
And I want to know
one more thing, so.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.310
If this is going
to be my new state,

00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:00.900
and I know what note I'm landing
at, I'm making a decision.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.240
The decision tells me where
my feet are going to be.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:07.820
Right?

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.390
The move decides where
my feet are going to be.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.640
What do I need to do?

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.672
What else do I need to
know for my total solution?

00:30:16.672 --> 00:30:19.005
So what do I need to know to
consider between decisions?

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:31.290
So say I'm considering the
state of-- I'm at note two.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.750
Note two says, left right.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:38.790
And I'm considering
of coming here

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:44.700
from note one, where my
foot position was up down.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.510
Or come here from
note one, where

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.270
my foot position was left right.

00:30:57.671 --> 00:30:59.420
I need to know where
my foot position was,

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.650
to choose between these, right?

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.795
If I don't know that,
then I can't choose.

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:06.170
AUDIENCE: That's not
from your state, though?

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.115
PROFESSOR: Not yet.

00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:09.010
It's not here, so it's
not part of my state.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.570
We've been talking about it a
lot, but we didn't put it here.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.070
So let's say that
the state is going

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.640
to have the note
that I'm landing at.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.550
And my foot position
after landing.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:33.100
So, if I know that I'm
going to land like this,

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.530
then I know where
I was here. l r.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.920
Say, l r.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.650
I can compute the
costs here, right?

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:47.010
This is delta of going
from this to this.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:53.641
And this is the delta for
going from this to this.

00:31:53.641 --> 00:31:54.540
Can you see?

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.290
Is that too small?

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.210
Delta wants to know where
my feet were before.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.910
And where they're
going to be now.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.290
So when I call it, I need
to know where I was before.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.165
And I need to know where
I'm going to be now.

00:32:08.165 --> 00:32:11.360
So this should be
part of my state.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.140
So our decision says, what's
my new position going to be?

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.610
So when I make a move, I
influence my new foot position.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.450
They're going to
be in someplace.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:25.242
And independently of that,
the note-- the position here--

00:32:25.242 --> 00:32:27.575
the position of the note,
increases all the time, right?

00:32:27.575 --> 00:32:28.991
Because time can
only go forwards.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.010
How are we going to account
for these extra moves?

00:32:38.689 --> 00:32:40.824
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:40.824 --> 00:32:42.990
PROFESSOR: So, we said that
between every two notes,

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.200
we might want to
make one extra move.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.092
AUDIENCE: Like, a
potential new note

00:32:53.092 --> 00:32:56.610
in between your
destination note?

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:57.442
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:32:57.442 --> 00:33:00.385
AUDIENCE: And then just fill
in the difficulties for that

00:33:00.385 --> 00:33:01.350
and see which ones--

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.850
PROFESSOR: So, if I want to use
the algorithm that I already

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:07.090
have, that compares my
landing position to my note,

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:10.470
to see whether I can go
there or not, what note would

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:14.670
I want to put in that
intermediate note?

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:18.750
So, you're basically saying
that between every two notes,

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.560
I'm going to have one more note.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.903
And my feet can
be wherever here.

00:33:24.903 --> 00:33:25.444
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:33:25.444 --> 00:33:28.228
I mean, you'll also
have the edge originally

00:33:28.228 --> 00:33:30.550
connecting them.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.820
So, you'd have it going
to the intermediate note,

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.070
but also from the destination.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.763
Yeah, like that.

00:33:35.763 --> 00:33:38.070
You'd have to--

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:42.630
PROFESSOR: So, what
note would I have here?

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.556
AUDIENCE: It makes
you go to the center.

00:33:44.556 --> 00:33:46.000
PROFESSOR: Do I have
to be at the center?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.370
AUDIENCE: Well, you
can be anywhere.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.036
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:48.036 --> 00:33:50.900
So I'm going to
invent the blank note.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.360
That's a big O. That means
you can do whatever you want.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.820
There are no constraints.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.800
So that is just an
intermediary state.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.790
So then I'm going
to take this input,

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.710
and I'm going to add
these blank notes here.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.690
And these map to adding
notes in the graph.

00:34:11.026 --> 00:34:12.484
AUDIENCE: Well,
then, when you just

00:34:12.484 --> 00:34:16.320
run through your difficulty
function between each two notes

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.854
and see if, for all the
potential moves, which

00:34:20.854 --> 00:34:23.656
one minimizes that path.

00:34:23.656 --> 00:34:25.060
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.190
So basically, I'm assuming
I don't need this.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:30.065
I'm assuming that.

00:34:30.065 --> 00:34:31.440
This is going to
be where there's

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.989
at least one choice
where this is going

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:37.377
to have the same cost
as a direct note.

00:34:37.377 --> 00:34:38.960
And then I'm going
to say that instead

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.260
of having more complex
shapes in the graph,

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.138
I'm going to insert
extra moves here.

00:34:46.138 --> 00:34:46.679
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.053
I would think that, if you
have an intermediate move that

00:34:49.053 --> 00:34:52.570
might be less expensive,
you should, like, just

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:54.411
hop to that new
position than to have

00:34:54.411 --> 00:34:56.374
an intermediate move, right?

00:34:56.374 --> 00:34:57.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.375
And I'm going to assume that
either that's not the case,

00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:02.500
or that I can always find
an intermediate move that

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.290
makes my life better.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:06.564
AUDIENCE: Every case?

00:35:06.564 --> 00:35:07.230
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:12.786 --> 00:35:14.255
PROFESSOR: These
results do work.

00:35:14.255 --> 00:35:16.380
You'll have to take my word
for it that this works.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.860
And this makes your
dynamic programming easy.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.500
And it makes your
graph building easy.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.370
So the advantage of this is
you're changing the input.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.160
And then, when you're
building your graph

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.000
or when you're doing
the DP, you only

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.430
worry about an input
that looks like this.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.720
You don't care about
any intermediate stuff.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.270
You have notes, and you have to
transition between the notes.

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:36.240
Period.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.365
So we reduce the
complexity of the problem.

00:35:39.365 --> 00:35:41.740
So whenever you can get away
with that, it's really nice.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.970
We can do that for centering.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.530
We might not be able to do
it for other more complicated

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:47.029
stuff.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.990
OK.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:57.730
So, we sort of know
what we want in a state.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.950
Now we want to build a
graph, so that the path

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:05.140
from some source
to some destination

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:10.970
has a cost that's equivalent to
the sum of these difficulties.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:11.470
Right?

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.220
Because then I can
run the shortest path.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.330
And my solution
will be right there.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:17.830
I know.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:18.950
You guys seem awfully sad.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.970
Do you want to take a break
and play for a little bit more?

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:24.790
Yes?

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:28.797
How many people want
to play, instead of.

00:36:28.797 --> 00:36:30.130
You don't have to play yourself.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:32.720
You can just rest for
these two or three minutes.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.220
And you can watch
someone else play.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.311
And get more intuition about
how you're supposed to play.

00:36:39.741 --> 00:36:40.240
OK.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.820
So one person wants
to take a break.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.110
Everyone else wants
to keep going?

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.440
Or are you guys
passed out already?

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.731
AUDIENCE: Can we get out early?

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:49.920
PROFESSOR: Sort of.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.420
Yeah.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.878
You'll get out
three minutes early,

00:36:51.878 --> 00:36:55.410
if we don't do another round.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.933
So who wants to keep going?

00:36:57.933 --> 00:36:58.474
AUDIENCE: No.

00:36:58.474 --> 00:37:01.057
Let's play.

00:37:01.057 --> 00:37:01.640
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.765
So who wants to keep going?

00:37:02.765 --> 00:37:04.241
You can only vote on one thing.

00:37:04.241 --> 00:37:04.990
Who wants to play?

00:37:08.297 --> 00:37:08.838
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:08.838 --> 00:37:09.463
AUDIENCE: Five.

00:37:09.463 --> 00:37:10.960
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.100
AUDIENCE: Victor, go.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.050
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:15.680
Who wants to go?

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.330
So we decided what we're
going to have in notes.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.730
And we're going to
build a graph, where

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:22.200
the notes are the states.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.830
And the edges are the moves.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.630
Right?

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:29.300
So a note tells me, just
like there, what note I'm at.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.440
Say I'm at note two.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.440
And where my feet are on.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.320
So, left foot left.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.290
Right foot right.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:42.270
So, given a state, what
outgoing edges do I build?

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.950
Where can I go to?

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:47.480
So let's say I have a state
that says I'm at note n

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.320
and my left foot is
in some position.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.000
My right foot is
in some position.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.656
What are my outgoing
edges from here?

00:37:55.656 --> 00:37:58.340
AUDIENCE: Is there an
outgoing edge to every move?

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.497
Because there's a point.

00:37:59.497 --> 00:38:00.080
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:05.660
Well, actually, the
blank is a note, right?

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:09.750
So if the next note, if
note three's a blank,

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.610
then the note is a blank.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.464
And then I can have.

00:38:13.464 --> 00:38:16.470
AUDIENCE: I guess,
isn't the difficulty

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:21.585
of the move dependent on what
note that blank actually is?

00:38:21.585 --> 00:38:23.960
PROFESSOR: So, it doesn't
depend on what the screen says.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.232
It depends on where my feet are.

00:38:27.232 --> 00:38:27.940
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:28.464
I see.

00:38:28.464 --> 00:38:29.880
PROFESSOR: So I
have a number that

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.690
tells me what's on my screen.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.980
This number is
enough for me to know

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.610
what's going to be on my screen
from now on until forever.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.080
Because I have the
list ahead of time.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.010
And then I have the
position of my feet.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.300
So these are both
part of the state.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.310
So I have notes
for all the notes.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.470
And all the positions
of the feet.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.270
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:55.240
But the blank note is
just one position of feet?

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.010
PROFESSOR: No.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.120
AUDIENCE: Or, it's
all positions.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:57.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.124
AUDIENCE: Isn't the
difficulty dependent

00:38:59.124 --> 00:39:01.014
on what position
your feet end up?

00:39:01.014 --> 00:39:01.680
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.690
So it's from where I
start to where I land.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:14.030
So, if I decide to start
from here, and go here,

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:18.080
the difficulty of this move
is-- so it doesn't depend on

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.520
whether I have a blank there.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.450
And this was OK.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.320
Or, if I had an up down,
then I just missed the note.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.120
But the difficulty, the effort
I'm expending, is the same.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.120
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.120
But if you start from that
other move and go to a different

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.150
position, that's--

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.060
PROFESSOR: If I go
from this to this,

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.747
then that's a
different difficulty.

00:39:35.747 --> 00:39:38.609
AUDIENCE: But it still
could be a blank note?

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:39.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.025
So, a blank note will let
me go wherever I want.

00:39:42.025 --> 00:39:43.630
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:49.098
But there are different kinds
of blank notes, with different--

00:39:49.098 --> 00:39:50.717
I guess I'm confused
as to what--

00:39:50.717 --> 00:39:51.300
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.591
So let's go through them again.

00:39:52.591 --> 00:39:55.200
AUDIENCE: Is it kind of
like it's, like, spreading,

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.860
so really when you
have your source note,

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.660
it's actually connecting
to every possible move.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.080
And every possible move is
connecting to your next--

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.913
so it's kind of like a
diamond shaped thing?

00:40:08.685 --> 00:40:09.560
PROFESSOR: Not quite.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.430
Not quite.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:12.220
So, let's go through
the notes again.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.730
And then let's go through that.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:16.030
So the source move will be
connected to some notes.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.280
And then those notes will
be connected to other notes.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.490
And it looks more like you
have a big, outgoing degree.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:22.836
Then you have a big network.

00:40:22.836 --> 00:40:24.085
Then the big, incoming degree.

00:40:24.085 --> 00:40:27.082
It looks like a messed
up sorting network.

00:40:27.082 --> 00:40:28.165
So, notes are constraints.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:34.230
This accepts any possible
feet combination, right?

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:38.830
So this accepts this.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.312
AUDIENCE: Is the
first combination

00:40:40.312 --> 00:40:42.782
contained in that note?

00:40:42.782 --> 00:40:43.607
In that blank note?

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:44.190
PROFESSOR: No.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:45.273
The blank is a constraint.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.170
So, if I have a note that
looks like this, then

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.590
if one of my feet is here and
the other one is in the center,

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:55.750
then that's fine.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.517
The constraint is met.

00:40:57.517 --> 00:40:59.600
If one of my feet is up
and the other one is down,

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.110
then the constraint is met.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:04.652
AUDIENCE: But the edge
running into that blank note,

00:41:04.652 --> 00:41:09.976
depending on how your feet
land, is different difficulty.

00:41:09.976 --> 00:41:10.944
Is that right?

00:41:10.944 --> 00:41:12.410
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.980
But when I compute
the edge width,

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.590
I need to know where
I'm landing exactly.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.770
Not just where the note
is because the note might

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:20.250
admit multiple positions.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:21.077
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:41:21.077 --> 00:41:22.910
PROFESSOR: So this guy
admits all positions.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:23.940
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.050
PROFESSOR: This guy admits
some positions, right?

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.140
These are l r, l r.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:33.150
If I have up down, how many
feet positions does it admit?

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:34.115
AUDIENCE: Just one.

00:41:34.115 --> 00:41:34.990
PROFESSOR: Not great.

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:36.830
AUDIENCE: No.

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:38.910
PROFESSOR: How many?

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:41.444
AUDIENCE: As an intermediate?

00:41:41.444 --> 00:41:43.610
PROFESSOR: If it's up down,
then it's on the screen.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.901
My intermediates are all blank.

00:41:44.901 --> 00:41:45.654
AUDIENCE: Oh, oh.

00:41:45.654 --> 00:41:47.844
I thought you were
saying start with that.

00:41:47.844 --> 00:41:48.760
PROFESSOR: So up down.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.135
If you see up down
on the screen,

00:41:50.135 --> 00:41:51.360
how many feet positions?

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.640
AUDIENCE: Left to right
what it could have.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.420
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.210
So, if the screen says up
down, the only two ways

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.740
I can do that is this.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:41:59.440
Or this.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:41:59.940
Right?

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.555
So, two positions.

00:42:00.555 --> 00:42:01.346
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:42:01.346 --> 00:42:03.637
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean, but
you could have intermediate

00:42:03.637 --> 00:42:05.850
where you step in the
first one, then back.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.890
PROFESSOR: But I don't
care because I've

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.120
added these blank notes.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.200
And they take care of
my intermediates for me.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.700
AUDIENCE: But so,
we're saying where

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:17.804
the feet land aren't
part of the note.

00:42:17.804 --> 00:42:18.470
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:19.640
They're just states.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.290
So they're a
decision I'm making.

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.816
AUDIENCE: So, do we
have the multiple-- no,

00:42:24.816 --> 00:42:28.500
we don't because they're
not part of the--

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.620
PROFESSOR: For each
note position here,

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.960
for every position
in the screen thing,

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.540
I have multiple feet
positions that I could be in.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.363
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:46.863
Right.

00:42:46.863 --> 00:42:50.895
But then, are there multiple
moves to get to those?

00:42:50.895 --> 00:42:51.520
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.061
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:52.061 --> 00:42:54.640
So there's multiple
moves connecting each.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:43:04.230
So for example, if I want
to get to l r, up down here,

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:09.360
I can go from l r,
up down in the blank.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.760
Or, I could have
l r be like this.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.040
And then transition.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:20.450
So I can have a lot of
possible foot positions

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:24.970
that I'm transitioning
from in order to get here.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.640
AUDIENCE: But those
aren't actually

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.837
separate notes on the graph.

00:43:29.837 --> 00:43:30.670
PROFESSOR: They are.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:33.620
They have to be.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.260
So these all have to
be separate notes.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.600
Because the edges are going
to have separate weights.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.100
Right?

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.680
This edge is going
to have one weight.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.160
This edge is going to
have another weight.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:42.820
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.736
That's what I thought.

00:43:43.736 --> 00:43:45.680
But then you said there
was only one blank.

00:43:51.999 --> 00:43:54.912
Don't there have to be multiple
blank notes for every foot

00:43:54.912 --> 00:43:55.610
thing.

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:57.485
If you're approaching
a note from different--

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:04.840
PROFESSOR: So, I'm not
sure what you're asking.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.796
So, if you want to
care about centering,

00:44:06.796 --> 00:44:08.420
if you want to have
intermediate moves,

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:12.060
you need one blank note
between every real note.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:16.122
So that you're allowed to make
one intermediate move between.

00:44:16.122 --> 00:44:16.788
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:16.788 --> 00:44:21.184
I get that that's talking
about the on the screen.

00:44:21.184 --> 00:44:21.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:22.520
That's the screen.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.180
AUDIENCE: That's the screen.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:23.805
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:44:23.805 --> 00:44:24.430
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:26.350
So, that's not
the graph, though.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.760
Here, we're talking about
the screen on the graph.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.780
PROFESSOR: Here, we're
talking about the graph.

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.540
So two tells me that the
screen is at note two.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.370
Whatever that happens to be.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:37.760
And my feet are
in this position.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:40.700
OK.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.450
So that's very important.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.560
Thanks for asking because
that's very important.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.350
So, a state has the note
that I'm landing at.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:48.650
So, where the screen is.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:50.185
And where my feet are.

00:44:50.185 --> 00:44:51.497
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:51.497 --> 00:44:52.080
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.270
AUDIENCE: The state corresponds
to the nodes that you're on.

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.020
PROFESSOR: A note.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.940
A note is a state.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.230
So, a note is a state.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:01.071
And a move goes
between two states.

00:45:01.071 --> 00:45:03.070
This is how we represent
all the graph problems.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.050
OK.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.834
AUDIENCE: So, you
need multiple blank.

00:45:10.834 --> 00:45:11.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.390
So here, I'm just
drawing one example.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:14.010
Yeah.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:14.240
Yeah.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.000
So for example, here
I would need-- sorry.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:16.589
Oh, OK.

00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:17.630
I get your confusion now.

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:18.129
So, yeah.

00:45:18.129 --> 00:45:20.930
This would be one move.

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:24.210
This would be another move.

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.796
AUDIENCE: That's all for a
single thing on the screen.

00:45:26.796 --> 00:45:27.420
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.286
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:28.286 --> 00:45:28.785
OK.

00:45:28.785 --> 00:45:29.695
That makes sense.

00:45:29.695 --> 00:45:32.028
AUDIENCE: So the next note
would have a really large end

00:45:32.028 --> 00:45:32.840
degree, right?

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.540
I guess they always have--

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.100
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:34.800
It'd have lots of--

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.385
PROFESSOR: So, this note
has a huge out degree.

00:45:36.385 --> 00:45:37.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:40.237
But I'm saying the ones that all
those intermediates connect to.

00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:40.903
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:40.903 --> 00:45:42.030
AUDIENCE: So, then,
they would connect

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.801
with some note that have,
like, really large degree.

00:45:43.801 --> 00:45:44.284
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:45:44.284 --> 00:45:46.450
AUDIENCE: But there's two
of them after that, right?

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:48.295
Because there would
be two different--

00:45:48.295 --> 00:45:49.420
PROFESSOR: So, what's next?

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.830
Next, is position, hmm.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:54.210
How did U number them?

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:57.452
I guess, crap.

00:46:03.111 --> 00:46:03.610
No.

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.080
It's not going to
match that, so.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.450
Whatever we do, it's
not going to match that.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:13.370
Say the next note,
4, is just an up.

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:19.890
4 is up down.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.880
And then I have two
notes for it, right?

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:22.800
Wild One note, l r.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.830
So this is note 4.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.060
That happens to be up down.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.270
And then I have this.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:40.767
And every one of these
connects to every one of these.

00:46:40.767 --> 00:46:42.350
AUDIENCE: If the
next move is up down,

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:43.561
how can notes have down up?

00:46:43.561 --> 00:46:45.060
Oh, because you can
switch the feet.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.556
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:46:45.556 --> 00:46:46.097
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:46:48.524 --> 00:46:49.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.773
So, I aimed to ask you guys, how
am I going to draw the edges?

00:46:51.773 --> 00:46:54.490
But you guys made me
do it with questions.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:57.040
So, suppose I met note n, l, r.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.760
What edges do I draw
going out of it?

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.914
So, note n, left foot
at some position.

00:47:01.914 --> 00:47:03.080
Right foot at some position.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.420
What are my outgoing edges?

00:47:07.476 --> 00:47:09.100
AUDIENCE: This is a
note on the screen.

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:09.620
Or--

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:09.860
PROFESSOR: In the graph.

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.693
AUDIENCE: --the new one
or intermediate one?

00:47:11.693 --> 00:47:12.850
PROFESSOR: Doesn't matter.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:15.106
So, intermediate notes
have a note blank.

00:47:15.106 --> 00:47:16.480
AUDIENCE: That's
just everything.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.688
PROFESSOR: It doesn't matter.

00:47:17.688 --> 00:47:20.720
Yeah, we're looking at all
of them at the same time.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.170
AUDIENCE: Wait, so
you're asking what are--

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:26.320
PROFESSOR: So, given this note,
who am I connecting it to?

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.510
Let's draw the outgoing edges.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:30.960
So, if you're solving
this as a graph problem,

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.860
you build the notes.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.990
You draw the edges.

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:34.471
You're on some algorithm.

00:47:34.471 --> 00:47:35.470
So let's draw the edges.

00:47:38.023 --> 00:47:40.481
AUDIENCE: I think it depends
if you're an intermediate note

00:47:40.481 --> 00:47:41.780
or not.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:42.600
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.190
So the note tells you
what your constraints are.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.830
And that covers
intermediate notes.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:52.099
If you're note is a blank, then,
well, there's no constraints.

00:47:52.099 --> 00:47:54.390
If the note is not a blank,
then there are constraints.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.639
AUDIENCE: Oh, note.

00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:56.830
I thought that was referring
to the note, not the--

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:57.413
PROFESSOR: No.

00:47:57.413 --> 00:47:58.860
So this is a note.

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.400
Maybe n is not good.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.702
Let's use i, instead, then.

00:48:03.702 --> 00:48:04.890
If n is hard.

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:08.647
So, i is the position
here, in this guy.

00:48:08.647 --> 00:48:09.146
Right?

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.015
Say for example,
i equals 1 here.

00:48:14.015 --> 00:48:15.090
I equals 2 here.

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:15.760
I equals 3 here.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.270
So and so forth.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:19.673
And that doesn't match this, so.

00:48:19.673 --> 00:48:21.172
AUDIENCE: We're
talking about note--

00:48:21.172 --> 00:48:21.797
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:48:21.797 --> 00:48:23.570
AUDIENCE: --not--

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:25.260
PROFESSOR: If one
note is represented

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.510
by these three numbers, right?

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:27.825
Each note has this tuple in it.

00:48:27.825 --> 00:48:29.495
AUDIENCE: Then i is the note.

00:48:29.495 --> 00:48:30.120
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.028
AUDIENCE: So i
connects to i plus 1.

00:48:32.028 --> 00:48:34.097
And then all
possibilities known.

00:48:34.097 --> 00:48:34.680
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.610
So this connects to i plus 1.

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:40.880
And then all possible
destinations, right?

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.380
So I'm going to say left.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.360
This is after the jump.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.630
So, left after the jump,
and right after the jump.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:54.340
And this is for all
possible left after a jump,

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.710
right after the jump.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:49:02.780
And lost a weight on this edge.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.940
AUDIENCE: The way
that it's from--

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:06.728
AUDIENCE: l r to

00:49:06.728 --> 00:49:08.997
AUDIENCE: --l r to l r.

00:49:08.997 --> 00:49:10.080
AUDIENCE: l j-- l sub j r.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.770
AUDIENCE: l r.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:16.850
PROFESSOR: So you want to
say from l r to l j, r j.

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:18.855
But what?

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:19.980
AUDIENCE: Difficulty level?

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:20.646
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:49:20.646 --> 00:49:21.922
Where is that?

00:49:21.922 --> 00:49:23.380
AUDIENCE: Your
difficulty function.

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.424
PROFESSOR: Which is?

00:49:24.424 --> 00:49:25.090
AUDIENCE: Delta.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:27.350
PROFESSOR: Delta.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:27.850
So, yeah.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:29.710
The weight is delta.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:31.220
I drew d.

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:36.880
Delta of these two
foot positions.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.660
Almost.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:42.260
If I want to minimize the
difficulty, then this is right.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.040
If I want to maximize
a score, then I

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.404
would have to add a minus sign.

00:49:47.404 --> 00:49:49.070
But if you're minimizing
the difficulty,

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.520
this is exactly the way because
it maps the shortest path.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.302
Usually, in dynamic programming,
things are maximized.

00:49:55.302 --> 00:49:57.586
AUDIENCE: Wait, why would
you add a minus if it's--

00:49:57.586 --> 00:49:59.460
PROFESSOR: So, if we're
maximizing something,

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:02.165
we have to flip-- we have to
add a minus to the edge costs

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:02.665
because--

00:50:02.665 --> 00:50:03.520
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:03.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.590
But this time we're
minimizing something.

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:05.802
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:50:05.802 --> 00:50:06.580
Right, right, right.

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.260
PROFESSOR: I promised you
that we'll maximize something

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:08.730
all the time.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:09.630
Well, I guess I lied.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:10.084
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:10.084 --> 00:50:10.538
Right, right, right.

00:50:10.538 --> 00:50:12.162
AUDIENCE: You don't
want to maximize d.

00:50:12.162 --> 00:50:13.720
Then you're dead.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.439
PROFESSOR: No.

00:50:14.439 --> 00:50:15.730
You want to maximize show offs.

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:17.090
So if we have the
entertainment thing,

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.210
then that would be maximized.

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:19.290
And then you'd have minus.

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:20.136
AUDIENCE: Then you'd
have everything you need.

00:50:20.136 --> 00:50:20.761
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:50:20.761 --> 00:50:21.611
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:21.611 --> 00:50:23.110
PROFESSOR: OK, so
we're almost good.

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:26.630
Source notes and
destination notes.

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:28.046
AUDIENCE: Well, I
guess source, we

00:50:28.046 --> 00:50:30.142
know that means
start in the middle.

00:50:30.142 --> 00:50:30.642
Right?

00:50:30.642 --> 00:50:33.720
Like, you would start off with--

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.329
PROFESSOR: What's the source?

00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:37.120
You want to start at
the first note, right?

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.581
PROFESSOR: But in
which position?

00:50:40.581 --> 00:50:42.265
AUDIENCE: Well, in
the center, right?

00:50:42.265 --> 00:50:43.988
I mean, the [INAUDIBLE] start.

00:50:43.988 --> 00:50:45.196
Or, I guess you could start--

00:50:45.196 --> 00:50:47.699
AUDIENCE: Wherever you want.

00:50:47.699 --> 00:50:49.240
AUDIENCE: Could you
add a source note

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.060
going to a bunch of
intermediate notes?

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:52.680
Yeah.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.510
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say there is a note 0.

00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:59.475
That let's me choose
how I'm going to start.

00:50:59.475 --> 00:51:01.100
AUDIENCE: Oh, it
could be any position.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.890
It's like an
intermediate note itself.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:03.515
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.690
So I'm going to have a note
0, with all possible foot

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:11.760
positions.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.540
And then this is going to
be connected to a source,

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.087
by edges of weight 0.

00:51:18.087 --> 00:51:20.670
So the intuition is that I get
to choose my starting position,

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:21.710
right?

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.360
Starting position.

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.440
I see the first note.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.020
I make a move.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.280
So I want to be able to
choose the starting position.

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.820
That's why I have
all those notes.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.370
And then make a move to
touch the first note.

00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:38.322
AUDIENCE: The starting
position is also a note.

00:51:38.322 --> 00:51:39.820
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.490
Because, if the
first note is here,

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:45.500
I don't necessarily
want to start like this

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.820
because maybe this
is harder than this.

00:51:52.295 --> 00:51:52.795
All right.

00:51:52.795 --> 00:51:53.753
What's the destination?

00:51:56.898 --> 00:51:58.400
AUDIENCE: The last note.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.930
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:04.790
So, all the notes that are at
note n, and have any position,

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:06.720
would be connected to
a destination note,

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.660
using an edge of weight 0.

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.510
Or I can consider
them as destinations.

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:16.340
And then choose the destination
that has the shortest path.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.580
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:23.320
The final destination is
going to be, like, two notes.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:23.820
Right?

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.242
It's going to be that
last position, and then--

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:26.866
PROFESSOR: Or it
might be more than two

00:52:26.866 --> 00:52:29.900
if the note is
just a simple note.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.030
Because that wouldn't
constrain my feet too much.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.530
OK.

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:34.770
And last, last question.

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:36.382
Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford?

00:52:36.382 --> 00:52:37.840
AUDIENCE: Bellman-Ford,
because you

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.235
have negative edges,
negative weight,

00:52:41.235 --> 00:52:45.130
as if you were going
to maximize to death.

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:48.060
PROFESSOR: So, this is always
going to be from 0 to 1.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.490
So I could possibly
use Dijkstra.

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:51.550
The answer is neither.

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:54.175
The answer is, we're
building a DAG, so.

00:52:54.175 --> 00:52:54.966
AUDIENCE: Dijkstra.

00:52:54.966 --> 00:52:56.730
AUDIENCE: We don't use that.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:57.980
PROFESSOR: DAG, shortest path.

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.350
Every time we have
dynamic programming, DAG,

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:02.820
shortest path.

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:03.320
OK?

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.240
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.360
Come on, last question.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.000
You can't get away that easily.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.550
OK, so.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:10.400
Who wants to play?
