00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.980
PROFESSOR: Today we're going
to introduce graph search

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.896
in general and talk about
one algorithm, which

00:00:25.896 --> 00:00:29.340
is breadth-first search, and
understand how in principle you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180
can solve a puzzle
like the Rubik's Cube.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.190
So before I get to
Rubik's Cubes let

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.942
me remind you of some
basic stuff about graphs.

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:50.380
Or I can tell you to start
out with, graph search is

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.905
about exploring a graph.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.980
And there's many different
notions of exploring a graph.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.950
Maybe I give you some
node in a graph, s,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.790
and some other
node in a graph, t,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.940
and I'd like to
find a path that's

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.390
going to represent a
problem like I give you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.140
a particular state of a
Rubik's Cube and I want to know

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.534
is there some path that
gets me into a solved state?

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.200
Do I really want to
solve this on stage?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.230
What the hell?

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.650
We started.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.410
So this is a particularly
easy state to solve,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.816
which is why I set up this way.

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:27.940
All right, so there you go.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.510
Seven by seven by seven Rubik's
Cube solved in 10 seconds.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.650
Amazing.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.030
New world record.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.327
So you're given some initial
state of the Rubik's Cube.

00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:40.702
You're given the
targets that you

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:42.160
know what solved looks like.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.000
You want to find this path.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.887
Maybe you want to
find all paths from s.

00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:49.720
Maybe you just want to
explore all the nodes

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.160
in a graph you can reach from s.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.460
Maybe you want to explore all
the nodes in a graph or maybe

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.501
all the edges in a graph.

00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:56.077
These are all
exploration problems.

00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:57.910
They're all going to
be solved by algorithms

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.640
from this class and next class.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.350
So before we go
further though, I

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.330
should remind you
what a graph is

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.169
and sort of basic
features of graphs

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.230
that we're going to be using.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.390
This is also 6042 material so
you should know it very well.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.120
If you don't,
there's an appendix

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.820
in the textbook about it.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.097
We have a set of vertices.

00:02:20.097 --> 00:02:21.055
We have a set of edges.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.655
Edges are either
unordered pairs--

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.240
some sets of two items--

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.630
or ordered pairs.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.270
In this case, we call
the graph undirected.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.920
In this case, we call
the graph directed.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.630
Usually, there's only one type.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.030
Either all the
edges are directed

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.690
or all the edges are undirected.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.440
There is a study of
graphs that have both,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.397
but we are not doing that here.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.430
Some simple examples.

00:03:23.344 --> 00:03:24.010
Here is a graph.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.795
This is an undirected graph.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.070
This is a directed graph.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.115
The set of vertices
here is a, b, c, d.

00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:52.525
The set of vertices
here is a, b, c.

00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:55.180
The set of edges here is--

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:04.250
E is going to be things
like a, b; b, c; c, d--

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.550
I think you get the idea.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.750
Just for completeness,
V is a, b, c, d.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.640
Just so you remember
notations and so on.

00:04:17.214 --> 00:04:19.589
One of the issues we're going
to talk about in this class

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.562
is how do you represent a graph
like this for an algorithm?

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:25.770
So it's all fine to say,
oh, this is a set of things.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.070
This is a set of things.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.710
An obvious representation
is, you have

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.120
a list or an array of vertices.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.520
You have an array of edges.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.320
Each edge knows
its two end points.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.650
That would be a horrible
representation for a graph

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.920
because if you're, I
don't know, at vertex, a,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.340
and you want to know, well
what are the neighbors of a?

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.260
b and c.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.290
You'd have to go through
the entire edge list

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.380
to figure out the
neighbors of a.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.424
So it's been linear time just
to know where you can go from a.

00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:52.340
So we're not going to
use that representation.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.430
We're going to use some
better representations.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.160
Something called
an adjacency list.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.970
Over here, you've got things
like a, c; b, c; and c, b.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.716
So you can have edges
in both directions.

00:05:10.716 --> 00:05:11.620
What am I missing?

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.120
b, a.

00:05:14.892 --> 00:05:17.480
So that's E, in that case.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.484
There are a whole lot of
applications of graph search.

00:05:25.484 --> 00:05:28.430
I'll make you a little list
to talk about few of them.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.095
So we've got web crawling.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.605
You're Google.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:42.100
You want to find all
the pages on the web.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.050
Most people don't just tell
you, hey, I've got a new page,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.450
please index it.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.520
You have to just keep
following links--

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.710
in the early days of the
web, this was a big deal--

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.659
following links finding
everything that's out there.

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:56.200
It's a little bit of an issue
because if you define it wrong,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.690
the internet is infinite
because of all those dynamically

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.600
generated pages.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.330
But to deal with
that, Google goes

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.350
sort of breadth-first
for the most part.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.710
It's prioritized You want
to see all the things you

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.440
can reach from pages you
already have and keep going.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.130
At some point, you give up
when you run out of time.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.130
Social networking.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.000
You're on Facebook.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.500
You use Friend Finder.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.260
It tries to find the friends
that are nearest to you.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.140
Or friends of friends is
sort of a level to search.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.340
That's essentially a
graph search problem.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.130
You want to know what's
two levels or three

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.180
levels of separation from you.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.529
And then you loop over those
and look for other signs

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:44.820
that you might be good friends.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.460
You are on a network like the
internet or some intranet.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.110
You want to broadcast a message.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.340
So here's you.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.350
You want to send data out.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.830
That's essentially a
graph exploration problem.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.850
That message, that packet, is
going to explore the graph.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.325
Garbage collection.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.369
I hope you all know that
modern languages have

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:18.160
garbage collection.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.740
This is why you don't have to
worry about freeing things.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.800
Even in Python--
even in CPython,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.600
I learned-- there is a garbage
collector as of version two.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.590
But also in PyPy, and
JPython and in Java--

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.564
pretty much every
fairly modern language

00:07:35.564 --> 00:07:36.730
you have garbage collection.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.780
Meaning, if there's some data
that's unreachable from--

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.820
So you have your variables.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.890
Variables that can be
accessed by the program.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.410
Everything that's reachable
from there you have to keep.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.020
But if some data structure
becomes no longer reachable,

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.895
you can throw it away
and regain memory.

00:07:57.895 --> 00:08:00.020
So that's happening behind
the scenes all the time,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.750
and the way it's
being done is with

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.170
their breadth-first
search, which

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.990
is what we're going
to talk about today.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.450
Another one.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.095
Model checking.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:21.250
Model checking is-- you have
some finite model of either

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.205
a piece of code, or a
circuit, or chip, whatever,

00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:26.220
and you want to prove
that it actually

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.620
does what you think it does.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.530
And so you've drawn a graph.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.790
The graph is all
the possible states

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.000
that your circuit or your
computer program could reach,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.393
or that it could possibly have.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.059
You start in some
initial state, and you

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.267
want to know among all the
states that you can reach,

00:08:42.267 --> 00:08:43.400
does it have some property.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.050
And so you need to visit
all the vertices that

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.500
are reachable from
a particular place.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.720
And usually people do that
using breadth-first search.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.390
I use breadth-first
search a lot,

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:59.860
myself, to check
mathematical conjectures.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:06.270
So if you're a mathematician,
and you think something

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.722
is true.

00:09:07.722 --> 00:09:11.600
Like maybe-- It's hard to
give an example of that.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.690
But you can imagine some graph
of all the possible inputs

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.330
to that theorem, and
you need to check them

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.600
for every possible input--

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.450
If this is true-- the
typical way to do that

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.480
is breadth-first searching
through that entire graph

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.100
of states.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.694
Usually, we're testing
finite, special cases

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:32.110
of a general conjecture, but
if we find a counter-example,

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.900
we're done.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.591
Don't have to work
on it anymore.

00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:36.590
If we don't find a
counter-example, usually then

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.270
we have to do the mathematics.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.695
It doesn't solve everything,
but it's helpful.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.430
And then, the fun
thing we're going

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.070
to talk about a
little bit today,

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.903
is if you want to solve
something like a two

00:09:55.903 --> 00:09:57.939
by two by two Rubik's
Cube optimally,

00:09:57.939 --> 00:09:59.730
you can do that using
breadth-first search.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.935
And you're going to do
that on your problem set.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.340
To do it solving this one
optimally using breadth-first

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.800
search would probably--

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.140
would definitely-- take
more than the lifetime

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.330
of the universe.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.780
So don't try seven
by seven by seven.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.180
Leave that to the
cubing experts, I guess.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.610
I think no one will ever solve
a seven by seven by seven

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.150
Rubik's Cube optimally.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.190
There are ways to find a
solution just not the best one.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.395
So let me tell you just
for fun, as an example.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.530
This Pocket Cube, which is a
two by two by two Rubik's Cube.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.780
What we have in mind is
called the configuration graph

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.480
or sometimes
configuration space.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.701
But it's a graph, so
we'll call it a graph.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:01.465
This graph has a vertex for
each possible state of the cube.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.535
So this is a state.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.820
This is a state.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.640
This is a state.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.240
This is a state.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.790
Now I'm hopelessly lost.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.540
Anyone want to work on this?

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.802
Bored?

00:11:25.802 --> 00:11:26.560
No one?

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.510
Alright, I'll leave
it unsolved then.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.522
So all those are vertices.

00:11:32.522 --> 00:11:33.980
There's actually
a lot of vertices.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.690
There are 264 million
vertices or so.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.310
If you want.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.560
To the side here.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:49.300
Number of vertices is something
like 8 factorial times 3

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.950
to the 8.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:57.637
And one way to see that
is to draw a two by two

00:11:57.637 --> 00:11:58.470
by two Rubik's Cube.

00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:12.890
So these are what you
might call cubelets,

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.370
or cubies I think is the
standard term in Rubik's Cube

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:16.870
land.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.125
There's eight of them
in a two by two by two.

00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:24.750
Two cubed.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.452
You can essentially permute
those cubies within the cube

00:12:28.452 --> 00:12:29.160
however you like.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.020
That's 8 factorial.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.234
And then each of them has
three possible twists.

00:12:33.234 --> 00:12:34.150
It could be like this.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.180
It could be like this.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.700
Or it could be like this.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.356
So you've got three for each.

00:12:39.356 --> 00:12:40.980
And this is actually
an accurate count.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.229
You're not over-counting the
number of configurations.

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:45.760
All of those are, at least
in principle, conceivable.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.060
If you take apart the
cube, you can reassemble it

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.590
in each of those states.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.930
And that number is
about 264 million.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.000
Which is not so
bad for computers.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.764
You could search that.

00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:02.930
Life is a little bit easier.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.940
You get to divide by
24 because there's

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.800
24 symmetries of the cube.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.190
Eight times three.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.329
You can divide by three,
also, because only a third

00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:14.370
of the configuration space
is actually reachable.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.070
If you're not allowed
to take the parts apart,

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.720
if you have to get
there by a motion,

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.096
you can only get to 1/3
of the two by two by two.

00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:22.720
So it's a little bit
smaller than that,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.550
if you're actually doing a
breadth-first search, which

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.758
is what you're going to be
doing on your problem set.

00:13:26.758 --> 00:13:29.350
But in any case, it's feasible.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.370
That was vertices.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.575
We should talk about edges.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.570
For every move--
every move takes you

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.870
from one configuration
to another.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.960
You could traverse it in one
direction and make that move.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.210
You could also undo that move.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.230
Because every move is
undoable in a Rubik's Cube,

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.940
this graph is undirected.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.570
Or you can think of it as every
edge works in both directions.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:03.610
So this is a move.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.830
It's called a quarter twist.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.640
This is a controversy
if you will.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.430
Some people allow a whole
half twist as a single move.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.030
Whether you define that as a
single move or a double move

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.380
is not that big a deal.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.920
It just changes
some of the answers.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.970
But you're still exploring
essentially the same graph.

00:14:23.454 --> 00:14:24.870
So that's the graph
and you'd like

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.244
to know some
properties about it.

00:14:26.244 --> 00:14:28.580
So let me draw a
picture of the graph.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.560
I'm not going to draw
all 264 million vertices.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.960
But in particular,
there's the solved state--

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.090
we kind of care
about that one, where

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:40.070
all the colors are aligned--

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.100
then there's all of
the configurations

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.040
you could reach by one move.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.950
So these are the possible
moves from the solved state.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.400
And then from those
configurations,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.970
there's more places you can go.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.448
Maybe there's multiple ways
to get to the same node.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.250
But these would be
all the configurations

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.190
you can reach in two moves.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.940
And so on.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.100
And at some point,
you run out of graph.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:26.250
So there might be a
few nodes out here.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.580
The way I'm drawing
this, this is everything

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.240
you can reach in one move, in
two movies, in three moves.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.010
At the end, this
would be 11 moves,

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.760
if you allow half twists.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.470
And as puzzlers,
we're particularly

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.740
interested in this
number, which you

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:50.760
would call, as a graph theorist,
the diameter of the graph.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.200
Puzzlers call it God's number.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.110
If you were God or some omni--

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.020
something being.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.860
You have the optimal algorithm
for solving the Rubik's Cube.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.220
How many moves do you
need If you always

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.100
follow the best path?

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.650
And the answer is, in
the worst case, 11.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:14.130
So we're interested in the worst
case of the best algorithm.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.880
For two by two by
two, the answer is 11.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.050
For three by three by
three, the answer is 20.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.070
That was just proved
last summer with a couple

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.650
years of computer time.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.800
For four by four by four--

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.759
I don't have one here--

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:28.258
I think we'll never
know the answer.

00:16:28.258 --> 00:16:30.525
For five by five by five,
we'll never know the answer.

00:16:30.525 --> 00:16:33.820
For six, for seven, same deal.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.330
But for two by two by
two, you can compute it.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.180
You will compute it
on your problem set.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.400
And it's kind of nice
to know because it

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.800
says whatever configuration I'm
in, I can solve it in 11 moves.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.440
But the best known
way to compute it,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.220
is basically to construct
this graph one layer at a time

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.470
until you're done.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.310
And then you know
what the diameter is.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.910
The trouble is, in between
here this grows exponentially.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.180
At some point, it
decreases a little bit.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.970
But getting over
that exponential hump

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.564
is really hard.

00:17:06.564 --> 00:17:08.980
And for three by three by
three, they used a lot of tricks

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.490
to speed up the
algorithm, but in the end

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.760
it's essentially a
breadth-first search.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.359
What's a breadth-first search?

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.060
This going layer by layer.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.430
So we're going to
formalize that in a moment.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.089
But that is the problem.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:37.320
So just for fun,
any guesses what

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.020
the right answer is for an
n by n by n Rubik's cube?

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.721
What's the diameter?

00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:43.720
Not an exact answer,
because I think we'll never

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.850
know the exact answer.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.558
But if I want theta
something, what

00:17:48.558 --> 00:17:50.280
do you think the something is?

00:17:54.649 --> 00:17:56.732
How many people here have
solved the Rubik's Cube?

00:17:56.732 --> 00:17:58.130
Ever?

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.510
So you know what we're
talking about here.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.390
Most people have worked on it.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.280
To think about an n by
n by n Rubik's Cube,

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.420
each side has area n squared.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.210
So total surface
area is 6 n squared.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:18.718
So there's, roughly, stata n
squared little cubies here.

00:18:18.718 --> 00:18:21.301
So what do you think the right
[INAUDIBLE] is for n by n by n?

00:18:26.702 --> 00:18:27.480
No guesses?

00:18:32.095 --> 00:18:33.450
AUDIENCE: n cubed?

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.900
PROFESSOR: n cubed?

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.540
Reasonable guess.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.045
But wrong.

00:18:38.045 --> 00:18:39.690
It's an upper bounds.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:40.890
Why n cubed?

00:18:43.432 --> 00:18:44.348
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:48.834 --> 00:18:51.000
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're
guessing based on the numbers.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.499
Yeah.

00:18:51.499 --> 00:18:53.500
The numbers are
misleading, unfortunately.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.466
It's the law of small
numbers I guess.

00:18:56.466 --> 00:18:59.300
It doesn't really look right.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.636
I know the answer.

00:19:00.636 --> 00:19:02.010
I know the answer
because we just

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.259
wrote a paper with the answer.

00:19:03.259 --> 00:19:05.940
This is a new result.
From this summer.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.330
But I'm curious.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.050
To me the obvious answer is
n squared because there's

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.700
about n squared cubies.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.340
And it's not so hard to show
in a constant number moves

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.011
you can solve a constant
number of cubies.

00:19:19.011 --> 00:19:20.760
If you think about the
general algorithms,

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.676
like if you've ever
looked up professor's cube

00:19:22.676 --> 00:19:25.200
and how to solve it,
you're doing like 10 moves,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.720
and then maybe you
swap two cubies

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.530
which you can use to
solve a couple of cubies

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:31.910
in a constant number of moves.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:36.400
So n squared would be
the standard answer

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.600
if you're following
standard algorithms.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.225
But it turns out, you can
do a little bit better.

00:19:41.225 --> 00:19:43.350
And the right answer is n
squared divided by log n.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.050
I think it's cool.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.814
Hopefully, you guys
can appreciate that.

00:19:46.814 --> 00:19:48.980
Not a lot of people can
appreciate n squared divided

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.365
by log n, but here in
algorithms, we're all about n

00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:53.290
squared over log n.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.420
If you're interested, the
paper's on my website.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.590
I think its called, Algorithms
For Solving Rubik's Cubes.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.110
There's a constant there.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.980
Current constant is not so good.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.320
Let's say it's in the millions.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.010
You've got to start somewhere.

00:20:15.754 --> 00:20:17.420
The next open problem
will be to improve

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.170
that constant to
something reasonable that

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.720
maybe is close to 20.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.250
But we're far from that.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.145
Let's talk about
graph representation.

00:20:31.289 --> 00:20:33.080
Before we can talk
about exporting a graph,

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.680
we need to know what
we're given as input.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.950
And there's basically one
standard representation

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.510
and a bunch of variations of it.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.125
And they're called
adjacency lists.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.720
So the idea with
an adjacency list,

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:58.436
is you have an array
called Adj, for adjacency

00:20:58.436 --> 00:21:02.290
of size V. Each
element in the array

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.735
is a pointer to a linked list.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:12.260
And the idea is that this
array is indexed by a vertex.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.170
So we're imagining
a world where we

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.500
can index arrays by vertices.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.960
So maybe, you just
label your vertices

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.730
zero through v minus 1.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.760
Then that's a regular array.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.802
Or, if you want
to get fancy, you

00:21:31.802 --> 00:21:35.200
can think of a vertex as an
arbitrary hashable thing,

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.700
and Adj is actually
a hash table.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.810
And that's how you
probably do it in Python.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.910
Maybe your vertices are
objects, and this is just

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.764
hashing based on the
address of the object.

00:21:44.764 --> 00:21:46.430
But we're not going
to worry about that.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.370
We're just going
to write Adj of u.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.560
Assume that somehow you
can get to the linked list

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.768
corresponding to that vertex.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.420
And the idea is,
for every vertex

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.260
we just store its
neighbors, namely

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.220
the vertices you can
reach by one step from u.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.150
So I'm going to define that
a little more formally.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:17.080
Adj of u is going to be
the set of all vertices,

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:22.430
V, such that u, v is an edge.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.990
So if I have a vertex
like b, Adj of b

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.685
is going to be both a
and c because in one step

00:22:38.685 --> 00:22:42.010
there are outgoing edges
from b to a and b to c.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.730
So Adj of b is a, c.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.530
In that graph.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.620
I should have labeled the
vertices something different.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:02.670
Adj of a is going to be
just c because you can't

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.145
get with one step from a to b.

00:23:05.145 --> 00:23:08.080
The edge is in the
wrong direction.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.240
And Adj of c is b.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.260
I think that definition's
pretty clear.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.290
For undirected graphs,
you just put braces here.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.710
Which means you store--

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.980
I mean, it's the same thing.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.180
Here Adj of c is going
to be a, b, and d, as you

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:33.200
can get in one step from c to
a, from c to b, from c to d.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.520
For pretty much every--

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.700
At least for graph
exploration problems,

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.580
this is the
representation you want.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.850
Because you're at some
vertex, and you want to know,

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:40.930
where can I go next.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.560
And Adj of that vertex tells you
exactly where you can go next.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.830
So this is what you want.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.040
There's a lot of different
ways to actually implement

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.540
adjacency lists.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.440
I've talked about two of them.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.720
You could have the vertices
labeled zero to v minus 1,

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.020
and then this is,
literally, an array.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.120
And you have--

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.460
I guess I should draw.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:13.730
In this picture,
Adj is an array.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.080
So you've got a, b, and c.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.490
Each one of them is a
pointer to a linked list.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:27.510
This one's actually going
to be a, c, and we're done.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.820
Sorry, that was b.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.520
Who said it had to be
alphabetical order?

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.110
A is a pointer to c,
c is a pointer to b.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.570
That's explicitly how
you might represent it.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.350
This might be a hash
table instead of an array,

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.870
if you have weirder vertices.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.370
You can also do it in a more
object-oriented fashion.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.090
For every vertex, v, you can
make the vertices objects,

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:05.930
and v dot neighbors
could store what

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.460
we're defining over
there to be Adj

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:13.630
of v. This would be the more
object-oriented way to do it

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.040
I've thought a lot about
this, and I like this,

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.010
and usually when I implement
graphs this is what I do.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:23.200
But it is actually convenient
to have this representation.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.665
There's a reason the textbook
uses this representation.

00:25:25.665 --> 00:25:28.040
Because, if you've already
got some vertices lying around

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.150
and you want to have multiple
graphs on those vertices,

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.710
this lets you do that.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.934
You can define multiple Adj
arrays, one for graph one, one

00:25:37.934 --> 00:25:39.350
for graph two, one
for graph three

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.790
but they can all talk
about the same vertices.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.410
Whereas here, vertex can
only belong to one graph.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.260
It can only have one
neighbor structure

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.390
that says what happens.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.000
If you're only dealing
with one graph,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.850
this is probably cleaner.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.220
But with multiple graphs, which
will happen even in this class,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.534
adjacency lists are
kind of the way to go.

00:26:00.534 --> 00:26:02.450
You can also do
implicitly-represented graphs.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:20.595
Which would be to say,
Adj of u is a function.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:36.660
Or v dot neighbors is a
method of the vertex class.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.210
Meaning, it's not just
stored there explicitly.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.270
Whenever you need it,
you call this function

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:45.500
and it computes what you want.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.420
This is useful because
it uses less space.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:52.030
You could say this uses
zero space or maybe v space.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.470
One for each vertex.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:54.139
It depends.

00:26:54.139 --> 00:26:56.180
Maybe you don't even need
to explicitly represent

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.080
all the vertices.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.500
You start with some vertex,
and given a vertex, somehow

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.610
you know how to compute, let's
say in constant time or linear

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:10.270
time or something, the
neighbors of that vertex.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:11.840
And then from
there, you can keep

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.340
searching, keep
computing neighbors,

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.590
until you find what you want.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.506
Maybe you don't have to
build the whole graph,

00:27:16.506 --> 00:27:19.774
you just need to build enough of
it until you find your answer.

00:27:19.774 --> 00:27:21.315
Whatever answer
you're searching for.

00:27:21.315 --> 00:27:23.850
Can you think of a situation
where that might be the case?

00:27:27.205 --> 00:27:29.330
Where implicit representation
would be a good idea?

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.830
Yes.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:30.710
Rubik's Cubes.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:31.543
They're really good.

00:27:31.543 --> 00:27:33.170
I never want to
build this space.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.060
It has a bajillion states.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.170
A bajillion vertices.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.780
It would take forever.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.580
There's more
configurations of this cube

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.590
than there are particles
in the known universe.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.701
I just computed that in my head.

00:27:47.701 --> 00:27:50.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.130
I have done this
computation recently,

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.620
and for five by five by five
it's like 10 to the 40 states.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.359
Or 10 to the 40, 10 to the 60.

00:27:58.359 --> 00:28:00.400
There's about 10 to the
80 particles in the known

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:00.940
universe.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.240
10 to the 83 or something.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.750
So this is probably
10 to the 200 or so.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.862
It's a lot.

00:28:07.862 --> 00:28:09.070
You never want to build that.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.820
But, it's very easy to
represent this state.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.520
Just store where
all the cubies are.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.410
And it's very easy to see what
are all the configurations you

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.640
can reach in one move.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.630
Just try this move, try
this move, try this move.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.371
Put it back and
try the next move.

00:28:22.371 --> 00:28:22.870
And so on.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.600
For an m by n by
n cube in order n

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.210
time, you can list all
the order n next states.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.050
You can list all the
order n neighbors.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.224
And so you can keep exploring,
searching for your state.

00:28:35.224 --> 00:28:37.390
Now you don't want to explore
too far for that cube,

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.020
but at least you're
not hosed just

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.190
from the problem of
representing the graph.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.030
So even for two by
two by two, it's

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.165
useful to do this
mostly to save space.

00:28:48.165 --> 00:28:50.310
You're not really saving time.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:54.960
But you'd like to not have to
store all 264 million states

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:01.850
because it's going to be several
gigabytes and it's annoying.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:05.650
Speaking of space-- ignoring
the implicit representation--

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.755
how much space does this
representation require?

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.090
V plus E. This Is going
to be the bread and butter

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.609
of our graph algorithms.

00:29:24.609 --> 00:29:27.150
Most of the things we're going
to talk about achieve V plus E

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:27.650
time.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.090
This is essentially optimal.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:32.162
It's linear in the
size of your graph.

00:29:32.162 --> 00:29:34.700
You've got V vertices, E edges.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.160
Technically, in
case you're curious,

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.560
this is really the size
of V plus the size of E.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.689
But in the textbook, and
I guess in the world,

00:29:44.689 --> 00:29:46.980
we just omit those sizes of
whenever they're in a theta

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.180
notation or Big O notation.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.930
So number vertices
plus number of edges.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.304
that sort of the
bare minimum you

00:29:52.304 --> 00:29:55.456
need if you want an explicit
representation of the graph.

00:29:55.456 --> 00:29:56.830
And we achieve
that because we've

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.880
got we've got v space just to
store the vertices in an array.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.820
And then if you add up--

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.677
Each of these is an edge.

00:30:06.677 --> 00:30:08.010
You have to be a little careful.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.570
In undirected graphs, each
of these is a half edge.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:15.340
So there's actually two
times e nodes over here.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.390
But it's theta E.
So theta V plus E

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.140
is the amount of space we need.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.090
And ideally, all our algorithms
will run in this much time.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.550
Because that's what you need
just to look at the graph.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:11.590
So let's do an actual algorithm,
which is breadth-first search.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.420
So to the simplest algorithm
you can think of in graphs.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.090
I've already outlined
it several times.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.640
You start at some node.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.810
You look at all the nodes
you can get to from there.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:26.976
You look at all the nodes
you can get to from there.

00:31:26.976 --> 00:31:29.300
Keep going until you're done.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.110
So this is going to explore
all of the vertices that

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.030
are reachable from a node.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.270
The challenge-- The
one annoying thing

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.520
about breadth-first search
and why this is not trivial

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.280
is that there can
be some edges that

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:52.340
go sort of backwards, like
that, to some previous layer.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.242
Actually, that's
not true, is it?

00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.275
This can't happen.

00:31:59.275 --> 00:32:02.220
You see why?

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.280
Because if that edge
existed, then from this node

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.205
you'd be able to get here.

00:32:08.205 --> 00:32:10.180
So in an undirected
graph, that can't happen.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.520
In a directed graph,
you could conceivably

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.660
have a back edge like that.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.270
You'd have to realize, oh,
that's a vertex I've already

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.450
seen, I don't want to put
it here, even though it's

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:21.270
something I can
reach from this node,

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.961
because I've already been there.

00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:24.710
We've got to worry
about things like that.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.970
That's, I guess, the main
thing to worry about.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.615
So our goal is to
visit all the nodes--

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:47.555
the vertices-- reachable
from given node, s.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.720
We want to achieve
V plus E time.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:10.530
And the idea is to look
at the nodes that are

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:15.780
reachable first in zero moves.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.040
Zero moves.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:17.820
That's s.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.480
Then in one move.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.650
Well that's everything you
can reach from s in one step.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.430
That's adjacency of s.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.810
And then two moves,
and three moves, and so

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:36.910
on until we run out of graph.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:47.800
But we need to be careful
to avoid duplicates.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.090
We want to avoid
revisiting vertices

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:52.090
for a couple of reasons.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.110
One is if we didn't, we
would spend infinite time.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.945
Because we'd just go
there and come back,

00:33:56.945 --> 00:33:58.070
and go there and come back.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.740
As long as there's
at least one cycle,

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.920
you're going to keep
going around the cycle

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.280
forever and ever if you don't
try to avoid duplicates.

00:34:05.707 --> 00:34:07.790
So let me write down some
code for this algorithm.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.580
It's pretty straightforward.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.190
So straightforward, we
can be completely explicit

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.830
and write pseudocode.

00:34:18.824 --> 00:34:21.199
There's a few different ways
to implement this algorithm.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:23.780
I'll show you my favorite.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.659
The textbook has a
different favorite.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.739
I'm going to write in
pure Python, I believe.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.100
Almost done.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.160
I think I got that right.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.594
So this is at the end
of the while-loop.

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:39.272
And at that point
we should be done.

00:36:39.272 --> 00:36:40.730
We can do an actual
example, maybe.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.560
I'm going to do it on
an undirected graph,

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.470
but this algorithm works just as
well on directed and undirected

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.970
graphs.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:30.950
There's an undirected graph.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:34.890
We're given some
start vertex, s,

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.430
and we're given
the graph by being

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:39.850
given the adjacency lists.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:42.600
So you could iterate over
the vertices of that thing.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.420
Given a vertex, you
can list all the edges

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:47.112
you can reach in one step.

00:37:47.112 --> 00:37:48.570
And then the top
of the algorithm's

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.400
just some initialization.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.980
The basic structure--

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.890
We have this thing called the
frontier, which is what we just

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.920
reached on the previous level.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:04.480
I think that's going to
be level i minus one.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.225
Just don't want to
make an index error.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.920
These are going to be all the
things you can reach using

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.970
exactly i minus one moves.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.020
And then next is going
to be all the things

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.560
you can reach in i moves.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:24.976
So to get started,
what we know is s.

00:38:24.976 --> 00:38:28.580
s is what you can
reach in zero moves.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.540
So we set the level
of s to be zero.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.219
That's the first
line of the code.

00:38:33.219 --> 00:38:35.010
There's this other
thing called the parent.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:36.650
We'll worry about that later.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.720
It's optional.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.700
It gives us some
other fun structure.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.950
We set i to be one because
we just finished level zero.

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:49.600
Frontier of what you can reach
in level zero is just s itself.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.560
So we're going to
put that on the list.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.870
That is level zero. i equals
one So one minus one is zero.

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:56.360
All good.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.810
And then we're going to iterate.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:59.540
And this is going
to be looking at--

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.347
The end of the iteration
is to increment i.

00:39:02.347 --> 00:39:03.930
So you could also
call this a for-loop

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:05.763
except we don't know
when it's going to end.

00:39:05.763 --> 00:39:09.020
So it's easier to
think of i incrementing

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.150
each step not knowing
when we're going to stop.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.191
We're going to stop whenever
we run out of nodes.

00:39:13.191 --> 00:39:16.787
So whenever frontier
is a non-empty list.

00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:18.370
the bulk of the work
here is computing

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.520
what the next level is.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.860
That's called next.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.330
It's going to be level i.

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:23.310
We do some computation.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.020
Eventually we have
what's on the next level.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.172
Then we set frontier next.

00:39:28.172 --> 00:39:29.380
Because that's our new level.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.930
We increment i, and then
invariant of frontier being

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:35.642
level i minus 1 is preserved.

00:39:35.642 --> 00:39:36.350
Right after here.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:40.100
And then we just keep going
till we run out of nodes.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.230
How do we compute next?

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.210
Well, we look at every
node in the frontier,

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.660
and we look at all the nodes
you can reach from those nodes.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.730
So every node, u, in the
frontier and then we look at--

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:53.110
So this means there
is an edge from u

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.660
to v through the picture.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.520
We look at all the edges
from all the frontier nodes

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.870
where you can go.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:02.330
And then the key thing is
we check for duplicates.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.830
We see, have we seen
this node before?

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:08.270
If we have, we would have set
it's level to be something.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:09.870
If we haven't seen
it, it will not

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:14.160
be in the level hash table
or the level dictionary.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.350
And so if it's not in
there, we'll put it in there

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:20.640
and add it to the next layer.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.860
So that's how you
avoid duplicates.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.890
You set its level to make sure
you will never visit it again,

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.870
you add it to the next frontier,
you iterate, you're done.

00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:32.900
This is one version
of what you might

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.240
call a breadth-first search.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.270
And it achieves
this goal, visiting

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.220
all the nodes reachable
from s, in linear time.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.640
Let's see how it works
on a real example.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.740
So first frontier is this thing.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.120
Frontier just has the node
s, so we just look at s,

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.930
and we look at all
the edges from s.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.440
We get a and x.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.460
So those get added
to the next frontier.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:01.040
Maybe before I go too
far, let me switch colors.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.080
Multimedia here.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.576
So here's level one.

00:41:12.576 --> 00:41:17.270
All of these guys, we're going
to set their level to one.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:18.877
They can be reached in one step.

00:41:18.877 --> 00:41:19.710
That's pretty clear.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.570
So now frontier is a and x.

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.380
That's what next becomes.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.240
Then frontier becomes next.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.510
And so we look at
all the edges from a.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.110
That's going to be s and z.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.730
s, we've already looked at,
it already has a level set,

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.200
so we ignore that.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:35.880
So we look at z.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.200
Z does not have a
level indicated here,

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.300
so we're going to set
it to i which happens

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.340
to be two at this point.

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.200
And we look at x.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.160
It has neighbors s, d, and c.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.330
We look at s again.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.680
We say, oh, we've already
seen that yet again.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.800
So we're worried about
this taking a lot of time

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.090
because we look at s
three times in total.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.290
Then we look at d.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:59.240
d hasn't been set, so we set
it to two. c hasn't been set,

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.220
so we set it to two.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:05.945
So the frontier at
level two is that.

00:42:05.945 --> 00:42:07.570
Then we look at all
the neighbors of z.

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:09.489
There's a. a's already been set.

00:42:09.489 --> 00:42:10.780
Look at all the neighbors of d.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:11.370
There's x.

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:11.870
There's c.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:12.703
Those have been set.

00:42:12.703 --> 00:42:13.850
There's f.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.440
This one gets added.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.480
Then we look at c.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.020
There's x.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.770
That's been done. d's been done.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.690
f's been done.

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:23.370
v has not been done.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:27.300
So this becomes a
frontier at level three.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.930
Then we look at level three.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:29.577
There's f.

00:42:29.577 --> 00:42:31.410
D's been done, c's been
done, b's been done.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:34.530
We look at v. c's been
done. f's been done.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.710
Nothing to add to next.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:36.780
Next becomes empty.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.240
Frontier becomes empty.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.530
The while-loop finishes.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:40.760
TA DA!

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.510
We've computed-- we've
visited all the vertices.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.453
Question.

00:42:44.453 --> 00:42:45.369
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:51.325 --> 00:42:52.910
What notation?

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.460
PROFESSOR: This is
Python notation.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.860
You may have heard of Python.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:01.720
This is a dictionary
which has one key value,

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.720
s, and has one value, zero.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.110
So you could--

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:08.300
That's shorthand in Python for--

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.440
Usually you have a
comma separated list.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.310
The colon is specifying
key value pairs.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.760
I didn't talk about parent.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.310
We can do that for a little bit.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:28.280
So parent we're initializing to
say, the parent of s is nobody,

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.890
and then whenever we
visit a new vertex,

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.900
v, we set its parent to be
the vertex that we came from.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.650
So we had this vertex,
v. We had an edge

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:38.560
to v from some vertex, u.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.720
We set the parent of v to be u.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.140
So let me add in
what that becomes.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.300
I'll change colors yet again.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:51.820
Although it gets hard to
see any color but red.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:55.340
So we have s.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:00.810
When we visited a, then the
parent of a would become s.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:05.150
When we visited z, the
parent of z would be a.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.640
Parent of x is going to be s.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.925
Parent of d is going to be x.

00:44:09.925 --> 00:44:12.765
The parent of c
is going to be x.

00:44:12.765 --> 00:44:14.364
The parent of f--

00:44:14.364 --> 00:44:16.530
it could have been either
way, but the way I did it,

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:21.200
d went first, and so
that became its parent.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.327
And I think for v,
c was its parent.

00:44:25.327 --> 00:44:27.410
So that's what the parent
pointers will look like.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:28.820
They always follow edges.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.760
They actually follow
edges backwards.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.620
If this was a directed
graph, the graph

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.420
might be directed that way
but the parent pointers

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.270
go back along the edges.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:38.390
So it's a way to return.

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:41.710
It's a way to return to s.

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:44.580
If you follow these pointers,
all roads lead to s.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.550
Because we started at s,
that's the property we have.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:54.180
In fact, these pointers
always form a tree,

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.280
and the root of the tree is s.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.860
In fact, these pointers form
what are called shortest paths.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:05.730
Let me write down a
little bit about this.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:21.285
Shortest path properties.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:51.400
If you take a node, and
you take its parent,

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.170
and you take the
parent of the parent,

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:56.600
and so on, eventually
you get to s.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.540
And if you read it
backwards, that will actually

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.880
be a path in the graph.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:09.420
And it will be a shortest
path, in the graph,

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.610
from s to v.
Meaning, if you look

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:17.180
at all paths in the graph
that go from s to v--

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:21.460
So say we're going from
s to v, how about that,

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.230
we compute this path out of BFS.

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:25.450
Which is, follow a
parent of v is c, parent

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:27.670
of c is x, parent of x is s.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:28.600
Read it backwards.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.590
That gives us a
path from s to v.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.140
The claim is, that
is the shortest

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:35.420
way to get from s to v. It
might not be the only one.

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.330
Like if you're going from s
to f, there's two short paths.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:40.330
There's this one
of length three.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.160
There's this one
of length three..

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.390
Uses three edges.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.300
Same length.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.110
And in the parent
pointers, we can only

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:48.640
afford to encode
one of those paths

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.015
because in general there might
be exponentially many ways

00:46:51.015 --> 00:46:52.690
to get from one node to another.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:56.940
We find a shortest path, not
necessarily the only one.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:00.600
And the length of that path--

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.750
So shortest here means that
you use the fewest edges.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:07.910
And the length will
be level of v. That's

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.729
what we're keeping track of.

00:47:10.729 --> 00:47:13.020
If the level's zero, you can
get there with zero steps.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.060
If the level's one, you
get there with one steps.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.143
Because we're visiting
everything you can possibly

00:47:17.143 --> 00:47:19.830
get in k steps, the
level is telling you what

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:21.411
that shortest path distance is.

00:47:21.411 --> 00:47:22.910
And the parent
pointers are actually

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:25.030
giving you the shortest path.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:27.090
That's the cool thing about BFS.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.620
Yeah, BFS explores the vertices.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.416
Sometimes, that's
all you care about.

00:47:30.416 --> 00:47:32.040
But in some sense,
what really matters,

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:36.200
is it finds the shortest way to
get from anywhere to anywhere.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.200
For a Rubik's Cube,
that's nice because you

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.260
run BFS from the start
state of the Rubik's Cube.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.190
Then you say, oh,
I'm in this state.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:46.724
You look up this state.

00:47:46.724 --> 00:47:47.640
You look at its level.

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.590
It says, oh, you can
get there in nine steps.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:52.260
That's, I think, the average.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.501
So I'm guessing.

00:47:53.501 --> 00:47:55.250
I don't know how to
do this in nine steps.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:00.220
Great, so now you
know how to solve it.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.720
You just look at
the parent pointer.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.095
The parent pointer gives
you another configuration.

00:48:03.095 --> 00:48:05.030
You say, oh, what move was that?

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:06.480
And then you do that move.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.940
I'm not going to solve it.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.360
Then you look at the
parent pointer of that.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.045
You do that move.

00:48:10.045 --> 00:48:11.510
You look at the parent
pointer of that.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.080
You do that move.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.871
Eventually, you'll get
to the solved state,

00:48:13.871 --> 00:48:16.430
and you will do it using
the fewest possible moves.

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:20.590
So if you can afford to put the
whole graph in memory, which

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.450
you can't for a big Rubik's Cube
but you can for a small one,

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:27.560
then this will give you a
strategy, the optimal strategy,

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.400
God's algorithm if you will,
for every configuration.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.200
It solves all of them.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.199
Which is great.

00:48:36.199 --> 00:48:37.990
What is the running
time of this algorithm?

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:41.870
I claim it's order V plus E.
But it looked a little wasteful

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:45.300
because it was checking
vertices over and over and over.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.260
But if you think
about it carefully,

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.246
you're only looking--

00:48:49.246 --> 00:48:51.270
what's the right
way to say this--

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:55.584
you only check every edge once.

00:48:55.584 --> 00:48:57.500
Or in undirected graphs,
you check them twice,

00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:00.820
once from each side.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.290
A vertex enters the
frontier only once.

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:07.610
Because once it's in the
frontier, it gets a level set.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:11.450
And once it has a level set,
it'll never go in again.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:14.450
It'll never get added to next.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:17.440
So s gets added once then we
check all the neighbors of s.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.910
a gets added once, then we
check all the neighbors of a.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:21.520
Each of these guys
gets added once.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.950
We check all the neighbors.

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:24.410
So the total running
time is going

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:27.490
to be the sum over all
vertices of the size

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:33.530
of the adjacency list of v. So
this is the number of neighbors

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:35.220
that v has.

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.579
And this is going to be?

00:49:37.579 --> 00:49:38.079
Answer?

00:49:42.336 --> 00:49:44.004
AUDIENCE: Two times
the number of edges.

00:49:44.004 --> 00:49:44.670
PROFESSOR: Sorry

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.211
AUDIENCE: Double
the number of edges.

00:49:46.211 --> 00:49:48.930
PROFESSOR: Twice the number of
edges for undirected graphs.

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.330
It's going to be the number
of edges for directed graphs.

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:52.770
This is the Handshaking Lemma.

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:54.670
If you don't remember
the Handshaking Lemma,

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:57.330
you should read the textbook.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.116
Six o four two stuff.

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:06.780
Basically you visit
every edge twice.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:10.870
For directed graphs, you
visit every edge once.

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.590
But it's order E. We
also spend order V

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.790
because we touch every vertex.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.770
So the total running
time is order V plus E.

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:23.240
In fact, the way this is going,
you can be a little tighter

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.827
and say it's order E. I just
want to mention in reality--

00:50:26.827 --> 00:50:29.410
Sometimes you don't care about
just what you can reach from s,

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:31.410
you really want to
visit every vertex.

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:33.710
Then you need another
outer loop that's

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:38.170
iterating over all the vertices
as potential choices for s.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:41.160
And you then can visit all the
vertices in the entire graph

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.930
even if it's disconnected.

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:45.040
We'll talk more about
that next class.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.607
That's it for BFS.
