00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.400
VICTOR COSTAN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.480
I am Victor.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.730
My full name is Victor Costan.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.610
I'm a third year Ph.D. student.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.150
I'm in CSAIL, and
I work in systems.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.610
I do mostly security
and distributed systems.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.675
And I'll be your algorithm
TA for this term.

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:40.290
Yay.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.040
How many people went
to lecture yesterday?

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.840
All right.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.620
Are there any parts of the
lecture that were particularly

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.610
unclear that you
guys want to go over?

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.410
So that I schedule what I
talk about in such a way

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.580
that I'll cover that
more than the parts

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.900
that are boring and obvious.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.874
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
complexity in equations,

00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:08.210
because I took 042
like 3 years ago.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.960
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.410
What else?

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.980
Thank you.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.938
AUDIENCE: Maybe some
basic outlines for, like,

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:29.873
writing proofs relevant
to like the [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:30.914
VICTOR COSTAN: All right.

00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:32.902
AUDIENCE: Sort of
methodology or something.

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:41.351
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:45.910
Anything else?

00:01:51.622 --> 00:01:53.050
OK.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.460
We're going to get started then.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.990
So the hardest, and I think most
important of the whole course,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.290
is learning how to deal
with asymptotic complexity.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.370
So asymptotic complexity
is this very nice tool

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.020
where you have a
function that looks

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.142
like this plus--
what'll I have here?

00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:22.516
10 plus sin x.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.774
So you have this guy, which
is quite long and horrible

00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:37.190
and would make
your life miserable

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.750
if you'd have to
reason about it.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:49.760
And you can say that this
is theta of n squared.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.360
x, sorry.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.320
So everything that's
here goes away.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.270
And this constant
factor here goes away,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.640
and it's nice and
small function.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.040
Why is that the
case, first of all?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.360
If I plot this function-- and
since I don't have my projector

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.430
you'll have to take
my word for it--

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.670
I will get something
that looks like this.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.500
If I plug this
function, I will get

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.560
something that looks like this.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.800
This is a scale from 0 to 200.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:38.260
However, if I make my
scale 0 to 20,000--

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.250
Let's say 200,000 to make sure
that is going to be correct.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.910
x squared looks like this.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.267
And this function
looks like this.

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:54.100
And as you make the
scale bigger and bigger,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.290
you can't even see
this noise anymore.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.000
The reason is that all
the noise is in this term.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.020
In the x to the power
of one fifth term.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.720
And as n-- pretend this
is n, x, n same thing--

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.590
so as the input to the function
gets bigger and bigger,

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.589
this grows at a much
faster rate than this.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.220
So if I don't care about
this, how the function grows,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.870
I can ignore anything aside
from the dominant term.

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:30.370
Do people remember
this from lecture?

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.255
Does this make sense?

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.640
OK.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.806
If it doesn't, that's great.

00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:39.230
It means that I'm not
wasting time covering it.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.639
So we learned about
three symbols,

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.180
or we will learn
about three symbols,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.620
when talking about
asymptotic complexity.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.790
The three symbols are
theta, O, and omega.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.630
Let's say this
complicated function is g.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.840
And this nice simple
function is f.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:15.180
If I say that g of x is theta of
f of x, that means two things.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.140
It means I have a lower
bound, like I showed here,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.950
and the lower bound looks
something like x squared.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.370
And it means that I also have a
higher-- an upper bound for it

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.390
that also looks like x squared.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.390
So the upper bound would
be something like this.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.660
And if I say this, then
I'm making a promise

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.790
that the function
stays between the lower

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.530
bound and the upper
bound, and the bounds

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.250
look sort of the same.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.270
I can't really have x squared
here, and x squared here.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.380
Right?

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.140
That would be impossible.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.050
So that's why I said
they look the same.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.090
They're not the same.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.320
And they're not the
same, because they're

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.040
allowed to differ by
a constant factor.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.730
So if this is f, and say
this is f prime, f of x

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.740
might be x squared.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.710
And we know for sure that this
is going to be lower than this.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:20.800
And f prime of x might
be 1.2 times x squared.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.860
And because I have
a 1.1 here-- and I

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.400
know that these get smaller
and smaller in relation to this

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.640
as the function-- as the inputs
to the function get bigger--

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.620
I know that this is going
to be the dominating factor.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.940
And because this is
bigger than this,

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.950
this function is
going to eventually

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.060
be larger than this function.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.330
So I have a bound from above,
and I have a bound from below.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.370
And the bounds look
almost the same.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.740
They're only different
by a constant factor.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.670
This is theta.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.400
To make things
spicier-- by the way,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.370
theta is really hard to
pronounce as opposed to O,

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.950
so we usually say and
write O instead of theta.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.730
We'll talk about what O
really means in a bit.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.740
But if you see O in a lot of
places, including our notes,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.780
know that most of the time
we actually mean theta.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.286
And sorry for that.

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:13.827
AUDIENCE: When do we
you actually mean O?

00:07:13.827 --> 00:07:15.910
VICTOR COSTAN: You can ask
us, and we'll tell you.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.250
Fortunately, it doesn't
a matter too much.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.696
So we're trying to get an
idea of how the functions look

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:23.820
like in the bigger picture.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.690
So most of the time
it doesn't matter.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.080
I'll give you an example
though of where it matters,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.900
and how it could matter.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:38.215
So suppose I have another
function that looks like this.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.850
So this is kind of ugly, too.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:56.000
This function is g of x,
say x times 1 plus sin of x.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.730
So I can't say anything about
the lower bound of this.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.750
This is going to hit 0 at an
infinite number of values.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.250
Right?

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.670
So I can't say that-- I can't
have a nice lower bound for it.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.680
The lower bound for it is 0.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.780
But I'm pretty sure
that it's never

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.380
going to be bigger than 2x.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:17.880
Right?

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.870
And that's still
worth something.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.552
So there's this
other function here

00:08:22.552 --> 00:08:23.760
that's supposed to be a line.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.370
Pretend it's a line.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.780
f of x equals 2x.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.409
And I know for sure
that this is never

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.419
going to exceed these, this.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.809
And in that case, where I
only have one upper bound,

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:41.799
and I don't have a good lower
bound, I say that g of x

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.670
is order of f of x.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.230
And this is where-- This
is what O really means.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.230
It means that I only have
an upper bound and not

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.920
a lower bound.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.750
In most of the cases when
you're coding something,

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.350
you don't really care
how well your program

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.650
can run if you're really lucky.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.358
What you really care
about is how does it

00:09:02.358 --> 00:09:03.620
run in the worst case?

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.897
Or how does it run
most of the time?

00:09:05.897 --> 00:09:08.230
So suppose you're Google, and
you're writing your search

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.890
engine, and you have
to return the result

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.990
to the user in 200 milliseconds.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.290
Because they did a study
that shows that if you return

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.750
the result in 400
milliseconds, they

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.810
lose some number of
users, which means

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.130
they lose some number
of billions a year.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.550
So to them a guarantee that
their algorithms complete

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.820
in 200 milliseconds
is pretty important,

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.040
because it means a ton of money.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.770
So if you have a running
time that looks like this,

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.280
that's OK, as long as
this is 200 milliseconds

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.900
for the number of pages
that Google indexes.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.775
Does that make sense?

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.530
OK.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.270
No answer means yes.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.620
So if it doesn't make
sense, please say something.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.960
OK, I will draw
another function.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.460
Again--

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:54.950
AUDIENCE: Victor?

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:55.790
VICTOR COSTAN: --wavy.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.290
Yes?

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.910
AUDIENCE: It says x times 1
plus something [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.630
So what?

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.950
VICTOR COSTAN: So it's--

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:01.866
AUDIENCE: Oh it's sin.

00:10:01.866 --> 00:10:03.283
VICTOR COSTAN: 1 plus sin of x.

00:10:03.283 --> 00:10:03.782
It--

00:10:03.782 --> 00:10:05.000
AUDIENCE: It looks
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.090
VICTOR COSTAN: Yeah.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.784
Sorry, my handwriting
is not very good.

00:10:07.784 --> 00:10:08.534
AUDIENCE: It's OK.

00:10:08.534 --> 00:10:09.360
Mine isn't either.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.860
VICTOR COSTAN: And
it doesn't really

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.170
matter what it is, it
just needs to be sin

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.639
so that it looks wavy like this.

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:15.180
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.010
VICTOR COSTAN: So
that I can make

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.380
something that
looks complicated.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:17.872
OK.

00:10:17.872 --> 00:10:18.364
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:10:18.364 --> 00:10:19.840
AUDIENCE: I have
a question, too.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.649
In the first example, is
it 1.2 times x squared?

00:10:23.649 --> 00:10:24.440
VICTOR COSTAN: Yes.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.720
I wanted something
that's higher than 1.1.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.080
AUDIENCE: It's like [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.871
VICTOR COSTAN: Yes.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:32.950
OK.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.334
Now that I got a
break, does anyone else

00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:36.250
want to ask questions?

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.900
OK.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.828
So I'm going to draw
another function.

00:10:44.828 --> 00:10:47.340
This one looks like this.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:58.176
And this is f of x
equals 1 plus sin of x.

00:10:58.176 --> 00:11:02.110
I have to use these signs
to make them look like that.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.880
Times x to the power of--
What do I have there?

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:13.180
1 5 plus x to the
power of one fourth.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.510
So for this function I know for
sure that it is greater than x

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.910
to the power of one fourth.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.710
Right?

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.640
So if this is--

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.216
I know for sure that
it's greater than that.

00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:32.440
Also if I look at this, and
I know that sin is never

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.100
bigger than 1, I know this
whole thing is going to be,

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.470
at most, 2.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.020
So if I have another
function that

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:46.690
says f prime of x equals, say,
3 times x to the power of 1.5,

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:51.210
I know that it's going
to bound it from above.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.480
So I have two bounds.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.470
So it sort of looks
like this case.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.540
Except when I use theta,
I have to make sure

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.220
that the bounds
are very similar.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.690
They can only differ
by a constant factor.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.290
In this case my bounds
differ by the exponent

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.330
here, which is more
than a constant factor,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.810
so they're not the same.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:20.360
So if I take my function--
which by the way is g--

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:30.580
if I want to say that g to the x
is theta of something, I can't.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.490
Because no matter
what I put in here,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.790
it's not going to be correct.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.290
The lower bound is this,
the upper bound is this.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.520
But what I can do is I can say
that I know for sure that it

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.740
is theta of x to the
power one fourth.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.490
And by the way I
can also say that it

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.240
is order of x to the
power of one fifth.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.100
So if you have weird running
times that looks like this,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:04.600
then you can only
use O and omega.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.220
And with that
being said, we will

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.210
use O for pretty much
the rest of this course.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.610
And for most of the cases
we'll use it to mean theta.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.110
Oh, by the way, these formulas
look ugly and complicated,

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.390
because I wanted the graphs to
look complicated to illustrate

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.440
the idea that asymptotic
notation makes

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.941
things look simpler.

00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:32.440
In this course the running times
that you'll be dealing with

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.130
are all look like this.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:45.800
They will either be order 1,
order log n, order n, order n

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.550
log n, n ordered n squared.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.450
You might have one or two cases
where you get something else,

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.040
but most of the time if
you have something else

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.730
coming out of your occurrence,
it means you're doing it wrong.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.081
So nice tip to have.

00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:03.080
And you can see that I
already started doing it.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.580
I'm already using
O instead of theta.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.670
So I guess I'm getting
into the habit.

00:14:11.664 --> 00:14:15.575
AUDIENCE: So why did you leave
the theta one blank for g of x?

00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:16.950
VICTOR COSTAN:
Because whatever I

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.790
put here is going to be wrong.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.250
If I put x to the
power of one fifth,

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.380
this is wrong, because I
can have an upper bound that

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.020
has x to the power
of one fifth in it.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.300
But I can't have a
lower bound like that,

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.030
because this function
hits x to the power of one

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.880
fourth in infinitely
many points.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.910
If I try to do x to the power
of one fourth, same deal.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.610
Lower bound yes, upper bound no.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.670
So whatever I put in here
is going to be wrong.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.030
Thank you.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.698
Good question.

00:14:48.698 --> 00:14:49.198
Yes?

00:14:49.198 --> 00:14:52.109
AUDIENCE: Is that
1.4 or one fourth?

00:14:52.109 --> 00:14:52.900
VICTOR COSTAN: 1.4.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.851
They are 1.4 and 1.5

00:14:54.851 --> 00:14:55.392
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:57.609
Because I thought you were
saying 1/4 and I was--

00:14:57.609 --> 00:14:58.650
VICTOR COSTAN: Oh, sorry.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.944
1 4, 1.4.

00:14:59.944 --> 00:15:05.591
1.4, 1.5.

00:15:05.591 --> 00:15:06.090
OK.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:06.881
Are we good so far?

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:23.680
OK.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.304
Let's go through a
couple of exercises.

00:15:25.304 --> 00:15:27.377
So I'll give you a
few functions-- Yes?

00:15:27.377 --> 00:15:29.210
AUDIENCE: Do you make
omega-- Is that-- It's

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.800
a lower bound already without
multiplying by any constant,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.480
or something?

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.990
Is that what it is?

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.190
VICTOR COSTAN: So
for all of these,

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:41.400
what you put here is the
simple, is the simple form.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.090
So you're lower bound can
be this function multiplied

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.300
by any constant factor.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.915
AUDIENCE: That-- So
omega means lower bound?

00:15:47.915 --> 00:15:49.540
VICTOR COSTAN: Omega
means lower bound,

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.570
O means upper bound,
theta means both.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.930
OK.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.860
Any other things to clear
up before I ask questions?

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.530
So it's your turn
before it's my turn.

00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:10.170
All right.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.000
I'm going to go over
a few functions,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.220
and I want you guys
to tell me what--

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.520
to help me write them
in asymptotic notation.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.230
So I will have f of n.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:27.530
And I want to know
it's theta of what?

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:32.680
So let's start with f of
n equals 10 to the 80.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.780
Does anyone know
why 10 to the 80?

00:16:37.141 --> 00:16:37.640
Yes.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.300
AUDIENCE: That'd be O of 1.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.050
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.435
That's the correct answer.

00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:43.560
You 're going ahead though.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.750
I was wondering if-- I was
wondering if you know why?

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.424
Why did I choose this?

00:16:50.424 --> 00:16:51.840
Does anyone know
why I chose this?

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.340
Yes?

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.814
AUDIENCE: Is that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:53.814 --> 00:16:55.230
VICTOR COSTAN: I
think that's 100.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.099
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:57.890
VICTOR COSTAN: You're
getting close though.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.787
It's something.

00:16:58.787 --> 00:17:00.245
AUDIENCE: It's a
really big number.

00:17:00.245 --> 00:17:02.311
VICTOR COSTAN: It's
a really big number.

00:17:02.311 --> 00:17:02.810
All right.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.190
So it's a really big number.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.440
That's the estimated number
of atoms in the universe.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.859
So realistically any
quantity that you

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.260
deal with that will
represent the real world,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.839
is not going to be
bigger than this.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.079
So if you want to get
all philosophical,

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.849
you can say that for any
algorithm that you write

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.720
in any realistic
input the running time

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.280
will be theta of 1.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.849
But if you do this, we're not
going to be happy with you

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:27.968
on exams.

00:17:27.968 --> 00:17:30.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.800
So let's choose another one.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.460
20 n to the power of 7.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.740
What's this an
asymptotic notation?

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.501
And why?

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.490
Yes?

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.550
AUDIENCE: Order O
of n to the seventh.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.360
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.720
Of that same thing,
n to the seventh.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.220
Thank you.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.722
Why is that?

00:18:01.722 --> 00:18:04.949
AUDIENCE: Because if you
distribute the exponent 7,

00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:07.290
20 to the seventh is a constant.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.570
VICTOR COSTAN: Excellent.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.160
20 to the 7 time
n to the 7, this

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.600
is a constant so it goes away.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:19.330
OK.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.420
And before I do
another one, I want

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.780
to give you guys some help
and remind you about logs.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.240
How many people
remember the laws

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.860
of working with logs from
algebra or some math class?

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:32.740
All right.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.510
You guys will be helping me
write them for everyone else.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:40.960
So if I have log
of n to the 100,

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.640
and I want to get to the theta
notation for it, what is it

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.190
and why?

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.330
AUDIENCE: Log n.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.080
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.580
Excellent.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.746
Why is that the case?

00:18:55.746 --> 00:18:57.950
AUDIENCE: It's 100 log n.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.700
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.380
So when I have an
exponent here, I

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.430
can pull it out in front of
the log as a constant factor.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:10.471
So this is the same
thing as 100 log n.

00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:10.970
OK.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:19.810
Now if I have the logarithm to
the base using base 5 of n--

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:20.640
How about this?

00:19:26.412 --> 00:19:27.855
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] multiply.

00:19:27.855 --> 00:19:29.780
That's just log n?

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.610
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.560
So this is-- can
you say that again?

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.530
AUDIENCE: Log n.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.280
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.260
So this is theta of
log n because it is--

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.360
AUDIENCE: Log n over log 5.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:48.160
VICTOR COSTAN: So
that's log n over log 5.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.610
So exponents inside the logs
turn into constant factors,

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:55.330
bases turn into
constant factors.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.390
So if you have an ugly
expression inside a logarithm,

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.020
you can, most of the
time, simplify it

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.061
to something really nice.

00:20:01.061 --> 00:20:04.390
And this contributes
to the fact that these

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.764
are the only functions that
you will see when the answer is

00:20:07.764 --> 00:20:09.180
cleaned up in
asymptotic notation.

00:20:13.941 --> 00:20:14.440
OK.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:14.660
Yes?

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.201
AUDIENCE: So when
you're writing log,

00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:18.452
are you assuming the
second base then?

00:20:18.452 --> 00:20:20.660
VICTOR COSTAN: Yes, there
is a certain base for logs.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.021
We're all computer scientists.

00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:22.520
Right?

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.213
So what's the natural
base for our logarithms?

00:20:25.213 --> 00:20:26.099
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:27.430
2D.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.350
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.880
Sweet.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.486
Math major?

00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:33.780
AUDIENCE: No, you know I
always heard natural base--

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:34.530
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.800
Yeah, it's a math joke.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.580
So for everyone else a natural
logarithm is in base E.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.490
For us CS people, a
natural base is 2,

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.580
because that's how many
values you have for a bit.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:54.820
So log means log n is
to log base 2 of n.

00:20:57.437 --> 00:20:59.020
The good news is
that most of the time

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.644
we're working with
asymptotic notation,

00:21:00.644 --> 00:21:01.840
so it doesn't really matter.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.670
We can communicate
with our math friends,

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:08.371
and we don't have
to talk about this.

00:21:08.371 --> 00:21:08.870
OK.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.060
I need to get another
complicated example.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.590
And my memory fails me.

00:21:17.518 --> 00:21:18.018
OK.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.200
So log-- See, I'm using
Ln to mean the math

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.850
natural logarithm.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:33.075
So we still have that
somewhere in here.

00:21:33.075 --> 00:21:39.570
Of log n to the base 100.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.300
They made me add all these
parentheses in the last section

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.110
to be clear, so I'm adding
them now from the start.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.790
Who wants to help
me clean this up?

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.496
Yes?

00:21:50.496 --> 00:21:51.799
AUDIENCE: Log, log n.

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:52.840
VICTOR COSTAN: All right.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.940
Wow, one step.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:03.200
Log, log n OK.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.931
Can you tell me
why, very quickly?

00:22:05.931 --> 00:22:08.347
AUDIENCE: So we can simplify
out the base and the exponent

00:22:08.347 --> 00:22:08.847
in there.

00:22:08.847 --> 00:22:09.664
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:22:09.664 --> 00:22:10.330
AUDIENCE: Then--

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.538
VICTOR COSTAN: Base goes out.

00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:12.880
Exponent goes out.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.177
AUDIENCE: Log, log of something
is another [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:16.177 --> 00:22:17.260
It's not exactly up there.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:17.745
But can you--

00:22:17.745 --> 00:22:18.536
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

00:22:18.536 --> 00:22:20.170
AUDIENCE: --occassionally
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.470
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.680
What does a theory student
say when they're drowning?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.090
Log, log, log, log.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.210
Some of you are laughing
already, because know this.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:31.710
OK.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.900
What if I want to make
this a little bit harder?

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:45.752
And I say log [INAUDIBLE]
5 of log n to the 100.

00:22:45.752 --> 00:22:47.210
You have to do a
bit more work now,

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.001
you can't just use the
tricks on the right.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.980
Anyone else?

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.490
Yes?

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:57.930
AUDIENCE: It's still log, log n.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:58.680
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.546
It is still log, log n.

00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:01.670
But for a different reason.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.294
Right?

00:23:03.294 --> 00:23:04.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.010
VICTOR COSTAN: Almost.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.690
OK.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:07.510
Maybe not.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:12.270
So the base still goes
out just like before.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.920
But this guy now goes out here.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:21.100
So I will have this be,
sort of like-- Notice

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.670
that I'm not saying
equal, I'm saying

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.590
like because I got
rid of the base.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:39.790
So it's like 100 times log
n, which is log 100 plus log,

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.780
log n.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.040
And this is a constant
factor, this grows as n grows.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.740
So this is going to
become incredibly small

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.960
as n becomes larger and
larger, so I can get rid of it.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.480
OK?

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.730
OK.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.010
One more, and this one's
going to be less boring.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.979
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] out into a
separate term-- the log of 100?

00:24:06.979 --> 00:24:09.046
Going from it in
the last step, how

00:24:09.046 --> 00:24:12.090
are you able to cross that out?

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.910
VICTOR COSTAN: If my memory--
If my memory works, I think,

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:21.017
log of a b is log a plus log b.

00:24:21.017 --> 00:24:21.725
AUDIENCE: Gotcha.

00:24:21.725 --> 00:24:22.965
VICTOR COSTAN: Am I right guys?

00:24:22.965 --> 00:24:23.465
Sweet.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.770
Good question.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.010
I wasn't sure, but
now that you asked,

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.340
everyone else helped me
make sure it's right.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:44.290
OK.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.706
I'm erasing so
much, because we're

00:24:45.706 --> 00:24:47.940
going to need more
room for this.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.090
So I have a log again, but this
time what I have inside the log

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:56.790
is n choose n over 2.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.730
Does any brave soul want to come
up here and solve this for me?

00:25:08.135 --> 00:25:08.635
No?

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.963
You guys are going to make
me write for the entire hour?

00:25:14.963 --> 00:25:16.895
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:19.793 --> 00:25:23.160
VICTOR COSTAN: I'll offer help.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.405
AUDIENCE: It's n-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:25.405 --> 00:25:26.530
VICTOR COSTAN: So this is--

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.609
AUDIENCE: Is that
n factorial over --

00:25:28.609 --> 00:25:29.400
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.980
AUDIENCE: --n divided
by 2 factorial?

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:37.250
VICTOR COSTAN: n factorial
over n divided by 2 factorial,

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.120
times n divided by 2 factorial.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:40.620
Close.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.170
And I'll give up
another hint, which

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.950
is that n factorial
can be approximated

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:56.420
as square root of 2pi n
multiplied by n over E divided

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.070
by n to the power of n.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:59.870
But I think this will
make you guys not

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.460
want to come up and solve this.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.018
Yes?

00:26:02.018 --> 00:26:03.101
AUDIENCE: OK. [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.120
VICTOR COSTAN: I
was-- Is that it?

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.490
Is that not it?

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.170
Did I get it wrong?

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:12.886
OK.

00:26:12.886 --> 00:26:16.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] minus n.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.890
VICTOR COSTAN: I think
that's an asymptotic.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.260
That's what we'll-- I
think we'll get to that.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.775
But factorials
grow exponentially.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.201
So it should be
something like this.

00:26:30.201 --> 00:26:30.700
OK.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.210
So we have that
nice approximation.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.680
Does anyone want to work it
out, or will I have to do it?

00:26:38.774 --> 00:26:41.350
I'll keep that in mind when
I'm grading your homework.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.230
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:53.390
So it's log of square root 2
pi n multiplied by n over 2

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.750
to the power of n.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.140
I'm going to put
these two together.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:06.720
So 2 pi n over-- There's
an n over 2 there, right?

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:16.780
So it's n over 2E times n
over 2 to the power of 2.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:27.330
OK, I can get rid of this
guy, because it's a constant.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:31.805
I can get-- No, I can't
get rid of this guy yet.

00:27:31.805 --> 00:27:35.605
AUDIENCE: In the denominator
shouldn't it be 2pi n over 2

00:27:35.605 --> 00:27:37.980
under the radical?

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.450
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.330
2pi n over 2, so
this simplifies.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.230
OK.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.750
Thank you.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.250
AUDIENCE: Square
at the bottom term,

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.100
you can get rid of the
square root on the end--

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.050
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.830
AUDIENCE: --and then cancel
the some of the exponents.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.580
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.746
Do you want to come help me?

00:27:55.746 --> 00:27:56.491
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:57.740
VICTOR COSTAN: Thanks so much.

00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:06.384
STUDENT: OK.

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:09.680
So we can distribute this
exponent here to cancel this.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:19.898
And then we get square root
of pi n times n over 2.

00:28:19.898 --> 00:28:23.167
And it'd be n-- sorry
about my handwriting.

00:28:23.167 --> 00:28:25.000
VICTOR COSTAN: I think
it's better than mine

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.760
by quite a bit.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.485
STUDENT: Square root of pi n.

00:28:32.485 --> 00:28:34.960
And this is square root
squared, so that cancels .

00:28:40.405 --> 00:28:44.365
Times n over E to the n.

00:28:49.315 --> 00:28:51.702
AUDIENCE: Do you need
parenthesis around n over 2E?

00:28:51.702 --> 00:28:52.285
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:28:52.285 --> 00:28:54.265
That's probably good.

00:28:54.265 --> 00:28:58.450
So, since this is n over E
to the n, and n over 2E n.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.210
Well since they're
to the n, both the

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:05.140
n we can give them a single
exponent and cancel stuff.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:13.910
So we just get square root
of pi n to the times 2

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:18.520
the n, over pi n.

00:29:22.892 --> 00:29:30.666
Can do some more cancelling
and just get 2 the n over--

00:29:30.666 --> 00:29:36.995
Going to simplify this to the
n over the square root of n.

00:29:36.995 --> 00:29:39.920
We can take out the pi, because
it's in our natural logarithm.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.660
It's a constant factor.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:54.980
And this is log of-- and
then-- Since it's a log of,

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.960
it's just log of 2 to the n.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:09.236
So it's-- say since it's log
you can turn it into log of 2

00:30:09.236 --> 00:30:13.070
to the n minus log
of square root of n.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.180
Log of 2 to the n is a
much greater complexity

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.270
than square root
of n, so we can--

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:18.173
VICTOR COSTAN: Sweet.

00:30:18.173 --> 00:30:20.290
Thank you.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.140
So see?

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.510
Complicated formula-- Even
more complicated formula

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.370
came out to be
one of the numbers

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.260
that I promised it
would come out to.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.470
Thanks for the help.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.320
So you can get rid of the
pi as soon as you want to.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.120
And this is the last step.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.550
I just want to
say it again, just

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.020
make sure everyone heard it.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.780
So once you get
here, you get this,

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:48.310
order n minus log
of square root of n,

00:30:48.310 --> 00:31:07.130
which is-- This is-- This is
order n minus one half log n.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.880
And the log n is
much smaller than n,

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.377
so this goes away completely.

00:31:12.377 --> 00:31:13.960
And you get this as
your final answer.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.950
OK.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:21.824
Does this make sense?

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:28.420
Any questions?

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.320
Anyone?

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.210
How many people are still
paying attention honestly?

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:35.130
Wow.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.532
Nice.

00:31:36.532 --> 00:31:37.990
You should come to
all my sections.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:00.390
OK.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.410
Let's talk about something
we covered in class.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.820
Let's talk about peak finding.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.560
And we'll start with
1D peak finding,

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.000
and then we'll go
to 2D peak finding.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.316
So does anyone remember the
pseudocode for the faster 1D

00:32:11.316 --> 00:32:12.440
peak finding by any chance?

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.660
ID peak finding.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.270
I think everyone said
they went to lecture,

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.580
so I don't have to explain
what peak finding is, right?

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:30.960
OK.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.870
So that's go for it.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:36.320
So suppose I have
a few numbers--

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:48.370
3-- let me write this one--
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:52.890
So the peak finding problem says
there's an array of numbers,

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.610
and I want to find
the local peak.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:56.720
And the local peak
is a number that's

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.040
surrounded by numbers that
are smaller or equal to it.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.720
So there shouldn't be any
larger numbers than it.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.355
And I want to find a
peak as quickly as I can.

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:12.480
So what's the faster
algorithm that we talked about

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:12.980
in lecture?

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:18.370
Yes?

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:18.870
OK.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.378
You didn't answer, right,
as much, at least so.

00:33:22.378 --> 00:33:23.390
AUDIENCE: Binary search?

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.140
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.840
It's exactly like binary search.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.270
Yep.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.740
Do you wanna help me
write the pseudocode?

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.089
You can tell me what it is.

00:33:31.089 --> 00:33:31.714
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:33:31.714 --> 00:33:34.290
So, I guess well
start in the middle.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:35.040
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.310
Start in the middle.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.334
If you-- If you write
this on your Pset

00:33:46.334 --> 00:33:48.250
you might want to be a
little bit more formal.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:49.410
Someone asked about proofs.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.730
I would say
something like, start

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.500
by looking at the middle
element of the array.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.530
Same thing though.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:58.640
OK.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.160
So let's pretend
this is the middle.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.480
Now it is.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.568
What do I do?

00:34:05.568 --> 00:34:09.870
AUDIENCE: Then you can check
one side in the middle.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.720
So it's [INAUDIBLE]
the right side.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.469
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.982
I'm looking at the right side.

00:34:13.982 --> 00:34:16.250
I see a 7 there,
so I know for sure

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.760
that this is not a local peak.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.389
Right?

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:21.468
What do I do now?

00:34:21.468 --> 00:34:26.704
AUDIENCE: So now you can
start over, and using 7.

00:34:26.704 --> 00:34:27.659
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:29.560
What if-- This would be small.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.900
What if I would look at 5 first?

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.860
Or you should I look
at the other side too?

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.483
AUDIENCE: Well you don't have
to in this case, but if you--

00:34:38.483 --> 00:34:40.897
But if 7 were smaller
then you would

00:34:40.897 --> 00:34:42.769
go and look at the
other side, and check

00:34:42.769 --> 00:34:44.110
to see if 5 is also smaller.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.580
In that case you've
already found the peak.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.330
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:51.469
So I have to look at both sides
and make sure-- if none of them

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:52.929
is smaller, than I-- I'm sorry.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.989
If none of them is
bigger, I found the peak.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:35:00.340
If any of them is bigger then
I can go whichever way I want.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.990
So I saw my 7, I'm going
to cut this in half.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:05.652
And now I look at this.

00:35:05.652 --> 00:35:06.610
You were saying, right?

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.140
So look at the
neighbors-- By the way,

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.700
can anyone understand
my handwriting?

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.830
Is it even worth
bothering to write?

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:19.090
AUDIENCE: It's pretty good.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.160
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.060
I see three nods.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.181
I'm going to write for
those three people.

00:35:24.181 --> 00:35:25.680
AUDIENCE: It's just
we haven't taken

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.858
any cursive in about 12 years.

00:35:27.858 --> 00:35:29.830
So--

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:30.580
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.560
Thanks.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.590
Not feeling well at all.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.346
OK look at neighbors,
figure out if you're a peak.

00:35:37.346 --> 00:35:39.470
You're one of the people
that said you can read it,

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.420
so now there's only two people
that can read my handwriting

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.140
and that I like.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.110
VICTOR COSTAN: Look
at the neighbors.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.540
See if local peak.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:58.160
And if not, figure out
which way to go in.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.850
And I'll say if not recurse.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.930
So what's the running
time for this?

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.250
Suppose I have n
elements to start with,

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.660
that's my array size.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:19.584
I will use t of n
as my running time.

00:36:19.584 --> 00:36:22.000
So to figure out the running
time for the whole algorithm,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.890
I have to look at the
running time for each step

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:24.660
and add them up.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.100
Right?

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.010
What's the running time
for the first step?

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:29.940
Looking in the middle.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the middle elements.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:38.520
VICTOR COSTAN: 1.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.020
1.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.610
I would not say 0.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:41.900
I still have to look at it.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:46.940
Or to be on the safe side
you say 1, theta of 1.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.530
It's a constant.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.030
OK.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.530
Now I have to look
at the neighbors,

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.150
and I have to see if one
of them is bigger or not.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.030
How about that?

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.118
How much time is left?

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:01.440
I heard the constant.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.670
OK.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:05.430
Very soft voice, but I
heard a constant there,

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.820
so I'm going to take it.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:11.254
So this guy is a constant.

00:37:11.254 --> 00:37:12.670
If it's a local,
if you come down.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:15.750
If it's not a local peak, what's
the running time for this?

00:37:22.146 --> 00:37:25.750
n over 2, since--

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.250
AUDIENCE: If you FOIL that you
divide by [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:29.180
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.810
So I'm looking at this guy.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.916
It's clearly not a peak.

00:37:32.916 --> 00:37:34.540
So I'm going to look
on the right side,

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.330
because I see a 7 here
that's bigger than a 6.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:40.590
So now I have the same problem,
except my array size just

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.290
dropped to half.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:46.390
So same problem, because I
already have a name for it,

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.110
except the input
size is different.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:56.130
So the running time for this
entire step is theta of 1

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.540
plus T of n over 2.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.650
So the running time
for the whole thing

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:07.770
is-- I should have said
theta of 1 here, sorry.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:13.890
So theta of 1 plus theta
of 1 plus T of n over 2.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:22.460
So this is theta 1
plus T of n over 2.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.330
So I wrote out my
pseudocode, looked

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:26.460
at the running time for
each step, added them up.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.630
Now I have a recurrence,
and I have to solve it.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:32.460
Let's solve it.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.450
We sort of glossed
over that in lectures,

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.980
so we're going to do it now.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:52.620
So T of n equals theta
of 1 plus T of n over 2.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.220
I'm going to expand this
using the definition.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:01.840
And theta of one is long, so I'm
going to call this c instead.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.060
It's a constant, right?

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:09.510
So c plus-- expanding
this-- c plus T of n over 4.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.080
I'm going to expand it again.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:25.530
And again-- Anyone
getting bored of this?

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:31.020
So if I expand it a lot of
times, I'm going to get i times

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:35.912
c, plus T of n
divided by 2 to the n.

00:39:35.912 --> 00:39:37.370
And you can expand
it as many times

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.120
as you want until
we see the pattern,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.950
but this is the pattern.

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.200
So I have a recurrence.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.770
What else do I need in
order to get a function?

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:47.336
I need a base case.

00:39:47.336 --> 00:39:49.710
So the problem size gets
smaller and smaller and smaller,

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.130
but at some point
it becomes so small

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.080
that I can solve it
just by looking at it.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.930
What's that case?

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:00.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.150
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.250
So if I have an array of
one element, it's a peak.

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.910
Right?

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:05.410
Job done.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:15.970
So T of 1 is a constant.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:22.350
So I want to write this in such
a way that this becomes this.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:29.680
So I want to figure out
an i such that-- Yeah.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:36.770
T of n divided by 2 to
the i equals T of 1.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.780
And the easiest way
of doing that is

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.660
to say that n divided
by 2 to the i is 1.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:48.770
So i is the inverse of
an exponential-- Anyone?

00:40:52.534 --> 00:40:53.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:54.950
VICTOR COSTAN:
Logarithm, thank you.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:01.470
Log n.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:05.250
So I have i, and I'm going
to plug it back in here.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:15.120
And I get constant times log
n, plus T of 1, which I know

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.390
is theta of 1.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.670
I'm going to make
this theta of 1 again.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:28.900
So theta of 1 times
log n, plus theta of 1.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.870
And I know that log n
dominates a constant,

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:35.760
so this is going to
be theta of log n.

00:41:40.655 --> 00:41:41.155
Solved.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:45.760
OK.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.130
How are we doing?

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:48.750
Yes?

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.435
AUDIENCE: In the second
to last from the bottom,

00:41:51.435 --> 00:41:55.604
I don't understand
[INAUDIBLE] of c times log n

00:41:55.604 --> 00:41:58.019
replace i by log n.

00:41:58.019 --> 00:42:02.350
In the second part of the
equation, how did you--

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:03.100
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.430
So in the jump from here
to here, where I said

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:08.862
i equals log n-- Right?

00:42:08.862 --> 00:42:10.510
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.660
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.990
So i becomes log n, c stays c.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:17.750
You're wondering about
this part, right?

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.400
So if i is log n,
then 2 to the i is n.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.660
So I have T of 1,
which I have here.

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.150
So I want this to
have this happen.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:34.726
When I'm solving for i here, I
set this guy to my base case,

00:42:34.726 --> 00:42:36.100
so that I can get
this to happen.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.094
The idea here is that you're
expanding the recursion

00:42:42.094 --> 00:42:43.760
forever, and you know
that at some point

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.890
you're going to have to stop.

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:45.540
When do you stop?

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.630
You stop at the base case.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.208
So you force this to
become the base case.

00:42:54.576 --> 00:42:56.395
OK?

00:42:56.395 --> 00:42:56.895
OK.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.650
Let's do 2D peak finding.

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.040
Let's talk about
it a little bit.

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.420
So 2D peak finding is
exactly like 1D peak finding,

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:27.020
except you have a 2D matrix
instead of a 1D array.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.610
Let's see if I
can do this right.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.210
So suppose this is our matrix.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:57.910
And suppose these are the rows.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:05.600
Suppose we have m
rows and n columns.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.580
Can anyone remind me what
the psuedocode for 2D

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.260
peak finding that we
talked about in lecture?

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.550
So we had two attempts.

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.110
The first one was
a clear failure.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:33.440
It didn't work.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.350
The second one worked.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.140
And we talked about its
running time a little bit.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.390
And then [INAUDIBLE] asked
you to think of a variation

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:41.630
to the second one.

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:45.720
So let's do those
straight up second version

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.490
of the pseudocode
without the variation.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:49.570
So 2D peak finding.

00:45:00.434 --> 00:45:01.350
What is the algorithm?

00:45:07.681 --> 00:45:08.180
All right.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.220
One person was not asleep in my
section at the end of lecture.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.105
I'm proud.

00:45:13.105 --> 00:45:13.646
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:13.646 --> 00:45:15.128
Well, Which one of us?

00:45:15.128 --> 00:45:16.634
We both spoke at the same time.

00:45:16.634 --> 00:45:18.675
VICTOR COSTAN: You had
your hand up first though.

00:45:18.675 --> 00:45:21.590
AUDIENCE: So you just pick
a middle of the column.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:23.448
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:45:23.448 --> 00:45:24.876
And then you find
the peak there.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:32.292
AUDIENCE: And then you shift
the neighbors, I think.

00:45:32.292 --> 00:45:42.686
VICTOR COSTAN: Find
peak neighbors.

00:45:42.686 --> 00:45:46.630
AUDIENCE: Neighbors
in the same room?

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:48.409
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:48.409 --> 00:45:50.450
VICTOR COSTAN: That's the
horizontal line, right?

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.950
OK.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:55.788
So what do you mean
by find the peak here?

00:45:55.788 --> 00:45:57.600
AUDIENCE: Like
within the column?

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.391
VICTOR COSTAN: Yes.

00:45:58.391 --> 00:46:01.290
So find the peak using what
we talked about before?

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:02.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:02.990
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.770
Find 1D peak.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.650
So you're thinking ahead.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.750
You're thinking of the
variation that [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:20.601
asked you guys to
think about at home.

00:46:20.601 --> 00:46:21.850
I'm glad you thought about it.

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:23.060
That's good.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.169
But what's the one
that we had in lecture?

00:46:25.169 --> 00:46:26.710
I don't want to
think about-- I don't

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.251
want to give you
guys the answer yet.

00:46:28.251 --> 00:46:32.110
So what did we say we were
going to do in lecture?

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:32.767
Yes?

00:46:32.767 --> 00:46:35.202
AUDIENCE: I think we
just picked a spot,

00:46:35.202 --> 00:46:37.130
checked the neighbors
and kept walking uphill.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.856
That makes sense.

00:46:38.856 --> 00:46:41.590
Every time we found a
neighbor that was bigger,

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.910
we moved to that spot.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:44.490
Checked its neighbors.

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:45.990
VICTOR COSTAN: So
this is the-- This

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:48.430
is the first
algorithm that's slow.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:49.026
It works.

00:46:49.026 --> 00:46:50.650
You're going to get
the correct answer.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:54.530
But it's slow because if you
have some handily crafted

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:58.570
matrix you can go like
this, and you're basically

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:01.400
going through the whole matrix.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:01.917
Yes?

00:47:01.917 --> 00:47:04.000
AUDIENCE: I think there's
like an algorithm that's

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.462
find a-- look through the
column for its maximum,

00:47:06.462 --> 00:47:08.300
and then look to either side.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.100
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:10.940
So instead of finding
a 1D peak, we're

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.825
going to find the maximum value.

00:47:16.161 --> 00:47:16.660
OK.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.480
And this is correct, and let's
look at its running time.

00:47:25.034 --> 00:47:26.200
Does anyone want to help me?

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:32.050
So this is T of n m.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:32.550
Right?

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:33.549
Then rows, then columns.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.050
So what's the running
time for the first step?

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.870
Come on.

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:41.030
This is the easy one.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:42.390
Yes?

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.950
The constant.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:43.450
Perfect.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.740
OK.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.650
What's the running
time for finding

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:52.087
a maximum amount of n numbers?

00:47:52.087 --> 00:47:53.460
AUDIENCE: n.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.000
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.830
Perfect.

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:01.820
And suppose we do that here?

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.950
Suppose these rows don't exist.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:06.130
Suppose this is
my entire matrix.

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:09.230
And I'm here, and I
found the maximum.

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:10.180
What do I do?

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.200
I look left, I look right.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.450
If both of them are
smaller, then it

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.260
means I found my
peak, because I know

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.960
that number was a
maximum in my column.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.290
Now if that's not the case, if
I find a number that's bigger,

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.330
I'll go in that direction.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.290
Does that sound reasonable?

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:28.790
OK.

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:34.660
So maximum for my column,
and I'm going to go right.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:41.020
So check neighbors, and I have
the same two conditions there.

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.325
If it's a peak, then I'm happy.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.430
Otherwise recurse.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.850
So what's the running
time if I have to recurse?

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:54.660
How does the new
problem look like?

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.800
It's an identical problem.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:01.450
I still have a matrix,
except-- What changed?

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:07.840
So suppose I got here-- and this
is the middle of my matrix--

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.810
and I see that
this guy is bigger,

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:12.950
so I'm going to recurse
to the right side.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.725
What happened to
my problem size?

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:18.090
OK?

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.090
AUDIENCE: Sorry I'm not
answering your question,

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:23.874
but shouldn't find x
be theta of m, not n?

00:49:23.874 --> 00:49:24.708
Is that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:24.708 --> 00:49:25.790
VICTOR COSTAN: Let me see.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:26.710
AUDIENCE: I can't tell

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:28.710
VICTOR COSTAN: You are right.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:31.380
Thank you for paying attention.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.920
Theta m.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:33.480
Sweet.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.980
That would have
tripped me up later.

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:35.650
Thanks for saving me.

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:36.098
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:37.181
So what was your question?

00:49:37.181 --> 00:49:38.126
Sorry.

00:49:38.126 --> 00:49:40.500
VICTOR COSTAN: So the question
is, if I have to recurse--

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.460
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.168
VICTOR COSTAN: --what's
the running time?

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.100
So I'm-- If I have to recurse,
I'm in this array that was

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:55.500
originally n by m, and I'm
only going to look at the right

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.000
side.

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:06.110
How many these-- how many rows
do I have in the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:08.584
Start to the easy one.

00:50:08.584 --> 00:50:09.299
AUDIENCE: m.

00:50:09.299 --> 00:50:10.340
VICTOR COSTAN: All right.

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.010
Same as before.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.340
How many columns?

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.210
AUDIENCE: n over 2.

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:16.210
VICTOR COSTAN: n over 2.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.300
Sweet.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:24.090
So there recursion
for this is theta of 1

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:32.830
plus theta of m plus
T of n over 2 and m.

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:38.870
I know that a constant can be
absorbed by this other guy,

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:47.122
so it's theta of m
plus T of n over 2 m.

00:50:47.122 --> 00:50:48.080
How would I solve this?

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:55.870
What's the first
thing that we need?

00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:58.880
Yes?

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.620
AUDIENCE: Need to figure
out the base case.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.180
VICTOR COSTAN: All right.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:01.540
Excellent.

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:01.950
Base case.

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:03.658
What's the best-- What
was the base case?

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.866
AUDIENCE: T of 1
comma T of n-- m.

00:51:10.866 --> 00:51:11.597
Sorry.

00:51:11.597 --> 00:51:12.430
VICTOR COSTAN: Nice.

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:14.850
AUDIENCE: Equal to O of m.

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:18.040
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.020
Sweet.

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:26.180
So if I only have
one column, then I

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:28.770
can do-- I can find the
maximum and I know for sure

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:29.880
that's going to be a peak.

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.060
Job done.

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:32.990
That's my base case.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:35.680
So I'm going to reduce
the problem size in half,

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.240
until I get to a single column.

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.800
Then I find the peak
there, and I'm happy.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.298
How would I solve
this recurrence?

00:51:46.552 --> 00:51:48.010
It's a one minute
answer, because I

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:51.245
think that's exactly how
much time we have, as a hint.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.486
Come on guys, this
looks familiar.

00:51:59.486 --> 00:51:59.985
Yes?

00:51:59.985 --> 00:52:01.905
AUDIENCE:Going to be something
like the recurrence over

00:52:01.905 --> 00:52:02.390
there--

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:03.348
VICTOR COSTAN: Exactly.

00:52:03.348 --> 00:52:04.782
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] of just n.

00:52:04.782 --> 00:52:05.740
VICTOR COSTAN: Exactly.

00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:07.230
m never changes, right?

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:09.990
So this is basically
a function of n.

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:13.280
So if m never changes, and I
pretend that it's a constant,

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.950
this looks exactly like the
recursion-- the recurrence

00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:17.340
that we solve before.

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:22.920
T of n is a constant,
plus T of n over 2.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.770
So I'm going to
get that constant,

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:35.380
multiply it by log n, which is
the solution that I had before.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:42.211
So the running time
is theta of m log n.

00:52:42.211 --> 00:52:42.710
All right.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:46.250
I think I have 30 seconds, so
what if I would choose-- What

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:48.870
if I would try to do
this algorithm instead?

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:50.740
It's another one
minute question.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:51.740
So I guess I'm cheating.

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.280
I'm taking time away.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.220
Sorry.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.800
So what if I would
be finding a 1D

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.557
peak instead of
finding a maximum?

00:53:01.315 --> 00:53:03.940
I'm looking at the running time,
because if the running time is

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.648
going to be the same,
it's not even worth

00:53:05.648 --> 00:53:07.400
thinking if it's correct or not.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.950
If it's a more
complicated algorithm

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:11.350
with the same running
time, why care about it?

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.901
So is the running time
going to be better?

00:53:13.901 --> 00:53:14.400
OK.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.900
I heard a nod.

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.094
Why?

00:53:17.094 --> 00:53:19.589
AUDIENCE: Won't it
be log m times log n?

00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:20.630
VICTOR COSTAN: All right.

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:23.240
So 1D peak is exactly
what we have there.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.380
Thank you.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:29.230
1D peak is exactly
like you said, log m.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:32.480
So this constant here
becomes this constant here,

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.550
so the algorithm
would be a lot faster.

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:38.660
As an order of magnitude idea,
if your m and n are one million

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.900
each, then log n is 20.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.290
So that's a 50 time
max improvement.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:46.900
And these are real input
sizes you might get.

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:47.520
And that's it.

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.530
Thank you guys.
