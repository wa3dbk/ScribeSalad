00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.770
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE] audio.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.310
We're going to have a series
of lectures on shortest paths.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.380
And one of the big differences
between this module

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.940
and the previous one, at least
from a mathematical standpoint,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.460
is that we're
going to be looking

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.780
at graphs that have
weights on their edges.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.690
So when Eric talked about
depth first search and breadth

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.140
first search in the
last couple of lectures,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.160
we had directed graphs
and undirected graphs.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.270
But we didn't really have
attributes on the edges.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.690
In particular, you have
a much richer class

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.190
of problems and
applications if you

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.700
allow for weights
on graph edges.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.020
And these weights
can be integers.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.270
They could be real
numbers, irrationals.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.560
They could be negative,
what have you.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.030
And for different
classes of graphs

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.790
and different
restrictions on weights,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.460
there's really a set of
shortest path algorithms,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.150
that we'll look at in the
next few lectures, which

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.050
are kind of optimized for
a particular application.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.900
So we won't do specific
algorithms today.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.770
But we'll set up the problem.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.050
We'll talk about
the general approach

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.970
that most shortest
path algorithms take

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.010
to solve a particular
instance of a problem.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.810
And then we'll
close with talking

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.390
about a particular property
that's pretty important.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.290
That's called the optimum or
optimal substructure property.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.904
That is a technique that most
shortest path algorithms,

00:02:06.904 --> 00:02:08.570
or actually all
shortest path algorithms

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.690
use to get efficient complexity.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.890
So asymptotic complexity
is important, obviously.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.580
And we're always looking for
the best algorithm with the best

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.930
asymptotic complexity.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.710
And optimal
substructure is a hammer

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.990
that we're going
to use to get that.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.850
So the canonical motivation,
of course, for shortest paths

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.010
is-- now, if you
want to steal, or I

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.640
guess borrow, a
cannon from Caltech

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.860
and bring it over
to MIT, then you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.510
want the fastest way of getting
here with your illegal goods.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.230
And you want to find the
shortest way or the fastest

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.080
way of getting from one
location to another.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.500
So Google Maps go
from point A to point

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.210
B. That's a classic application
of the shortest path problem.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.000
In this case, you could
imagine that distance

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.110
would be something that would
be a very simple metric that you

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.120
could use for the
weights on the edges.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.360
So for this entire
module, we're going

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:31.390
to be looking at
a graph G V, E, W.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.660
And you know what V and E are.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.360
They're the vertices
and the edges.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:47.020
And W is a weight function
that maps edges to weights.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.510
And so we're adding
that in here.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:59.140
And so W would be E to R.
So the set of real numbers.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.990
We're going to be looking
at two different algorithms

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.630
in subsequent lectures.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.085
And you'll implement one of
them in your problem set.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.030
The simpler algorithm,
which we'll look at first,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.510
is called Dijkstra, after
Edsger Dijkstra, who

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.970
did some similar work in
concurrent programming,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.320
won the Turing Award.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.790
But on the side invented
this cool algorithm--

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.330
or at least gets credit for
it-- called Dijkstra's algorithm

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.530
that assumes non-negative
weight edges.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.030
So I should really
say non-negative.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.690
So read that as non-negative.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:51.510
And that has a complexity
of order V log V plus E.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.290
All right.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.330
So this is practically
linear time.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.910
And typically, you're going
to be dominated in many cases

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:10.060
by E. In general, if you talk
about a simple graph, what's

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.690
the asymptotic relationship
between E and V?

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.040
Can you relate E to V?

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.874
Can you give me a bound?

00:05:22.874 --> 00:05:23.942
AUDIENCE: V squared.

00:05:23.942 --> 00:05:24.650
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.970
V squared, thanks.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.700
That's good.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.280
So you can think of E
as being order V square.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.470
And you can certainly have--
that's worth recursion.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.540
So now, you can kind of
imagine a complete graph.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.390
And a complete
graph is something

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.980
that has an edge between
each pair of vertices.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.710
And that's where you'll
get E being k w squared.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.370
So when you say
simple graph, you're

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.630
saying you have at most one edge
between any pair of vertices.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.160
A multigraph is
something that could

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.140
have multiple edges
between pairs of vertices.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.480
We won't really be
talking about multigraphs

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.840
in this sequence of lectures.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.420
But something to think about or
keep in the back of your mind

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.130
as we go through
these algorithms.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.810
And so the dominating factor
here, and in many cases really,

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.390
is E. And Dijkstra is a
nice algorithm, because it's

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.080
linear in the number of edges.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.900
So that's Dijkstra.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.090
And that's the first
of the algorithms

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.750
that we'll look at next time.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.070
But we'll see the general
structure of Dijkstra today.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:50.880
And then there's the
Bellman-Ford algorithm

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.890
that works on positive and
negative edges, weight edges.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:03.630
And this has a
complexity order V E.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.240
So you could imagine a
particular implementation

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.060
of Bellman-Ford running
in order V cubed time.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.360
Because E could be V square.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.610
And you've got this
additional E factor.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.800
So it's order V cubed
versus order V log V.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.000
So when you have a
chance, use Dijkstra.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.670
When you're stuck, you'd
want to do Bellman-Ford,

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.665
because you have these
negative weight edges.

00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:29.790
And one of the challenges
in negative weight edges,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.550
and I'll say a little
bit more as we go along,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.050
is that you end
up having to have

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.720
to find cycles that are
of a negative weight,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.840
because they kind of throw off
your shortest path algorithm

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.590
if you were just assuming that
shortest path lengths are only

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.180
going to decrease.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.460
But when you have negative
weights, you might take a step

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.900
and the overall
weight might decrease.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.150
So it's kind of a longer path
in terms of the number of edges.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.600
But the weight is smaller.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.970
And that kind of makes the
algorithm more complicated.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.362
And it has to do more work.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.820
So that's really why there's
a difference between these two

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.760
complexities.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.200
And I guarantee you, you'll
understand this much better

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.700
after we're done with
the lectures on Dijkstra

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.019
and the lectures
on Bellman-Ford.

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:21.560
So that's the set
up for the problem.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.030
That's what we're
going to be looking at.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.830
Let's look at a couple
more definitions

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:34.549
beyond what I have here with
respect to just the notation.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:46.883
And you can think of path p as
a sequence of vertices-- V0, V1,

00:08:46.883 --> 00:08:49.880
et cetera, to Vk.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:57.650
And this is the path
if Vi, Vi plus 1

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:03.320
belongs to E for 0 less
than or equal to i less than

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.210
or equal to k.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.290
So a path is a
sequence of edges.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.670
And each of those edges
has to be in the graph,

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.530
has to be in the set of edges E.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:20.090
And W of p, which is
the weight of the path,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.860
we know that by the weight
of edges, those are easy.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.970
They're given by the W function.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.840
The weight of the path
is simply the summation

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.620
of the weights of the edges.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:33.620
All right.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.610
So fairly obvious definitions.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.730
But obviously, we have to
get these right in order

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.350
to actually solve the
problem correctly.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:49.760
And the shortest path problem
is, as you can imagine,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:10:00.050
something that tries to find a
path p that has minimum weight.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.840
So in general, you have
some set up for the problem.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.350
But it comes down
to find p with--

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.599
And there are many,
many possible paths.

00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:18.640
You have to understand
that there are potentially

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.082
an exponential number
of paths in the graphs

00:10:22.082 --> 00:10:23.040
that we would consider.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.610
And here's a real
simple example where

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:33.360
you would have an
exponential number of paths.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.540
And we'll come back to this
example later in the lecture.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.390
But let's assume that all
the directions go this way.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.500
And it's a directed graph.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.245
Well, you could have the path
that goes all the way here.

00:10:49.245 --> 00:10:52.220
But you could have the
path that goes on top

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.700
and all the way this way.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.510
You have basically two choices
on getting to this vertex.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.190
Then you've got,
given the two ways

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.320
you have of getting
to this vertex.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.580
You've got four ways
of getting here.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.240
And then, you have eight
ways of getting there.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.870
So on and so forth.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.750
So there's an exponential
number of paths potentially.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.970
The other thing that's
interesting here,

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.900
which is important in
terms of this complexity

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.580
is, what's interesting
about what you see here

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.380
with respect to the complexity
and what you see here.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.590
Anybody want to point that out?

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:30.910
So I have this complexity
here and order VE out there.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.762
What's an interesting
observation

00:11:34.762 --> 00:11:37.095
if you look at this board
here and the two complexities?

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.810
Anybody?

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:42.580
Yeah, back there.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.330
AUDIENCE: It's not a
function of weight.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.690
PROFESSOR: It's not
a function of weight.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:46.190
Great.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.650
That's definitely
worth recursion.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.180
And I'll let you throw this one.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.990
All the way back
there, all right?

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.900
Right.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.580
All right, good.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.537
Good, good.

00:11:59.537 --> 00:12:00.120
That was good.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.450
That was better than
what I could do.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.180
No, not really.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:09.390
But I would've been right
in his hands right there.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.940
Anyway, so that's a great
observation, actually.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.940
And I should have pointed
it out right up front.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.880
But I'm glad I
got it out of you.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.160
W doesn't exist
in the complexity.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.650
This is pretty important.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.410
W could be a large number.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.030
I mean, it could
be 2 raised to 64.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:34.640
The fact is that there's only
E square different values

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.170
possible for a weight, right.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.730
I mean, roughly speaking.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.390
If you have a complete
graph, it's a simple graph,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.160
there's order E square
possible weights.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.830
But the range of the weights
could be exponential.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:54.480
I could have an edge
weight of 0.0001

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.090
and a different edge
weight of 10 raised to 98.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.190
There's nothing
that's stopping me

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.040
from doing that or putting
a specification like that.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.830
But the nice thing about
Dijkstra, and Bellman-Ford,

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.030
and virtually all
of the algorithms

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.960
that are useful in
practice is that they

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.450
don't depend on the dynamic
range of the weights.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.720
And so keep that in
mind as you think

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.622
of shortest path algorithms.

00:13:19.622 --> 00:13:22.080
And we'll talk a little bit
about this in section tomorrow,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.390
or the TAs will, as to why
breadth first search and depth

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.380
first search aren't directly
applicable to the shortest path

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.610
problem.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:36.480
And the hint really is the
dynamic range of the weights.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.770
So keep that in mind.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.970
So a couple things why this
is an interesting algorithm,

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.310
or interesting problem to solve,
and harder than the problems

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.070
we've looked at so far
like sorting and search,

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.760
is that you have an
exponential number of paths.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.540
And then the dynamic
range of the weights

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.700
can be very, very large.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.540
And it's not linear
by any means.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.040
All right.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.020
So these algorithms are going
to have to have some smarts.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.810
And the optimal
substructure property

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.670
that we'll look at towards
the end of today's lecture

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.070
will give you a sense of how
these algorithms actually

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.980
work in basically linear time.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.310
Or VE, you could
think of that as being

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.330
cubic time in terms
of the vertices.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.530
So keep that in mind.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:23.470
Let's talk a little bit
more about weighted graphs.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.990
I want a little
bit more notation.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:38.170
And what I have is V0
using path p to Vk.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.470
So I'm going to write
that to say that there's

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.810
a particular path of V0 to Vk.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:48.900
Sometimes I'm searching for the
path p with a minimum weight.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.190
And that's how I'm
going to represent that.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:56.120
V0, which is a
single vertex path,

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.580
is the path from V0 to V0.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.680
So it's really a 0 length path.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.630
And it has weight 0.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.410
So that's one condition.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.670
The other condition
that we need to look at,

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:18.120
which is the other case, is
what if there isn't a path?

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.820
So I want to put those
two things together,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.610
the two extremes, and of
course all of the cases

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:29.810
in between, in this definition
of the shortest pathway.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.990
And so I'm going to talk
about the shortest path

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.990
value of the weight of the
shortest path between u and v

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.610
as delta, u, v. And my
goal is to find delta.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.560
It's also to find the path.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.890
It doesn't help you
very much if you

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:53.270
know that there's a way of
getting from here to Lexington

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.830
within 14 miles if you don't
know what that path is, right.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.690
So that's one
aspect of it, which

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.110
is you want to get the weight.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.970
But you want to get
the path as well.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.230
And these algorithms
will do that for you.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.150
And in particular,
what we want is

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:24.100
delta u, v to be the minimum
over all the paths W p,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:30.730
such that p is in fact
the path from u to v.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:40.490
And this is the case where if
there exists any such path,

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.920
and the last thing is you
want this to be infinity,

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.185
the weight to be
infinity otherwise.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:56.490
So if you're only talking about
roads going from here to Tokyo,

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.540
should have length infinity.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:04.099
A little matter of the
Pacific Ocean in between.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:08.970
So that's the set up
in terms of the numbers

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.040
that we want to see.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.800
If you're starting from
a particular point,

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.720
you can think of the shortest
path length from your source

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.240
as being a 0.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.150
Initially, everything
is infinity

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.790
because you haven't
found any paths yet.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.450
And what you're going to do is
try and reduce these infinities

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.970
down for all of
the vertices that

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.040
are reachable from
the source vertex.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.580
And it's quite possible that
you may be given a graph where

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.740
a particular vertices,
or in your set

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.030
V, that can't be reached
from the particular source

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.290
that you started with.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:50.650
And for those vertices, you're
going to have your delta u,

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:56.650
v. If v is unreachable from
you, it will stay at infinity.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.390
So let's look at an example.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:12.980
Let's take-- it's going to
be an iterative process here

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.150
of finding the shortest paths.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:22.100
And so let's take
an example that

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.770
corresponds to a
fairly complex graph,

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.330
or at least a nontrivial one,
where that's my source vertex.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.420
And I've labeled these
other vertices A through F.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.725
And I have a bunch of edges.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.280
5.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.140
I got one more here.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.640
So that's what's given to me.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:18.720
And I want to find delta
S plugged in for u.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:25.390
And A, B, D, et cetera plugged
in for V for this graph.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:30.850
And let's just do this
manually if you will.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:35.111
And just trying to do some
kind of breadth first search.

00:19:35.111 --> 00:19:36.610
And we do know
breadth first search.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.060
We know depth first search.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:45.580
You can imagine trying to use
those notions to try and find

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.020
the shortest paths here.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.829
So now we have to
prove afterwards

00:19:48.829 --> 00:19:51.370
when we are done that these are,
in fact, the shortest paths.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.720
And that's the hard part of it.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.860
But we can certainly try and
fill in some numbers associated

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.620
with paths that
we do know about.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.635
So I'm going to say
that the numbers that

00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:08.210
are inside each of
these vertices-- d of u

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.365
is the current weight.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.890
And so initially, I'm going
to start with D of S being 0,

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.699
because that's a source.

00:20:19.699 --> 00:20:21.240
And all of these
other ones are going

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.073
to have-- I'm not going
to write this down--

00:20:23.073 --> 00:20:26.940
but they're going to have
infinity for their D of Vs.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.350
So D of A is infinity.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.210
Do of B is infinity, et cetera.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.500
And what I want to do is
decrease this D number

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.080
to the point where I'm confident
that all of the D numbers

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.230
that are inside these vertices,
these are the current weights,

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.310
or end up being
the delta numbers.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.520
So my algorithm is done when
my d numbers shrink down.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.810
And I got the delta values,
the correct delta values.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.500
But if I wanted to do this,
sort of a seat of the pants

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.920
approach, just go off
and try and iteratively

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.860
reduce these numbers, you say,
well, this one was infinity.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.690
But clearly, if I start from
S and I follow the edges in S,

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.980
I'm going to be able
to mark this as a one.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.630
And similarly here, I'm going
to be able to mark this as a 2.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:19.860
Now, I could arbitrarily
pick this one

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.870
here and this A
vertex, and then start

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:28.090
looking at the edges that
emanate from the A vertex.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:36.470
And I could go off and mark
this as 6, for example.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:42.380
And if I start from
here, I'd mark this as 3.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:48.570
Now, is it in fact
true that 6 equals

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:54.670
delta S comma C equals 6?

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.100
No.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.550
What is in fact-- is there a
better way of getting to C?

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.780
And what is the weight of that?

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.594
What vertex do I
have to go through?

00:22:06.594 --> 00:22:19.180
I mean, one way is to go
from S to B to D to C, right?

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.520
And that would give me 5 right?

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.280
So that's 5.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.530
Can I do better than 5?

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.770
Not in this graph.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:28.930
OK

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:36.680
So it's not the case that the
shortest length path gave you

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.980
the smallest weight.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.600
I mean, that was
one example of that.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.600
And I can go on an and
bore you with filling

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.930
in all of these numbers.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.980
But you can do that on your own.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:53.020
And it's really not particularly
edifying to do that.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.660
But you get a sense
of what you need

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.430
to be able to do in order
to converge on the delta.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.600
And it might take some doing.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.002
Because you have to somehow
enumerate in an implicit way--

00:23:06.002 --> 00:23:07.460
you can't do it in
an explicit way,

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.370
because then there'd be an
exponential number of paths.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.670
But you'd have to
implicitly enumerate

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.480
all the different ways that you
can possibly get to a vertex

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.790
and discover the shortest
path through that process,

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.490
all right.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.080
And so we have to be able to
do that in these shortest path

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.510
algorithms.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:31.290
And this is a simple graph
that has positive weights,

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.160
non-negative weights with edges.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.599
It gets more complicated when
you have negative weights.

00:23:38.599 --> 00:23:40.640
But before I get to that,
there's one other thing

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.490
that I want to talk
about here with respect

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.900
to discovering the actual path.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.935
So what we did here
was we had delta u,

00:23:49.935 --> 00:23:55.890
v that corresponded to the
weight of the shortest path.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:24:00.080
But if you want
the path itself, we

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.090
need to have a way of finding
the sequence of vertices that

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:08.310
corresponds to the
minimum weight path.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.240
And in particular,
we're going to have

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.290
to define what we call the
predecessor relationship.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:25.270
And so what I have is
d of V is the value

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:31.230
inside the circle, which
is the current weight.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.400
And as d is something
you're very interested in,

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.270
eventually you want
it to go to delta.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.330
The other thing that
you're very interested in--

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.950
and this is really a fairly
straightforward data structure

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.050
corresponding to just the d
number and this predecessor

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:50.910
number.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:25:06.820
And pi of V is the predecessor
vertex on the best path to V.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.070
And you said, pi
of S equals NIL.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.950
And then you can think of
this as this is eventually

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:20.600
what we want, and this
gets modified as well.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.720
So right now, when
you're working and trying

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.320
to find the path, you
have some particular path

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.500
that happens to be
the current best path.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.930
And that's a
sequence of vertices

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.550
that you can get by
following the predecessors.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:40.250
So once you're at a particular
vertex E, you say all right,

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:46.700
right now I can look at pi of
E. And if that points me to C,

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.190
then that's good.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.240
I'm going to look at pi of
C. And that might point me

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.320
to A, and so on and so forth.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.560
In this particular
instance, pi of E

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.470
is going to, when you're finally
done, is going to point to A.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:06.150
And pi of A is going to point
to S, all right, because that's

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:10.010
the path that is the
best path is this one.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.660
Like so and like that.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.380
And so those are the
two data structures

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.200
you need to keep in mind
that you need to iterate on,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:24.970
this predecessor relationship
and the current distance.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:29.340
And then this ends
up being delta.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.370
You're done.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.401
And at that point, your
predecessor relationship

00:26:33.401 --> 00:26:33.900
is correct.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.842
So that's the set up.

00:26:39.842 --> 00:26:41.800
The last complication I
want to talk about here

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.284
is negative weights.

00:26:44.284 --> 00:26:46.450
And it's, I think, appropriate
to talk about it when

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.370
we have Bellman-Ford up here.

00:26:53.467 --> 00:26:55.050
Which is really the
general algorithm.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:09.190
So let's talk about-- so
the first question is why.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.780
Why do these things
exist, other than making

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.380
our lives more difficult?

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.780
So give me an example.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.855
What is the motivation for a
graph with negative weights?

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.990
I mean, I really
would like to know.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.450
The best motivation is
definitely worth recursion.

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:28.980
Then I can use it next time.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:29.863
Yeah, go ahead.

00:27:29.863 --> 00:27:35.286
AUDIENCE: I'm just
thinking like if your goal,

00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:37.258
if your goal [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:40.709 --> 00:27:42.188
And some of them cost too much.

00:27:42.188 --> 00:27:45.392
Some of them get
you money, and you

00:27:45.392 --> 00:27:49.090
want to know what-- you're
trying to find [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:55.499 --> 00:27:56.485
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:27:56.485 --> 00:27:58.465
Yeah, I mean, I think
that's a good motivation.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.980
I think driving, when
you think about distances

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.530
and so on, there's no notion
of a negative distance,

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.820
at least physically.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.652
But you can imagine that you
could have a case where you're

00:28:13.652 --> 00:28:15.110
getting paid to
drive or something,

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.325
or it costs you to drive,
and that would be one.

00:28:18.325 --> 00:28:18.950
Yeah, go ahead.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.366
AUDIENCE: It sounds
like Monopoly.

00:28:20.366 --> 00:28:24.014
So the vertices are
supposed to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:24.014 --> 00:28:25.680
PROFESSOR: Oh, if you
land on something,

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.570
you have to pay rent.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.060
Or sometimes you
land on something

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.010
and you actually get money.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:29.926
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:32.792 --> 00:28:34.750
PROFESSOR: Takes you
forward, backwards, right.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:35.458
Yeah go ahead.

00:28:35.458 --> 00:28:36.374
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.670
PROFESSOR: So that is such
an interesting notion.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.230
Sometimes you may want to go.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.080
And maybe in this
case, you're saying

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.490
it's better to take
your distance metric

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.940
and go further away in order
to get the best way of getting

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.190
there, or something like that.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.106
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.160
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:09.659
Sure.

00:29:09.659 --> 00:29:10.290
That'd be good.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:10.820
Right.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.103
Victor, you had your hand up.

00:29:12.103 --> 00:29:12.728
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:12.728 --> 00:29:15.223
I'm going to give
[INAUDIBLE] on the highway,

00:29:15.223 --> 00:29:18.217
you can't [INAUDIBLE]
distances [INAUDIBLE] negative.

00:29:18.217 --> 00:29:22.209
Well, if a government
uses [INAUDIBLE] police

00:29:22.209 --> 00:29:26.201
to regulate traffic, then you
might have a negative distance.

00:29:26.201 --> 00:29:28.696
Because obviously, you
could go a certain way

00:29:28.696 --> 00:29:31.582
minus the [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:31.582 --> 00:29:32.290
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.120
Yeah, that's a good example.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.050
One of the things that
we have to think about

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.310
is-- and this is something
that might come up,

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:43.620
by the way, in a problem set
or a quiz-- which is, is there

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:48.540
a way of shifting these weights
to make them all positive?

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.250
So the examples we've talked
about, not clear to me

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:56.100
that in the particular
settings that we talked about

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.130
that you can somehow
create the base

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:03.120
case to be 0 rather
than being negative.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.370
So it may not be possible
in a particular scenario.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.630
But if you can do
that-- and the reason

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.200
I bring this up is if
you can do that, suddenly

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.760
instead of using an
order V, E algorithm,

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.120
if you can prove correctness
of the final solution

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.630
is exactly what you'd have
gotten for the initial problem

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.360
certification, you've gone
from an order V, E algorithm

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.894
to an order V log V algorithm.

00:30:24.894 --> 00:30:26.310
So that's a wonderful
thing to do.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.160
So keep that in mind.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.720
Try and get rid of negative
weight edges if you can

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.730
without changing the
problem certification.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.080
I saw a hand back there.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.056
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

00:30:35.056 --> 00:30:37.008
I thought you were just
asking the question,

00:30:37.008 --> 00:30:37.984
if we could do that?

00:30:37.984 --> 00:30:41.400
So I was just gettin
ready to answer.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:47.540
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah, so that's
something to keep in mind.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.956
One example that I think has
come up here, which came up,

00:30:49.956 --> 00:30:51.330
I think, the last
time I lectured

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:54.620
was imagine that you're
driving and there

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.240
are all these advertisements.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.750
And you get paid to
drive on a freeway.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.197
So the reverse toll.

00:31:00.197 --> 00:31:02.530
I mean, it's a reverse toll,
because you get to go there

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.940
and you have to
see all these ads.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:09.200
And then I guess you drive
pretty fast through those ads.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.380
But you have to go through.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.690
And so you get paid to go
through those particular roads.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.810
And then what about
social networks?

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:19.550
I mean, there's liking
people and disliking people.

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:22.037
I mean, that sounds pretty--
that's negative and positive.

00:31:22.037 --> 00:31:23.870
One could imagine that
social networks would

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.190
have positive weights
and negative weights.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.750
I'm surprised one
of you-- I mean,

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:29.250
I don't have an
account on Facebook.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:32.240
But presumably, you guys do.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.154
So think of what's the--
yeah, that's right.

00:31:36.154 --> 00:31:37.570
Well, I'm not sure
how this works.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:40.410
But you guys figure it out.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.240
So why?

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.060
Reverse tolls, social networks.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.770
Lots of things.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.140
Even if you're not
convinced by the motivation,

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.589
I will spend a whole lecture
talking about Bellman-Ford.

00:31:56.589 --> 00:31:57.880
So that's just so that's clear.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.470
So the issue with the
negative weight cycles

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:07.780
is something that is worth
spending a minute on.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.780
And I talked about
the fact that you

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.100
had an exponential
number of paths.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.820
And that causes a
bit of a problem,

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.610
even in the case where
you have positive weights.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.420
And I will revisit that example.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.970
But here's an even
worse problem that

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.955
corresponds to negative cycles.

00:32:29.449 --> 00:32:30.990
So eventually, you
want to terminate.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:32.860
The faster you
terminate, and if you

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.850
can talk about
asymptotic complexity,

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.100
obviously that means
that you've terminated

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.160
within a worst
case bound of time.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.680
And if that's
exponential, that's bad.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.040
You'd want it to be small.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.310
But what if you
didn't even terminate?

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:52.610
So suppose you have
something like this

00:32:52.610 --> 00:33:02.400
where you have a graph that
has negative weights on some

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.140
of the edges.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.840
But others are positive.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.025
So this one has a minus 6.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.060
I think I got those right.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:26.520
So 2 for minus 6 over
here, 3, 2, 1, and minus 2.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.500
So one thing that you
notice from this graph

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:33.700
is that you got this
annoying cycle here.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.710
That's a negative weight cycle.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.130
And that's why I've picked
this particular example.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.860
Minus 6 plus 2 is minus 4.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.910
Minus 4 plus 3 is minus 1.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:45.670
So if you had something where
you can't depend on the fact

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:50.870
that the D's are going
to keep reducing.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.120
And that eventually,
they'll stop reducing.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:53.870
Well, that's true.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:55.286
Eventually, they'll
stop reducing.

00:33:55.286 --> 00:33:57.350
Because they're
lower bounded by 0

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.470
when you have positive weight
edges or non-negative weight

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:01.290
edges.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:05.940
But if you have a graph with
a negative cycle-- and I mean,

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.969
this is a recipe for an
infinite loop, right--

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:10.980
in your program,
potentially a bug.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.380
But maybe not even a bug,
not a bug in implementation,

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.750
but a bug in the algorithm.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.415
Because this determination
condition isn't set properly.

00:34:19.415 --> 00:34:20.790
So you can imagine
that you would

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:24.100
get to B and the
first time-- whoops,

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.860
I'm missing a weight here.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:32.909
So you get to B. And
you say, well, I'm done.

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:36.739
Delta of SB is 4.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:37.576
But that's not true.

00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:39.659
Because you could get to
B. And then you could get

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.854
back to B with the weight of 3.

00:34:41.854 --> 00:34:44.020
And then you could do it
again with the weight of 2,

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.540
and so on and so forth.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.989
So that's a problem.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.050
So what would you like
an algorithm to do?

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:52.719
What would you like the
Bellman-Ford to do here?

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:56.855
It's not the case that
all of the delta values,

00:34:56.855 --> 00:34:58.230
that is the shortest
path values,

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.210
are undefined for this graph.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.410
Some of them are well defined.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.440
This one, you can't
ever get back to it.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.040
So clearly, delta S, S is 0.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.150
Everybody buy that?

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.610
What about this one?

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.640
It's 2, right.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.600
Delta S, A is 2.

00:35:21.132 --> 00:35:23.340
And everybody buys that,
because there's just no way.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.560
You can't, you don't touch
a negative weight cycle.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.750
You, in fact, don't touch
a negative weight edge.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.400
But more importantly, you don't
touch a negative weight cycle

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.830
in order to get
to A. And there's

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.960
no way of touching that.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.970
On the other hand,
anything that's in here

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.870
you could run many times.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:44.430
And you could end up with
whatever weight you wanted.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.940
There'd be a minus
infinity weight.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.680
So what you want
an algorithm that

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.770
handles in particular
negative cycles,

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:53.400
which are the hard part here.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.590
Negative weights
aren't the hard part

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.960
if you can't run through
these edges more than once.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.450
It's actually the negative
cycles that are hard.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.500
And the negative
cycles are going

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:08.330
to make shortest path lengths
indeterminate, but not

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:12.940
necessarily for every
node in the graph,

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.800
like this example shows.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.600
So what you want your
Bellman-Ford algorithm to do,

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.730
or your shortest
path algorithm that

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.390
handles negative
cycles to do, is

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.810
to finish in reasonable
amounts of time.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.930
Order V, E will
take and give you

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:33.540
the delta numbers for
all of the vertices

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.290
that actually have
finite numbers

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.150
and then mark all of
these other vertices

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:43.140
as being indeterminate, or
essentially minus infinity.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:43.720
OK

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.560
So that's your
termination condition.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.770
It's different from the
termination condition

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.920
if you simply had
non-negative edge weights.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.890
All right.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:55.750
So remember, it's cycles that
cause a problem, not just

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.230
the edges.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:00.250
And you have to do
something about the cycles.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.210
But they may not affect the
entire part of the computation.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.890
So if you don't know that
you have a cycle or not,

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:12.180
then you end up with
having to use Bellman-Ford.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.750
And so that also tells you
something which is interesting,

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:18.400
which is Bellman-Ford has
to detect negative cycles.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.880
If Bellman-Ford couldn't
detect negative cycles,

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.310
then how could it possibly
be a correct algorithm

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.090
for the arbitrary case?

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.380
So Dijkstra doesn't
have to do that.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.450
And that's why
Dijkstra is simpler.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.720
All right.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:36.820
So let me talk about the general
structure of shortest path

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.600
algorithms.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.750
And the 2 important notions
that I want to talk about here

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:49.030
are the notion of relaxation,
which we sort of did already

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.590
when we ran through
this example.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.460
But I need to formalize that.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:59.465
And then we'll go back and
revisit this exponential graph

00:37:59.465 --> 00:37:59.965
example.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.650
So the general structural
of shortest path algorithms

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:09.260
are as follows.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:16.470
We're going to initialize for
all u belonging to the vertex

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:20.380
set, we set d v to be infinity.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:26.260
And we set the
predecessor to be NIL.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:31.650
And then we'll set
d of S to be 0.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.400
We're talking about a
single source, here.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.800
We'll set that to be 0.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.740
And what we're going to
do is essentially repeat.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:54.240
Select some edge u comma v.
And I'm not specifying how.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.560
This is going to result
in a different algorithm

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.640
depending on the
specifics of how.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:07.430
But the important notion is that
we're going to relax edge u,

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:11.980
v. And what the notion
of relaxation is

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.140
is that you're
going to look at it.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:21.880
And you'll say, well, if d
of v is greater than d of u

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:29.000
plus w u, v, then I've
discovered a better

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.640
way of getting to v
then I currently know.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.100
So d of v would
currently be infinity,

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.020
which means I haven't found
a way of getting to v yet.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:43.110
But I know that d of u, for
example, is a finite number.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:45.840
And I do know that this edge
exists from u to v, which

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.910
means that I can update
the value of d of v.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:53.550
And that's what we call
relaxation of the edge u, v.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:57.710
And so what you do here
is if the if is true,

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:05.770
then you set d, v to
be d, u plus w u, v.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:09.570
And you'll also update the
predecessor relationship,

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:16.430
because the current
best predecessor for v

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:17.826
is going to be u.

00:40:17.826 --> 00:40:20.900
So that's the notion
of relaxation.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.880
And I kind of ran
out of room here.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.930
But you keep doing this.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:28.010
This repeat.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.525
So what is the repeat?

00:40:30.525 --> 00:40:42.110
Well, the repeat
is until all edges

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:56.860
have d of v less than or
equal to d of u plus w u, v.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:01.940
And the assumption here is that
you have no negative cycles.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.020
We need a different structure.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.840
The notion of relaxation is
still going to be relevant.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.650
But don't think
of this structure

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.940
as being the structure
that Bellman-Ford uses,

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.580
or algorithms that can
handle negative cycles use.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:23.370
So hopefully, you got
the notion of relaxation,

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.580
which is from a
pictorial standpoint,

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.420
it's simply
something that we did

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:35.150
when we looked at updating the
value of 6 to 5, for example.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.840
So we said through
this process, if I

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.970
relax this particular edge
and d was already set up--

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:47.230
let's say d, the
vertex here had 3.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.450
And this was originally 6.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.620
And I look at it and
I say, D of C is 6.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:58.530
On other hand, 6
is greater than d

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:03.060
of the vertex D, which
happens to be 3 plus 2.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:06.370
And since 5 is less than
6, I can relax this edge

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:09.610
and update the value of 6 to 5.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.690
And then I update the
predecessor relationship

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:18.300
to have a pi of
C to be D. That's

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.460
the notion of relaxation.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.610
Fundamental notion.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:24.860
Going to use it in every
algorithm that we talk about.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.530
When do you stop?

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:28.480
Well, when you don't
have negative cycles,

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:32.740
there's a fairly clean
termination condition,

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.940
which says that you can't relax
any of the edges any more.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.040
OK You get to the
point where you

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.430
have values that are
associated with each

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.170
of these vertices inside.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.150
And it doesn't matter
what edge you pick,

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.580
you can't improve them.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.820
So this termination
condition, it

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.271
could involve an order E check.

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:55.770
So we're not talking
complexity here

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:59.190
yet in terms of being efficient.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:03.040
But you can imagine when I
say until all edges cannot be

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.720
relaxed, that you'd have
to look at all the edges.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.740
And if any one of
them can be relaxed,

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.480
it's possible that another
one can now be relaxed.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.800
So you've got to keep going
until you get to the point

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.610
where none of the
edges can be relaxed.

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:20.040
So this is a brute
force algorithm.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.420
And it'll work.

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.720
It'll just be slow.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.110
It'll work for known
negative cycles.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.290
And if you just kind of
randomly select these edges

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.340
and just keep
going, I'll give you

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:36.880
an example where it works
pretty badly in a minute.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.340
But this is an algorithm.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.030
So I guess I lied
when I said we weren't

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.270
going to give you an algorithm.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:43.150
It is an algorithm.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:47.150
It's just an algorithm that
you never want to implement.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.940
You do want to implement
the relaxation condition.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:55.130
But not this random way of
selecting edges and having

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:58.470
this termination condition
that, in of itself,

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:01.770
is an order E check.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:03.490
And one of the
reasons why you don't

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:06.080
want to implement this
algorithm is coming up shortly

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.710
in our exponential
graph example.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:12.530
But let me make sure
that people aren't bored.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:15.040
Any questions about
the general structure,

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.156
relaxation, anything?

00:44:18.156 --> 00:44:19.870
Are we good?

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:20.550
OK.

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:24.050
So you guys, I walk away
from lecture thinking

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.320
I've given this spectacular
lecture and everybody

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.170
understands.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:29.320
And then Victor tells
me when he shows up

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.260
in section in the
morning, he says

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.050
did people understand graphs?

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.130
And everyone says no.

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:37.810
Or did people understand x?

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:38.850
And people say no.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:43.460
So at least tomorrow, tell
Victor that you understood.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.840
Whether you did or not.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.090
So then I feel better.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:49.774
AUDIENCE: That's going to
make my life real easy.

00:44:49.774 --> 00:44:51.680
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.030
So good.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:55.540
Well, you probably like
hearing stuff from Victor

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.470
better than me anyway.

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:59.100
That's the secret here, right?

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.010
All right, so one
of the reasons why

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:09.380
you don't want to
implement this algorithm

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.850
is precisely this
example that I put up.

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:16.120
And this is a really neat
example that I like a lot,

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:20.540
because it points out
two different things.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.670
It points out that
exponential number

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:27.840
of paths, an exponential
number of paths in a graph,

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.864
could cause a problem
with this algorithm.

00:45:29.864 --> 00:45:31.280
The other thing
that it points out

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.590
is that we got issues
with the weights of edges.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:39.480
One of the nice observations
one of you made earlier on

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.560
is that we had these neat
algorithms that did not

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.760
depend on the dynamic
range of the weights.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.480
So let's just say
that I in fact had

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.970
an exponential range
for the weights.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.220
I know 4 isn't exponential,
but at some level,

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.500
you could imagine that
it's exponentially

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.980
related to 1 or 2.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.390
And the point here
is that if I created

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:13.940
a graph that looked like this,
where I have V4, V5, V6, V7,

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:20.390
V8, and it had this
structure, then

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:23.270
I'm going to end
up having something

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:29.000
like 2 raised to n
over 2 weight if I

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.700
have n vertices in this graph.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.060
Or at least the dynamic
range of these weights

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.730
is going to be 2 raised
to n divided by 2.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:36.640
Everybody buy that?

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.600
So think of this graph as being
a fragment of this large graph,

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.380
which where n could
be 100 and the weights

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.380
could be 2 raised to 50.

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.920
And 2 raised to
50 isn't a number

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.780
that we can't handle
on a computer, right?

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.720
It's still less
than 64 bits, right?

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.250
So it's a pretty
reasonable example.

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:59.190
And we talked about multiple
precision arithmetic,

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:00.440
infinite precision arithmetic.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.520
So we can handle
arbitrary numbers

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.030
of an arbitrary position.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.940
So there's nothing
that's stopping us

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.280
from putting square root of
2 and all sorts of things.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.990
We won't do imaginary numbers.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.790
But you could imagine
putting numbers

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:20.140
with a high dynamic range as
edges in a particular graph

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.870
and expect the Dijkstra,
assuming that all of the edges

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:28.090
are non-negative, that Dijkstra
should be able to run on it.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.760
So what happens
with this example?

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.090
Well, with this example,
here's what happens.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:36.340
Let's say that I
ran this algorithm.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:42.210
And initially, I just
followed this chain here.

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:45.320
And I get-- this
starts with a 0.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.530
And this is a 4, because
I get there with 4.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:50.280
This one is 8.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.650
And this is 10.

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:55.380
And this is 12, 13, 14.

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.740
And that's the initial pass.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.990
That's the selection.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:10.020
What ends up happening is that
you could now relax at this--

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.430
you see 14.

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.660
And let's say you
relax this edge.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:18.940
You see that 12 and 14,
you've turned that into 13.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.500
And then when you relax this
edge, this turns into 12.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.640
So you go through that process.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.510
Now, this one stays 12.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.560
But now you relax this edge.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.350
And so this 12 becomes 10.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:37.310
And then when this
changes, you need

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:41.830
to-- if you relax
this edge first,

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:45.060
then this 13 is
going to become 11.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.440
It doesn't really matter.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.450
This becomes, I guess, 11.

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:51.281
And-- is that right?

00:48:51.281 --> 00:48:51.780
Yup.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:55.690
This is 11 and
that's 11 as well.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.440
It might start out
being 12 if you

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.250
relax this edge and that edge.

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:02.920
So you might go to 12 to
11, and so on and so forth.

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:07.450
So for a pathological ordering,
I won't belabor the point.

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:09.700
But you see that you're
going 14, 13, 12,

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:14.480
11 with a bad ordering
that corresponds

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.990
to the selection of the edges.

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:21.266
And so if the overall weight
here and overall weight here,

00:49:21.266 --> 00:49:22.640
when you start
out with, is going

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.390
to be order 2
raised to n over 2.

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:29.160
OK And you could be, in
this particular graph,

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.640
relaxing edges an
exponential number of times

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:36.940
in order to finish.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.840
And so the number of
times you relax an edge

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.440
could be of the
order of the weights

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.820
that you start out with.

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:47.220
And that makes this algorithm
an exponential time algorithm.

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.050
So clearly, we have
to do better than that

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:52.540
when it comes to
Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.840
So how are we going to
do better than that?

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.260
Yeah, question back there.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.718
AUDIENCE: Is it an
issue that we're

00:49:57.718 --> 00:49:59.176
starting at the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:02.807 --> 00:50:04.140
PROFESSOR: You're exactly right.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.410
There's an issue with the
ordering that we've chosen.

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:10.920
But what you have to show
is that for any graph,

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.790
the particular ordering
that you choose

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:16.910
will result in V log V plus
E and so on and so forth.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:17.910
So you're exactly right.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:20.118
I mean, it's an issue with
the ordering we've chosen.

00:50:20.118 --> 00:50:22.050
This is a pathological ordering.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.850
It's just meaning
to say that we have

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:27.080
to be careful about
how we select.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.040
If you selected wrong,
you've got problems.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.110
And so the purpose
of next week is

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:35.360
going to be how do we
select these edges properly.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:40.070
And so I leave you
with this notion of,

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:44.200
very simple notion of,
optimal substructure using

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.430
two very simple
terms that you can

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:50.200
prove in literally
a line of text.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:59.410
And the first one says as
subpaths of a shortest path

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:00.580
are shortest paths.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:11.920
And all that means is if I
had V0, and I went to V1,

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.500
and I went to V2, and
these are paths here.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:22.930
So this could be p01, p02, p03.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:26.240
And so there are many vertices
potentially between V0 and V1.

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.010
And if you tell me
that V0 through V3,

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:34.460
the concatenation of
p01, p02, and, sorry, p03

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.485
are a shortest path.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.110
If this is an SP,
shortest path, then that

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:50.030
implies that each of these
are shortest paths as well.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.650
And that makes sense,
because if in fact there

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:55.740
was a better way of
getting from V0 to V1

00:51:55.740 --> 00:52:00.200
that was better than p01, why
would you ever put p01 in here?

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.390
You would use that better way.

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:03.580
So very simple.

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.810
That's what's called the
optimum substructure property.

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:12.190
And this notion of the
triangle inequality

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:14.440
is also related to that.

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:21.700
And that simply says that if
I have something like this,

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:28.110
that I have V0, V1,
and V2, then when

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:32.810
I look at the delta
value of V0, V1,

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:38.500
and I compare that with the
delta values of V0, V2, and V2,

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:46.290
V1, then this has got to be
smaller than or equal to this

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:48.096
plus that.

00:52:48.096 --> 00:52:49.220
And that again makes sense.

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:54.090
Because if this plus this
was smaller than that,

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:59.030
well remember I'm talking
about paths here, not edges.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:00.890
And the better way
of getting to V1

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:03.140
would be to follow--
go through V2 rather

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.640
than following this
path up on top.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.480
Amazingly, these two
notions are going

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.670
to be enough to
take this algorithm

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:12.980
and turn it into essentially
a linear time algorithm.

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.530
And we'll do that next time.
