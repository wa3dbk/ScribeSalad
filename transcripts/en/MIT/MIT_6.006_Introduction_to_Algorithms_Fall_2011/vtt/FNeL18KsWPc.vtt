00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.710
PROFESSOR: Continuing
in the theme

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.190
of sorting in general, but
in particular, binary search

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.910
trees, which are a
kind of way of doing

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.210
dynamic sorting,
if you will, where

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.759
the elements are
coming and going.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.020
And at all times, you want
to know the sorted order

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.170
of your elements by storing them
in a nice binary search tree.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.360
Remember, in general, a
binary search tree is a tree.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.040
It's binary, and it has
the search property.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.300
Those three things.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.660
This is a rooted binary tree.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.815
It has a root.

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:56.870
It's binary, so there's a
left child and a right child.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.270
Some nodes lack a
right or left child.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.040
Some nodes lack both.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.780
Every node has a key.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.110
This is the search part.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.850
You store key in every node,
and you have this BST property,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.780
or also called the
search property,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.280
that every node-- if you
have a node the stores key x,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.599
everybody in the left subtree
stores a key that's less than

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.890
or equal to x, and everyone
that's in the right subtree

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.130
stores a key that's
greater than or equal to x.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.370
So not just the left
and right children,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.870
but every descendant way
down there is smaller than x.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.370
Every descendent way down
there is greater than x.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.370
So when you have a binary
search tree like this,

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.170
if you want to know
the sorted order,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.469
you do what's called
an in-order traversal.

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:38.260
You look at a node.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.750
You recursively
visit the left child.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.740
Then you print out the root.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.780
Then you recursively
visit the right child.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.742
So in this case, we'd
go left, left, print 11.

00:01:47.742 --> 00:01:49.130
Print 20.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.630
Go right.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.130
Go left.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.000
Print 26.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.980
Print 29.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.620
Go up.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.780
Print 41.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.500
Go right.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.640
Print 50.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.630
Print 65.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.450
Then check that's
in sorted order.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.180
If you're not familiar
with in-order traversal,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.240
look at the textbook.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.350
It's a very simple operation.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.850
I'm not going to talk
about it more here,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.750
except we're going to use it.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.030
All right, we'll get to the
topic of today's lecture

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.620
in a moment, which is balance.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.220
What we saw in last
lecture and recitation

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.220
is that these
basic binary search

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.509
trees, where when you insert
a node you just walk down

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.050
the tree to find where that item
fits-- like if you're trying

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.360
to insert 30, you go left here,
go right here, go right here,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.460
and say, oh 30 fits here.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.440
Let's put 30 there.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.420
If you keep doing that,
you can do insert.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.560
You can do delete.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.336
You can do these
kinds of searches,

00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:40.750
which we saw, finding
the next larger element

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.352
or finding the next
smaller element, also known

00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:44.560
as successor and predecessor.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.850
These are actually the typical
names for those operations.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.520
You can solve them
in order h time.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.290
Anyone remember what h was?

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.150
The height.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.790
Yeah, good.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.460
The height of the tree.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:04.800
So h is the height of the BST.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.560
What is the height of the tree?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.914
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:09.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.538
PROFESSOR: Log n?

00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:13.210
Log n would be great,
but not always.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.530
So this is the issue
of being balance.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.870
So in an ideal
world, your tree's

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.190
going to look
something like this.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.230
I've drawn this picture probably
the most in my academic career.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.180
This is a nice, perfectly
balanced binary search tree.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.690
The height is log n.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.580
This would be the balance case.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.680
I mean, roughly log n.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.380
Let's just put theta
to be approximate.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.560
But as we saw at the
end of last class,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.020
you can have a very unbalanced
tree, which is just a path.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.657
And there the height is n.

00:03:57.657 --> 00:03:58.990
What's the definition of height?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.615
That's actually what
I was looking for.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.587
Should be 6.042 material.

00:04:05.587 --> 00:04:06.581
Yeah?

00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:08.569
AUDIENCE: Is it the
length of the longest path

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:09.827
always going down?

00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:12.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah, length of the
longest path always going down.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.610
So length of the longest path
from the root to some leaf.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.910
That's right.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.060
OK, so this is--

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.520
I highlight this
because we're going

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.840
to be working a lot
with height today.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.840
All that's happening here, all
of the paths are length log n.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.829
Here, there is a
path of length n.

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:49.120
Some of them are shorter,
but in fact, the average path

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.710
is n over 2.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.840
It's really bad.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.790
So this is very unbalanced.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.920
I'll put "very."

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.590
It's not a very formal
term, but that's

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.170
like the worst case for BSTs.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.730
This is good.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.650
This does have a
formal definition.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:15.410
We call a tree balanced if
the height is order log n.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.250
So you're storing n keys.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.970
If your height is
always order log n,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.130
we get a constant factor here.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.430
Here, it's basically exactly
log n, 1 times log n.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.930
It's always going to
be at least log n,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.426
because if you're storing
n things in a binary tree,

00:05:31.426 --> 00:05:33.050
you need to have
height at least log n.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.170
So in fact, it will be theta
log n if your tree is balanced.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.540
And today's goal is
to always maintain

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.760
that your trees are balanced.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.690
And we're going to do
that using the structure

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.840
called AVL trees, which
I'll define in a moment.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.630
They're the original
way people found

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.980
to keep trees balanced
back in the '60s,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.720
but they're still
kind of the simplest.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.678
There are lots of ways
to keep a tree balanced,

00:05:56.678 --> 00:05:59.700
so I'll mention some other
balance trees later on.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.910
In particular, your textbook
covers two other ways to do it.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.720
It does not cover AVL
trees, so pay attention.

00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:14.390
One more thing I
wanted to define.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:20.230
We talked about the
height of the tree,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:27.350
but I'd also like to talk about
the height of a node in a tree.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.030
Can anyone define this for me?

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.880
Yeah?

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.522
AUDIENCE: It's the level
that the node is at.

00:06:38.522 --> 00:06:40.230
PROFESSOR: The level
that the node is at.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.254
That is roughly right.

00:06:41.254 --> 00:06:42.170
I mean, that is right.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.513
It's all about, what
is the level of a node?

00:06:44.513 --> 00:06:48.424
AUDIENCE: Like how many
levels of children it has.

00:06:48.424 --> 00:06:50.340
PROFESSOR: How many
levels of children it has.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.830
That's basically right, yeah.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.110
AUDIENCE: The distance
from it to the root.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.776
PROFESSOR: Distance
from it to the root.

00:06:55.776 --> 00:06:56.930
That would be the depth.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.180
So depth is counting from above.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.960
Height is--

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.928
PROFESSOR: Yes, longest path
from that node to the leaf.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.856
Note that's why I wrote
this definition actually,

00:07:11.856 --> 00:07:12.832
to give you a hint.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:27.000
Here I should probably
say down to be precise.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.026
You're not allowed to
go up in these paths.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.485
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:38.485 --> 00:07:39.447
All right.

00:07:39.447 --> 00:07:40.890
Sorry.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.450
I've got to learn how to throw.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:42.950
All right.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.495
So for example, over here I'm
going to write depths in red.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.820
If you're taking notes it's OK.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.490
Don't worry.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.480
So length off the longest
path from it down to a leaf.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.740
Well, this is a leaf,
so its height is 0.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.894
OK.

00:08:01.894 --> 00:08:04.960
Yeah, I'll just
leave it at that.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.000
It takes 0 steps to get
from a leaf to a leaf.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.260
This guy's not a leaf.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:16.900
It has a child, but it has a
path of length one to a leaf.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.580
So it's one.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.630
This guy has a choice.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.830
You could go left and you
get a path of length 1,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.720
or you could go right and
get a path of length 2.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.490
We take the max, so
this guy has height 2.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.250
This node has height 1.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.620
This node has height 3.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.872
How do you compute
the height of a node?

00:08:40.872 --> 00:08:42.479
Anyone?

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:43.419
Yeah.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.544
AUDIENCE: Max of the height
of the children plus 1.

00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:46.252
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:08:46.252 --> 00:08:48.330
You take the max of the
height of the children.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.700
Here, 2 and 1.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.730
Max is 2.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.540
Add 1.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.770
You get 3.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.110
So it's going to always
be-- this is just a formula.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:06.640
The height of the
left child maxed

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:17.860
with the height of the
right child plus 1.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.380
This is obviously
useful for computing.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.090
And in particular, in
lecture and recitation

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.110
last time, we saw
how to maintain

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:32.760
the size of every tree using
data structure augmentation.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.403
Data structure augmentation.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.900
And then we started with a
regular vanilla binary search

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.540
tree, and then we
maintained-- every time

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.160
we did an operation
on the tree, we also

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.060
updated the size of
the subtree rooted

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.260
at that node, the size field.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.720
Here, I want to
store a height field,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.170
and because I have this nice
local rule that tells me

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.411
how to compute the height
of a node using just

00:09:59.411 --> 00:10:01.910
local information-- the height
of its left child, the height

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.750
of its right child.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.287
Do a constant
amount of work here.

00:10:06.287 --> 00:10:07.370
There's a general theorem.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.180
Whenever you have a
nice local formula

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.300
like this for updating
your information in terms

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.010
of your children,
then you can maintain

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.890
it using constant overhead.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.500
So we can store the height
of every node for free.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.390
Why do I care?

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.310
Because AVL trees are going to
use the heights of the nodes.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.260
Our goal is to keep
the heights small.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.750
We don't want this.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.200
We want this.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.260
So a natural thing to
do is store the heights.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.100
When they get too big, fix it.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.550
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.363
Maybe one more thing to mention
over here for convenience.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.360
Leaves, for example, have
children that are-- I mean,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.550
they have null pointers to
their left and right children.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.250
You could draw them
explicitly like this.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.920
Also some nodes just
lack a single child.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.360
I'm going to define the
depths of these things

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.590
to be negative 1.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.270
This will be
convenient later on.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.070
Why negative 1?

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.874
Because then this formula works.

00:11:24.874 --> 00:11:26.040
You can just think about it.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.185
Like leaves, for example,
have two children,

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:29.060
which are negative 1.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.750
You take the max.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.250
You add 1.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.460
You get 0.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.505
So that just makes
things work out.

00:11:33.505 --> 00:11:35.380
We don't normally draw
these in the pictures,

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.190
but it's convenient that I don't
have to do special cases when

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.096
the left child doesn't exist and
the right child doesn't exist.

00:11:42.096 --> 00:11:43.470
You could either
do special cases

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.910
or you could make
this definition.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.510
Up to you.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.780
OK.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.535
AVL trees.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.930
So the idea with an AVL
tree is the following.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.211
We'd like to keep the
height order log n.

00:12:39.211 --> 00:12:41.710
It's a little harder to think
about keeping the height order

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.110
log n than it is to think
about keeping the tree balance,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.095
meaning the left and right
sides are more or less equal.

00:12:49.095 --> 00:12:50.970
In this case, we're
going to think about them

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.720
as being more or
less equal in height.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.280
You could also think
about them being

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.600
more or less equal
in subtree size.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.640
That would also work.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.020
It's a different
balanced search tree.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.610
Height is kind of the
easiest thing to work with.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.570
So if we have a node,
it has a left subtree.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.670
It has a right subtree,
which we traditionally

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.310
draw as triangles.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.456
This subtree has a height.

00:13:13.456 --> 00:13:17.440
We'll call it HL for left.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.710
By the height of the subtree,
I mean the height of its root.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.280
And the right subtree
has some height, r.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.860
I've drawn them as the
same, but in general they

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.260
might be different.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.250
And what we would like
is that h sub l and h

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.890
sub r are more or less the same.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.670
They differ by at
most an additive 1.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:41.240
So if I look at h sub l minus
h sub r in absolute value,

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.690
this is at most
1, for every node.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.780
So I have some node x.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.370
For every node x, I want
the left and right subtrees

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.410
to be almost balanced.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.840
Now, I could say
differ by at most 0,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.030
that the left and right have
exactly the same heights.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.290
That's difficult,
because that really

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.130
forces you to have
exactly the perfect tree.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:07.900
And in fact, it's not even
possible for odd n or even n

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.280
or something.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.810
Because at the very
end you're going

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.750
to have one missing child, and
then you're unbalanced there.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.070
So 0's just not
possible to maintain,

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.400
but 1 is almost as
good, hopefully.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.950
We're going to prove
that in a second.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:30.060
And it turns out to be easy
to maintain in log n time.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.205
So let's prove some stuff.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:43.525
So first claim is that
AVL trees are balanced.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.000
Balanced, remember, means
that the height of them

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.820
is always order log n.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.300
So we're just going to assume
for now that we can somehow

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.850
achieve this property.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.100
We want to prove that it
implies that the height is

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.730
at most some
constant times log n.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.740
We know it's at
least log n, but also

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.460
like it to be not much bigger.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.040
So what do you think
is the worst case?

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.020
Say I have n nodes.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.370
How could I make the
tree as high as possible?

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.570
Or conversely, if I have
a particular height,

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.600
how could I make it have
as few nodes as possible?

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.790
That'd be like the
sparsest, the least balanced

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:30.870
situation for AVL trees.

00:15:34.488 --> 00:15:34.988
Yeah?

00:15:34.988 --> 00:15:37.154
AUDIENCE: You could have
one node on the last level.

00:15:37.154 --> 00:15:39.740
PROFESSOR: One node on the last
level, yeah, in particular.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.690
Little more.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.960
What do the other
levels look like?

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.680
That is correct, but I want
to know the whole tree.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.490
It's hard to explain
the tree, but you

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.240
can explain the core
property of the tree.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:55.703
Yeah?

00:15:55.703 --> 00:15:56.619
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:00.310
PROFESSOR: For every
node, let's make

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.730
the right side have a height of
one larger than the left side.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.270
I think that's worth a cushion.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.450
See if I can throw better.

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:12.862
Good catch.

00:16:12.862 --> 00:16:14.830
Better than hitting your eye.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.539
So I'm going to not
prove this formally,

00:16:22.539 --> 00:16:24.580
but I think if you stare
at this long enough it's

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.000
pretty obvious.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.809
Worst case is when-- there
are multiple worst cases,

00:16:32.809 --> 00:16:34.350
because right and
left are symmetric.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.680
We don't really care.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.040
But let's say that
the right subtree

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:52.350
has height one more than
the left for every node.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.780
OK, this is a little
tricky to draw.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.087
Not even sure I want
to try to draw it.

00:17:03.087 --> 00:17:04.670
But you basically
draw it recursively.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.550
So, OK, somehow I've
figured out this

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.089
where the height
difference here is 1.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.260
Then I take two copies of it.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.220
It's like a fractal.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.569
You should know all
about fractals by now.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.849
Problem set two.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.548
And then you just-- well,
that's not quite right.

00:17:20.548 --> 00:17:22.589
In fact, I need to somehow
make this one a little

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:28.700
bit taller and then
glue these together.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.330
Little tricky.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.010
Let's not even try
to draw the tree.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.880
Let's just imagine
this is possible.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.740
It is possible.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.190
And instead, I'm going
to use mathematics

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.160
to understand how
high that tree is.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.070
Or actually, it's
a little easier

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.200
to think about-- let
me get this right.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.350
It's so easy that I
have to look at my notes

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.550
to remember what to write.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.460
Really, no problem.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.760
All right, so I'm
going to define n sub h

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:08.580
is the minimum number
of nodes that's

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:15.690
possible in an AVL
tree of height h.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.090
This is sort of the inverse
of what we care about,

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.440
but if we can solve the
inverse, we can solve the thing.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.640
What we really care about
is, for n nodes, how large

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.390
can the height be?

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.232
We want to prove
that's order log n.

00:18:31.232 --> 00:18:33.690
But it'll be a lot easier to
think about the reverse, which

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.245
is, if I fix the height to
be h, what's the fewest nodes

00:18:37.245 --> 00:18:38.590
that I can pack in?

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.060
Because for the very unbalanced
tree, I have a height of n,

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.540
and I only need to put n nodes.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.300
That would be really bad.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:54.090
What I prefer is a situation
like this, where with height h,

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.360
I have to put in
2 to the h nodes.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.100
That would be perfect balance.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.840
Any constant to the h will do.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.234
So when you take the
inverse, you get a log.

00:19:02.234 --> 00:19:03.650
OK, we'll get to
that in a moment.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.960
How should we analyze n sub h?

00:19:20.163 --> 00:19:21.400
I hear something.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:21.900
Yeah?

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:27.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] 2 to
the h minus 1 [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:40.900
PROFESSOR: Maybe, but I don't
think that will quite work out.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.239
Any-- yeah?

00:19:47.239 --> 00:19:50.592
AUDIENCE: So you have only
1 node in the last level,

00:19:50.592 --> 00:19:55.861
so it would be 1/2
to the h plus 1.

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:58.500
PROFESSOR: That turns out
to be approximately correct,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.050
but I don't know where you
got 1/2 to the h plus 1.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:04.710
It's not exactly correct.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.490
I'll tell you that, so that
your analysis isn't right.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.612
It's a lot easier.

00:20:09.612 --> 00:20:11.320
You guys are worried
about the last level

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.816
and actually what the tree looks
like, but in fact, all you need

00:20:13.816 --> 00:20:14.316
is this.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.024
All you need is love, yeah.

00:20:20.024 --> 00:20:20.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.517
PROFESSOR: No, it's not a half.

00:20:22.517 --> 00:20:23.600
It's a different constant.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:23.960
Yeah?

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.570
AUDIENCE: Start with base cases
and write a recursive formula.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.270
PROFESSOR: Ah,
recursive formula.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.169
Good.

00:20:29.169 --> 00:20:30.460
You said start with base cases.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.860
I always forget that part, so
it's good that you remember.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.120
You should start
with the base case,

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.036
but I'm not going to
worry about the base case

00:20:36.036 --> 00:20:37.210
because it won't matter.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:40.330
Because I know the base case
is always going to be n order 1

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.710
is order 1.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.550
So for algorithms,
that's usually all

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.690
you need for base case, but it's
good that you think about it.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.640
What I was looking for
is recursive formula,

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.740
aka, recurrence.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.840
So can someone tell me--
maybe even you-- could tell me

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.690
a recurrence for n sub h,
in terms of n sub smaller h?

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.145
Yeah?

00:21:01.145 --> 00:21:02.630
AUDIENCE: 1 plus [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.480
PROFESSOR: 1 plus
n sub h minus 1.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.320
Not quite.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.196
Yeah?

00:21:15.196 --> 00:21:19.170
AUDIENCE: N sub h minus
1 plus n sub h minus 2.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.365
PROFESSOR: N plus-- do
you want the 1 plus?

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:25.720
AUDIENCE: I don't think so.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.560
PROFESSOR: You do.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.040
It's a collaboration.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.470
To combine your
two answers, this

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.720
should be the correct formula.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.980
Let me double check.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.260
Yes, whew.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:35.760
Good.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.050
OK, why?

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.900
Because the one thing we know is
that our tree looks like this.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.130
The total height here is h.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.260
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.050
How many nodes are in
this tree of height h?

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:57.660
Well, the height is the
max of the two directions.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.260
So that means that the
larger has height h minus 1,

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.860
because the longest
path to a leaf

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.750
is going to be down this way.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.110
What's the height of this?

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.140
Well, it's one less
than the height of this.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.270
So it's going to be h minus 2.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:17.550
This is where the n sub h minus
1 plus n sub h minus 2 come in.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.400
But there's also this node.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.580
It doesn't actually make a big
difference in this recurrence.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.940
This is the exponential part.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.370
This is like itty bitty thing.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.080
But it matters for the
base case is pretty much

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.850
where it matters.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:31.920
Back to your base case.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.500
There's one guy here, plus
all the nodes on the left,

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.410
plus all the nodes on the right.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.110
And for whatever
reason, I put the left

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.804
over here and the
right over here.

00:22:41.804 --> 00:22:43.720
And of course, you could
reverse this picture.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.380
It doesn't really matter.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.620
You get the same formula.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.200
That's the point.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.250
So this is the recurrence.

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.370
Now we need to solve it.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.070
What we would like is
for it to be exponential,

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.830
because that means there's a
lot of nodes in a height h AVL

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.780
tree.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.460
So any suggestions on
how we could figure out

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.290
this recurrence?

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.275
Does it look like anything
you've seen before?

00:23:06.275 --> 00:23:07.460
AUDIENCE: Fibonacci.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.335
PROFESSOR: Fibonacci.

00:23:08.335 --> 00:23:09.930
It's almost Fibonacci.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.290
If I hid this plus 1,
which you wanted to do,

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.210
then it would be
exactly Fibonacci.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:21.190
Well, that's actually good,
because in particular, n sub h

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.620
is bigger than Fibonacci.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.220
If you add one at
every single level,

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.050
the certainly you
get something bigger

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.560
than the base
Fibonacci sequence.

00:23:31.479 --> 00:23:33.520
Now, hopefully you know
Fibonacci is exponential.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:40.570
I have an exact formula.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.990
If you take the golden ratio to
the power h, divide by root 5,

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.600
and round to the
nearest integer,

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.320
you get exactly the
Fibonacci number.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.307
Crazy stuff.

00:23:53.307 --> 00:23:54.890
We don't need to
know why that's true.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.800
Just take it as fact.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.292
And conveniently phi
is bigger than 1.

00:23:59.292 --> 00:24:00.750
You don't need to
remember what phi

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.240
is, except it is bigger than 1.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.900
And so this is an
exponential bound.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.560
This is good news.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:13.160
So I'll tell you
it's about 1.618.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.420
And so we get is that--
if we invert this,

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:21.410
this says n sub h is bigger
than some phi to the h.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.334
This is our n, basically.

00:24:23.334 --> 00:24:24.750
What we really
want to know is how

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:29.420
h relates to n, which is
just inverting this formula.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.090
So we have, on the
other hand, the phi

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:37.260
to the h divided by
root 5 is less than n.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.720
So I got a log base
phi on both sides.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.640
Seems like a good thing to do.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.200
This is actually quite annoying.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.210
I've got h minus a
tiny little thing.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:25:01.920
It's less than
log base phi of n.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:08.900
And I will tell you that is
about 1.440 times log base 2

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.700
of n, because after all,
log base 2 is what computer

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.800
scientists care about.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.690
So just to put it
into perspective.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.170
We want it to be
theta log base 2 of n.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.370
And here's the bound.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.532
The height is always less
than 1.44 times log n.

00:25:23.532 --> 00:25:24.990
All we care about
is some constant,

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.800
but this is a pretty
good constant.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.900
We'd like one.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.040
There are binary search tress
that achieve 1, plus very,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:39.360
very tiny thing, arbitrarily
tiny, but this is pretty good.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.830
Now, if you don't know
Fibonacci numbers,

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.810
I pull a rabbit out of a hat
and I've got this phi to the h.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.530
It's kind of magical.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.055
There's a much easier way
to analyze this recurrence.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:57.810
I'll just tell you because
it's good to know but not

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:58.550
super critical.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.830
So we have this
recurrence, n sub h.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.110
This is the computer scientist
way to solve the recurrence.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.190
We don't care about
the constants.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.940
This is the theoretical
computer scientist

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.450
way to solve this recurrence.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:25.700
We don't care about constants.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.020
And so we say, aw, this is hard.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.610
I've got n sub h minus
1 and n sub h minus 2.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.360
So asymmetric.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.900
Let's symmetrify.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.030
Could I make them
both n sub h minus 1.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.440
Or could I make them
both n sub h minus 2?

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.920
Suggestions?

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.220
PROFESSOR: Minus
2 is the right way

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.130
to go because I want to know n
sub h is greater than something

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.400
in order to get a
less than down here.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.210
By the way, I use that
log is monatomic here,

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.770
but it is, so we're good.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.080
So this is going to
be greater than 1

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.880
plus 2 times n sub h minus 2.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.432
Because if I have
a larger height

00:27:10.432 --> 00:27:11.640
I'm going to have more nodes.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.140
That's an easy
proof by induction.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.120
So I can combine
these into one term.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.910
It's simpler.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.040
I can get rid of this 1 because
that only makes things bigger.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.960
So I just have this.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.800
OK, now I need a
base case, but this

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.800
looks like 2 the something.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.190
What's the something?

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.190
H over 2.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.330
So I'll just write theta
to avoid the base case.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.180
2 to the h over 2.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.780
Every two steps of h, I
get another factor of 2.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.970
So when you invert
and do the log,

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:50.130
this means that h is also
less than log base 2 of n.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.690
Log base 2 because of that.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.060
Factor 2 out here
because of that factor 2

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.000
when you take the log.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.730
And so the real answer is 1.44.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.190
This is the correct--
this is the worst case.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.780
But it's really easy to prove
that it's, at most, 2 log n.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.540
So keep this in
mind in case we ask

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.840
you to analyze
variance of AVL trees,

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.900
like in problem set three.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.960
This is the easy way
to do it and just get

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.070
some constant times log n.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.600
Clear?

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.590
All right, so that's AVL
trees, why they're balanced.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:27.070
And so if we can
achieve this property,

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:30.090
that the left and right subtrees
have about the same height,

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.890
we'll be done.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.370
So how the heck do we
maintain that property?

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.810
Let's go over here.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.580
Mobius trees are
supposed to support

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.270
a whole bunch of operations,
but in particular, insert

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.130
and delete.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:09.060
I'm just going to worry
about insert today.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.410
Delete is almost identical.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.340
And it's in the code that
corresponds to this lecture,

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.420
so you can take a look at it.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.380
Very, very similar.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.930
Let's start with insert.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:33.190
Well, it's pretty
straightforward.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.390
Our algorithm is as follows.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:42.780
We do the simple BST insertion,
which we already saw,

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.280
which is you walk down the tree
to find where that key fits.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.950
You search for that key.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.830
And wherever it isn't,
you insert a node there,

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.010
insert a new leaf,
and add it in.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.690
Now, this will not
preserve the AVL property.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.000
So the second step is
fix the AVL property.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.520
And there's a nice concise
description of AVL insertion.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.700
Of course, how do you do step
two is the interesting part.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.440
All right, maybe let's
start with an example.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.380
That could be fun.

00:30:22.296 --> 00:30:24.695
Hey, look, here's an example.

00:30:24.695 --> 00:30:26.070
And to match the
notes, I'm going

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:33.230
to do insert 23 as
a first example.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.720
OK, I'm also going to annotate
this tree a little bit.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.160
So I said we store
the heights, but what

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.370
I care about is which height is
larger, the left or the right.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.090
In fact, you could
just store that,

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.830
just store whether
it's plus 1, minus 1,

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.270
or 0, the difference between
left and right sides.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.840
So I'm going to draw that
with a little icon, which

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.740
is a left arrow, a
descending left arrow if this

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.748
is the bigger side.

00:30:59.748 --> 00:31:01.910
And this is a right arrow.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:02.730
This is even.

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.330
Left and right are the same.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.420
Here, the left is heavier,
or higher, I guess.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.240
Here it's even.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.720
Here it's left.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.580
This is AVL, because
it's only one

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.010
heavier wherever
I have an arrow.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.220
OK, now I insert 23.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:24.030
23 belongs-- it's less than 41,
greater than 20, less than 29,

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.140
less than 26.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.800
So it belongs here.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.319
Here's 23, a brand-new node.

00:31:31.319 --> 00:31:32.610
OK, now all the heights change.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:36.680
And it's annoying to draw
what the heights are,

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.150
but I'll do it.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.320
This one changes to 1.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.370
This is 0.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.850
This changes to 2.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:46.450
This changes to 3.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.160
This changes to 4.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.890
Anyway, never mind
what the heights are.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:53.960
What's bad is, well,
this guy's even.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.590
This guy's left heavy.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.090
This guy's now
doubly left heavy.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.650
Bad news.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.410
OK, let's not worry
about above that.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.510
Let's just start.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.270
The algorithm is going
to walk up the tree

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:08.220
and say, oh, when do
I get something bad?

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.650
So now I have 23,
26, 29 in a path.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.840
I'd like to fix it.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.023
Hmm, how to fix it?

00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:21.500
I don't think we know how to
fix it, so I will tell you how.

00:32:26.824 --> 00:32:28.240
Actually, I wasn't
here last week.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.480
So did we cover rotations?

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.360
AUDIENCE: No.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.480
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.820
Then you don't know.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.540
Let me tell you about rotations.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.310
Super cool.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.180
It's just a tool.

00:33:12.598 --> 00:33:14.398
That's x and y.

00:33:21.254 --> 00:33:22.420
I always get these mixed up.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:33.255
So this is called
left rotate of x.

00:33:37.342 --> 00:33:39.800
OK, so here's the thing we can
do with binary search trees.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.636
It's like the only
thing you need to know.

00:33:41.636 --> 00:33:43.680
Because you've got search
in binary search trees

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.210
and you've got rotations.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.877
So when I have a tree like this,
I've highlighted two nodes,

00:33:48.877 --> 00:33:50.960
and then there's the
children hanging off of them.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.390
Some of these might be
empty, but they're trees,

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.510
so we draw them as triangles.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.810
If I just do this,
which is like changing

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.980
which is higher, x or y, and
whatever the parent of x was

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.160
becomes the parent of y.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.650
And vice versa, in fact.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.340
The parent of y was x, and
now the parent of x is y.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:14.030
OK, the parent of a is still x.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.270
The parent of b changes.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.120
It used to be y.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.510
Now it's x.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.230
The parent of c was y.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:20.370
It's still y.

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.000
So in a constant number
of pointer changes,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.663
I can go from this to this.

00:34:24.663 --> 00:34:25.870
This is constant time.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.380
And more importantly, it
satisfies the BST order

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.070
property.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.469
If you do an in-order
traversal of this,

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:39.095
you will get a, x, b, y, c.

00:34:42.437 --> 00:34:46.778
If I do an in-order traversal
over here, I get a, x, b, y, c.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.110
So they're the same.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.139
So it still has BST ordering.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:55.330
You can check more formally.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.570
b has all the nodes
between x and y.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:01.400
Still all the nodes
between x and y, and so on.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.840
You can check it at
home, but this works.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.256
We call it a left rotate because
the root moves to the left.

00:35:08.256 --> 00:35:10.130
You can go straight back
where you came from.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.310
This would be a
right rotate of y.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.580
OK, it's a reversible operation.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.190
It lets you manipulate the tree.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.970
So when we have this
picture and we're

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:26.450
really sad because this
looks like a mess, what

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.810
we'd like to do is fix it.

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:31.050
This is a path of three nodes.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:34.445
We'd really prefer
it to look like this.

00:35:34.445 --> 00:35:37.660
If we could make that
transformation, we'd be happy.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.740
And we can.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:44.085
It is a right rotate of 29.

00:35:44.085 --> 00:35:45.460
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.700
So let me quickly copy.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.810
I want to rotate 29
to the right, which

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.930
means 29 and 26-- this is x.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.030
This is y.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:24.250
I turn them, and so
I get 26 here now,

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.100
and 29 is the new right child.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.600
And then whatever
was the left child

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.570
of x becomes the left
child of x in the picture.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:32.640
You can check it.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.790
So this used to
be the triangle a.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:38.830
And in this case,
it's just the node 23.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.385
And we are happy.

00:36:40.385 --> 00:36:42.470
Except I didn't
draw the whole tree.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:46.250
Now we're happy because
we have an AVL tree again.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.250
Good news.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.310
So just check.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.970
This is even.

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.000
This is right heavy.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.970
This is even.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:56.360
This is left heavy still.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.530
This is left heavy,
even, even, even.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:07.325
OK, so now we have an AVL tree
and our beauty is restored.

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:08.640
I'll do one more example.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:16.755
Insert 55.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:24.690
We want to insert 55 here.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.850
And what changes is
now this is even.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.990
This is right heavy.

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.180
This is doubly left heavy.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.500
We're super sad.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.320
And then we don't look
above that until later.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:48.240
This is more
annoying, because you

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.570
look at this thing,
this little path.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.360
It's a zigzag path, if you will.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.370
If I do a right rotation
where this is x and this

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:03.260
is y, what I'll get is
x, y, and then this is b.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.090
This is what's in
between x and y.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.510
And so it'll go here.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:11.510
And now it's a zag zig
path, which is no better.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.390
The height's the same.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:14.040
And we're sad.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:19.660
I told you, though,
that somehow rotations

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:20.760
are all we need to do.

00:38:24.086 --> 00:38:25.050
What can I do?

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:31.140
How could I fix
this little zigzag?

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.110
Just need to think
about those three nodes,

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:35.900
but all I give
you are rotations.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.400
AUDIENCE: Perhaps rotate 50.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.620
PROFESSOR: Maybe rotate 50.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.130
That seems like a good idea.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:41.808
Let's try it.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.420
If you don't mind, I'm
just going to write 41,

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.790
and then there's all
the stuff on the left.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:49.990
Now we rotate 50.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:53.190
So 65 remains where it is.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.810
And we rotate 50 to the left.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.050
So 50 and its child.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.550
This is x.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.320
This is y.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.735
And so I get 55 and I get 50.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.710
Now, this is bad from
an AVL perspective.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:13.470
This is still doubly left
heavy, this is left heavy,

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.820
and this is even.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.690
But it looks like this case.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:22.460
And so now I can do a
right rotation on 65,

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:27.090
and I will get-- so let me
order the diagrams here.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.480
I do a right rotate on
65, and I will get 41.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.260
And to the right I get 55.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.012
And to the right I get 65.

00:39:37.012 --> 00:39:38.805
To the left I get 50.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.600
And then I get the left subtree.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.400
And so now this is
even, even, even.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.950
Wow.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.140
How high was left subtree?

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.780
I think it's still left heavy.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.850
Cool.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.600
This is what some people
call double rotation,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.370
but I like to call
it two rotations.

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:03.687
It's whatever you prefer.

00:40:03.687 --> 00:40:05.020
It's not really a new operation.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.790
It's just doing two rotations.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.010
So that's an example.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:09.460
Let's do the general case.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.164
It's no harder.

00:40:11.164 --> 00:40:13.330
You might say, oh, gosh,
why do you do two examples?

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.750
Well, because they
were different.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.541
And they're are two
cases on the algorithm.

00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:18.190
You need to know both of them.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.161
OK, so AVL insert.

00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:21.660
Here we go.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.700
Fix AVL property.

00:40:33.459 --> 00:40:42.500
I'm just going to call this
from the changed node up.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.900
So the one thing that's
missing from these examples

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.160
is that you might have to
do more than two rotations.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.090
What we did was look at the
lowest violation of the AVL

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:52.524
property and we fixed it.

00:40:52.524 --> 00:40:53.940
When we do that,
there's still may

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.840
be violations higher up,
because when you add a node,

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.620
you change the height
of this subtree,

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.911
the height of this subtree,
the height of this subtree,

00:41:02.911 --> 00:41:04.840
and the height of this
subtree, potentially.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.170
What happened in these
cases when I was done,

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.667
what I did fixed one violation.

00:41:08.667 --> 00:41:09.500
They were all fixed.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.920
But in general, there might be
several violations up the tree.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.510
So that's what we do.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.000
Yeah, I'll leave it at that.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:33.785
So suppose x is the lowest
node that is not AVL.

00:41:40.879 --> 00:41:42.920
The way we find that node
is we start at the node

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.040
that we changed.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.800
We check if that's OK.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.900
We update the heights as we
go up using our simple rule.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:55.120
And that's actually not our
simple rule, but it's erased.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.625
We update the height based on
the heights of its children.

00:41:57.625 --> 00:41:59.000
And you keep
walking up until you

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.010
see, oh, the left is twice,
two times-- or not two times,

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.870
but plus 2 larger than
the left, or vice versa.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:10.230
Then you say, oh, that's bad.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.980
And so we fix it.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.060
Yeah, question.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.895
AUDIENCE: So here we
continue to [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:16.895 --> 00:42:17.520
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.436
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:23.102 --> 00:42:27.476
add n to the level
[INAUDIBLE] than 1.

00:42:27.476 --> 00:42:30.890
So add [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:34.250
PROFESSOR: AVL property's
not about levels.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.000
It's about left subtrees
and right subtrees.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.720
So the trouble is that 65--
you have a left subtree, which

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:44.250
has height 2-- or sorry,
height 1, I guess--

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:47.380
because the longest path
from here to a leaf is 1.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.630
The right subtree
has height negative 1

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.750
because it doesn't exist.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:51.810
So it's one versus negative 1.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.351
So that's why there's
a double arrow.

00:42:53.351 --> 00:42:54.140
Yeah, good to ask.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.030
It's weird with the negative 1s.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.560
That's also why I wanted to
define those negative 1s to be

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.420
there, so the AVL property
is easier to state.

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.180
Other questions?

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.570
All right.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:08.070
Good.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.810
I think I want a
symmetry assumption here.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.050
I don't know why I
wrote right of x.

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:28.810
I guess in modern days
we write x dot right.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:31.020
Same thing.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:34.090
OK, I'm going to assume that
the right child is the heavier

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.350
one like we did before.

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:38.120
Could be the left.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.431
It's symmetric.

00:43:39.431 --> 00:43:40.180
It doesn't matter.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:58.700
So now there are two
cases, like I said.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.240
I'm going to use
this term right heavy

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.490
because it's super convenient.

00:44:22.735 --> 00:44:24.110
OK, right heavy
is what I've been

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.040
drawing by a
descending right arrow.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.280
Balance is what I've been
drawing by a horizontal line.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.440
OK, so we're just distinguishing
between these two cases.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:36.000
This turns out to
be the easy case.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.227
So we have x, y, a, b, c.

00:44:43.227 --> 00:44:44.810
Why are we looking
at the right child?

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:47.730
Because we assumed that the
right one is higher, so that x

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.380
was right heavy.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.190
So this subtree as I've drawn
it is higher than the left one

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:55.040
by 2, in fact.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.800
And what we do in this
case is right rotate of x.

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:07.162
And so we get x, y, a, b, c.

00:45:07.162 --> 00:45:09.370
I could have drawn this no
matter what case we're in,

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:12.150
so we need to check
this actually works.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:13.350
That's the interesting part.

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:15.170
And that's over here.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.450
OK, so I said x is right
heavy, in fact doubly so.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:25.250
y is either right
heavy or balanced.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:28.260
Let's start with right heavy.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:33.710
So when we do this rotation,
what happens to the heights?

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:39.431
Well, it's hard to tell.

00:45:39.431 --> 00:45:41.930
It's a lot easier to think about
what the actual heights are

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:43.440
than just these arrows.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.030
So let's suppose x has height k.

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.070
That's pretty generic.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.230
And it's right
heavy, so that means

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:54.450
the y has height k minus 1.

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:58.620
And then this is right heavy,
so this has height k minus 2.

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.466
And this is something
smaller then k minus 2.

00:46:01.466 --> 00:46:03.867
In fact, because this
is AVL, we assume

00:46:03.867 --> 00:46:05.450
that x was the lowest
that is not AVL.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.500
So y is AVL.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.920
And so this is going
to be k minus 3,

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.155
and this is going to be k minus
3 because these differ by 2.

00:46:15.155 --> 00:46:17.030
You can prove by a simple
induction you never

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:21.310
get more than 2 out of whack
because we're just adding 1,

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:22.470
off by 1.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:23.900
So we got off by 2.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.280
So this is the bad situation.

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.710
Now we can just update
the heights over here.

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:32.770
So k minus 3 for a, k minus
3 for b, k minus 2 for c.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.420
Those don't change because
we didn't touch those trees,

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.050
and height is about
going down, not up.

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:43.190
And so this becomes k minus
2, and this becomes k minus 1.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:45.570
And so we changed the
height of the root,

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.460
but now you can see
that life is good.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.280
This is now balanced between
k minus 3 and k minus 3.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.810
This is now balanced between
k minus 2 and k minus 2.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.290
And now the parent of
y may be messed up,

00:46:56.290 --> 00:47:00.050
and that's why after this
we go to the parent of y,

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:02.300
see if it's messed up, but
keep working our way up.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:05.520
But it worked.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.100
And in the interest
of time, I will not

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.790
check the case
where y is balanced,

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:14.400
but it works out, too.

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.165
And see the notes.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:53.160
So the other case is
where we do two rotations.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:58.670
And in general, so here
x was doubly right heavy.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:03.010
And the else case is
when the right child

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:06.850
of x, which I'm going to
call z here, is left heavy.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:09.590
That's the one
remaining situation.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.620
You do the same
thing, and you check

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.560
that right rotating and
left rotating, which

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:18.210
makes the nice picture,
which is x, y, z,

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:22.530
actually balances everything and
you restore the AVL property.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:26.670
So again, check
the notes on that.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.375
I have a couple minutes
left, and instead I'd

00:48:29.375 --> 00:48:31.000
like to tell you a
little bit about how

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.680
this fits into big-picture land.

00:48:38.107 --> 00:48:39.440
Two things I want to talk about.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.180
One is you could
use this, of course,

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:48.670
to sort, which is, if you
want to sort n numbers,

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:54.900
you insert them and you
do in-order traversal.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.060
How long does this take?

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:05.370
In-order traversal
takes linear time.

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:08.370
That's the sense in which we're
storing things in sorted order.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:12.900
Inserting n items-- well,
each insert takes h time,

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.140
but now we're guaranteed
that h is order log n.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:20.460
So all the insertions take log
n time each, n log n total.

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.390
So this is yet another way to
sort n items in n log n time,

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:26.800
in some ways the
most powerful way.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.400
We've seen heaps, and
we've seen merge sort.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.080
They all sort.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:35.710
Heaps let you do two operations,
insert and delete min, which

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:39.750
a lot of times is all you
care about, like in p set two.

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:42.920
But these guys,
AVL trees, let you

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.130
do insert, delete,
and delete min.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.360
So they're the same
in those senses,

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.420
but we have the new
operation, which

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:56.570
is that we can do find next
larger and next smaller, aka

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:59.080
successor and predecessor.

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:06.120
So you can think about what
we call an abstract data type.

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.870
These are the operations
that you support,

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:11.260
or that you're
supposed to support.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.344
If you're into Java, you
call this an interface.

00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:16.010
But this is an
algorithmic specification

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.630
of what your data structure
is supposed to do.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:24.080
So we have operations
like insert and delete.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.632
We have operations
like find the min

00:50:26.632 --> 00:50:30.840
and things like successor
and predecessor,

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.310
or next larger, next smaller.

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:38.000
You can take any subset of these
and it's an abstract data type.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.492
Insert, delete, and min is
called a priority queue.

00:50:41.492 --> 00:50:43.440
So if you just take
these first two,

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.500
it's called a priority queue.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:49.140
And there are many
priority queues.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.310
This is a generic thing
that you might want to do.

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:55.070
And then the data
structure on the other side

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:57.020
is how you actually do it.

00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:00.040
This is the analog
of the algorithm.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.370
OK, this is the specification.

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:02.580
You want a priority queue.

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.700
One way to do it is a heap.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:08.220
Another way to do
it is an AVL tree.

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.720
You could do it
with a sorted array.

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.230
You could do lots of
sub-optimal things, too,

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.950
but in particular, heaps
get these two operations.

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:17.770
If you want all
three, you basically

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:20.010
need a balanced
binary search tree.

00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:26.010
There are probably a dozen
balanced binary search trees

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:28.680
out there, at least a dozen
balanced search trees,

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.370
not all binary.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:31.760
They all achieve log n.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.990
So it doesn't really matter.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:35.630
There are various practical
issues, constant factors,

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:36.680
things like that.

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.260
The main reason you prefer a
heap is that it's in place.

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.795
It doesn't use any extra space.

00:51:40.795 --> 00:51:42.670
Here, you've got pointers
all over the place.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:46.080
You lose a constant
factor in space.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.680
But from a theoretical
standpoint,

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.388
if you don't care
about constant factors,

00:51:49.388 --> 00:51:53.760
AVL trees are really good
because they get everything

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.680
that we've seen
so far and log n.

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.490
And I'll stop there.
