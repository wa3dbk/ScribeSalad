00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:23.535
PROFESSOR: Hey, everybody.

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:26.960
You ready to learn
some algorithms?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.350
Yeah!

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.580
Let's do it.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.540
I'm Eric Domain.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.950
You can call me Eric.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.020
And the last class, we
sort of jumped into things.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.610
We studied peak
finding and looked

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.940
at a bunch of algorithms
for peak finding

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.880
on your problem set.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.014
You've already
seen a bunch more.

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:44.430
And in this class, we're going
to do some more algorithms.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.730
Don't worry.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.670
That will be at the end.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.550
We're going to talk about
another problem, document

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.950
distance, which will be a
running example for a bunch

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.360
of topics that we
cover in this class.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.640
But before we go there, I wanted
to take a step back and talk

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.400
about, what actually
is an algorithm?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.760
What is an algorithm
allowed to do?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.702
And also deep philosophical
questions like, what is time?

00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:06.410
What is the running
time of an algorithm?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.060
How do we measure it?

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.030
And what are the rules the game?

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.120
For fun, I thought I
would first mention

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.520
where the word comes
from, the word algorithm.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.390
It comes from this guy,
a little hard to spell.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.210
Al-Khwarizmi, who is sort
of the father of algebra.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.240
He wrote this book called "The
Compendious Book on Calculation

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.740
by Completion and
Balancing" back in the day.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.420
And it was in
particular about how

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.194
to solve linear and
quadratic equations.

00:01:44.194 --> 00:01:45.360
So the beginning of algebra.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.151
I don't think he invented
those techniques.

00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:48.780
But he was sort of
the textbook writer

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.826
who wrote sort of how
people solved them.

00:01:50.826 --> 00:01:52.200
And you can think
of how to solve

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.550
those equations as
early algorithms.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.080
First, you take this number.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.970
You multiply by this.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.660
You add it or you reduce
to squares, whatever.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.100
So that's where the word
algebra comes from and also

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.690
where the word
algorithm comes from.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.715
There aren't very many
words with these roots.

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:10.580
So there you go.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.335
Some fun history.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.550
What's an algorithm?

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.870
I'll start with sort of
some informal definitions

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.070
and then the point
of this lecture.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.220
And the idea of a
model of computation

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.684
is to formally specify
what an algorithm is.

00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:30.850
I don't want to get super
technical and formal here,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.900
but I want to give
you some grounding

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.330
so when we write Python code,
when we write pseudocode,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.054
we have some idea what
things actually cost.

00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:38.970
This is a new lecture.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.470
We've never done
this before in 006.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.800
But I think it's important.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.870
So at a high level,
you can think

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.600
of an algorithm is just
a-- I'm sure you've

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.870
seen the definition before.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.789
It's a way to define computation
or computational procedure

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:58.830
for solving some problem.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.651
So whereas computer
code, I mean,

00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:08.400
it could just be running
in the background

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.566
all the time doing whatever.

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:12.000
An algorithm we think
of as having some input

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.800
and generating some output.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.770
Usually, it's to
solve some problem.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.040
You want to know is this
number prime, whatever.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.540
Question?

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.120
AUDIENCE: Can you turn up
the volume for your mic?

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.950
PROFESSOR: This microphone does
not feed into the AV system.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.066
So I shall just talk louder, OK?

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.800
And quiet the set, please.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.150
OK, so that's an algorithm.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.890
You take some input.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.320
You run it through.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.010
You compute some output.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.210
Of course, computer
code can do this too.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.140
An algorithm is basically
the mathematical analog

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.380
of a computer program.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.620
So if you want to reason about
what computer programs do,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.249
you translate it into
the world algorithms.

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:57.540
And vice versa, you want to
solve some problem-- first,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.710
you usually develop an
algorithm using mathematics,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.819
using this class.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.610
And then you convert
it into computer code.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.760
And this class is about
that transition from one

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.110
to the other.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.265
You can draw a picture
of sort of analogs.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.769
So an algorithm is a
mathematical analog

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.289
of a computer program.

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.254
A computer program is built on
top of a programming language.

00:04:24.254 --> 00:04:26.045
And it's written in a
programming language.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.760
The mathematical analog
of a programming language,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.630
what we write algorithms
in, usually we

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.890
write them in pseudocode,
which is basically

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.650
another fancy word for
structured English,

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.950
good English, whatever
you want to say.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.200
Of course, you could use
another natural language.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.140
But the idea is, you need to
express that algorithm in a way

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.610
that people can understand
and reason about formally.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.350
So that's the structured part.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.780
Pseudocode means lots
of different things.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.040
It's just sort of an abstract
how you would write down

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.630
formal specification
without necessarily being

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.739
able to actually run
it on a computer.

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:16.030
Though there's a particular
pseudocode in your textbook

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.050
which you probably
could run on a computer.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.426
A lot of it, anyway.

00:05:19.426 --> 00:05:21.050
But you don't have
to use that version.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.950
It just makes sense to humans
who do the mathematics.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.420
OK, and then ultimately, this
program runs on a computer.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.340
You all have computers,
probably in your pockets.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.130
There's an analog of a computer
in the mathematical world.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.230
And that is the
model of computation.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.560
And that's sort of the focus of
the first part of this lecture.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.850
Model of computation says what
your computer is allowed to do,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.770
what it can do in
constant time, basically?

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.460
And that's what I want
to talk about here.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:13.080
So the model of computation
specifies basically

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:28.290
what operations you
can do in an algorithm

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.180
and how much they cost.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.430
This is the what is time.

00:06:38.274 --> 00:06:39.690
So for each
operation, we're going

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.550
to specify how
much time it costs.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.680
Then the algorithm does
a bunch of operations.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.513
They're combined together
with control flow,

00:06:45.513 --> 00:06:48.060
for loops, if statements,
stuff like that which we're not

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.280
going to worry about too much.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.440
But obviously, we'll
use them a lot.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.020
And what we count is how much
do each of the operations cost.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.720
You add them up.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.094
That is the total cost
of your algorithm.

00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:00.010
So in particular, we
care mostly in this class

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.960
about running time.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.900
Each operation has a time cost.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.960
You add those up.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.400
That's running time
of the algorithm.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:14.974
OK, so let's-- I'm going to
cover two models of computation

00:07:14.974 --> 00:07:17.390
which you can just think of
as different ways of thinking.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.380
You've probably seen
them in some sense

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.650
as-- what you call them?

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.330
Styles of programming.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.450
Object oriented style of
programming, more assembly

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.530
style of programming.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.076
There's lots of different
styles of programming languages

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:33.700
which I'm not going
to talk about here.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.910
But you've see analogs if
you've seen those before.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.580
And these models
really give you a way

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.940
of structuring your
thinking about how

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.770
you write an algorithm.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.020
So they are the random access
machine and the pointer

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.010
machine.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:08:04.550
So we'll start with random
access machine, also known

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.530
as the RAM.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.459
Can someone tell me what
else RAM stands for?

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:11.750
AUDIENCE: Random Access Memory?

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.220
PROFESSOR: Random Access Memory.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.860
So this is both confusing
but also convenience.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.870
Because RAM simultaneously
stands for two things

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.135
and they mean almost the
same thing, but not quite.

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:23.010
So I guess that's more
confusing than useful.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.560
But there you go.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:31.244
So we have random access memory.

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:32.380
Oh, look at that.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.549
Fits perfectly.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.340
And so we're thinking,
this is a real--

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.130
this is-- random access memory
is over here in real computer

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.630
land.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.809
That's like, D-RAM
SD-RAM, whatever--

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:48.310
the things you buy and stick
into your motherboard, your GP,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.190
or whatever.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.076
And over here, the mathematical
analog of-- so here's,

00:08:53.076 --> 00:08:53.575
it's a RAM.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.070
Here, it's also a RAM.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.550
Here, it's a random
access machine.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.560
Here, it's a random
access memory.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.450
It's technical detail.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:09.680
But the idea is, if you look
at RAM that's in your computer,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.310
it's basically a
giant array, right?

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.090
You can go from zero
to, I don't know.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:20.080
A typical chip these days is
like four gigs in one thing.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.890
So you can go from
zero to four gigs.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.660
You can access anything in the
middle there in constant time.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.490
To access something, you
need to know where it is.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.270
That's random access memory.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.320
So that's an array.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.090
So I'll just draw a big picture.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.490
Here's an array.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.840
Now, RAM is usually
organized by words.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.890
So these are a
machine word, which

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.510
we're going to
put in this model.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.510
And then there's address zero,
address one, address two.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.150
This is the fifth word.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.070
And just keeps going.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.486
You can think of
this as infinite.

00:09:55.486 --> 00:09:57.570
Or the amount that
you use, that's

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.660
the space of your algorithm, if
you care about storage space.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.610
So that's basically it.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.000
OK, now how do we-- this is
the memory side of things.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.150
How do we actually
compute with it?

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.240
It's very simple.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:18.490
We just say, in constant time,
an algorithm can basically

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:25.160
read in or load a constant
number of words from memory,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:33.020
do a constant number of
computations on them,

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.950
and then write them out.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.150
It's usually called store.

00:10:43.539 --> 00:10:45.330
OK, it needs to know
where these words are.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:52.290
It accesses them by address.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.390
And so I guess I
should write here

00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:01.910
you have a constant number of
registers just hanging around.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.040
So you load some
words into registers.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.105
You can do some computations
on those registers.

00:11:06.105 --> 00:11:07.480
And then you can
write them back,

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.120
storing them in
locations that are

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.850
specified by your registers.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.690
So you've ever done
assembly programming,

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.510
this is what assembly
programming is like.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:20.500
And it can be rather annoying to
write algorithms in this model.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.140
But in some sense,
it is reality.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.320
This is how we think
about computers.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.780
If you ignore
things like caches,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.270
this is an accurate
model of computation

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.332
that loading,
computing, and storing

00:11:30.332 --> 00:11:32.040
all take roughly the
same amount of time.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.720
They all take constant time.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.980
You can manipulate a
whole word at a time.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.680
Now, what exactly is a word?

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.830
You know, computers these days,
it's like 32 bits or 64 bits.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.710
But we like to be a
little bit more abstract.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:51.220
A word is w bits.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.530
It's slightly annoying.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.340
And most of this class, we won't
really worry about what w is.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.280
We'll assume that
we're given as input

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.970
a bunch of things
which are words.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.720
So for example, peak finding.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.050
We're given a matrix of numbers.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.380
We didn't really say whether
they're integers or floats

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.407
or what.

00:12:06.407 --> 00:12:07.490
We don't worry about that.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.810
We just think of
them as words and we

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.560
assume that we can
manipulate those words.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.840
In particular, given two
numbers, we can compare them.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.820
Which is bigger?

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.670
And so we can determine,
is this cell in the matrix

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.950
a peak by comparing it with
its neighbors in constant time.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.479
We didn't say why it was
constant time to do that.

00:12:23.479 --> 00:12:24.520
But now you kind of know.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.160
If those things are
all words and you

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.618
can manipulate a constant number
of words in constant time,

00:12:28.618 --> 00:12:31.680
you can tell whether a number
is a peak in constant time.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.930
Some things like w should be at
least log the size of memory.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.570
Because my word should
be able to specify

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.920
an index into this array.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.231
And we might use that someday.

00:12:48.231 --> 00:12:49.730
But basically, don't
worry about it.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:50.710
Words are words.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.080
Words come in as inputs.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.720
You can manipulate
them and you don't

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.240
have to worry about
it for the most part.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.010
In unit four of
this class, we're

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.920
going to talk about, what if we
have really giant integers that

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.987
don't fit in a word?

00:13:03.987 --> 00:13:05.070
How do we manipulate them?

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.830
How do we add them,
multiply them?

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.490
So that's another topic.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.620
But most of this
class, we'll just

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.030
assume everything we're
given is one word.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.890
And it's easy to compute on.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.420
So this is a realistic
model, more or less.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.260
And it's a powerful one.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.230
But a lot of the
time, a lot of code

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.190
just doesn't use
arrays-- doesn't need it.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.540
Sometimes we need arrays,
sometimes we don't.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.920
Sometimes you feel like a
nut, sometimes you don't.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.105
So it's useful to think about
somewhat more abstract models

00:13:38.105 --> 00:13:42.120
that are not quite as
powerful but offer a simpler

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.360
way of thinking about things.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.830
For example, in
this model there's

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.884
no dynamic memory allocation.

00:13:47.884 --> 00:13:50.050
You probably know you could
implement dynamic memory

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.590
allocation because
real computers do it.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.520
But it's nice to
think about a model

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.620
where that's taken
care of for you.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.010
It's kind of like a higher
level programming abstraction.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.580
So the one is useful in this
class is the pointer machine.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.190
This basically corresponds to
object oriented programming

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:10.020
in a simple, very
simple version.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.660
So we have dynamically
allocated objects.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:30.370
And an object has a
constant number of fields.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:44.040
And a field is going to
be either a word-- so you

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.390
can think of this
as, for example,

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.470
storing an integer, one
of the input objects

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.600
or something you computed on it
or a counter, all these sorts

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.570
of things-- or a pointer.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:02.370
And that's where pointer
machine gets its name.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:09.310
A pointer is something that
points to another object

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:14.470
or has a special value
null, also known as nil,

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.870
also known as none in Python.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.860
OK, how many people have
heard about pointers before?

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.497
Who hasn't?

00:15:25.497 --> 00:15:26.330
Willing to admit it?

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.230
OK, only a few.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.770
That's good.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.020
You should have seen pointers.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.080
You may have heard
them called references.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.700
Modern languages these days
don't call them pointers

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.690
because pointers are scary.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.390
But there's a very subtle
difference between them.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.994
And this model actually
really is references.

00:15:40.994 --> 00:15:43.285
But for whatever reason, it's
called a pointer machine.

00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:45.350
It doesn't matter.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.480
The point is, you've
seem linked lists I hope.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.240
And linked lists have a
bunch of fields in each node.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.490
Maybe you've got a pointer
to the previous element,

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:00.820
a pointer to the next
element, and some value.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.550
So here's a very
simple linked list.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.050
This is what you'd call a
doubly linked list because it

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.050
has previous and next pointers.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.390
So the next pointer
points to this node.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.110
The previous pointer
points to this node.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.075
Next pointer points to null.

00:16:17.075 --> 00:16:19.940
The previous pointer
points to null, let's say.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.931
So that's a two node
doubly linked list.

00:16:21.931 --> 00:16:24.180
You presume we have a pointer
to the head of the list,

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.900
maybe a pointer to the
tail of list, whatever.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.395
So this is a structure
in the pointer machine.

00:16:29.395 --> 00:16:31.380
It's a data structure.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.790
In Python, you might
call this a named tuple,

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:38.340
or it's just an object
with three attributes,

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.090
I guess, they're
called in Python.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.340
So here we have the value.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.450
That's a word like an integer.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.160
And then some things
can be pointers

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.420
that point to other nodes.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.730
And you can create a new node.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:50.720
You can destroy a node.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.310
That's the dynamic
memory allocation.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.920
In this model, yeah,
pointers are pointers.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.220
You can't touch them.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.160
Now, you can implement this
model in a random access

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:01.900
machine.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.069
A pointer becomes an index
into this giant table.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.069
And that's more like
the pointers in C

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.762
if you've ever
written C programs.

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:11.220
Because then you
can take a pointer

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.869
and you can add one to it and
go to the next thing after that.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.744
In this model, you can
just follow a pointer.

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.057
That's all you can do.

00:17:17.057 --> 00:17:18.890
OK, following a pointer
costs constant time.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.329
Changing one of these
fields costs constant time.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.930
All the usual things you might
imagine doing to these objects

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.609
take constant time.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.755
So it's actually a weaker
model than this one.

00:17:29.755 --> 00:17:31.630
Because you could
implement a pointer machine

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.741
with a random access machine.

00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:35.490
But it offers a different
way of thinking.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.323
A lot of data structures
are built this way.

00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:40.205
Cool.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.130
So that's the theory side.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.510
What I'd like to talk about
next is actually in Python,

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:53.520
what's a reasonable
model of what's going on?

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.160
So these are old models.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.970
This goes back to the '80s.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.312
This one probably '80s or '70s.

00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:00.770
So they've been
around a long time.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.120
People have used them forever.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.872
Python is obviously much
more recent, at least

00:18:04.872 --> 00:18:05.955
modern versions of Python.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.790
And it's the model of
computation in some sense

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.200
that we use in this class.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.200
Because we're implementing
everything in Python.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.610
And Python offers both a random
access machine perspective

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.430
because it has arrays, and
it offers a pointer machine

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.780
perspective because
it has references,

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.600
because it has pointers.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.150
So you can do either one.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.890
But it also has a
lot of operations.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:38.180
It doesn't just have load
and store and follow pointer.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.030
It's got things
like sort and append

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.590
and concatenation of two
lists and lots of things.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.940
And each of those has a
cost associated with them.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.990
So whereas the random access
machine and pointer machine,

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.115
they're theoretical models.

00:18:52.115 --> 00:18:53.710
They're designed
to be super simple.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:58.230
So it's clear that everything
you do takes constant time.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.000
In Python, some of the
operations you can do

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.150
take a lot of time.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.734
Some of the operations in Python
take exponential time to do.

00:19:05.734 --> 00:19:08.150
And you've got to know when
you're writing your algorithms

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.260
down either thinking in a Python
model or your implementing

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.950
your algorithms
in actual Python,

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.260
which operations are
fast and which are slow.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.704
And that's what I'd like to
spend the next few minutes on.

00:19:19.704 --> 00:19:20.870
There's a lot of operations.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.620
I'm not going to
cover all of them.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.280
But we'll cover
more in recitation.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.130
And there's a whole
bunch in my notes.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.060
I won't get to all of them.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.140
So in Python, you can do
random access style things.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.540
In Python, arrays
are called lists,

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.230
which is super confusing.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.240
But there you go.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:48.110
A list in Python is an
array in real world.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.285
It's a super cool
array, of course?

00:19:51.285 --> 00:19:52.750
And you can think
of it as a list.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.460
But in terms implementation,
it's implemented as an array.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:55.960
Question?

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.660
AUDIENCE: I thought
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.160
PROFESSOR: You thought Python
links lists were linked lists.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.368
That's why it's so confusing.

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:04.280
In fact, they are not.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.630
In, say, scheme, back in the
days when we taught scheme,

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.040
lists are linked lists.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.580
And it's very different.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.530
So when you do-- I'll
give an operation here.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.330
You have a list L, and you
do something like this.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.390
L is a list object.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.647
This takes constant time.

00:20:25.647 --> 00:20:27.480
In a linked list, it
would take linear time.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.770
Because we've got a scan to
position I, scan to position J,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.000
add 5, and store.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.030
But conveniently in Python,
this takes constant time.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.862
And that's important to know.

00:20:39.862 --> 00:20:41.820
I know that the terminology
is super confusing.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:49.140
But blame the benevolent
dictator for life.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:55.580
On the other hand, you can do
style two, pointer machine,

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.830
using object oriented
programming, obviously.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.210
I'll just mention
that I'm not really

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.530
worrying about methods here.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.640
Because methods are just sort of
a way of thinking about things,

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.870
not super important
from a cost standpoint.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.150
If your object has a constant
number of attributes--

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.300
it can't have like
a million attributes

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.250
or can't have n
executes-- then it

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.890
fits into this
pointer machine model.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.450
So if you have an
object that only

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.079
has like three things or
10 things or whatever,

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:28.120
that's a pointer machine.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.828
You can think of
manipulating that object

00:21:29.828 --> 00:21:31.350
as taking constant time.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.955
If you are screwing around
the object's dictionary

00:21:33.955 --> 00:21:35.730
and doing lots of
crazy things, then you

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.990
have to be careful about
whether this remains true.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.460
But as long as you only
have a reasonable number

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.230
of attributes, this
is all fair game.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.550
And so if you do something like,
if you're implementing a linked

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.185
list, Python I
checked still does not

00:21:48.185 --> 00:21:49.310
have built-in linked lists.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.430
They're pretty easy
to build, though.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:52.420
You have a pointer.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.590
And you just say
x equals x.next.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.700
That takes constant time
because accessing this field

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.319
in an object of constant
size takes constant time.

00:22:02.319 --> 00:22:04.110
And we don't care what
these constants are.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:05.443
That's the beauty of algorithms.

00:22:05.443 --> 00:22:07.450
Because we only care
about scalability with n.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.150
There's no n here.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.200
This takes constant time.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.910
This takes constant time.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.530
No matter how big
your linked list

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.140
is or no matter how
many objects you have,

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.300
these are constant time.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.760
OK, let's do some
harder ones, though.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.480
In general, the
idea is, if you take

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.160
an operation like L.append--
so you have a list.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.460
And you want to append
some item to the list.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.580
It's an array, though.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.790
So think about it.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.840
The way to figure out
how much does this cost

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.600
is to think about
how it's implemented

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.750
in terms of these
basic operations.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.780
So these are your sort of
the core concept time things.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.320
Most everything can be reduced
to thinking about this.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.320
But sometimes,
it's less obvious.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.517
L.apend is a little
tricky to think about.

00:22:55.517 --> 00:22:57.600
Because basically, you
have an array of some size.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.250
And now you want to make
an array one larger.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.625
And the obvious way to do that
is to allocate a new array

00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:03.708
and copy all the elements.

00:23:03.708 --> 00:23:05.260
That would take linear time.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.180
Python doesn't do that.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.910
What does it do?

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.680
Stay tuned for lecture eight.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.140
It does something
called table doubling.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.140
It's a very simple idea.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.560
You can almost get
guess it from the title.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.946
And if you go to lecture--
is it eight or nine?

00:23:23.946 --> 00:23:26.180
Nine, sorry.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.050
You'll see how
this can basically

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.820
be done in constant time.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.860
There's a slight catch,
but basically, think of it

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.280
as a constant time operation.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.254
Once we have that,
and so this is

00:23:38.254 --> 00:23:39.920
why you should take
this class so you'll

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.920
understand how Python works.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.610
This is using an algorithmic
concept that was invented,

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.180
I don't know, decades
ago, but is a simple thing

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.769
that we need to do to solve
lots of other problems.

00:23:49.769 --> 00:23:50.310
So it's cool.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.800
There's a lot of features in
Python that use algorithms.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.500
And that's kind of
why I'm telling you.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.120
All right, so let's
do another one.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.210
A little easier.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.030
What if I want to
concatenate two lists?

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.080
You should know in Python this
is a non-destructive operation.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.440
You basically take a copy of
L1 and L2 and concatenate them.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.300
Of course, they're arrays.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.440
The way to think about
this is to re-implement it

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.280
as Python code.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.630
This is the same
thing as saying, well,

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.440
L is initially empty.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.250
And then for every item
x and L1, L.append(x).

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.300
And a lot of the times in
documentation for Python,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.820
you see this sort of here's
what it means, especially

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.520
in the fancier features.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.879
They give sort of an equivalent
simple Python, if you will.

00:24:38.879 --> 00:24:40.420
This doesn't use
any fancy operations

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.920
that we haven't seen already.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.050
So now we know this
takes constant time.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.840
The append, this append,
takes constant time.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.020
And so the amount of
time here is basically

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.230
order the length of L1.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.670
And the time here is
order the length of L2.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.140
And so in total,
it's order-- I'm

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.470
going to be careful and
say 1 plus length of L1

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:06.160
plus length of L2.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.060
The 1 plus is just in
case these are both 0.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.960
It still takes constant time
to build an initial list.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.020
OK, so there are a
bunch of operations

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.650
that are written in these notes.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.830
I'm not going to go
through all of them

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.130
because they're tedious.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.580
But a lot of you, could just
expand out code like this.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.830
And it's very easy to analyze.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.246
Whereas you just
look at plus, you

00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:26.670
think, oh, plus
is constant time.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.659
And plus is constant
time if this is a word

00:25:28.659 --> 00:25:29.450
and this is a word.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.760
But these are entire
data structures.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.480
And so it's not constant time.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.994
All right.

00:25:35.994 --> 00:25:37.910
There are more subtle
fun ones to think about.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:43.540
Like, if I want to know is x in
the list, how does that happen?

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.870
Any guesses?

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.660
There's an operator
in Python called

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.670
in-- x in L. How long
do you think this takes?

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.770
Altogether?

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.010
Linear, yeah.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:25:59.760
Linear time.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.786
In the worst case,
you're going to have

00:26:00.786 --> 00:26:02.090
to scan through the whole list.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.500
Lists aren't necessarily sorted.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.030
We don't know
anything about them.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.540
So you've got to just
scan through and test

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.290
for every item.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.240
Is x equal to that item?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.012
And it's even worse if
equal equals costs a lot.

00:26:12.012 --> 00:26:13.720
So if x is some really
complicated thing,

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.870
you have to take
that into account.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.400
OK, blah, blah, blah.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.250
OK, another fun one.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.680
This is like a pop quiz.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.660
How long's it take to
compute the length of a list?

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.800
Constant.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.197
Yeah, luckily, if you
didn't know anything,

00:26:29.197 --> 00:26:31.530
you'd have to scan through
the list and count the items.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.930
But in Python, lists
are implemented

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.100
with a counter built in.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.270
It always stores the
list at the beginning--

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.620
stores the length of the
list at the beginning.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.790
So you just look it up.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.300
This is instantaneous.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.690
It's important, though.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.270
That can matter.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.920
All right.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.890
Let's do some more.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.370
What if I want to sort a list?

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.370
How long does that take?

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:13.800
N log n where n is the
length of the list.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:20.450
Technically times the time
to compare two items, which

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.130
usually we're just
sorting words.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.850
And so this is constant time.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.530
If you look at Python
sorting algorithm,

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.240
it uses a comparison sort.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:35.260
This is the topic of lectures
three and four and seven.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.500
But in particular,
the very next lecture,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.670
we will see how this is
done in n log n time.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:45.690
And that is using algorithms.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:52.210
All right, let's
go to dictionaries.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:55.240
Python called dicts.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.600
And these let you do things.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.600
They're a generalization
of lists in some sense.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.130
Instead of putting just an
index here, an integer between 0

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.020
and the length minus 1, you
can put an arbitrary key

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.250
and store a value, for example.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.940
How long does this take?

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.795
I'm not going to ask you
because, it's not obvious.

00:28:12.795 --> 00:28:16.860
In fact, this is one of the
most important data structures

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.580
in all of computer science.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.410
It's called a hash table.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:25.270
And it is the topic of
lectures eight through 10.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:28.350
So stay tuned for how to
do this in constant time,

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.250
how to be able to
store an arbitrary key,

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.120
get it back out
in constant time.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.850
This is assuming the
key is a single word.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:35.620
Yeah.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.245
AUDIENCE: Does it first check to
see whether the key is already

00:28:38.245 --> 00:28:39.700
in the dictionary?

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it will
clobber any existing key.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.732
There's also, you
know, you can test

00:28:44.732 --> 00:28:46.190
whether a key is
in the dictionary.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:47.926
That also takes constant time.

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:49.800
You can delete something
from the dictionary.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.710
All the usual-- dealing with
a single key in dictionaries,

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.510
obviously dictionary.update,
that involves a lot of keys.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.070
That doesn't take some time.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.059
How long does it take?

00:28:59.059 --> 00:29:00.975
Well, you write out a
for loop and count them.

00:29:00.975 --> 00:29:02.795
AUDIENCE: But how can you
see whether [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:02.795 --> 00:29:04.160
dictionary in constant time?

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.118
PROFESSOR: How do you do
this in constant time?

00:29:06.118 --> 00:29:08.220
Come to lecture
eight through 10.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.420
I should say a
slight catch, which

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.480
is this is constant time
with high probability.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.834
It's a randomized algorithm.

00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:17.375
It doesn't always
take constant time.

00:29:17.375 --> 00:29:18.570
It's always correct.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.380
But sometimes, very rarely,
it takes a little more

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.760
than constant time.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.170
And I'm going to
abbreviate this WHP.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:29.410
And we'll see more what
that means mostly, actually,

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:30.390
in 6046.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.434
But we'll see a fair amount
in 6006 on how this works

00:29:33.434 --> 00:29:34.350
and how it's possible.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.680
It's a big area of research.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.430
A lot of people work on hashing.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.120
It's very cool and
it's super useful.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.720
If you write any code these
days, you use a dictionary.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.470
It's the way to solve problems.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.990
I'm basically using
Python is a platform

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.840
to advertise the rest of the
class you may have noticed.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.600
Not every topic we cover in
this class is already in Python,

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.210
but a lot of them are.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.210
So we've got table doubling.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:03.070
We've got dictionaries.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.460
We've got sorting.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:09.300
Another one is longs, which
are long integers in Python

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.990
through version two.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:17.850
And this is the
topic of lecture 11.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:21.360
And so for fun, if I have
two integers x and y,

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.610
and let's say one of them
is this many words long

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.360
and the other one is
this many words long,

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.151
how long do you think
it takes to add them?

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:33.790
Guesses?

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.900
PROFESSOR: Plus?

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.580
Times?

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.827
Plus is the answer.

00:30:43.827 --> 00:30:45.160
You can do it in that much time.

00:30:47.936 --> 00:30:49.810
If you think about the
grade school algorithm

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:53.030
for adding really big
multi-digit numbers,

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.500
it'll only take that much time.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.770
Multiplication is a
little bit harder, though.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:58.520
If you look at the
grade school algorithm,

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.310
it's going to be x times y--
it's quadratic time not so

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:02.660
good.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.600
The algorithm that's
implemented in Python

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.870
is x plus y to the
log base 2 of 3.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:16.880
By the way, I always write
LG to mean log base 2.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.430
Because it only has two
letters, so OK, this is 2.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.710
Log base 2 of 3 is about 1.6.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:27.240
So while the straightforward
algorithm is basically

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.410
x plus y squared, this one
is x plus y to the 1.6 power,

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:32.910
a little better than quadratic.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:37.680
And the Python developers
found that was faster

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.350
than grade school
multiplication.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.490
And so that's what
they implemented.

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.573
And that is something we
will cover in lecture 11,

00:31:42.573 --> 00:31:43.240
how to do that.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.510
It's pretty cool.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.290
There are faster
algorithms, but this

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:50.430
is one that works
quite practically.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.080
One more.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.452
Heap queue, this is in the
Python standard library

00:31:55.452 --> 00:31:57.410
and implements something
called the heap, which

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.540
will be in lecture four.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.780
So, coming soon to a
classroom near you.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.760
All right, enough advertisement.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.200
That gives you some idea of
the model of computation.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.330
There's a whole bunch more in
these notes which are online.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.930
Go check them out.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:17.354
And some of them, we'll
cover in recitation tomorrow.

00:32:17.354 --> 00:32:19.770
I'd like to-- now that we are
sort of comfortable for what

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:23.350
costs what in Python, I
want to do a real example.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.152
So last time, we
did peak finding.

00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:26.860
We're going to have
another example which

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.400
is called document distance.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.180
So let's do that.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.770
Any questions before we go on?

00:32:40.235 --> 00:32:41.225
All right.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.840
So document distance problem
is, I give you two documents.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.050
I'll call them D1 D2.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:22.180
And I want to compute the
distance between them.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.150
And the first question
is, what does that mean?

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.170
What is this distance function?

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.550
Let me first tell
you some motivations

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.010
for computing document distance.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.580
Let's say you're
Google and you're

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.130
cataloging the entire web.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.060
You'd like to know when two web
pages are basically identical.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.991
Because then you store less
and because you present it

00:33:43.991 --> 00:33:44.990
differently to the user.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.770
You say, well,
there's this page.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.320
And there's lots
of extra copies.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.470
But you just need--
here's the canonical one.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.814
Or you're Wikipedia.

00:33:52.814 --> 00:33:54.980
And I don't know if you've
ever looked at Wikipedia.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.771
There's a list of all
mirrors of Wikipedia.

00:33:56.771 --> 00:33:58.600
There's like millions of them.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.620
And they find them by hand.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.160
But you could do that
using document distance.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.680
Say, are these
basically identical

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.510
other than like some
stuff at the-- junk

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.116
at the beginning or the end?

00:34:10.116 --> 00:34:12.449
Or if you're teaching this
class and you want to detect,

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:14.499
are two problem sets cheating?

00:34:14.499 --> 00:34:15.290
Are they identical?

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.230
We do this a lot.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.631
I'm not going to tell you
what distance function we use.

00:34:18.631 --> 00:34:20.130
Because that would
defeat the point.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.920
It's not the one
we cover in class.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.770
But we use automated tests
for whether you're cheating.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:29.250
I've got some more.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:30.570
Web search.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:31.880
Let's say you're Google again.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.139
And you want to
implement searching.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:37.389
Like, I give you three words.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.489
I'm searching for
introduction to algorithms.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:42.280
You can think of
introduction to algorithms

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.980
as a very short document.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.980
And you want to test
whether that document is

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.416
similar to all the other
documents on the web.

00:34:48.416 --> 00:34:50.290
And the one that's most
similar, the one that

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:51.820
has the small
distance, that's maybe

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.969
what you want to put at the top.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.552
That's obviously not
what Google does.

00:34:54.552 --> 00:34:56.969
But it's part of what it does.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:58.750
So that's why you might care.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.280
It's partly also
just a toy problem.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.720
It lets us illustrate
a lot of the techniques

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.790
that we develop in this class.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:12.280
All right, I'm going
to think of a document

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.735
as a sequence of words.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.410
Just to be a little
bit more formal,

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.610
what do I mean by document?

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:26.150
And a word is just
going to be a string

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:30.024
of alphanumeric
characters-- A through Z

00:35:30.024 --> 00:35:30.940
and zero through nine.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.980
OK, so if I have a
document which you also

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.200
think of as a string
and you basically

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.040
delete all the white space and
punctuation all the other junk

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.100
that's in there.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.820
This Everything in between
those, those are the words.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.630
That's a simple definition
of decomposing documents

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:51.490
into words.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.240
And now we can think
of about what--

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.340
I want to know whether
D1 and D2 are similar.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.000
And I've thought
about my document

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.300
as a collection of words.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.540
Maybe they're similar if they
share a lot of words in common.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.660
So that's the idea.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:11.550
Look at shared words
and use that to define

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.300
document distance.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.614
This is obviously only one
way to define distance.

00:36:14.614 --> 00:36:16.280
It'll be the way we
do it in this class.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.730
But there are lots of
other possibilities.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:27.810
So I'm going to
think of a document.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:28.860
It's a sequence of words.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.155
But I could also think
of it as a vector.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:41.330
So if I have a document D and
I have a word W, this D of W

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:43.930
is going to be the
number of times

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:47.160
that word occurs
in the document.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:52.260
So, number of recurrences
W in the document D.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.140
So it's a number.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.480
It's an integer.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.510
Non-negative integer.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.599
Could be 0.

00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:58.140
Could be one.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.440
Could be a million.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.210
I think of this
as a giant vector.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:07.800
A vector is indexed
by all words.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.110
And for each of them,
there's some frequency.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.530
Of lot of them are zero.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:16.106
And then some of them have some
positive number occurrences.

00:37:16.106 --> 00:37:17.480
You could think
of every document

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:22.354
is as being one of these
plots in this common axis.

00:37:22.354 --> 00:37:24.020
There's infinitely
many words down here.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.220
So it's kind of a big axis.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.600
But it's one way to
draw the picture.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:36.420
OK, so for example, take two
very important documents.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.270
Everybody likes cats and dogs.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:41.510
So these are two word documents.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:42.890
And so we can draw them.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.889
Because there's only three
different words here,

00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:47.444
we can draw them in
three dimensional space.

00:37:47.444 --> 00:37:49.110
Beyond that, it's a
little hard to draw.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:53.010
So we have, let's say,
which one's the-- let's say

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:56.550
this one's the-- makes
it easier to draw.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:00.350
So there's going to be
just zero here and one.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:06.310
For each of the axes, let's say
this is dog and this is cat.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:10.510
OK, so the cat has won the--
it has one cat and no dog.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:12.170
So it's here.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.480
It's a vector
pointing out there.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.992
The dog you've got
basically pointing there.

00:38:20.992 --> 00:38:22.200
OK, so these are two vectors.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.640
So how do I measure how
different two vectors are?

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.235
Any suggestions from
vector calculus?

00:38:33.864 --> 00:38:35.559
AUDIENCE: Inner product?

00:38:35.559 --> 00:38:36.600
PROFESSOR: Inner product?

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.780
Yeah, that's good suggestion.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.550
Any others.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.010
OK, we'll go with inner product.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:48.589
I like inner product,
also known as dot product.

00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:49.630
Just define that quickly.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.790
So we could-- I'm going
to call this D prime

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:02.360
because it's not what
we're going to end up with.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.160
We could think of this as
the dot product of D1 and D2,

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:17.380
also known as the sum over all
words of D1 of W times D2 of W.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.010
So for example, you take the
dot product of these two guys.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:21.540
Those match.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:27.940
So you get one point there,
cat and dog multiplied by zero.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.600
So you don't get much there.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.410
So this is some
measure of distance.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:38.220
But it's a measure of,
actually, of commonality.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.160
So it would be sort of
inverse distance, sorry.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.209
If you have a high
dot product, you

00:39:43.209 --> 00:39:44.500
have a lot of things in common.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.210
Because a lot of these
things didn't be--

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.840
wasn't zero times something.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.460
It's actually a positive number
times some positive number.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.197
If you have a lot of shared
words, than that looks good.

00:39:53.197 --> 00:39:55.280
The trouble of this is if
I have a long document--

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.210
say, a million words--
and it's 99% in common

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:02.760
with another document
that's a million words long,

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.310
it's still-- it
looks super similar.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.970
Actually, I need to do
it the other way around.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:12.267
Let's say it's a million words
long and half of the words

00:40:12.267 --> 00:40:12.850
are in common.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:15.190
So not that many,
but a fair number.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.479
Then I have a score
of like 500,000.

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:21.020
And then I have two documents
which are, say, 100 words long.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.540
And they're identical.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.670
Their score is maybe only 100.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.310
So even though
they're identical,

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.170
it's not quite scale invariant.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.630
So it's not quite
a perfect measure.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.241
Any suggestions for
how to fix this?

00:40:33.241 --> 00:40:34.740
This, I think, is
a little trickier.

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.722
Yeah?

00:40:35.722 --> 00:40:37.639
AUDIENCE: Divide by the
length of the vectors?

00:40:37.639 --> 00:40:39.596
PROFESSOR: Divide by the
length of the vectors.

00:40:39.596 --> 00:40:40.970
I think that's worth a pillow.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.280
Haven't done any pillows yet.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.770
Sorry about that.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:47.550
So, divide by the
length of vector.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.447
That's good.

00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:51.030
I'm going to call
this D double prime.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.190
Still not quite
the right answer.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.240
Or not-- no, it's pretty good.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.060
It's pretty good.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.960
So here, the length
of the vectors

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.030
is the number of
words that occur

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:06.610
in them This is pretty cool.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:10.610
But does anyone
recognize this formula?

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.200
Angle, yeah.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.650
It's a lot like the angle
between the two vectors.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.670
It's just off by an arc cos.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.229
This is the cosine of the
angle between the two vectors.

00:41:21.229 --> 00:41:22.020
And I'm a geometer.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.020
I like geometry.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.110
So if you take arc
cos of that thing,

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.520
that's a well established
distance metric.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:32.210
This goes back to '75,
if you can believe it,

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.850
back when people-- early
days of document, information

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.585
retrieval, way before
the web, people

00:41:37.585 --> 00:41:40.670
were still working
on this stuff.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.990
So it's a natural measure of the
angle between the two vectors.

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.690
If it's 0, they're
basically identical.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.670
If it's 90 degrees, they're
really, really different.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:53.030
And so that gives you a nice way
to compute document distance.

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.670
The question is, how do we
actually compute that measure?

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.020
Now that we've come up with
something that's reasonable,

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.460
how do I actually
find this value?

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.930
I need to compute these
vectors-- the number

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:06.500
of recurrences of each
word in the document.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.817
And I need you compute
the dot product.

00:42:08.817 --> 00:42:09.900
And then I need to divide.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.691
That's really easy.

00:42:10.691 --> 00:42:13.260
So, dot product--
and I also need

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.610
to decompose a document
to a list of words.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.492
So there are three
things I need to do.

00:42:17.492 --> 00:42:18.450
Let me write them down.

00:42:30.417 --> 00:42:31.375
So a sort of algorithm.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:42.745
There's one, split a
document into words.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:51.040
Second is compute
word frequencies,

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.080
how many times
each word appears.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.860
This is the document vectors .

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:02.020
And then the third step is
to compute the dot product.

00:43:07.124 --> 00:43:09.290
Let me tell you a little
bit about how each of those

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:10.690
is done.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:14.860
Some of these will be covered
more in future lectures.

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.980
I want to give you an overview.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.800
There's a lot of ways to
do each of these steps.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.900
If you look at the--
next to the lecture

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.310
notes for this lecture two,
there's a bunch of code

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.640
and a bunch of data
examples of documents--

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.530
big corpuses of text.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.070
And you can run,
I think, there are

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:34.760
eight different
algorithms for it.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.010
And let me give you--
actually, why don't I

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.060
cut to the chase a
little bit and tell you

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.430
about the run times of these
different implementations

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:43.431
of this same algorithms.

00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:45.638
There are lots of sort of
versions of this algorithm.

00:43:45.638 --> 00:43:46.910
We implement it a whole bunch.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.850
Every semester I teach this, I
change them a little bit more,

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.970
add a few more variants.

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:55.260
So version one, on
a particular pair

00:43:55.260 --> 00:44:00.700
of documents which is like a
megabyte-- not very much text--

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.460
it takes 228.1
seconds-- super slow.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.790
Pathetic.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:09.410
Then we do a little bit
of algorithmic tweaking.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.780
We get down to 164 seconds.

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.740
Then we get to 123 seconds.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.340
Then we get down to 71 seconds.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:21.460
Then we get down
to 18.3 seconds.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:25.130
And then we get to 11.5 seconds.

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:28.270
Then we get to 1.8 seconds.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:31.760
Then we get to 0.2 seconds.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.630
So factor of 1,000.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.530
This is just in Python.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.730
2/10 of a second to
process a megabytes.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:39.410
It's all right.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:40.750
It's getting reasonable.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:41.969
This is not so reasonable.

00:44:41.969 --> 00:44:43.760
Some of these improvements
are algorithmic.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.300
Some of them are
just better coding.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.280
So there's improving
the constant factors.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.710
But if you look at
larger and larger texts,

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:54.210
this will become
even more dramatic.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.220
Because a lot of these
were improvements

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.790
from quadratic time algorithms
to linear and log n algorithms.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.432
And so for a megabyte, yeah,
it's a reasonable improvement.

00:45:02.432 --> 00:45:04.890
But if you look at a gigabyte,
it'll be a huge improvement.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.099
There will be no comparison.

00:45:06.099 --> 00:45:07.640
In fact, there will
be no comparison.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.098
Because this one
will never finish.

00:45:09.098 --> 00:45:11.330
So the reason I ran
such a small example

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:13.540
so I could have patience
to wait for this one.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:17.050
But this one you could run
on the bigger examples.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:22.490
All right, so where do
I want to go from here?

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:24.380
Five minutes.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.560
I want to tell you about
some of those improvements

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.380
and some of the algorithms here.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.770
Let's start with
this very simple one.

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:36.325
How would you split a
document into words in Python?

00:45:36.325 --> 00:45:36.825
Yeah?

00:45:36.825 --> 00:45:38.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.935
Iterate through the document,
[INAUDIBLE] the dictionary?

00:45:40.935 --> 00:45:42.560
PROFESSOR: Iterate
through the-- that's

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.490
actually how we do number two.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:46.900
OK, we can talk about that one.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:52.220
Iterate through the
words in the document

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.690
and put it in a dictionary.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:59.980
Let's say, count of
word plus equals 1.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.320
This would work if count
is something called a count

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.440
dictionary if you're
super Pythonista.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.940
Otherwise, you have to check,
is the word in the dictionary?

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.610
If not, set it to one.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.459
If it is there, add one to it.

00:46:12.459 --> 00:46:14.000
But I think you know
what this means.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.859
This will count the
number of words--

00:46:15.859 --> 00:46:18.400
this will count the frequency
of each word in the dictionary.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.020
And becomes dictionaries
run in constant time

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:26.020
with high probability--
with high probability--

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:31.170
this will take order--
well, cheating a little bit.

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:32.630
Because words can
be really long.

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:35.480
And so to reduce a word
down to a machine word

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.810
could take order the
length of the word time.

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:40.210
To a little more
precise, this is

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:41.626
going to be the
sum of the lengths

00:46:41.626 --> 00:46:45.800
of the words in the
document, which is also

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.464
known as a length of
the document, basically.

00:46:48.464 --> 00:46:49.130
So this is good.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.565
This is linear time
with high probability.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.770
OK, that's a good algorithm.

00:46:55.770 --> 00:47:02.390
That is introduced
in algorithm four.

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:04.627
So we got a significant boost.

00:47:04.627 --> 00:47:05.960
There are other ways to do this.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.190
For example, you
could sort the words

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:10.930
and then run through
the sorted list

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:13.430
and count, how many do you
get in a row for each one?

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.925
If it's sorted, you
can count-- I mean,

00:47:15.925 --> 00:47:18.300
all the identical words are
put right next to each other.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.800
So it's easy to count them.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.310
And that'll run almost as fast.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:22.690
That was one of
these algorithms.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:29.350
OK, so that's a couple
different ways to do that.

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.740
Let's go back to
this first step.

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.785
How would you split a document
into words in the first place?

00:47:33.785 --> 00:47:34.284
Yeah?

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:36.617
AUDIENCE: Search circulated
spaces and then [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:36.617 --> 00:47:39.150
PROFESSOR: Run through
though the string.

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.870
And every time you see anything
that's not alphanumeric,

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:43.250
start a new word.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:45.380
OK, that would run
in linear time.

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.380
That's a good answer.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.590
So it's not hard.

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:54.210
If you're a fancy Pythonista,
you might do it like this.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:02.485
Remember my Reg Exes.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.090
This will find all the
words in a document.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:10.660
Trouble is, in general,
re takes exponential time.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.260
So if you think about
algorithms, be very careful.

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.010
Unless you know how
re is implemented,

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:19.800
this probably will
run in linear time.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.000
But it's not obvious at all.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.210
Do anything fancy with
regular expressions.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:26.543
If you don't know what this
means, don't worry about it.

00:48:26.543 --> 00:48:27.100
Don't use it.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.990
If you know about it, be
very careful in this class

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.656
when you use re.

00:48:29.656 --> 00:48:31.664
Because it's not
always linear time.

00:48:31.664 --> 00:48:33.330
But there is an easy
algorithm for this,

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:38.075
which is just scan through
and look for alpha numerics.

00:48:38.075 --> 00:48:38.950
String them together.

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:39.449
It's good.

00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:41.530
There's a few other
algorithms here in the notes.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:42.670
You should check them out.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:46.930
And for fun, look at this code
and see how small differences

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.190
make dramatic difference
in performance.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:51.620
Next class will
be about sorting.
