STEPHEN PEARSE: How
many of you guys in here

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.970
think you might want to one
day run your own company

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.230
or begin a startup?

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.480
The vast majority of you.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.630
Good.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.500
Remember that, because at
the end of my presentation,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.030
I'm going to give you guys
an opportunity to begin

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.730
that process.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.540
My name is Steve Pearse and
my background, let's see.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.940
Former CEO, entrepreneur,
I am an angel investor.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.280
I work with venture capital
companies as a litmus test.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.820
If I like it, they
might like it too.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.420
And I advise CEOs and startups.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.457
I live in Colorado, Florida,
I used to live here full-time,

00:01:15.457 --> 00:01:16.540
now I just come and visit.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.740
So my specialty and background,
primarily telecommunications,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.770
IT, and as of late, the last
10 years or so, health science.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.790
I've bought companies,
I have sold companies.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.160
I have raised over $250
million over six rounds,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.600
and my background is kind
of up through the ranks.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.890
AT&amp;T, then I became
chief engineer at Sprint,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.890
ran operations and started
Time Warner Telecom,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.490
I ran a wireless company, was an
executive vice president at Bay

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.320
Networks, merged into
Nortel in a successful sale

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.230
for $7 billion.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.090
And then I did my own
startup in Silicon Valley,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.440
and that was cool.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.949
That, I came in when we
were valued at $18 million,

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:14.740
and we sold for $2.7 billion
less than a year and a half-ish

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.460
later.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.910
Those were the days.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.070
You might think
that was a bubble.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.920
Guess what?

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.080
There's always a bubble.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.370
There's always a bubble.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.270
Look what's happening now with
Twitter and social networking.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.960
There's always a bubble.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.960
Your challenge is to find
how can I make my own bubble,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.880
or where is the next
bubble going to be.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.510
Your challenge is to
be a hockey player

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.230
and skate to where the
puck is going to be,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.730
not where it is now,
because you're too late.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.040
Where do you think that next
big event is going to happen?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.956
That's your challenge.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.030
The startup.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.100
And these statistics
are about right.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.860
Some might say
I'm over-generous,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.970
but out of every 10 startups,
maybe one will succeed.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.400
Kawasaki will say one out of 20.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.050
But one out of 10 will succeed.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.394
What's a success?

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:18.470
Success is, if
you're an investor,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.230
you make at least 10x.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.600
The investor really
wants 100x, and they're

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.760
going to gun for that,
but they'll take 10x.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.180
They want something that's
going to make-- it's called,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.220
hey this company, thanks,
Steve, you made the fund.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.880
What does that mean,
I made the fund?

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.260
They've got a fund, they have
a lot of private investors

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.540
give them their money,
they invest that money,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.600
and they want all that
money back, plus more

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.390
to the investors.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.330
If you have a $100
million fund, you've

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.470
got to give that $100 million
back or you're a failure.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.290
You really want to give $200
million back, $400 million

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.790
back.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.830
You want to give
much, much, much more,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.360
and as a venture
capitalist, you get

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.200
to pocket an even
bigger percentage

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.760
than your limited partners
or investors will take.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.810
So they want a 10x company
that makes the fund.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.000
So 10 companies, they want one
to be a factor of 10 better.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.320
Three out of 10-ish might
yield a moderate return.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.460
What's a moderate return?

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.630
Maybe 2 to 4x in
four to seven years.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.190
And you really want
to be shutting down

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.620
the fund in about seven years.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.330
Sometimes it happens,
sometimes it doesn't.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.610
And then six are failures,
completely shut down.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.360
So that's the odds
you're facing here.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.930
You might think, oh
God, if I do this,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.900
chances are I'm not going to
be a success, a big success.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.020
That's fine, because
investors know these odds,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.280
and if you come from a failure
or two, there's no problem.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.080
As long as you did
a good job, you

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.650
learn from the
failures or mistake.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.250
Maybe it was just the wrong
bid at the wrong time.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.280
But they're not afraid
of reinvesting in people

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.582
who have done this a few times.

00:05:13.582 --> 00:05:14.540
And look at the Valley.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.720
You have people
skip companies right

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.960
and left all over the place.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.630
So long history of backgrounds.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.980
OK.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.160
Why do a startup?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.600
I mean, what's the game here?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.700
What are you trying to play?

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.920
Well, if you do a startup, and
you get money from investors,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.680
you have to be able to exit.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.690
And what is an exit?

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.490
You have to either go
public or get sold.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.590
That's an exit.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.020
Why is going public an exit?

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.360
Because finally, I can
cash out the stocks

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.600
that I bought from
you a long time ago.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.850
Your investors want
their money back.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.160
If you're interested in
running a mom and pop

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.470
business with a cool
idea and cool technology,

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.940
no one's going to invest
in it except family.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.660
Why?

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.826
Because they're never going
to get their money back.

00:06:05.826 --> 00:06:08.090
It's not a liquid asset.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.220
So you have to plan on going
public or getting sold.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.790
If you're a technology company--
and by the way, officially,

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.880
the answer is always
I'm going public.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.020
I'm not going to sell.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.750
Never going to sell.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.210
I'm going to run this thing
forever, hand it off to the--

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.380
why do you have to say that?

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.120
Why do you have to say we're
not going to get acquired?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.060
Because if you say I'm going to
get acquired, you're not in it.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.510
Your heart's not in it.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.850
You're looking for a
trick, a magic pony,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.140
I want to sell this puppy,
I'm going to make a buck,

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.497
and I don't want to-- I want
to sell it and make money

00:06:51.497 --> 00:06:52.080
and that's it.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.871
No, no, no, no, no.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.370
You can't say that.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.120
You say that and no one's
going to give you a penny.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.010
So you're always going public.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.000
But why would a company
ever want to buy you,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.540
just in case they
wanted to buy you?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.650
Bay Networks.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.570
At one time, Bay Networks
was bigger than Cisco.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.860
Bay built routers.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.080
Internet IP routers.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.800
And I ran the internet and
telecom business group.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.670
And we built blades to replace
the old technology that

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.750
was maybe 10 megabits a second.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.980
We had to come out with 100
megabit a second, and then gig,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.470
and play that game.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.300
Different interfaces.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.540
And my team was a good team.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.830
We could build a blade
in about 18 months.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.560
That was pretty good.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.550
People working maybe
9:00-5:00, 9:00-6:00.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.450
Good engineers, teamwork,
meetings, stuff like that.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.620
A startup can do
that in nine months.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.490
And nine months' delta in
a new product introduction

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.440
can spell the difference
between failure and success

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.170
in this business.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.100
I could not afford to
build a new blade that

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.730
goes into my rack and
sell it to my customers,

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.300
sometimes, if I can
only do it in 18 months.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.250
If I have another
company start advertising

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.440
and have a good marketing
person and they're

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.510
telling the industry analysts
and all the industry rags,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.940
hey we got this new widget.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.799
And it's got 100 megabits now.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.730
And we're selling and
customers love it.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.100
I have to do a make
or buy decision.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.030
I may interrupt my development.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.920
I may say, finance,
go strike a deal.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.160
Let's buy this company quickly.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.360
And Bay did that all the time.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.170
I bought a bunch of
startups, hot startups

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.490
for internet dial-in modems.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.390
That was big time
back in the '90s.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.620
So you had a box that was 10
times smaller, faster, cheaper,

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.100
all that stuff, using
chips that just came off

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.829
the line from Intel
or TI or whatever,

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:11.620
and you can build
something in nine months,

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.710
I'd buy that company.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.190
That's a great example
of how you can go out,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.080
take the state-of-the-art
today, the latest chip sets,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.050
build it smarter
smaller, faster,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.030
all these nice characteristics,
and sell your company.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.040
And you can do it over
and over and over again.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.160
Why can you do
that as a startup?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.490
Why can't big companies do that?

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.870
Because you're
working for stock.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.590
You're not working
for a promotion,

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.620
you're not working
for a lot of things

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.430
big companies' people work for.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.280
A nice stable lifestyle.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.840
You're willing to work until
midnight and bring in pizza.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.130
The CEO, when I was a CEO, I'd
bring in Chinese just to entice

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.670
people, please stay
longer and work harder.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.740
Because everybody's
working for the same thing.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.080
Everybody wants to get rich.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.590
Everybody wants stock.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.893
It's a great unifier.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.960
It is the enticement
that makes everybody

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.360
think along the same way.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.850
When I was at AT&amp;T,
everybody wanted

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.080
to make you look bad so
they might step on you

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.940
and get another
$5,000 raise, or maybe

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.750
run the department
with five more people.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.880
That's big company mentality.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.620
Startups were such
a great cleanse

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.070
when I left the big
corporate environment

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.779
and went to the startup world.

00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:40.320
That's what we're
talking about here.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.824
That's the taste of what
could be your future.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.350
OK, getting money.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.310
Signal to noise.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.100
Signal to noise.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.400
Do you know how much noise
is out there that you're

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.470
going to be fighting against,
if you want attention

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.380
as a startup?

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.310
If you want attention
from a VC or an angel,

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:12.000
you're wading through a
tremendous amount of noise.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.456
Your signal has to
be muy powerful.

00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:17.830
And we're going
to talk about how

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.190
to make your signal
very powerful,

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.130
and punching through that noise.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.530
Because you've got to go out
and grab people by the neck,

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:30.140
shake them, and make them
listen to your pitch.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.460
So, this is a terrible
elevator pitch,

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.810
but it's the elements of what
you want to be looking for.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.220
I'm going to paraphrase.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.190
For this huge,
great target market

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.060
who really hate the
stuff they're using now,

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:51.620
our thermostat is a new
[? Heigelberg ?] category

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.750
that provides all your solutions
you've been looking for.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.700
Unlike the bozos who
we're competing against,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.250
we have assembled
incredible, groundbreaking

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.569
technology that is going
to be ready in six months.

00:12:07.569 --> 00:12:09.860
Essentially, that's kind of
what you want to be saying.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.110
You have to have all these
elements in your elevator

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.980
pitch.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.130
And say it a lot better
than this format up here.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.120
That's what you need to do.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.950
I'd like you to start
thinking about filling

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.040
in the blanks for
your ideas now.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.790
Whether or not it's a real
product or technology,

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.320
or something you
think, hey, this

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.760
would be cool if I
could ever do this.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.260
Think about how
you would say this.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.870
Because that's the elevator
pitch and will determine

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.120
your readiness to do a startup.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.850
Your readiness to get money.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.760
You've got really one shot,
because once a venture

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.320
capitalist has seen your face,
and you've said a few words,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.212
they're either
thinking right away,

00:12:57.212 --> 00:12:59.420
I'm going to go ahead and
listen to the rest of this,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.800
or you're having trouble
here, and then you're gone.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.810
Why?

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:05.900
Too much noise.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.360
They see thousands of pitches
and thousands of people,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.250
and they have to quickly-- it's
almost neuronally implanted.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.610
They can very quickly determine
whether you're worth it or not.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.420
So that's why it's important
to rehearse this stuff

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.501
and get it down right.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.302
Everybody's maybe heard this.

00:13:26.302 --> 00:13:28.260
I didn't have time to
write you a short letter,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.530
so I wrote you a long one.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.880
What does that mean?

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.470
It means you've got to
be super, super crisp.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.340
You've got to be able
to say what you're

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.900
going to say and enunciate it.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.900
Grab them-- you have to hit
him over the head with a hammer

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.950
with what you're saying.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.470
It's got to be so compelling.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.210
We'll talk more about
that, but you really

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.240
got to capture their attention.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.020
And then Jeffrey Moore.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.360
What do you mean, you
have to induce greed?

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.190
Greed doesn't sound good.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:12.690
Well, when you go to the store
and you see something on sale,

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.190
what are you thinking?

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.710
You're thinking that's on sale.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:17.510
Do I need it?

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.490
I don't know.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.280
Maybe I should buy it
now while it's on sale.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.760
You're inducing
spontaneous greed

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.490
when you buy something for
sale, because it's a good deal.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.290
Might not be there later.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.740
You have to induce greed on the
part of your investors venture

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.020
catalysts or angel
investors, even family.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.100
You have to say I'm on
to something really big.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.050
Really, really big.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.780
This is going to be
huge, and you need

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.720
to think about investing now.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.740
You have to get
that greed going,

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.950
and that greed has to be started
from the very first elevator

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:55.730
pitch.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.170
And really, a good
elevator pitch

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.760
isn't what I just said up here.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.820
A good elevator pitch
starts with a hook.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.510
And we're going to talk about
that hook a little bit later.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.250
The pitch.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.430
Keep it simple.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.510
Keep it simple and stupid.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.450
Keep it really, really simple.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.800
No matter how simple
you think your pitch is,

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.445
no matter how easy and clear
you think you are, you're not.

00:15:20.445 --> 00:15:22.800
You're not being clear enough.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.250
You need to really dumb it down.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.360
Like third grade.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.784
You need to be able to
explain it to a third grader.

00:15:28.784 --> 00:15:30.450
If you can explain
it to a third grader,

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.190
you're doing a good job.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.820
Don't worry about coming
across as too simplistic.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.970
They'll pull you up
to a different level

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.327
if they need to, like, let's
talk more about the technology,

00:15:42.327 --> 00:15:43.910
let's get into the
weeds a little bit.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.210
But if you lose them early on
by being too technical or too

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.230
complex, you're gone.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.130
They won't give you the chance
of explaining yourself later,

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.540
because you weren't able
to communicate effectively

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.330
up front.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:05.980
This hook is kind of like a pain
point, or a statement of greed.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.870
You have to say something
that is so exciting, they're

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.520
going to stop what they're doing
and continue to listen to you,

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.894
because I've never
heard of that.

00:16:13.894 --> 00:16:16.020
How is that possible?

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.480
Think about your
target audience.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.260
Is your target
audience technical?

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.894
Is your target audience
a lay consumer?

00:16:21.894 --> 00:16:24.060
Is it the financial analysts
who don't know anything

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.340
about technology, they want to
hear about money and numbers.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.220
You need to really understand
who your target audience is.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.350
If the eyes start to
glaze over, you failed.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.780
You didn't do your homework.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.810
You didn't understand
who your audience was.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.290
Talk to them on their level.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.770
That makes them excited.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.500
Everybody's listening to
you, greedy for something.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.320
Give them what they want.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.300
And if you're in a room
of different people,

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.900
change your pitch to the
lowest common denominator

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.620
You might have a room full of
VCs and a couple of junior VCs.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.340
If one of the
partners in the room

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.220
is not from this
industry at all,

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.960
you need to lower it down
to that person's level,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.859
because if you lose
that person, they're

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.150
going to blackball you later.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.042
They're going to
say, they lost me.

00:17:14.042 --> 00:17:15.750
They weren't able to
communicate with me.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.099
I don't like them.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:20.940
So be sure, when you're
scanning the room,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.390
or before you even
walk into the room,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.609
get a list of who
the VCs may attend,

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:31.790
what their backgrounds are,
what companies they work for.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.220
If you can connect
with any of them

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.950
by their past history
with a person or a company

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.680
that you're familiar
with, bring it in.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.730
Say, by the way, I happen to
know you were from Nortel.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.550
Did you know so and so?

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.150
Try to engage that person.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.910
But bring it down to the
lowest common denominator.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.730
The whizzes in the room will
try to bring you back up,

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.314
but always try to
remember there's

00:17:56.314 --> 00:17:57.980
one or two people who
may not understand

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.880
what you're talking about.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.060
Joe's already
covered 10, 20, 30.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.520
But really, 20 minutes.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.080
20 minutes?

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.290
They gave me an hour.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.000
Why do I need to make
this a 20-minute pitch?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.530
Well, for two reasons.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.040
One, they're going
to have trouble--

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.330
you're going to have trouble
getting your presentation

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.580
to work with the AV equipment.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.450
That's going to
eat up some time.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.010
But realistically, you're
going to be interrupted

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.860
over and over and over again.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.420
People will drag you
into minutia and detail.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.840
You need to fight
that and resist that,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.530
but you'll be stopped.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.700
And you'll never get through
your 20-minute pitch.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.420
That hour will go
just like that.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.820
So you really have to make it,
if you're pitching it alone

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.320
in a room, no more
than 20 minutes.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.000
It will expand to the full hour.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.720
Use pictures.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.300
Seriously, use pictures.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.400
There's nothing more boring
than this right here.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.620
There's always
somebody in the room,

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.790
whether it's angels or a
venture capital partnership,

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.460
someone in the room who
wants to show off they

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.220
know more than you do.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.640
That's not going to work.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.150
We did that three years ago.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.050
It was a failure.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.990
Or, wait a minute.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.890
The neural resistance,
I thought was

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.150
going to be higher than that.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.970
You need to defend that.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.440
You're always going to be
teased into a rat hole.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.992
Here, follow me
into this rat hole,

00:19:32.992 --> 00:19:34.700
let's run around,
waste everybody's time,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.150
and then you're going
to be asked to leave.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.140
Don't fall for that.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.410
You have two options.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:51.240
You either firmly and with a
nice, reasonable answer, say,

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.320
nope that's not the
case, and this is why,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.760
but I'll get back to that
later if you want to.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:05.000
Or you say, good point, I'm
not familiar with that point

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.210
you just made.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.680
I'll get back to you later.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.190
Don't let them continue
that conversation.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.240
You've got to know how to
shut off the questions,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.900
shut off the
spigot, and move on,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.000
because you have an
agenda to get to asking

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.630
for money at the very end.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.030
If you don't get to
that, then it was a nice,

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.270
thank you for the
information, there's the door.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.410
You have to be able
to get to that.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:36.210
So as important as
anything I've talked about

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:42.880
is the need for you to
be a competent presenter.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.340
You need to show passion,
you have to show confidence,

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.990
and you have to
engage the audience.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:56.650
Not easy to do, and it takes,
sometimes, years and years

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.830
to learn how to do that.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.570
It's very difficult. If I
were to grab any one of you

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.040
down here and say, please give
a presentation on whatever

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.065
your most passionate
thing is, you're

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:07.440
going to be kind
of hard-pressed,

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.900
you're going to want to kind
of recite things from memory,

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.980
and forget about the engagement.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.680
You're going to speak too fast.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.100
It's almost impossible
to speak too slowly,

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.290
especially if you're from
a technical background.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.630
Slow the pace down.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.760
Make sure everybody's
keeping up with you.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.700
See if you've lost eye contact.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.010
If you have, focus on the person
who you lost eye contact with

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.970
and say, I must
be confusing you.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.070
Can I answer any
question you've got?

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.050
You've got to pull people out.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.740
You've got to get everybody
in the room along with you

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.944
nodding their heads, because
the more they nod their head

00:21:47.944 --> 00:21:50.360
and agreeing with you, the
more likely at the end, and all

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.770
I want is $25
million, and I'm going

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.410
to give you 10% of my company.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.770
It's a great deal.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.770
So seriously, that's
like sales 101.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.760
Get them nodding their heads.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.860
Look at everybody in the eye.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:09.330
Be bold, be confident, use
passion, change your pitch

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:13.180
and elevation, do whatever
you have to do-- histrionics,

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.190
get their attention.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.730
Focus them on what
you're saying.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.080
So Joe has basically
covered the elements.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.540
And this isn't the right order.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:30.690
This isn't maybe Joe's order
fir a business plan or even

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.400
a pitch, but basically, you
want to have these things.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.550
You want to have the hook.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.050
The hook as to be an
exciting statement.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.670
You know, hey, I
think we did fusion.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:43.860
It's in my basement.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.770
What?

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.030
Then talk about it.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.480
Then you need to
have your solution.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.950
Your solution is, we
have a great product.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.807
It's using this technology,
using all these things

00:22:54.807 --> 00:22:55.723
in the elevator pitch.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.680
Not everybody will
agree with my order,

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.150
but this is the order I like.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.360
What's your magic?

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.850
Don't wait to talk about the
technology at the very end,

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.450
and don't do it right up front.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.420
Hey, we solved
this implant issue.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.331
Talk about why it's
exciting, what's

00:23:16.331 --> 00:23:18.330
the market, what problem
are you going to solve,

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.540
and we did it with
this unbelievably

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.200
great new technology,
fresh out of the labs.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.480
Or wherever it came from.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.420
Or a new chip or whatever it is.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.134
Talk about the magic
and technology,

00:23:30.134 --> 00:23:32.550
so the technologists can get
excited and go, yes, what are

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.390
you going to do with it now?

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.220
Then go into the
business model, and then

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.550
more detail, the
marketing and sales issue.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.570
You really have to
have a credible way

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.070
to sell what you've got.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:49.910
You've got to have a credible
way to channel it or retail it

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.030
into the customer's hands.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.260
How are you going to
be successful at that?

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.880
There's a lot of great
products that need

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.830
to be sold through Home Depot.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:03.700
And Home Depot has thousands
of these ideas coming in,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.777
and then they, one by one,
nope, no time for you, go away.

00:24:06.777 --> 00:24:08.610
Nope, no, and then what
are you going to do,

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:10.890
with all of your channel
strategies closed off?

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.120
Have a credible
solution for that.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.870
Talk about the competition.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:19.980
If it's a new product,
never been sold before,

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.990
well, that could
be nice, but you've

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:25.520
got to spend a huge
amount of money and time

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.925
and your personal capital
creating a new niche,

00:24:28.925 --> 00:24:31.050
or a new market for this.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.540
You don't know how hard that is.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.748
It's going to be really hard.

00:24:33.748 --> 00:24:35.590
If nobody's buying
this sort of thing now,

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.340
you have to-- look
at Dean Kamen.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.750
The Segway.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.450
Remember everybody
got all excited?

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.520
I mean, my home in Boulder,
we had activists saying,

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.110
we don't want Segways
riding down my sidewalk.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.550
And they had protests.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.620
Dean didn't realize
how hard it was

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.240
to create a whole new market
where the whole country stops

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.680
driving and uses Segways.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.210
It didn't work at all that way.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:05.310
He was trying to create a whole
new approach towards travel.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.700
Very difficult. If it's a
substitution, then who are we

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.787
substituting against
and why are you better?

00:25:10.787 --> 00:25:13.120
Because we're 10 times cheaper,
faster, better, smaller.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.100
All those sorts of things.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:21.210
And I have management
here, not at the top.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.700
Why?

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.140
Because I don't care who
you are unless I really

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.080
am excited about
your ideas, and then

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.020
I want to know who you are.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.550
Where'd you were
to come from, how

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.960
do I know you've got to take
my money and spend it wisely?

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.270
Have you done this before?

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.250
Then give me all
your credentials,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:45.250
but not until I'm
greedy, because I

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.360
want some of your stock,
please, and now, who are you

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.900
and what's your team?

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.600
| at that point it's credible.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.840
If you hit them too soon
with here I am an all

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.840
that, without knowing whether
they're excited or greedy yet,

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.570
they're going to
not listen to it.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:05.130
I won't listen to it
I'm going to skip it.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.090
Then go over your financials.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.950
What are you going to do
with the money that you get?

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.240
How are you going to spend it?

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.680
Is it a credible timeline you
have for spending that money,

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.840
or are you going to
run out of money?

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.340
Which is a problem,
because then you

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.860
have to stop what you're doing
and go raise money sooner,

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.380
than later, and
stop the company.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.244
Then go over your status
and your timeline.

00:26:28.244 --> 00:26:29.410
Have you built anything yet?

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.360
Do you have any prototypes?

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.600
When are you going
to have it done?

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.475
How do you know you're
going to have it done?

00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:35.530
Is it a credible timeline?

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.480
What people have you lined
up to build this thing?

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.990
Status and timeline.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:46.310
And then don't forget-- a
lot of people forget this,

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.000
at the very end, the offer.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.810
You have to make the offer.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.770
What is that offer?

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.847
And for all this cool
stuff, and the $100 million

00:26:56.847 --> 00:26:58.680
we're going to make
over the next five years

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.800
with this product,
I'm going to give you

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.320
10% of my company
for $25 million.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.240
And we're looking at
closing in the next 60 days,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.390
and oh, by the way, we're
talking to four other venture

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.956
capitalists and three of
them are quite interested.

00:27:15.956 --> 00:27:17.080
Love to hear back from you.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.780
Make the request, which is the
offer of your stock for money.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.740
A little bit about the hook.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.150
When you very first
meet somebody,

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:35.770
you've got about seven
seconds to engage,

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.170
to make them excited about
hearing the rest of what

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.410
you have to say.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:45.910
So that hook could be
whatever the cool part

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.360
of your technology or
product is going to be.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.540
The hook could be-- imagine
a safe rubber coding

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.482
that conducts electricity.

00:27:54.482 --> 00:27:56.690
Wait a minute, why would I
need-- well, before I say,

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.190
but how do you--
OK, keep talking.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.360
So that's a hook.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.340
An example of a hook.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.640
Have you ever felt threatened?

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.620
Wow, what kind of a question--
yes, of course I have.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.350
Are you threatening me?

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.778
No, we have a solution for you.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.990
Our box is 10 times smaller,
faster, cheaper, better

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.570
than this.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.900
Oh, cool, the next
generation of that.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.900
People will want that.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.370
Anyway, that's kind of a hook.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:33.750
So think about
what is your hook?

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.940
What is your bold
statement that's

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.590
going to wake me up and stop
what I'm doing and listening

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:46.930
to you, whether it's an elevator
or the beginning of a pitch.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:53.270
So no geek speak.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.567
No geek speak.

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:56.400
What does that mean?

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.190
I've had lots and
lots of pitches,

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.900
and they start off
with technical jargon.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.290
And that's the
wrong thing to do,

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.200
because then my job is
now, pull out of you,

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.960
why am I greedy about that?

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.330
You need to explain it simply.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.520
This is a real example.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.480
"Our technology is the first
integrated automatic book

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.520
scanner that will scan and
digitize bound documents

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.603
at a speed of 1,200 pages
per minute at a fraction

00:29:24.603 --> 00:29:26.025
of the cost of
existing solutions,

00:29:26.025 --> 00:29:28.400
based on destructive digital
imaging technology initially

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.160
developed at Bell Labs"-- Bell
Labs isn't around anymore--

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.050
"and protected by 12 patents."

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:39.470
That's the wrong way to start a
pitch about what you're doing.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:43.720
A better approach is, we enable
massive knowledge sharing.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.400
We're going to digitize
all the physical libraries

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.770
at an incredibly low cost,
and there's people lined up

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.430
who want this technology.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.660
So that's what I
mean by geek speak.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.620
Focus of the pitch.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:06.660
So again, it's really tempting
to talk about the technology

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:11.690
improvements, or
the technology that

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:16.000
is going into your product,
and how exciting it is,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.880
but you've got to convert that
into something that customers

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.220
really will care about.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.500
So talk about the
customer benefits, not

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.200
the tech benefits.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.090
The tech benefits-- if you
talk about the tech benefits,

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.090
it's a so what?

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.060
Why do I care about this
next generation of thing

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.950
that you're building
or producing?

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.580
It has to have benefits
for the customer.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.220
If it's telecom improved
network utilization,

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.010
this is scalable and adaptable.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.790
It integrates well,
seamless integration.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:47.230
The figures of merit that
a buyer are interested in,

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.660
not just the fact that this
is a cool next generation

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.807
technology.

00:30:51.807 --> 00:30:54.140
And then you've got to talk
about the business benefits.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:59.290
And the business benefit--
every business has pain,

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.160
and you have to find
what the pain point is.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.070
You're in pain.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.000
I can heal your pain.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.010
I have something that's going
to make things better for you.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.020
And it usually has to
boil down to a dollar.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:20.670
You have pain that's costing you
$700,000 a year in something,

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.260
and my product, my
device, my process,

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.660
whatever you're selling
can cut that in half,

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.260
and I can prove it to you.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.320
So that's a pain point.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.210
Increase revenues
or decrease costs.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:38.710
Everything's got to
boil down to a dollar.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:39.240
A dollar.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.480
Your technology
is not important.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.820
It's what that can do for a
business or a customer that

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.240
can reduce their pain, and
that's usually evidenced

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.770
by costing them money.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:58.160
And you're either going to make
them money or save them money.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.810
Style.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.540
If you're making a
pitch, either you've

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.470
got to be the best
presenter of your team,

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.280
or find the best
presenter of your team

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.860
and let that person do it.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.770
It's best if the founder
or the CEO does it.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.490
I haven't seen a
whole lot of companies

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.570
that aren't led by the founder
or the CEO making the pitch.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:30.030
So between the two of you,
unless you're the same person,

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:31.500
get good at making the pitch.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.425
Be the best presenter.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.930
If you're not the
egghead, have the egghead

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:42.640
in the room on a
really short leash.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.280
Because they're going to
get into the rat holes.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.950
They love rat holes.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.020
I love a rat hole.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.700
I have to sometimes wake up and
go, stop talking about that.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.100
You're excited about
it, nobody else is.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.170
But be prepared to ask the
one-off technical question.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:02.390
Exactly what frequency
will that resonate?

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.136
Tell them.

00:33:04.136 --> 00:33:07.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.660
I said this earlier.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:13.240
Give firm answers, even if
you don't have the answer.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.600
Don't sound hesitant, like,
oh we hadn't thought of that.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.860
Crushing defeat.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:25.030
If you don't have an answer,
say, let me get back to you.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.690
I'll get back to
you in 24 hours.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.060
I think I know the answer.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.020
Or the answer is, yes of course,
we've always been that way

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.710
and we always will, or
no, that's not a problem,

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:37.660
and here is why.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.630
Be firm in your
answer, smile, I mean,

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:46.296
don't get angry, smile, and
say yes or no, but be firm.

00:33:46.296 --> 00:33:49.070
Have the presence
to be confident,

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.734
because you're asking
for their money,

00:33:51.734 --> 00:33:53.150
and they want to
give it to people

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:57.340
who are firm and confident
and all those nice things.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.190
I talked about looking
at everybody in the room.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:01.366
Try to grab their eyeballs.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.930
Practice that.

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.780
By the way, if you've
never given a speech

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.840
in front of a large
audience, the best confidence

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.960
builder before you start the
speech is, look at everybody

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.699
in the room beforehand, at the
bottom or wherever you are,

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:22.949
look at everybody in
the room, and pretend

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.510
like they're an old buddy.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:27.110
They're an old friend.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:31.230
And you won't any trouble
with confidence or locking up

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.480
or things like that.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.310
Try it.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.920
Do your homework,
like I said earlier.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.080
Know who you're talking to.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.190
And practice your pitch.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.330
Practice it.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.210
Have all the points
at your fingertips.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.580
Be ready to go over
them at any time.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.100
And then pull questions
out of the quiet people.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.940
Even if, you can tell, this
person does not like me

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.590
or what I'm doing or anybody
that I brought up here,

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:01.630
still, pull them out.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.305
Ask questions.

00:35:02.305 --> 00:35:03.930
Because if nothing
else, you will learn

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.250
what they don't like about you.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.166
They might say, well, I
don't understand that.

00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:09.637
You said that, I
don't believe it.

00:35:09.637 --> 00:35:11.470
You may not be able to
convince that person,

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.210
but make sure
everybody in the room

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:14.930
has been able to say
something, or ask

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:20.700
them a question of these
venture capitalists.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.200
OK, here's some pitch examples.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.900
You saw some earlier from
Joe, here are some more.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.730
Good and bad.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.600
Name are changed to
protect the innocent.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.490
This was a pitch made to me,
I think, in 2003 or 2004.

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.640
don't do what they did.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.020
So here's a company,
CyberEx LLP.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.050
Here's the executive summary.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:49.130
Remember, the year
is, I think, 2004.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:52.030
The year was 2004.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:55.320
What they're
telling me, in 2005,

00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:00.350
we'll have customers, and in
2007 $60 million in sales.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:01.420
How about that.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.572
2007, investor IRR
greater than 200%,

00:36:04.572 --> 00:36:06.030
you all are going
to get money back

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.135
and the investors are
going to be happy.

00:36:08.135 --> 00:36:12.560
What a terrible, terrible pitch.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.960
It's insulting.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.090
You're telling me this is
what's going to happen.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.080
You haven't even told
me what you do yet,

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.880
and you're telling me how much
money I'm going to make on it.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.370
Please.

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:26.390
And here's the people-- the next
slide is, here's who we are.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:29.200
I don't know what you do, but
you're telling me who you are.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.140
So we got Aunt May, Peter
Parker, Doctor Octopus,

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.830
and here's our advisory board.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:37.810
Great.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:41.990
I see all the backgrounds, is
it relevant to what you do?

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:43.480
I don't know yet.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.690
I don't know what you do.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.440
So, now maybe they're going
to get to what they do now.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.320
Let's see.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.400
Sentinel eStrand technology.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.290
What does that mean.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.320
"Dynamically adjusts
to block emerging"--

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.300
what kind of threats?

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.940
Emerging threats, holy cow!

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.160
DNA, I see DNA.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.130
They're a medical
product company.

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:07.610
There's DNA there.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.840
Special ISTAT-- is
that like a statin?

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.760
ISTAT detects mutation--
oh, that sounds terrible.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.000
Mutations,
immunization of-- spam?

00:37:19.565 --> 00:37:20.065
Spam.

00:37:20.065 --> 00:37:23.645
There's a DNA, Powerful
[INAUDIBLE] Identify Spam.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.060
Don't do that.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.430
And then CyberEx
technology benefits.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.990
"The sentinel technology
provides complete cyber

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:37.650
messaging"-- this
is a lot of words.

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.220
This isn't 30 point font, is it?

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.050
No, not exactly.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.910
So, OK.

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:46.325
This meeting ended really fast.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:56.870
This is a good example
of an on-the-spot pitch

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.770
made by somebody in a company
I helped start up in Boulder.

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:03.760
Everybody's heard of
the internet of things?

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.460
You have the [? Hue ?]
light bulb and shades

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.650
and the lights that you
can control in your house,

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.070
and the Nest thermostat,
all that sort of thing.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.770
The house is being
filled up with

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:17.340
smart, intelligent,
IP-addressable, programmable

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:17.910
objects.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:19.320
It's really cool.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.180
But if you have
15 things that are

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.780
programmable in your home
that do things automatically,

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.260
you need 15 apps to do it.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.560
So we have a company
in Boulder that's

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.440
integrating all these
addressable things,

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.910
programmable so things
can talk to each other.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:39.064
This is an example of
a fairly decent pitch.

00:38:39.064 --> 00:38:39.730
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.498
-Brought to you by Toyota.

00:38:41.498 --> 00:38:47.980
--[INAUDIBLE] CES 2014 at Digital
Experience is the [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.389
And I found Mike from Revolve.

00:38:51.389 --> 00:38:52.850
Hi, Mike, how are you?

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:54.285
-Good, Sharon, how are you?

00:38:54.285 --> 00:38:55.285
-Doing great, thank you.

00:38:55.285 --> 00:38:57.130
Now Revolve, I hear
that this is going

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.911
to make my life so much easier.

00:38:58.911 --> 00:38:59.410
I'm excited.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:02.970
Please, tell me how this
makes my life easier.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:06.370
-Well, Revolve is essentially a
smart home automation solution,

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.200
focused on taking those
premium devices like Philips

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.080
Hue, [INAUDIBLE]
Nest, and Sonos,

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.910
bringing them all together
under a single application

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.660
and then allowing you to
automate them in ways that you

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.815
can't do with just a single
native application that

00:39:19.815 --> 00:39:20.790
comes with those.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:22.110
-Oh, that's excellent.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.930
I have like 10 of these
apps sitting around at home

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.360
because I have the
Hue, I have Sonos,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.356
and It drives me nuts that
I have to skip from one app

00:39:30.356 --> 00:39:31.390
to another.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.807
So is this easy for consumers?

00:39:33.807 --> 00:39:35.640
-It's really easy, and
actually, again, it's

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.386
direct to consumer play.

00:39:37.386 --> 00:39:40.140
So, if you want, I'll walk
you through how easy it is.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.160
We pride ourselves
on 60-second setup,

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.800
and you'll be up and running,
discovering your devices

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.110
and being able to control them.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:47.040
-OK, I'm counting.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.850
Do it.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:48.720
-All right.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.330
So here we set the app here.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:51.850
And the first thing
that you'll see

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.480
is that we essentially
allow you to just plug

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.730
in the hub in a central
location in the home.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.510
You're not tied to
your router, is often

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.657
in the basement or
some obscure place.

00:40:02.657 --> 00:40:04.490
And the reason was we
wanted to get the best

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.690
signal to talk to all the
devices that you have.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:08.271
So the key, though
is getting this

00:40:08.271 --> 00:40:09.520
onto your local Wi-Fi network.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.900
And what we've done is created
a proprietary technology

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.550
that essentially takes
your Wi-Fi credentials

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:19.580
that you that you have
on your iPhone or iPad

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.130
and then transmits that
optically to the hub.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:25.280
So if you just enter
our password, hit done,

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.910
replace the iPad right
onto the hub and optically,

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:32.560
it's transmitting the data to
the hub, and within 30 seconds,

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.832
we'll get notification
that the hub is now

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:36.750
on your local WiFi network.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:38.890
And as soon as it does,
it'll automatically

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.670
start discovering
these great devices

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:44.450
like Sonos, Nest, Phillips Hue.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:45.594
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:45.594 --> 00:40:47.760
STEPHEN PEARSE: It goes on
for another minute or so.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.450
[INAUDIBLE] kind of cool.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.930
I like that show.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:55.420
So that's an example
of how you get

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.900
to the point, talk about why do
I care about your technology?

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.970
If you have things
in your home that

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.470
needs to be controlled
or automated,

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:03.790
but they don't
talk to each other

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.520
because they're from
different manufacturers,

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.490
that's the solution.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:09.220
And he gets to
the point quickly.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:14.510
Here's another example of
a presentation or a pitch

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:18.380
that we did in the year 2000
to telecommunications company.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:23.550
We built a box that was 10
times faster, smarter, smaller,

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:27.800
better, than the Nortel
box, where I had just left.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.370
And this is an
example of how you

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.200
might want to use
pictures and clearly

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.830
talk about the superlatives
of what you're trying to sell.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.520
So talk about a big,
total addressable market.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.850
Now, remember, this
was a long time ago.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:48.400
In 2008, the prediction
was, this kind of technology

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.570
was going to be huge.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:53.430
So therefore, we need a
product in that space.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:59.080
And why is the stuff that you're
competing against terrible?

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.100
Talk about why things
are terrible today.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.000
And then talk about
why what you're selling

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.030
is being purchased,
and people want it,

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:13.770
but they want it faster,
cheaper, smaller, better.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:17.400
And then talk about the
evolution of how your product--

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.450
and how the history of
the technology, inevitably

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.970
is going to lead to what
you're trying to sell.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:25.430
So you want to show a nice
picture showing things

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:29.520
getting better and faster,
and more products later on.

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.200
And then in our case, we're
simplifying the telephone

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.100
central office, so we show how
complicated things are now,

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.400
and how the picture gets
a little simpler when

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.830
you buy our product.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.250
Keeping it simple.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.650
Now, all these things were
technical, kind of jargony,

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:47.460
but the audience
we were pitching to

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.650
knew it intimately,
because that was

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:52.190
the big bubble at that time.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:54.840
Fiber optics and
telecommunications.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.750
And everybody knew
a lot about it.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:00.190
But I try to keep it even
simpler than what they might--

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:04.060
they were being given
pitches of terribly complex,

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.240
brand new protocols, new-wave
division-- experimental stuff.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.570
We kept it simple.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.630
And I think that's
one of the reasons why

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.240
we had lots of customers
and we had lots of money

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.000
coming in, because we
made our value proposition

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.248
compelling, simple, and easy.

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:25.702
I'll talk about that later.

00:43:25.702 --> 00:43:27.035
When do you want to raise money?

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.850
So you always, always,
always, always get money

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:37.360
when you do not need money.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.890
Why?

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:41.960
What if I just had a round not
too long ago, I got $2 million

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.640
in the bank, and I'm good
for another nine months,

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.560
a year, now's a good time to
start raising money again,

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.680
because people who
have money don't want

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.750
to give it to you under duress.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.930
If you're going to run out of
money in six months, and it

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.690
takes six months
to close a deal.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:07.500
And assume it's going to
take six months for you

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.590
to start your campaign
and close a round.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:13.726
If that's the case, then
by the time you close,

00:44:13.726 --> 00:44:15.350
you're going to be
almost out of money,

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.760
and if somebody holds up the
deal or bargain or whatever,

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.150
your company's done, or
you start laying people off

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.690
and you lose all your momentum.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:26.270
So always start raising
your money and plan

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:30.510
to close around at least six
months before you really need

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:31.010
it.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.320
How do you raise money?

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:39.120
Let's go to this VC,
oh, they said no.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.460
Let's go to that
VC, oh they said no.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.930
Do you do it serially
or in parallel?

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:49.250
You not only have to
do it in parallel,

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:52.400
but you have to
orchestrate it in parallel,

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.590
because this is important.

00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:01.832
If you go to one or two VCs and
spend a month or so with them,

00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:03.540
and they're kind of
dragging their heels,

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.342
and then you go
to the next ones,

00:45:06.342 --> 00:45:07.800
and the next ones
are saying, well,

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.450
what did the first one say?

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:10.830
Well, they're thinking about it.

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:12.540
How long did-- OK.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:16.470
They see hesitancy on some other
people, some other investors'

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.845
part, they're going
to make them hesitant,

00:45:18.845 --> 00:45:20.220
and all of a
sudden, everything's

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.090
being strong along.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.960
Everybody's waiting
to see, well,

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:27.150
why didn't they-- if you do
everybody at the same time,

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:31.400
nobody knows what hand
is being dealt where,

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.219
what potential partners might
be thinking, because you often

00:45:35.219 --> 00:45:36.760
don't get money from
just one person.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.720
You get it from several
venture capitalists,

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.160
and they want to
team and partner.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.720
You want to create this feeding
frenzy all at the same time.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.414
Hey, did you get a
pitch by this company?

00:45:46.414 --> 00:45:47.830
They're going to
do you next week?

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:49.770
Let's talk about them
right afterwards.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.500
They'll talk, they'll
compare notes,

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.340
and you're just more
likely to end up

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.090
with a really successful
high valuation

00:45:56.090 --> 00:46:01.080
if you orchestrate your pitch.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.560
Don't dribble it out.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.370
Do it all at once
at the same time,

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:08.600
get all the feedback at the
same time, and hit it hard.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:14.640
Again, assume it's going to take
six months to close a round.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.490
Signal to noise.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:18.770
Why should they pay
attention to you?

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:21.430
You have a nice,
pretty business plan

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:24.010
and a pitch deck, why won't
they return your calls?

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:25.330
Because they don't know you.

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:31.020
And most pitches come
across their desks

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.600
and they throw it away.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.860
So you really need to
have a differentiator.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.580
You need to be introduced or
have somebody do something

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.020
that gets their attention.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:44.460
Or maybe an article in
a newspaper or something

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.310
like that, to get
their attention.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.180
Think about what
signal you're going

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.500
to punch through the noise
that they're hearing every day,

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.470
If you can be introduced
because so-and-so

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:57.760
knows somebody in this
venture capital partnership,

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.650
that's the best way.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.800
So hand out a lot of
cards, meet people

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.940
go to social
networking functions

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.320
where VCs and angels
are going to be.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.920
An angel is a great way to
get introduced to big money,

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.300
to the venture capitalists.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.120
Because chances
are, the good ones

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.536
have worked with
them before, too.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:25.490
Oh, you've got two good offers
from two venture capital

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:26.300
companies.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.650
Yay!

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:31.500
One is better than the other.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.300
One is better than the other.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.760
What should you think
about when you decide

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.740
whose money should I take?

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.510
Does it matter?

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:41.510
One's a better offer.

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:44.740
One is going to give you $25
million for 10% of the company.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.110
The other is going to
give you $25 million

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:49.460
for 15% of the company.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.785
Hey, that's my company
you're taking there.

00:47:51.785 --> 00:47:53.900
I want that.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.210
What do you think about?

00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:58.550
Go for the best offer?

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:00.630
It really depends.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:05.870
If one is a mid-level, not
so well-known venture capital

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:10.950
company, and the other
is a super top-tier, NEA

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:17.960
or one with a great track
record and history of getting

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.680
their companies acquired,
you should probably

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:26.120
go with the name brand because
they can make deals happen.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.810
They can bring in money
for the next round.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.270
They have a cachet.

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.550
That's hard to compete with.

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:35.300
That's my belief.

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:39.490
And don't focus too much
on the equity dilution,

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:44.490
because chances are,
founders and CEOs,

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:46.550
even if you have a
highly diluted round,

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.870
they don't want you to
walk away or lose interest.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:52.800
They're going to
re-up your percentage.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.650
So good management tends to
keep a big hunk of the company,

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:58.890
no matter how many
rounds you go through.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:01.480
So don't focus too
much about dilution.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:05.430
It's important to focus
on it, but not too much,

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:08.130
Anybody know what this means?

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:14.690
C-F-I-M-I-T-Y-M. There's usually
someone who knows what that

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:16.630
means.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:22.820
Cash Is More Important
Than Your Mother.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.060
Ever heard that term?

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:28.490
Finance people use
it all the time.

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:31.510
Cash is really,
really important.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:33.570
Cash flow.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.590
The fastest way to
kill your company

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:38.020
is not pay attention
to cash flow.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.990
Wait a minute-- we have
orders pouring in like crazy.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.670
Everything's going great.

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:46.250
What do you mean, we're dead?

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:47.380
We have to shut the doors?

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.660
Because you can go bankrupt
if you're not paying attention

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.740
to cash flow, and you
need emergency debt,

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.740
and you scared off the
investors from giving you

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.250
a bridge loan because you
weren't paying attention

00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:59.870
to the business.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:05.020
So if you don't
want to hire a CFO,

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:09.325
have a good rental-- and a lot
of startups just rent a CFO,

00:50:09.325 --> 00:50:11.200
but make sure they're
paying attention to it.

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.080
Flexibility and pivots.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.810
You're not going
to end up selling

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:22.120
the product you think you are.

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.320
In fact, the company
probably is not

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:28.450
going to be the company
you think you're building.

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:33.110
A very large percentage, and
no one has the data statistics,

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:38.800
but I think most startups end
up, at some point, pivoting.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.160
Pivoting a little
bit, pivoting a lot.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:46.050
We were going to build-- this
company, Revolve in Boulder.

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:47.850
They came to me
and said, we want

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:53.300
to build an internet-addressable
irrigation system.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.960
Well, OK, that's interesting.

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.640
Nest is building the
thermostat, and now they're

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.690
building fire alarms and
stuff, and maybe irrigation

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.700
is important, too.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.240
But we talked, and
I convinced them

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.900
that there is a bigger problem.

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.550
And you can be the one.

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.850
The ring that rules all
devices in the home.

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:16.040
You can build this product,
because you guys are all

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.970
[? ex-Amber ?] people, and
you know how to do wireless,

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:22.260
and we have seven radios in
the box and can control every

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:24.730
protocol in the universe.

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:26.690
You can do it!

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:28.690
And they went and built it.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:29.980
They pivoted.

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:32.990
They were building
this irrigation system.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:36.190
So you might end up having to do
that once or maybe even twice.

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:37.930
Don't be afraid
of being flexible.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:42.540
Don't be afraid of taking
rapid customer feedback.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:46.710
Use the lean, Eric Ries'
lean startup methodology.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:48.060
Do a lot of prototypes.

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:48.935
Show it to customers.

00:51:48.935 --> 00:51:50.143
What do you think about that?

00:51:50.143 --> 00:51:52.940
Well, I don't like the color,
or I don't like that button.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.680
Whatever it is, take
that feedback quickly,

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.680
build more prototypes,
and don't be

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.322
afraid to change course
in what you're building.

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:06.640
A few more success factors.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.640
So intellectual property.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.630
I have five patents.

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:15.240
I really don't care,
because patents have never

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:19.720
successfully, in my experience,
or most VCs I've talked to,

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.180
has never successfully
defended anything.

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:27.240
In fact, most of
the patents that

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:31.490
startups pull out
of universities end

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:36.410
up being handed back later,
either because the terms are

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:38.280
too onerous, from
the university,

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.399
I want so much thousands
of dollars a year.

00:52:40.399 --> 00:52:42.190
Well, I'm going to
figure out a way how not

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:44.140
to have to give that to you.

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:48.120
But anyway, IP is good
and it's important,

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.030
and some people who
might buy your company

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:52.240
may say, thank you, I
would like that patent

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.840
as part of my war chest
to defend this or that.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.160
It could be important.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.210
But speed is far more
important than patents.

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:03.010
Outrun your competitors.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:05.620
Even if everybody
steals your idea

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.310
and they're building
it right away,

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:12.300
and they're stealing all
your intellectual property,

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.390
if you beat them to the
market, first mover will win.

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:20.050
Just be first, be
fast, be the best.

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:25.390
So focus more on speed
than intellectual property.

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:27.857
Think about the mission.

00:53:27.857 --> 00:53:28.690
What is the mission?

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:31.410
Well, isn't the
mission in the pitch?

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:34.300
No, it's really not.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.647
The mission is when you
sit down with your team

00:53:36.647 --> 00:53:38.230
and go, what are we
trying to do here?

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:40.590
Oh, well, we want to build this
box, we want to sell a million

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:41.150
of them.

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:45.441
No, what are we really
trying to do here?

00:53:45.441 --> 00:53:46.190
What are we doing?

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:48.023
Well, we want to change
the way people think

00:53:48.023 --> 00:53:52.550
about this whole field, or we
want to change the way people

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:56.030
interface with their
home, or what is

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:58.230
it you're really trying to do?

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:01.820
And you're using a technology
for right now to do it,

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.560
but later on you may
move on to other things.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.190
But what are you
really trying to do?

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:08.690
Figure out your mission
statement, word for word.

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:10.910
Figure it out.

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:11.920
How am I doing on time?

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.430
Am I out?

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:18.530
I'm out?

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:19.030
I'm good?

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:21.130
OK, all right.

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:22.120
The team.

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:22.640
The team.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:29.742
Really, venture capitalists
do look at the team,

00:54:29.742 --> 00:54:31.950
and a lot of them say, yeah,
the most important thing

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:36.780
is the team and we're
betting on the team.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.844
Well, really, they
want your idea

00:54:38.844 --> 00:54:40.010
to make them a lot of money.

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:41.460
That's the most important thing.

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:47.470
But the team can pivot or be
flexible and have the integrity

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:51.620
to be able to handle
shocks, whether it's a money

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.050
shock or a technology shock.

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:57.630
Or we just came to market and
so did three other companies.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:58.560
What do we do now?

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.940
Do we buckle or are we tough?

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.290
Is this team going
to stick with it?

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:05.090
Are we going to work
whatever we have to?

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:06.672
The team is really important.

00:55:06.672 --> 00:55:08.380
Think about that as
you're assembling it.

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:12.990
Make sure the chemistry works.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:16.890
There will be the
time when you'll

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:19.210
have founder versus CEO issues.

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:21.730
Who's really running this
company, or this is my baby,

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:22.760
or whatever.

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.124
Or you'll have hires of
people who you really

00:55:25.124 --> 00:55:26.540
like, but they're
not working out,

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.985
and what do we do with them?

00:55:28.985 --> 00:55:31.590
These things have to be
thought out well in advance.

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:33.620
You have to be able to
make the tough decisions.

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:35.380
And part of that
toughness has to be

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.780
displayed to the
venture capitalists,

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:39.080
to the people giving you money.

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.830
Yet you have to have
good answers for when

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:42.380
people-- what would
you do if this

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.660
were to happen with the team?

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.784
Have that thought out.

00:55:51.712 --> 00:55:53.670
How much money will it
cost to build a company?

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:55.290
That's part of
the business plan.

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:57.674
And how much money
you will you make us?

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:04.840
Also goes into your final exit
strategy when you go public.

00:56:07.336 --> 00:56:08.710
Think about what
happens when you

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:11.130
go-- have a credible
story when you go public.

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:12.930
Even if you end up
getting acquired,

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.370
always plan on going public.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.240
Just a few more real quick.

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:24.350
One of the things
about startups,

00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:25.724
if you don't have
any experience,

00:56:25.724 --> 00:56:28.220
it's really, really tough
to convince money people

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:29.790
that you know what you're doing.

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:33.330
So you have to surround
yourself with people who

00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:35.000
compensate for your weaknesses.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.590
If you want to be
the CEO of a company

00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:38.870
but you don't have any
experience in finance or sales,

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:43.070
whatever, this is my
team, and everybody rounds

00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:43.860
each other out.

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:46.664
You have to make sure you
answer that issue of, are

00:56:46.664 --> 00:56:48.330
you really ready for
this startup, based

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:51.160
on your experience level?

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:54.120
We talked about trying to
do it again after a failure.

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.300
Failure is not bad.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:59.670
In Silicon Valley,
it's a mark of courage.

00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:03.220
Speed and execution
are personality traits.

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.070
They really are.

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:07.569
If you don't come
across as high energy,

00:57:07.569 --> 00:57:09.110
I'm going to be a
hard time believing

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:11.390
that you have this as
a personality trait,

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:15.190
that you are going to get this
product done fast when you

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:16.310
say it's going to be done.

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:19.540
You're willing to put in the
late midnight oil, burning that

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.060
to get this thing out the door.

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.630
Try to convey that you're
capable of these things.

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:27.630
Focus, focus, focus.

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.630
The worst thing that
can happen to a startup

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:33.850
is, OK we started
out building this,

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:37.410
but oh, here's a shiny, pretty
little thing over there.

00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:39.600
And I'm going to start
going build that.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.440
Oh, wait a minute.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.370
I just read about
that, it's cool, too.

00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:45.440
That's losing focus.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:49.710
Sometimes you're going to be
forced to pivot because there's

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.342
a major block that you
didn't expect thrown up

00:57:52.342 --> 00:57:54.300
in front of you, and you
need to get around it.

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.600
You need to pivot around it and
move on to something similar,

00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.880
but you don't want to give
up one perfectly good thing

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:04.380
that you spent six months doing
just because something else

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.740
nicer and prettier came along.

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:07.800
So focus.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:08.950
You have to stay focused.

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:12.062
If somebody says, hey
boss, look at this.

00:58:12.062 --> 00:58:13.270
They just came out with that.

00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:14.860
Shouldn't we be building that?

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.380
Focus.

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:17.971
We're getting this done now.

00:58:17.971 --> 00:58:19.720
We're going to work
on it and that's that.

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:26.180
We talked about stock
dilution and control,

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.470
and not to worry
too much about that.

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:30.470
And then finally, take
help from your investors.

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:37.360
But investors probably aren't
going to be very helpful.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:40.030
You might think they are,
they might tell you they are,

00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:41.900
they're going to say
we're your buddies,

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:44.730
I love what you're doing, I
love you, I'm going to help you,

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:48.030
I'm going to roll up my
sleeves, and it's all BS.

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:49.116
They can't.

00:58:49.116 --> 00:58:50.490
They're doing too
many companies.

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:53.010
They're sitting
on too many boards

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:54.330
They know people.

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:56.950
Use the network and
use their connections.

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:59.950
At the next round,
have them help you.

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:03.710
Who you're partnering with now,
can we parade in front of them

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:04.670
as well?

00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:06.900
But they're not going
to help you that much.

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:09.820
Angel investors are more
likely to roll their sleeves up

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:12.820
because sometimes they're
retirees like me who

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:16.790
want to have fun and play with
gadgets and stuff like that,

00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:17.810
and they could help.

00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:21.100
But in general, the kind
of help from your investors

00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.840
is more who they know.

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.790
Customers and
networks and partners.

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:31.400
OK, so the bottom line is,
this all really boils down

00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.250
to leadership.

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:35.230
Whether it's technology
leadership, CEO leadership,

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:39.500
team management, you want to be
the leader in whatever you do.

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.520
So leadership wins.

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:46.980
In order to be a leader,
you've got to show passion,

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:51.970
you've got to be confident,
and you have to engage.

00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:54.880
You have to do
those three things.

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.160
You need to have
a call to action.

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.500
I'm going to go do this.

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.310
Do you want to be a part of it?

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:03.000
I can give you a
piece of my company.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.940
Love to have you
on board, but we're

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:06.530
going to change the world.

01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:09.500
You need to make
that pitch and then

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.880
you win the war, even if
you don't win that battle,

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.390
even if you don't get that VC.

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:17.484
The word will get out,
what you're trying to do,

01:00:17.484 --> 01:00:18.650
and you're going to do fine.

01:00:26.044 --> 01:00:27.384
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:27.384 --> 01:00:28.550
MODERATOR: Thank you, Steve.

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:29.630
STEPHEN PEARSE: Thanks, Joe.

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:30.320
Thank you, guys.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:35.470
And by the way, all of you can
be the next Tony Stark or Betty

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:36.570
Stark.

01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:39.890
We need another Tony
Stark, a female Tony Stark,

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:40.930
captain of industry.

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:42.127
So good luck, OK?

01:00:42.127 --> 01:00:42.960
Thank you very much.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.510
[APPLAUSE]
