00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.720
JOSEPH HADZIMA: OK, you
met the financing sources.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.909
You got a little bit
of an insight there.

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.200
Part of what you're going to
need when you talk to them

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.150
is some idea of what
the financials look

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.210
like for your business.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.770
And joining us tonight
to show you how

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.610
to do that is Charlie Tillet.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.290
Now, Charlie's been doing
this for-- he was in the $10K.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.310
I think he'll talk
about that a bit.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.240
CHARLIE TILLETT: Yep.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.660
JOSEPH HADZIMA: And I was
in-- I've been doing things

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.070
around the world-- I
was in Istanbul two

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.090
years ago, in a
setting with 25 teams

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.040
from around the Muslim world.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.340
And I was mentoring
a team from Pakistan.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.720
And I'm looking at
their slide deck,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.510
and I get to the financials,
and I say, where did you

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.346
get this template?

00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:10.470
And they didn't quite
understand what I was saying.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.840
And I'm looking at it,
it was Charlie's template

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.990
that he uses in the course.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.910
So his speeches here have
transformed financial plans

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.210
all over the world, in
Pakistan, and he's graciously

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.720
come back to talk to us.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.460
Charlie was the
person I mentioned

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.550
who I met outside of the MIT
Enterprise Forum meeting,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.690
and asked him what he was doing,
and that led to a whole career

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.560
with a bunch of
entrepreneurs up north.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.920
CHARLIE TILLETT: Yep.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.450
JOSEPH HADZIMA: And
I'll sort of let

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.500
you pick it up there, Charlie.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.130
CHARLIE TILLETT: OK, great.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.941
Thanks, Joe.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.280
What was the first
story he told?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.190
AUDIENCE: Jumping in
your pickup truck.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.273
CHARLIE TILLETT: OK, yeah.

00:01:51.273 --> 00:01:52.830
So we will get to that.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.440
So it's great to
be here tonight.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.365
I've got probably
twice as many slides

00:01:57.365 --> 00:02:01.210
as I should cover in my little
over an hour that I've got.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.320
So I'm going to go quick.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.560
But feel free to ask any
questions as we go along.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.310
And what I'll try and do is,
I wrote down a few notes,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.090
listening to the
panel, the great panel

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.330
that we had here,
maybe some terms

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.880
that they brought up
that they didn't really

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.170
give enough explanation
or background on.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.419
So I'm going to try to touch
on those as we go as well.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.710
So tonight we're going to
talk about your business plan

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.300
financials.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.740
Putting together that
critical spreadsheet

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.300
that you've got to have when you
walk into that meeting, right?

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.180
Or when you send
someone your deck,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.570
and how to put that together.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.860
But we're going to
step back a little bit.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.120
And as people say, I was a
CFO of a couple of companies.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.662
But part of my job was
being a salesperson.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.120
And what I would
do is I would walk

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.710
into these meetings with
a deck and with a team.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.990
But my job was to sell
that team to the investors.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.062
And in return, they
would give us money,

00:02:55.062 --> 00:02:56.270
and we would give them stock.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.000
But what we're really
selling is the team,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.690
and the concept of the business
that we're trying to build.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.390
Then, will talk about what
is your business model,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.430
and building your
financial projections.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.330
And so this template that
I'm going to show you tonight

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.030
is up on the website.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.769
There's a new
template this year.

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.310
It's got a little more detail
in terms of cost of goods sold,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.450
in case you're doing something
that's got more of a hardware

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.010
component.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.719
This gives a little
more detail on that.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.510
But that was what I
was trying to think of.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.700
So this template is
going to be out there, so

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.860
that you can download it.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.990
It's an Excel spreadsheet.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.989
You can start plugging
in your own stuff in it.

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.530
And I'll tell you
the things that you

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.867
need to take out when you
actually show it to someone.

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:42.450
And then, the last
part is we're going

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.150
to talk about sharing the pie.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.640
So I've added a couple
things to this talk

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.310
about putting together your
business plan spreadsheet.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.260
And one of them is talking
about the venture capital

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.610
perspective, and helping
you sit it in their shoes

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.120
and evaluate your opportunity.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.100
But also thinking about the
other uses or takers of equity

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.830
in your company.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.200
And by equity, I mean stock.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.320
So I've got couple
slides on here

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.040
on thinking about your
company, and all of the people,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.580
and all of the entities that
could potentially get stock

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.230
in your company,
and what that does

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.970
to your ownership
in the company.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.710
So my background is I was a
graduate from Sloan in '91.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.080
That was the inaugural
year-- oh, well, in 1990

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.810
was the inaugural year
of the $10K Contest.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.510
Well, it's now the $100K.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.400
And we were the
third place team.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.370
So rather than get,
you know, I think

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.720
it's now $20,000 or $30,000
worth of free legal service

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.040
and accounting
service, we got $300

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.940
to split between
the three of us.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.510
So since that wasn't enough
to start our business,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.220
we all went our separate ways.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.890
But what I did,
Joe introduced me

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.780
to some guys who had
an interesting idea

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.514
for some network
monitoring equipment.

00:05:07.514 --> 00:05:09.180
And they didn't really
know how to build

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.670
a business around that.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.970
And that experience
in the $10K Contest

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.700
was critical, because I'd
worked with these two guys.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.100
And we'd sat at the-- we didn't
have Wi-Fi at that time--

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.990
so we're sitting in
the computer lab,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.540
plugging it into a
spreadsheet late at night,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.030
going, well, if we increase
the sales price by this much,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.470
what does it do to our business?

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.657
If we are able to reduce
cost by this much,

00:05:36.657 --> 00:05:37.990
what does it do to our business?

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.580
How many salespeople
are we going to need?

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.460
And I went through
that whole exercise

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.830
of building that template for
the business plan contest.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.770
And because of that, I
had tremendous credibility

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.660
when I started.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.280
I knew what I was talking
about when I went in

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.610
to talk to these guys who
had this data communications

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.610
product.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.800
And I was able to
convince them that I could

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.170
help them build their model.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.730
And sure enough, I
was able to do that.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.767
But it was the entering
into the contest,

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:11.350
and working with the
team, and working

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.830
through all of that, that
helped give me that experience.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.630
The company was
NetScout Systems.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.300
We completed several
rounds of venture financing

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.780
there, and went public in 1999.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.626
I then got involved
with a dot.com

00:06:26.626 --> 00:06:29.770
company, which fortunately
didn't last too long.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.120
And then was at a
Homeland Security

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.630
company that made bomb detection
equipment for airports.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.450
So completely different
industry, but the same metrics.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.010
The same tools apply.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.930
The same spreadsheet that
I'd built to get NetScout

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.500
off the ground was
the same spreadsheet

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.810
that I used to get
Reveal off the ground.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.080
And it's the same spreadsheet
that you guys can all

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.060
use to get your
business off the ground.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.320
I raised $125 million in
more than 10 transactions

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.800
over that period.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.540
So you're probably
saying to yourself,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.320
I'm too busy to
do my financials.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.860
Right?

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.040
I've got more
important things to do.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.200
One, they're not going
to be right anyway.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.190
I mean, who can
sit here and say,

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.390
we're going to be able to be
spot on on our financials?

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.180
Right?

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.727
The second is, the VCs aren't
going to believe it anyway.

00:07:25.727 --> 00:07:27.310
They're going to
look at your numbers,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.500
and they're going
to say, they've

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.610
got their own ideas of this.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.080
And the third is, you've got
more important things to do.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.890
Building the team, figuring
out what the product is,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.140
and looking at who
your customers are.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.680
But the reality
is the financials

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.820
are the scoreboard, the
scorecard for your company.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.220
So if you don't know
what you're shooting for,

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.360
then how do you know
whether you're making

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.920
progress against those goals?

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.470
But the more important
thing is kind

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.860
of what I was
talking about with me

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.970
and my team in the $10K Contest.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.930
It helps you understand what
your key assumptions are,

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.910
because you've got to put those
assumptions into either numbers

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.200
or formulas.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.600
You've got to understand
what the drivers are.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.340
So if you're able to
increase prices by 10%,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.360
what does that do?

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.360
Is that an important
lever or not?

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.500
Or is it more important
to get your costs down?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.180
Or is it more important to
outsource your development

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.790
and get your R&amp;D spending down?

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.210
Is it more important to do
software as a service model,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.760
or sell it is a product?

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.690
And how do those things
impact how much cash

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.580
you're going to need?

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.660
So it's a great exercise that
helps you understand what's

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.860
going on in your business.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.990
Because as the CEO
of your company,

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.060
the number one
job is to maintain

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.360
the cash in the company.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.080
It's the oxygen supply.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.350
And without that, you could be
doing everything else right,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.490
but it doesn't take
long for people

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.000
to start walking
out the door when

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.680
they're not getting a paycheck.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.160
Now, your management
team-- we've

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.670
had those days where I
have to go to the guys

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.380
and say, hey, guys, there's
not going to be anything

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.920
in the envelope this week.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.050
But for your rank
and file employees,

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.290
you can't be missing payroll.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.510
And your vendors will only
let you stretch out payables

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.260
for so long.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:32.400
So you've got to know where
you stand with your cash,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.430
and what cash you need.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.290
So you don't need
to be an accountant,

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.370
but you've got to
understand these key terms.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.120
And you've got to be
able to discuss them.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.960
Because the investors
up here, they also

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.950
don't expect you to
be an accountant.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.980
But they do expect you
to understand the drivers

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.430
in your business, and what the
key metrics in your business

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.930
are.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.260
In Reveal Imaging--
Reveal Imaging

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.900
was a company that made
bomb detection equipment.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.350
And there we had an
all-star management team.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:09.210
We had five guys-- this
was founded in 2003,

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.050
18 months after 9/11--
we had five guys who'd

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.565
been in Homeland Security
for more than a decade each.

00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:17.940
So there were a
lot of people who

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.774
wanted to get into Homeland
Security on September 12, OK?

00:10:22.774 --> 00:10:24.190
But there were not
a lot of people

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.720
who were in Homeland Security,
the Homeland Security business,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.060
on September 10.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.250
And we had five of
those guys here.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.650
So we had a market opportunity.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:39.490
The Congress had said,
all passenger bags

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.500
that go on a passenger
airliner in the United States

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.710
have to be screened
for explosives.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.680
And we want a machine that
can automatically do that.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.900
We don't want people
looking at X-ray images.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.090
And there were
machines on the market.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.980
These guys had actually--
of the eight machines that

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.940
had been certified--
these guys had

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.930
been involved in getting four
of those machines certified.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.270
So we really had
an all-star team.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.510
They had come up with an
idea for a product that

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.890
was half the size of
the existing equipment.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.620
Also half of the throughput,
but half of the cost.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.280
And so those metrics were very
compelling for the smaller

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.340
airports like Burlington,
Vermont, or Nantucket, Mass,

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.920
rather than the Logan's.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.430
But there's 500 airports in
the country, and one by one

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.760
they were getting ticked
off by our competitors.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.770
So we had an opportunity
to get to market

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.410
that we had to get to fast,
because once those airports

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.000
were staffed with our
competitors' equipment,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.040
they were no longer
an opportunity.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.470
So we went out, and we
hit the ground running.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:46.500
And we started raising money
the first day we got together

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.770
as a management team.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.880
We raised an angel round within
90 days of $1 million dollars.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.830
And then, within six months, we
raised our first venture round.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:59.810
And it was a $5 million,
but it was in two tranches.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.200
The tranches were a
$5 million tranche,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.410
and a second $5 million tranche,
based upon hitting milestones.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.760
Because we wanted to raise
as much money as possible,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.170
but our investors were reluctant
to give us everything up front.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.990
So we reached this
compromise, where

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.630
we said, OK, we're going
to hit some milestones,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.850
and because we had
the financial plan,

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.950
and we knew how far $5
million would take us,

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.480
we knew what we could get done
before we ran out of money.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.700
And so we were able
to pre-negotiate

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:39.830
an increase in value upon
hitting that milestone.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.360
So it was kind of a
win-win, because we did not

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.130
have to spend-- once we
raised the $5 million,

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.110
we didn't have to immediately
start thinking about raising

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.270
the next $5 million,
because we had

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.510
that kind of in our hip pocket.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.970
All I can say is that,
as soon as we raised

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.760
a round of financing,
I started thinking

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.640
about the next financing
that we were going to do.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.480
It could have been
bank financing,

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.270
like an equipment
line, which is simply

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:11.680
as you buy equipment for
your manufacturing facility,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.190
or as you buy computers for
your software engineers,

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:20.150
you send a copy of the
invoice over to the bank,

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.250
and they will provide--
they will give you

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:29.730
90% of that money back-- and
you now have a loan to the bank.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.860
So it didn't look like a
lot of money, $500,000.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.530
But as we were getting close
to running out of money,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.410
and we hadn't met
that milestone there

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.420
we had committed to to
get the second $5 million,

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.400
that $500,000 was
very important to us.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.270
Because that gave us an
extra three months of runway

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.920
to get closer to the goal.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.680
So I'm going to kind of
take you behind the scenes

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.000
to think about what does
a venture capitalist want.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.840
When they put in
their money, they're

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.200
interested in getting 3x
to 5x absolute returns.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.080
So if they put $1 million
into your company,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.810
they want to get $3
million back to $5 million

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.060
back, on top of the $1 million.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.370
So they've got to get $4
million to $6 million back.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.800
And if it's $5
million, do the math.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.140
Their investment horizon
is five to seven years.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:37.900
And what I will say is that,
when you take venture money,

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.540
that clock starts ticking
the day that that money gets

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.450
wired into your account.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:50.690
And while five years
seems like forever,

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:55.720
the investors realize that five
years goes by in a heartbeat.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.500
And they will start
pounding you to run

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.780
faster than you think you can
possibly run from day one.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.150
And it's motivating,
and it's a great thing.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.100
And if you have
the right partners,

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.360
they're helping you
do the right things.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.400
But you got to
recognize that it's

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.080
going to be-- I think they
admitted up here-- it's

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.730
going to be a very
intense environment when

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:19.650
you take that money.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:26.410
So you better be prepared for
it when you take the money.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.080
They also want to get--
I mean, you heard up here

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.410
that they want to get a
significant amount of money

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:31.910
invested.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.300
It depends on the firm.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.390
Some firms might want
to put in $1 million,

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.100
some firms might want
to put in $5 million.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.291
It depends on the firm.

00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.040
But they want to have
a significant amount

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.240
of money invested.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.360
And they want to have a
significant ownership.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.051
So if $5 million
is their target,

00:15:49.051 --> 00:15:50.550
they don't want to
put in $5 million

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.890
and get 10% of the company.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.780
They want to have-- at an
early stage investment--

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.720
they want to have a
significant amount.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.430
So the formula to think
about how much equity

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:07.420
you have to give up is
the percentage of equity

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.730
that the venture
capitalists are going to get

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.030
is the money that they
invest-- and we'll

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.720
have some examples on
the next page-- divided

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.091
by the pre-money value plus
the money that they invested.

00:16:19.091 --> 00:16:20.090
Now, that's the formula.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.000
It doesn't really give you
the answer, because what's

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.380
the pre-money valuation?

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:31.460
But as you heard up here, kind
of where is the market today,

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.600
he was saying he sees
a lot of companies

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.030
in the $3 million to $6
million pre-money range, right?

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:43.780
So there is kind of a sense
of where the market is today,

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.600
and what other
companies are getting.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.440
But where that pre-money
valuation comes in,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.347
that's the key to
the negotiation

00:16:56.347 --> 00:16:57.180
that you have to do.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.650
The other part is how much
money they're investing.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.640
So if we look at a
couple of examples here.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.680
Say a Series A round, $5
million invested on a $5 million

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.170
pre-money.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:14.000
So we take the $5 million
invested, we add that

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.400
to the pre-money of $5 million.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.609
It's 5 over 10, it
comes out to 50%.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:20.960
If there's a Series B,
let's say it's $10 million

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.530
invested on a $15
million pre-money.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:29.090
That'd be $10 million over 10
plus 15, would be 10 over 25,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.480
or 40%.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.950
But recognize that when the
Series B money comes in,

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:39.820
the Series A investors get
diluted by the same 40%

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.060
that everyone else
gets diluted by.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.700
And I have an example
walking through that.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.530
Typically, the A
and the B investors

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.980
are going to be the same people.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.500
So the B investors are kind
of diluting themselves.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.260
But recognize that
that dilution happens.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.190
So don't think that you're
giving up 50% of your company,

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.920
and then 40% of your
company, and you're

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.170
left with 10% of your company.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:09.790
You're really left with
30% of your company, right?

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:14.670
So if an investor is looking
for three to five times

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.060
on their money, and
they've put $15 million in,

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:26.100
and they own 70% of
the company, then

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:31.730
three times the $15 million
invested is $45 million,

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.100
plus the original
$15 million back,

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.820
so they've got to
get $60 million.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.700
They own 70% of the company.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:43.980
So that company has to be valued
at $85 million to $130 million

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.480
for them to get
that type of return.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.640
And so in order to
get so that valuation,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.240
you've got to grow your
revenues to $40 to $60 million.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.940
So there's a lot of
businesses that you guys

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.680
could start that can grow to--
you know, another comment you

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.640
heard here was make
sure that your investors

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.230
and your opportunity and
your investment dollars

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:12.430
are aligned, right?

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.660
One of the big
problems was people

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:19.920
going after what turned out to
be a small opportunity with too

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.460
much capital.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.970
So the problem is, is that
once someone has $15 million

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:31.970
invested in your company, you've
got to go after the big return.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.380
So you could have
a business that

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.090
could be a great
business for you

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.780
and a couple of your MIT
pals that goes to $5 million

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.310
in revenue, or $10
million in revenue,

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.630
and there's three of you,
and you each own 33%,

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.135
and you have no outside income,
and no outside investors,

00:19:50.135 --> 00:19:51.300
and it's very profitable.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.330
It could be a
great business that

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.430
could be just a
gold mine for you,

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.790
but it would not be an
appropriate investment

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.900
for some of our panelists here.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.540
And if they had come
in as an investor,

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:09.530
then there's going to be a
mismatch, and a lot of tension.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:15.770
Because you can't get to a
happy place for both of you.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.180
So I know that this screen's a
little bit hard to read here,

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.070
but let me just walk you
real quickly through.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.420
If you've got a
founding group here

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.350
that has four million shares
between all of the founders,

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:34.870
they've got 100% of the equity,
and there's 100% right there.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:40.410
You then bring in some early
employees and give them--

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.910
and there'd be a
list, I have a list

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.490
in the back of showing kind
of who would get what--

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.980
but you have some
early employees,

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.890
and maybe some advisors,
that get a number of shares.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.930
And so already the founders
get diluted a little bit.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.580
They then bring
in an angel round

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.720
of $500,000 at a $4.5
million pre-money.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.600
So we know for our formula,
$500,000 divided by $5 million,

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.290
the angel investors
are going to get 10%.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:10.040
In this case, and in all these
cases, new shares are issued.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.080
The founders continue to own
their four million shares,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.790
but now there's five million
shares in the company,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.050
and the founders have
been diluted to 80%, OK?

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:25.390
We now have kind of the
classic A round venture

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.360
capitalists come in, and
they put in $5 million

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.170
at the $5 million that
I talked about earlier.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.930
They get 50%.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.980
But one of the
things that is going

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.190
to happen when the
A round comes in

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.720
is the investors
are going to want

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.930
to see that you
have an option pool

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:46.480
so that you can issue stock
options to your employees.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.540
Because all employees
like stock options,

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:55.110
and it provides extra
incentive to your employees.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.760
But the investors
are saying, we don't

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:03.100
want to be diluted for the
first 100 people that you hire.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.990
So you've got to
set aside options

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:10.270
to take care of those people
without them being diluted.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.460
So they still get their 50%, but
you've got to create this pool.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.690
And in my example, it's 12%.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:22.970
But it's somewhere in the
10% to 20% range, right?

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:28.110
And that's a topic for
discussion and negotiation

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.530
with your venture capitalists.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:33.490
Anything I'm saying wrong
here, feel free to hop in.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.420
So then we have our final
round is that $10 million

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.950
at $15 million, and
these investors get 40%.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.640
Notice the A investors
are now down to 30%,

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.340
and our founding team
is down to 18.2%.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.960
So this kind of walks you
through the progression

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:56.720
of how stock gets distributed
to both employees,

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.900
angel investors, and
venture capital investors.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.802
Yep?

00:23:00.802 --> 00:23:04.176
AUDIENCE: So the question I
have is other than the stock

00:23:04.176 --> 00:23:06.104
distribution, do
they get more control

00:23:06.104 --> 00:23:08.514
because they ask for
more seats on the board?

00:23:08.514 --> 00:23:11.888
Is that something which happens
a lot when the second round

00:23:11.888 --> 00:23:13.840
and third round happens?

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.610
CHARLIE TILLETT: So the question
is, do they-- so first off is

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:20.040
the investors are going to
get preferred shares that

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.780
have many more rights than
the common shares, OK?

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.240
And there will be
anti-dilution provisions,

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.010
there will be
ratchet provisions,

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.500
in case there's a down round.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.900
But probably the most important
thing that will always happen

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.150
is that they will get
board representation.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:42.480
And that is a little
bit of a negotiated--

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.080
it's not negotiated that they
have board representation,

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.150
but what I've seen is, so let's
say that you're the founder,

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.690
you say we have two
seats, the founders

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.750
have two seats on the board,
your venture capitalists

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.590
come in, they get two
seats on the board,

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.700
and then you agree that
the fifth board member

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.530
will be mutually agreed upon.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:07.860
And you've got to
figure out-- again,

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.140
if you have problems
deciding on a mutually

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:17.430
agreeable fifth board member at
this stage in the relationship,

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.900
then these are not the
right venture guys for you

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.400
to be working with, OK?

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.420
So it should be pretty
easy to find someone

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.520
that everyone agrees
has domain knowledge,

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.520
has expertise in the field, is
entrepreneurial, and is going

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.674
to be kind of neutral, right?

00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:37.090
So does that answer
your question?

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:37.370
Yep?

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.869
AUDIENCE: Yeah, on a previous
slide, you were talking about,

00:24:39.869 --> 00:24:42.200
say you've taken $10
million in VC money,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.132
but it turns out the
opportunity was smaller.

00:24:44.132 --> 00:24:46.547
It's only $5 million
in revenue per year.

00:24:46.547 --> 00:24:48.310
What are the
options, then, there?

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.810
CHARLIE TILLETT:
So her question is,

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.101
let's say you've taken more
money than the opportunity.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.200
There's really no
happy ending there,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.570
because the investors
are going to want

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.280
to get their money back.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.720
And a company that
grows to $5 million,

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.010
it's kind of the
walking dead, right?

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.670
So you're now
making enough money

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.870
to where you're not
going out of business,

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:19.470
but there's another problem
there, is that companies that

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:25.690
only get to $5 million and $10
million-- now, I don't know,

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.800
how much revenue does
Pinterest-- you know,

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.050
there's a lot of companies
out there that have no revenue

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.490
and have tremendous valuations.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.750
But let's not plan that we're
going to catch lightning

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.250
in a bottle, OK?

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.820
So a company that has $5
million to $10 million

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.160
in revenue, the reality is that
there's a very small market.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.780
Who's going to buy
a company like that?

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.650
When we were at Reveal
Imaging, we grew the company

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.860
to $100 million, and we grew
the company to $50 million

00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:01.460
in revenue, but our buyers were
aerospace defense companies

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.740
that are huge.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.450
And they were willing
to pay us $125 million

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:14.070
for $50 million revenue,
but nothing more than that.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:18.010
They were only willing to pay
us kind of 1.5 times revenue.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.160
They were hoping that we would
have $500 million in revenue,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.480
because they were willing
to pay $1.25 billion.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.080
But the problem is that a
$5 million to $10 million

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.600
company doesn't get
any big company who's

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:35.050
your-- it's too small to go
public, and the big companies,

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.870
it's not big enough
to move the needle.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.450
Especially if you've
already proven that it's not

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.690
going to go like that, right?

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.230
You've already decided that
it's going to go $5 million,

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.880
$6 million, $7 million.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.625
It doesn't get anyone excited.

00:26:52.472 --> 00:26:56.870
So the business model,
and in my mind-- I mean,

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.860
you heard the term used a
couple of times on the panel

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.700
tonight-- how I think
of it is it's an income

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.450
statement in percentage terms.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.710
And we'll show you some
of the business models

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:12.470
from a number of companies in a
number of different industries.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.520
But when you think about
your business model,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.610
think about your business
reaching critical mass.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:22.280
Do you have to have some kind
of geographic dispersion?

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.630
Or do you need a
critical mass of sales

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:30.400
in order to get your
volume pricing down?

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.430
Or maybe it's the
number of customers that

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.070
gives you some kind of synergy.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:40.900
So when you think about your
business model, think about it,

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.920
it's in the happy times, right?

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.800
It's reached critical
mass, and it is kind

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.065
of hitting on all cylinders.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.280
So how many are Course 15?

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.899
OK, maybe about a
third, or maybe 40%.

00:27:58.899 --> 00:28:00.690
So this is going to be
a little bit boring.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.650
This section is going to be a
little bit boring for you guys,

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.774
but I want to make sure
everyone's on the same page

00:28:04.774 --> 00:28:05.480
here.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.870
So when we talk about the income
statement, we start at the top.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:13.140
And it's your sales number,
also called your revenue number,

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:17.700
and that's the products that
you're shipping out the door,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.930
or the service that
you're providing,

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.830
and the dollar number that
you're putting on that invoice.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.680
So it's after any
discounts that you give.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.100
It's after any
kickbacks or anything.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.675
It's the number-- when
you send out an invoice

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:33.977
to that customer, what's
the dollar on that invoice,

00:28:33.977 --> 00:28:35.560
and what's the check
that you're going

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.390
to get from that customer.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.200
Your cost of goods sold
is the material costs,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.770
the labor it costs to
build your product,

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.090
it's the facilities in
which that product is built,

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.710
but it's also your support cost.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:54.440
So if you ship a product, and
you have a one year warranty,

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:58.500
or you have a tech support
line that people are calling,

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.370
that's part of your cost, too.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.930
So you've got to staff
that tech support line.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.440
You've got to man
it, maybe it's 24/7.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.080
If you've got a
hardware product,

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.020
and it breaks within
the warranty period,

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.440
you've got to fix that.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.880
You've got shipping costs.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.260
You might have to send
someone out into the field,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.810
if you've got a big machine
like we had at Reveal

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.680
that weighed two tons.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.620
So those are all
the things that go

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.020
into your cost of goods sold.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:28.670
It's not your R&amp;D. So it's
not your programming cost.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.069
Your product development
costs go down in R&amp;D.

00:29:32.069 --> 00:29:33.860
Then, you have your
three main departments.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.310
Sales and marketing
is self-explanatory.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.760
R&amp;D would be all of your
programming, product

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.190
development, any
material that gets

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:45.970
bought as part of your
product development process.

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.680
Then, your general
and administrative

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.290
is kind of everything else.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.890
Your CFO is in there,
your CEO is in there.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:57.910
HR, IT, your facilities,
your facility staff

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.660
for the non-manufacturing
facility.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.630
And at the bottom is
your operating profit,

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:07.300
or EBITDA, earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation,

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.360
and amortization.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.060
And I like to use that as the
yardstick, because it gets

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.380
really complicated adding
in capital expenses

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.240
and depreciating stuff, and that
kind of obscures what's really

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.870
going on in your business.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.590
So I would urge
you in your plans

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:28.790
don't depreciate
anything, and also

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.960
don't start allocating your
general and administrative

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.300
expenses across
other departments.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:39.110
Just let them sit in your G&amp;A.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:41.526
So I get a lot of
business plans.

00:30:41.526 --> 00:30:43.400
I'm happy to look at
anyone's business plans.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.380
My email is at the end
of this presentation.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.204
Any time, whether it's part
of this class, or any time

00:30:48.204 --> 00:30:50.620
in the next 10 years, you want
to send me a business plan,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.030
say, I'm getting ready
to make a presentation.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.890
I want someone to
look at this and just

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.970
make sure it's
not totally crazy.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.350
So I get a lot of
business plans.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.370
And the first thing that I do
when I look at a business plan

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.740
is I look at the
top line, and say,

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:08.262
how big is this
business going to get?

00:31:08.262 --> 00:31:10.660
What is the market
opportunity here?

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.320
So here's an
opportunity, they think

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.295
it can grow to $75 million.

00:31:14.295 --> 00:31:17.130
The next thing that I
look at is, in year four,

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.080
kind of the happy times, once
they've reached critical mass,

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.750
what does this
business look like?

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.444
What are the gross margins?

00:31:24.444 --> 00:31:25.860
I've worked in
companies that have

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.700
80% gross margins and companies
that have 50% gross margins,

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.140
and I can tell you it's
dramatically easier

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.490
to make money and
run a business when

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:39.370
you have 80% gross margins
versus 50% gross margins.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:41.230
It's dramatically different.

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.490
And then, where are the
big expenses down here?

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.970
What are they spending on R&amp;D?

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.600
Particularly, what
are they spending

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.980
on sales and marketing?

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.090
Because most firms end up
at about the same place

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.470
in R&amp;D spending once
they reach critical mass.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.740
They end up about the
same place G&amp;A spending.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:02.270
But the sales and marketing
wildly varies, depending on

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.780
is it a consumer product, is it
a business to business product,

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.770
is it a luxury
product that you have

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:10.590
to do a lot of advertising,
is there a lot of trade shows.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:14.440
So it depends on your whole
sales strategy and distribution

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.650
strategy, and that shows up
in your sales and marketing.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.810
The last thing that I look at
is kind of the operating profit

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.810
over the this four year period.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.240
Because that gives you
a pretty good yardstick

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.780
for how much cash
this company is

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.130
going to take to get
to profitability.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:38.950
It's not perfect, but it's
probably within 20% or 30%,

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:40.890
which is a good-- you
know, it at least says

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:45.350
to me this company, $3.5
million plus $2.5 million

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.870
is $6 million, maybe it lost a
little bit here in year three,

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:49.850
so it's $7 million.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.964
It's not a company that's
going to need $20 million.

00:32:52.964 --> 00:32:54.380
But it's also not
a company that's

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.004
going to need $1
million or $2 million.

00:32:56.004 --> 00:32:59.810
So it gives you just a sense
of what this company needs.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.040
Now, let's say you're looking
at your business plan.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.831
I would urge you to
look at the same thing.

00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:08.590
Start at the top line,
and say, do I really

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.400
think this business can
do this kind of revenue?

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.810
I would also urge you to look
at year four or year five,

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.290
whatever it's going
to take you get

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:19.470
to that place, the
critical mass, and say,

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.950
does this business model
look like other companies

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.740
in my space, or is it different?

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.490
And if it's different, that
doesn't mean it's wrong.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:31.970
It just means that you better
understand why it's different.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.260
Maybe you're doing something
dramatically different.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.360
Maybe you've got
some tremendous cost

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:42.920
of goods sold value that
other companies don't have.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.100
But you've got to
understand that.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.110
Then, I would urge you to
think about a year one,

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.530
because thinking about
expenses in year four

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:58.050
is a very difficult exercise.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:00.630
Because you can't even--
I mean, here you are,

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.600
you're getting your
business off the ground.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.910
It's hard to think about if
I had $75 million in revenue,

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.409
where would that money be spent.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.659
But it's very easy to think
about the next 12 months.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.710
And who are my key hires?

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.020
And how much are those
people going to cost?

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.820
And what are the
stuff that they're

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.260
going to need to buy to
help them do their job?

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.780
And you're probably not
going to have a lot of sales,

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.530
so you don't really
need to think too much

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.880
about cost of goods sold yet.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.620
OK?

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.500
But you need to
start thinking about

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.570
what are my staffing
priorities, and what

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.480
are the things that we need,
and where are we going to locate

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.070
our business, and what we don't
have to spend on facilities,

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.440
and that kind of thing.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.570
And then, while year one
should be fairly easy to do,

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:47.120
year two is not that much
more of a stretch, because you

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.590
are ready have kind of thought
about where I am in month 12.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.630
And so you just kind
of extrapolate that

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:56.550
into what are we going to do
once we start having revenue?

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.620
OK, so what is my support
team going to look like?

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.070
What is my sales team
going to look like?

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.890
And put some numbers on that.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:05.460
And then, once you've
done that, look

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.750
at where your percentages
are out here in year two.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:12.470
And you already looked at
where they are in year four.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:16.884
And kind of make year three as
kind of a blending process, OK?

00:35:16.884 --> 00:35:19.050
Now, you're not going to
do this on an annual basis.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.360
I'm going to urge you to
do it on a quarterly basis.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.760
And we'll get into those
specific spreadsheets

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.080
and talk you talk you
through that in a bit.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:37.540
So the business model in terms
of this percentage of income,

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:41.060
or percentage of
revenue, exercise

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:47.030
helps you think about what your
business is going to look like,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.650
and how you're
going to get there.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.610
It's going to show
how your business is

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.750
going to make money.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.740
So let's look at a number
of different companies, OK?

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.630
This is a number in
the retail sector.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.960
You guys all know them.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.510
Walmart, the low cost
leader, Target's kind

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:05.920
of a middle market, and
Nordstrom is more high end.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.760
What has categorized
these businesses.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.200
They all have crappy
gross margins, right?

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.800
24% for Walmart, 34%
percent for Target.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.790
They spend nothing
on R&amp;D. Target

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.002
should probably spend a
little something on their IT

00:36:20.002 --> 00:36:21.085
department, though, right?

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:31.170
Now, all of this information is
available from the Securities

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.330
and Exchange Commission, or you
can get rid of Yahoo Finance

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:34.850
now.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.600
So just going to
Yahoo Finance, you

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.310
can pull up the annual reports.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.720
You can get all this
information off of there.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.470
Most companies do
the lump sales,

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:46.640
general and administrative
expenses together.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.590
So I don't have a
breakout on what

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:52.000
they're spending on sales
and marketing versus G&amp;A.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.900
But you can see
the sales, and SG&amp;A

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.510
comes in kind of
across the board here.

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.300
But not tremendously profitable.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.470
But very high annual revenue.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.800
I mean, look at Walmart
at $344 billion.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.440
So 6% of a big number
is still a big number.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.350
One of the things that's
useful to look at,

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:15.530
not comparing yourself
to these companies,

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.840
but comparing yourself
to your peers,

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.870
is going to be looking
at revenue per employee.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.710
So I just threw this
on here so you could--

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:28.880
it does tell a lot how companies
within similar industries

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.190
have very similar
revenue per employee.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:37.147
And in retail, it's in the
$150,000 to $200,000 range.

00:37:37.147 --> 00:37:38.730
Let's look at the
restaurant business.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.360
It's probably even worse, right?

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.010
Again, terrible gross margins,
but actually the profitability

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:48.000
is a little bit better
than the retail stores.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:57.610
But look at the revenue per
employee, $45,000 per employee.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:59.230
So think of this.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.445
The cost of goods are 68%.

00:38:05.072 --> 00:38:06.530
And a lot of that's
got to actually

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.560
be meat and potatoes, right?

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.640
So how much money is
actually left over

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:16.200
to pay-- if your average
employee is $45,000 per person,

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.740
you can't pay that
person $45,000 a year.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.310
So this idea that
they're going start

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:26.020
being able to pay fast
food workers $15 an hour,

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.000
which is this big
argument, there's

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.886
just not enough money there.

00:38:31.886 --> 00:38:34.257
It's a crazy
business here, and I

00:38:34.257 --> 00:38:36.340
suspect that there are a
lot of part-time workers.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.550
But it is an
interesting fact here

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:43.400
that all these businesses have
such low revenue per employee.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.690
Let's look at some
interesting companies now.

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:49.800
Cisco, very good
gross margin, 64%.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.580
We see R&amp;D is at 13% and
operating profit at 25%.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.160
These might be a
couple years old,

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.080
but they're in line with this.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:04.510
And revenue per employee
is $573,000 per employee.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:08.230
Think of that versus
$45,000 per employee, OK?

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:10.600
So you can afford
to pay your Cisco

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.510
employees $100,000 to $125,000.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.940
You can't afford to do
that at McDonald's, right?

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.700
So again, these
are characterized

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.870
by R&amp;D spending of kind
of the 10% to 15% range.

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:25.060
Except for Dell.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.150
And Dell is really
just a box manufacture.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.330
They're just an assembler.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.230
They're just a
supply chain story.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.980
They're not an R&amp;D story.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.820
And it comes out
in their numbers.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.200
Medtronic is a
medical device maker,

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.300
but it really has all the
characteristics of a technology

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.487
hardware company.

00:39:44.487 --> 00:39:46.070
Let's look at some
software companies.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:49.110
Again, even better
gross margins.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:53.250
Say R&amp;D is in that
same 10% to 15%.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.510
And the revenue per
employee at Microsoft

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.430
is about the same as Cisco.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:00.670
Oracle and SAP,
which are more peers,

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.720
have very similar
revenue per employee

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.790
in that $250,000
to $300,000 range.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.562
The internet companies
are all across the board.

00:40:12.562 --> 00:40:14.520
I mean, Apple's not really
an internet company,

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.900
but they are kind
of interesting here

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.660
in that they have $2 million
of revenue per employee.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.610
Mind-boggling.

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:27.210
I mean, Google is at $1 million.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:29.750
I started putting Google on
this after they went public.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.490
And I said, well, they
can't sustain that.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.230
They were about $1
million when I first

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:35.740
did it I think three years ago.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.510
And they've actually increased
their revenue per employee

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.230
as they've grown.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.550
So they've become
more productive,

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:45.940
which is kind of-- few
companies are able to do that.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.900
Usually, companies
have a decrease

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.320
in revenue per employee
as they get bigger.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.880
Google's been able
to increase it.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.250
Again, here, R&amp;D spending.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:58.931
I mean, Apple is so big that
that 2% is still a huge number,

00:40:58.931 --> 00:40:59.430
right?

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.490
But if we look at
the rest of these,

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.000
it is a little bit
across the board,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.350
and it's part of where a company
is in this stage of their life

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:09.810
cycle.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.679
But this gives you kind of a
sense of where companies are.

00:41:12.679 --> 00:41:14.220
Another thing that's
interesting here

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.680
is the two companies with
the lowest gross margin

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:20.970
are Apple, which is
selling hardware,

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:23.580
and Pandora, which
is selling music.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.900
So just because you're in a
intellectual property business,

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.670
or in a-- I don't know what you
would call music, if you're not

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.120
calling it hardware.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.140
But it's kind of interesting
that their cost of goods

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:41.280
are actually as high as Apple's,
because of the royalties

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.670
that they have to pay.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:46.484
And that creates some
problems for them.

00:41:46.484 --> 00:41:48.400
I think they're now
starting to show a profit,

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.115
but it's still a
very tough business.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.170
Looking at business models
over a period of time,

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:57.670
they evolve slowly.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:00.230
I've been doing this
talk since at least '98.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:07.730
And just looking at Cisco,
it looks like the same.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.380
I mean, yeah, it goes up
and down a little bit.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.520
But companies do
not dramatically

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.120
change over a period of
time once they kind of

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.600
hit that critical mass.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:23.530
So as you're
building your model--

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:27.010
I know the talk yesterday was
on your product and pricing

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:31.470
your product-- what's the value
that you bring to the customer?

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.240
And how is that value
going to be split

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.270
between you and the customer?

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:41.730
I hear a lot of
people say, well,

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:46.980
we have a product that will
save our customers $10,000.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:50.060
So we think we should
charge them $10,000.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.380
Well, at $10,000,
they're indifferent

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.520
whether they do it manually
or whether they do it

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.640
with your new
piece of equipment.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.260
So you've got to
price that product

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:04.040
to where it's compelling for
the customer to take that risk

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.600
and make that change.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.190
And if it's a $10,000
value to them,

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:13.580
you've probably got to price
that at $2,000 or $3,000,

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.670
and let them capture the
majority of that savings,

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:19.890
because they're taking the risk.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.920
And so you've got
to figure out how,

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.050
at a $2,000 or
$3,000 price, you're

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:27.280
going to be able to sell
that and capture enough value

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.980
yourself, OK?

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:33.140
Your distribution strategy.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.690
So think about the price, and
then your cost of goods sold

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:39.010
should be pretty
straightforward.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.370
I mean, you know the
material that goes in there.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:43.680
Again, it's not how
long is it going to take

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.140
to develop this product.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.660
That's part of your R&amp;D, and
that's a whole other exercise.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:54.010
But it's, if I sell a unit, how
much material goes into it, how

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.400
much labor goes into
it, how much overhead

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.310
in the manufacturing
facility goes into it,

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.570
how much support am I
going to have to provide?

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:06.110
These are all questions that,
if you sit there and noodle away

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:11.932
at it, you can come up with
a pretty reasonable range,

00:44:11.932 --> 00:44:14.820
and come up with your
cost of goods sold.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.966
When you think about your
distribution strategy,

00:44:16.966 --> 00:44:18.590
how am I going to
sell my product, that

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:20.850
could have-- I have an
example of that in here--

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:26.220
that could have a huge impact
on everything involving

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:30.130
your business, in both your
revenue all the way down

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:32.530
to your sales and marketing
and your operating profit.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:35.100
So that's a huge decision
you're going to have to make.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.110
R&amp;D, I would argue, should
end up at the 10% to 20%

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.880
range generally.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:41.620
As we've looked at
a lot of companies,

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.920
that's where they end up.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.470
That doesn't mean you shouldn't
be at 30%, like Zynga was,

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:49.550
depending on where you
are in your life cycle.

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.060
But if you're a
technology company,

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:58.080
and you're not spending
10% of your revenue on R&amp;D,

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.210
you're yourself short for
tomorrow's products, right?

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.540
Because you've always
got to be evolving.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.110
G&amp;A is going to end
up at 5% to 15%.

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:09.950
The lower you can
get that, the better.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:13.210
That's where the CFO is,
so just squeeze that down.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:16.400
And make sure you build
in an operating profit.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.770
Now, you're operating profit
shouldn't be 40% to 50%.

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:24.360
There's a few companies
that can get away with that.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.910
But to think that your
company is one of those

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:30.360
is probably unrealistic.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:36.140
So if you're putting
together your model,

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:40.174
and you keep coming up with a
40% to 50% operating profit,

00:45:40.174 --> 00:45:42.340
you should really question
some of your assumptions.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:45.390
Do I really, am I
missing anything here?

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.780
I'm not saying it's wrong.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.500
It might be doable.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.860
But you're going to get
some pushback on that

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.780
from people who've looked
at a lot of business plans.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:00.520
So I talked about how
your distribution strategy

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.260
is going to impact
your operating profit.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.970
So let's look at an
example here where

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.220
you're selling it through
your own direct sales force.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.590
You have $100 million in
revenue, your cost of goods

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.880
is $40 million, leaving
you with $60 million,

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.900
or 60% gross margin.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:17.040
You have $23 million in sales
and marketing, $12 million

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.540
in R&amp;D, and some G&amp;A,
bringing your total expenses

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.475
to $40 million, and an operating
profit of $20 million, or 20%.

00:46:24.475 --> 00:46:26.100
So let's say, instead
of that, you say,

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.290
I'm going to bring
in a distributor,

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:33.250
and give him a 20% discount off
of our list price or selling

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.090
price.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:37.814
And in return for that 20%,
he's going to go out and sell it

00:46:37.814 --> 00:46:38.480
to the customer.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.630
He gets to keep the
20%, but he frees me up

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:44.530
of all the sales and
marketing activity.

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:46.370
Well, not entirely.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.760
Because even the
distribution channel

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.360
needs some care and feeding.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.260
So you can't completely get
rid of your sales force.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.020
You can't completely get rid
of your marketing efforts.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.270
But you can cut those back.

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:59.580
And in my example, I said,
well, you could cut it back

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.390
from $23 million to $8 million.

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:05.050
Now, your R&amp;D is
still going to be

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.810
the same, because
you've got to keep

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:10.230
feeding the machine with
new products, right?

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.630
And your cost of goods is
going to be exactly the same,

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.190
because you're shipping
the same number of units.

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:16.810
But because you have
fewer employees,

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.610
you probably don't need
quite as many people in HR,

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:21.380
you don't need as
many bean counters.

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.720
Your G&amp;A is going to
be a little bit less,

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.500
and so that's going
to be $4 million.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.920
So in this example, your revenue
is reduced from $100 million

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.090
to $80 million, and
your operating profit

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.560
is reduced from $20
million to $16 million,

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.030
but you're still
getting a 20% profit.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:43.400
Now, I don't know whether
one is right or wrong.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.900
I would say that the
distributor model

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.790
is going to be great if it
can get you to market faster,

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:52.390
or if it can take you from
$80 million to $160 million

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:56.030
faster than you could grow
organically from $100 million

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:57.750
to $160 million.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.490
You're still getting
the same 20%.

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:06.230
And whether that 20%
came out at 15% or 25%,

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:08.990
the more important number
here is the $16 million

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.300
in operating profit
versus the $20 million

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:15.600
in operating profit.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.470
So as you're
building your model,

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:19.560
there is some business
planing software out there,

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.560
kind of like a TurboTax.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.080
It asks you a
bunch of questions.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.940
It asks you the questions,
you answer the assumptions,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.630
and it spits out a plan.

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:31.410
Do not use that software,
because the beauty

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:34.310
of this exercise, the
benefit of this exercise,

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:38.880
is understanding exactly
what's going into your model,

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.510
and building it yourself.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:47.530
And when something doesn't add
up, figuring out what's broken.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:52.080
When you start getting
50% operating profits,

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:58.200
start saying, let's look
at my revenue per employee.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:02.190
Oh, my revenue per employee
is $1 million per employee.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:05.659
Well, Google does that,
and Apple does that,

00:49:05.659 --> 00:49:07.450
but there are not very
many other companies

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:10.200
that have $1 million in
revenue per employee.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.910
So maybe I need to add more
employees to my staffing plan.

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:20.740
And where am I going to
deploy those people in order

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.790
to build up my organization?

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.910
So it's doing it, it's
working the exercise

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.870
that is the real benefit.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:35.420
Build your sales projections
from the bottom up.

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.000
Anyone watch Shark Tank?

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:38.880
OK.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.651
I gave this talk
about two months ago,

00:49:41.651 --> 00:49:43.900
and everyone said, no, it's
on Friday night, I go out.

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.240
You know, I'm not waiting
at home Friday night.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.210
So someone was on
Shark Tank last week,

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:50.580
and they said they're
selling a product that

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.090
went into school lockers.

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:56.080
And they said, why are
you valuing your company

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.040
at $5 million?

00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.570
And he said, well, there's
50 million school lockers

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:05.170
in the country, and we only
need to get 5% of them.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:10.810
I mean, it's a crazy-- that's
wrong on so many counts.

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:12.917
Because it doesn't
talk about how

00:50:12.917 --> 00:50:15.250
you're going to get into each
school, how many are going

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.920
to sell into each school, what
is your distribution strategy

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.090
to get there.

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:22.790
So instead of saying,
the market is huge

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:24.650
and we're going to
get a slice of it,

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:26.600
what you said need
to say is, we're

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.590
going to have five sales guys.

00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:30.330
And each sales
guy is going to be

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.760
responsible for a
territory in the country.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.750
And each territory has--
I'm kind of making this up

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:37.780
about the school
lockers as I go here--

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.860
but each territory
has 25,000 schools.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:45.320
And I expect each sales
guy to higher 10 reps.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.460
And each rep is going to
go to two schools a day.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:55.040
And we expect a closure rate of
10% when they go to a school,

00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.670
and each school that buys these
is going to buy 50 lockers.

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:02.610
And you put that
all in, and it'll

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:05.230
come up with a model for how
many you're going to sell.

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:10.320
And that may not be--
it will not be accurate.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.554
Because as you put this
together, it's a crystal ball.

00:51:13.554 --> 00:51:14.970
And when you get
out there, you're

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:19.730
going to find out a sales guy
can't go to two schools a day,

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:24.000
and he can't close 10%,
and they don't buy 50.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.540
But when you get a guy
out there selling stuff,

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:29.710
he's going to be
providing data, and you're

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:32.480
going to start getting
feedback to say,

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.860
we can visit three
schools a day,

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.270
but there's only
a 5% closure rate,

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:40.210
but each school that does
buy is going to buy 75.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:43.130
And then, you can
adjust your model.

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:45.040
But since you've
built your model,

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.610
now you can adjust
it, and figure out

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:50.490
where you're going to go next.

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:54.490
The last thing is that
there's spreadsheet overload.

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:58.380
So never do a best
case, worst case,

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.550
and present three
different models, and say,

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:03.000
if everything goes right,
here's what we need.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.990
I'm not saying don't
look at contingencies.

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:10.320
But just put your
best foot forward.

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.289
Put your best
estimate on the paper.

00:52:12.289 --> 00:52:13.830
Say, here's what we
think we're going

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:23.430
to do, and leave the best case,
worst case for someone else.

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:26.110
I might give you some rules of
thumb on the next spreadsheet.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.730
These are focused on making
your investment interest

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:30.870
attractive to investors.

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:33.410
Just like your $5
million business

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:35.021
might be a great
business, it's not

00:52:35.021 --> 00:52:36.520
going to be attractive
to investors.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.370
So I may say, don't put
together a business plan that

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:41.189
only gets you to $5 million.

00:52:41.189 --> 00:52:42.480
That could be a great business.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.720
OK, so don't let me
discourage you from that.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.770
It's most relevant for
technology companies.

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:52.050
So if you're going to
start a fast food chain,

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:54.770
these metrics are not
going to apply to you.

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:57.710
And like I said, it might
not apply to your industry.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:04.520
Staffing is what's going
to drive your expenses, OK?

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:09.720
Most technology companies,
staffing is 50% to 66%

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.100
of your expense.

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.680
And your average
cost per employee

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.900
is going to be about $90,000.

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.590
I know it sounds crazy,
sounds crazy high.

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.870
But the reality is,
in Boston, first

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:24.740
off is, who has administrative
assistants anymore?

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:28.130
Unless you have like a
large manufacturing staff

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:31.950
that's doing kind of
assembly and stuff like that.

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:34.820
But in most of the companies
that you guys are going

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:38.360
to be starting, it's going to
be a lot of technology workers,

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.240
it's going to be a
lot of programmers,

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.270
it's going to be a lot of
sales and marketing staff,

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:45.780
it's going to be a
few finance people.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.490
I mean, the finance
and HR are probably

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.810
going to be the cheapest
people in your company.

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:50.960
I mean, really.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.770
A programmer these
days, especially

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:54.850
if you want to get a
algorithm engineer,

00:53:54.850 --> 00:53:57.000
algorithm engineer is
probably going to cost you

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.070
$125,000, $150,000 a year.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.410
OK?

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:05.590
Just a programmer's
going to cost you

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:07.370
$80,000, $90,000, $100,000.

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:10.310
And these folks are going
to want raises every year.

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:17.890
So salaries are going to
come in at about $90,000.

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:20.920
Employee benefits are going
to add about 15% to that.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.510
So I know you've all heard
horror stories about General

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:26.530
Motors pays their
guys $25 an hour,

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.190
but they're true
cost is $50 an hour.

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.760
Ignore all that
accounting mumbo-jumbo.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:35.030
You can add in 15%, and that'll
be a pretty good yardstick

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:37.440
to cover their FICA
expenses, which

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.660
is Social Security tax,
and their health insurance.

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.180
OK?

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:45.920
As I said, salaries are going to
be about 2/3 of your expenses.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.040
And sales staff is really
industry dependent.

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.990
So I've got some
yardsticks on here,

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:53.330
but it really
depends on-- if you

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:55.930
got a guy who's selling
lockers to a school system,

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:59.490
OK, you can probably get that
guy for, I don't know, probably

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:02.459
$50,000 a year, and maybe
give him a 10% commission

00:55:02.459 --> 00:55:03.000
or something.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.870
Or maybe $40,000 a year.

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:06.790
So you know, this
is not a guy that's

00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:10.360
selling complicated
software sale, OK?

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.470
But someone who is selling
something like that

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:18.900
is going to need $150,000
to $250,000 a year.

00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:22.150
So I don't have time to go
through a case study here,

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:29.980
but a couple years ago,
I went in when OpenTable

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:32.400
went public, and just looked
at some of their publicly

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.980
available information.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:37.030
And this first page is all
of the publicly available

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.980
information.

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.720
But I was able to really
uncover a lot of things

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.540
about how they ran
their business,

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.660
and how they were
generating revenue.

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.750
And I would just urge you to
look at these next few pages.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:51.835
This presentation will
be on the website.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:58.270
In terms of cash flow, it's
critical to understand it.

00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:01.100
But producing a
cash flow statement

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.260
is really complicated, and
it's really prone to error.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.090
And the reason is
that you have to put

00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:08.030
in all of these
formulas, and then

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:12.460
the plug number that makes
all the formulas work is cash.

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:18.100
So any error in any formula, or
anything that you fat-fingered

00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:22.280
wrong shows up as cash.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.120
And sometimes it's
to the negative,

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.840
sometimes it's to the positive.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.480
Every time I do
this, I say I'm going

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:32.140
to put together a cash flow
just so people can look at one.

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:35.070
And maybe I'll chastise myself,
and I'll go home and do this.

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:37.200
And if I do, I'll
send it to Joe.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.150
But a good proxy for
cash flow is just

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:42.150
looking at your
cumulative operating

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:46.150
losses over the period of
time, and adding in any capital

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:47.780
expenses that you had.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.030
And while that's
not perfect, it's

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:52.870
a pretty good number
for how much money

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:56.670
this business is going to need.

00:56:56.670 --> 00:57:01.200
So a lot of people ask me, well,
how much should I pay myself?

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.650
And venture catalysts, they
don't want their entrepreneurs

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:09.790
to starve, but they
want them to be hungry.

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:14.780
So what I would urge you
to do is think about maybe

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.384
what you made before
you came back to school.

00:57:17.384 --> 00:57:19.550
I mean, I assume a lot of
you are graduate students.

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:22.240
Or think about
what your peers are

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.960
going to make as they're
going out into industry.

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:31.330
Now, if you're in a very
specific discipline,

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:35.010
and your peers are going out
to work in that discipline,

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:37.565
and because-- let's say
they're geological engineers,

00:57:37.565 --> 00:57:39.315
and they're going to
go up to North Dakota

00:57:39.315 --> 00:57:44.020
and make $250,000 a year because
they're helping drill for oil.

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.840
Well, you can't
say, well, look, I

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:49.070
could be drilling for oil
in North Dakota for $250,000

00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:49.660
a year.

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.050
Therefore, that's what
I need to pay myself.

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:54.550
So that's kind of
an extreme case.

00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:56.520
But think about what
your peers are making,

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.590
and generally you
can argue that that's

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:00.280
what you ought to be paid.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.420
Or what you were getting
paid in your prior life,

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:05.460
unless you were an investment
banker in your prior life,

00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:05.960
right?

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:11.030
Your investors want you
to earn a living wage.

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:13.120
They don't want you to be
worried about paying the bills,

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.203
or getting your car fixed.

00:58:14.203 --> 00:58:16.850
They don't want you
to work 23 hours a day

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:19.620
with as few distractions
as possible.

00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:21.880
But they want to make sure
that you're still hungry,

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:27.840
and increasing shareholder
value every day.

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.480
So here's what we want to
get to is our profit and loss

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.250
statement for four years, OK?

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:37.070
And so I've got this
color coded spreadsheet,

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:39.260
and here's the code here.

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:42.510
Anything that's in blue comes
from another spreadsheet.

00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:44.050
And I've got a
little column here

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.550
that you would take out when
you actually presented this

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:51.030
to anyone that says, here,
this is coming from the P&amp;L

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:52.780
by quarter spreadsheet.

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.940
And so this spreadsheet's got
about 12 pages on it, right?

00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:00.090
So here's your summary page
here, and as you can see,

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:01.870
everything comes
from another page.

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:04.490
So nothing shows
up on this page.

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:06.714
But as you're putting
together your spreadsheet,

00:59:06.714 --> 00:59:08.380
you're going to keep
coming back to this

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.040
and say, how does this look?

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.380
Does this make sense?

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.350
Do my sales go like this?

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:15.440
Or do my expenses go like this?

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:19.080
Or is everything kind of in
a nice, smooth trend line?

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.080
Or if it's not,
can I explain it?

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.540
So for example, I might have no
marketing expenses in year one.

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:27.190
I might have a tremendous amount
of marketing expenses in year

00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:28.830
two as we launch our product.

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:31.780
And then those expenses,
maybe not in absolute terms,

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:34.750
but in percentage terms,
come down in year three,

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:40.210
because now we've already
reached the market.

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:43.050
So the next spreadsheet, and
this spreadsheet is actually--

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:46.020
I would urge you to,
at least to start with,

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.879
do for your projections
on quarterly terms.

00:59:48.879 --> 00:59:50.420
Because there's a
lot of times you're

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.640
going to be fat-fingering
stuff in here,

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.250
and when you have
48 cells that you

00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:58.630
have to fat-finger
something in, you're

00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:00.670
going to make more
errors than if you only

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:02.730
have 16 to put them in.

01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:05.380
And so this spreadsheet goes
out to about here, which

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.900
is year 4, Q4, right?

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.570
But as we can see, everything
from our quarterly statement

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:14.560
also comes from
another spreadsheet.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.440
So let's look at the
detailed spreadsheets.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.680
And the first one is
our sales spreadsheet.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.020
So here, in the red,
is input numbers.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.970
So I've got my unit
sales in units,

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:26.960
and I've just plugged
in some numbers here.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.360
Now, you're going to
have to justify these

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.710
in the rest of your projections
by what's my sales staff,

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:38.010
and how much units am I
expecting a salesperson

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:40.040
to sell.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.990
Here's my unit price, and I've
got a couple different models.

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:46.730
And as you can see,
when I launch model two,

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:49.460
I decrease the
price on model one,

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.380
because now it's old technology.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.830
And so our product revenue
is simply a multi-- you know,

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.640
the black is a
calculated figure--

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.700
it's just a multiplication
of those two.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.560
And then the magenta
number, that's

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.000
what goes to our
other spreadsheet.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.340
So our support revenue,
here's our installed base,

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.690
and there's some retention
on our installed base,

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:19.980
and then we charge 15% of
what the value of that product

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.187
is to show what our
support revenue would be.

01:01:22.187 --> 01:01:24.020
But you're just going
to have to play around

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.750
with these
percentages, depending

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:27.540
on your product
and your company.

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:30.590
But I just wanted to show that
there was actually some support

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:33.250
revenue in it as well,
and this support revenue

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:36.400
goes to the other spreadsheet.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.500
So then we have our
cost of goods sold.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:42.240
So we have our units that
are coming from our others

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:52.770
spreadsheet, and we've plugged
in our unit cost down here.

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:55.450
And so this gives us our
variable cost per unit.

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:58.850
We've got the 20 units at
$1,500 per unit, comes down

01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:02.390
to $30,000 in material cost.

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:03.960
But I've also got some staffing.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.220
I've got a VP of manufacturing,
I've got a supervisor,

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.650
I've got a technician.

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:10.710
He can build one unit a day.

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:13.220
And so I've got to think
about how many technicians I

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:15.890
need as I ramp up
that product volume.

01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:16.390
OK?

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.670
So we'll talk about the
staffing plan on another page,

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:29.050
but those staffing
costs get added up

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:31.160
into salary and benefits.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.170
We have our variable cost here.

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:36.910
We have a facilities cost that
is really a step function,

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:39.890
because you can't ramp
up facilities in line

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:43.240
with-- you can't add
another 100 square feet,

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.130
you've got to rent 10,000 square
feet, and then another 10,000

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.880
square feet if you need more.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.830
So we just plugged
in some numbers

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:54.550
on our facilities expense, and
that gives us our total product

01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:56.650
cost of goods sold here.

01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:58.090
When we look at
the staffing plan,

01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:00.131
this is a spreadsheet
you're going to keep coming

01:03:00.131 --> 01:03:02.170
back to over and over
again, because, as I said,

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:05.480
this is where 66% of your
expenses are going to be.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.710
So first is, you've
got a spreadsheet that

01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:10.950
goes down to about here with
all of your departments.

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:14.200
And I would urge you, don't
create too many lines in here.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.920
Don't create a junior
programmer, senior programmer,

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.620
programmer level three.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.860
You know, kind of
glom things together,

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:23.380
because you're going to be
fat-fingering a lot of stuff

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:23.880
in.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.690
And do the same thing
with their salaries.

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:30.580
If a junior programmer
makes $80,000,

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.340
and a programmer makes $100,000,
and a senior programmer makes

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:36.550
$120,000, just
put in programmer,

01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:38.990
put them all in at $100,000.

01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:46.070
You know, again, this is going
to be your guideline, right?

01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:51.040
So you've got this for all of
your departments down here,

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.790
and again, this spreadsheet
goes all the way out to here.

01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:56.450
So the companion part
to this spreadsheet

01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:59.950
is actually over on the
right side of this thing.

01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:03.980
And now you plug in salaries
for each of these staffing

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:05.030
positions.

01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:11.000
And all this spreadsheet does is
take your number of employees,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.580
and remember, this
is a quarterly,

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:15.200
so we're taking the annual
salary, dividing it by 4,

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:18.100
multiplying it by the number
of people in that position,

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:22.400
and then we're adding
in our benefits at 15%.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.390
So FICA is 7%.

01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:29.150
And I've done the math, I've
done the math dozens of times,

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:33.830
8% of your total
payroll is usually

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:37.660
enough to cover health
insurance for everyone,

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:41.130
at kind of a 75% to 25% ratio.

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:43.310
Because some people
aren't going to take it.

01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:45.907
Some people are going to
be on their spouse's plan.

01:04:45.907 --> 01:04:47.490
If you're a tech
company, you're going

01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:50.770
to have a lot of single people,
so they cost about a third

01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:52.610
as much as the married people.

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:55.990
And so 8% works out
to be pretty good.

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:58.000
But your employees
are still going

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.620
to want to get
raises in year two.

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.670
Just because you're a
start up, they still

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:03.070
want a little something extra.

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:05.290
And as I mentioned,
a lot of companies

01:05:05.290 --> 01:05:07.130
have problems getting
those expenses up

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:10.697
in years three and four because
they don't add people enough.

01:05:10.697 --> 01:05:12.280
One of the things
that people don't do

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.230
is they don't ramp
up their salaries.

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:19.040
So add in 2% a quarter,
that gives you 8% a year.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.000
It's not an unreasonable number.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.800
And again, while most payrolls
are going up kind of 3%

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:30.772
these days, if you're trying to
hold on to technology talent,

01:05:30.772 --> 01:05:33.230
you're going to have to give
them a little something extra.

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:36.000
So again, this goes out--
just add 2% a year out

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.160
until year four.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.340
And so the math gets
done, and these go

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.760
to the departmental expenses.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.970
Non-salary expenses.

01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:46.480
Well, we've got our
salary expenses,

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.380
and then you've got tech
supplies and miscellaneous.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:54.820
I would urge you to put in
as many formulas as you can.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:59.520
So for like your programmers,
put in $2,000 per person,

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.020
per month.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:03.800
It sounds like a lot, but I've
worked in a couple technology

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.780
companies, and it could
be an oscilloscope,

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:11.090
it could be some cabling, it
could be some CAD software.

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:13.940
Whatever it is, these guys can
figure out a way to spin it.

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:16.870
If that sounds like too much
to you, put in $1,000 a month.

01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:19.710
But the beauty of that is that,
as you change your staffing

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:23.679
plan, this number just ramps
up and down in line with that.

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.970
So you can make dramatic
changes to your staffing plan,

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:29.465
you don't have to come back
here and fat-finger anything in.

01:06:29.465 --> 01:06:31.590
But some of these things,
you are going to have to,

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:33.030
especially in the
marketing area.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:36.310
You're going to have to decide,
what trade shows do I go to,

01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:42.040
and what am I going to
do for sales expenses?

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.910
And then you could
even put in commissions

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:52.300
in here, commissions as
a percentage of sales,

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.980
if that seems to work.

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:56.350
And so therefore, as
your cells ramp up,

01:06:56.350 --> 01:07:00.550
your commissions ramp
up in line with that.

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:04.230
And here's your travel per
person per month for your sales

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:06.500
people is $3,000.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:09.890
That seems to be pretty
good number there.

01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:12.480
I put in telephone and
internet per person,

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.170
and that just ramps up
as your company ramps up.

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:18.940
So use as many formulas
in this as you can.

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:23.480
And so that brings us
back to our quarterly P&amp;L,

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.570
and where it all comes together.

01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:30.500
I've got a quick example
here on your CAPEX.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.050
And so what I did was I
took your total revenues,

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:36.220
but I offset revenues
by a quarter,

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:38.590
figuring that
customers are going

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:41.830
to take 60 to 90 days to pay.

01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:44.520
So if you bill them
now, assume that you're

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.320
going to get money 90
days from now, right?

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.860
And hopefully,
you'll get it sooner.

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.589
But your other expense
is your employees,

01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:53.880
which are 2/3 of your expenses.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.960
They want to get paid
on payday, right?

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.970
They don't want to get
paid 30 days from now.

01:07:57.970 --> 01:07:59.550
So I just assumed--
you know, this

01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:03.180
is a little bit of a
conservative look at it--

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:08.120
but I assume your other expenses
come due in the current period.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:13.170
And so based on that, you plug
in a starting balance here,

01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:17.140
and you say, where does
this money get us to?

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:22.920
This money gets us
to the end of Q3.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:26.180
In that case, I'm going to
need to raise additional money,

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:29.080
and how much money am I going
to have to raise there to get us

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.710
to the next milestone?

01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:32.460
So in this case, I
said, well, maybe we've

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.830
hit a milestone here
at the end of Q3,

01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:36.760
and that's going to
allow us to raise

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.189
our next round of funding.

01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:38.689
OK?

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:42.890
I've talked about most of these.

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:47.020
Showing steady and
consistent growth.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.790
And here's some
suggestions in here,

01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:52.010
in terms of an executive summary
versus a full blown business

01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:52.510
plan.

01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:56.046
In reality, the
executive summary

01:08:56.046 --> 01:08:58.045
is all most people are
going to want to look at,

01:08:58.045 --> 01:08:59.858
at the beginning, and
then when they really

01:08:59.858 --> 01:09:01.399
get into due diligence,
they're going

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:04.390
to want to look at the rest.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.979
So I think I can get through the
rest of this in five minutes,

01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:11.430
because I've gone
over a lot of it.

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:14.069
What I would say, as you think
about equity in your company--

01:09:14.069 --> 01:09:18.870
you're sitting around a
conference table here at MIT,

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:21.220
and you're thinking
about the company,

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:26.060
or maybe you've been working
on the company for the last two

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.420
years and you're really
ready to launch it--

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:32.149
all I would urge you is that
the work that is yet to be done

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:34.990
is far more than the work
that has been done already.

01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:38.240
Even though it feels like
you've done a tremendous amount,

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.050
the work that it takes growing
to a $1 million dollars

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:42.979
is hard.

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:45.770
But growing from $1
million to $10 million

01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:48.490
is equally hard, if not harder.

01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:52.750
And going from $10 million to
$100 million is really hard.

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:56.870
So the fact that a lot
has been accomplished,

01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:59.050
there's still a lot left to do.

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:03.670
So you don't want to
reward people for what's

01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:04.860
been done in the past.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:09.160
You want to incentivize them
to do things in the future.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.800
So I'm a big believer
that everyone should vest.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.690
I used to be
adamantly against this

01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:17.740
when I was a member
of a founding team.

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.570
But I've heard horror stories
where three or four people

01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:24.430
get together, and one
guy, or one person,

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:26.760
gets an opportunity
that they can't pass up

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.880
and they leave with
their 25% of the company.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.280
And then the three
people that are left

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.080
are now working for
themselves, and not

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.560
taking a paycheck, for someone
who's actually got a great job.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.670
So I think everyone should vest
over some kind of three or four

01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:47.630
your period.

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:51.246
Typically, this is the
ranges that you would see.

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:55.450
A CEO in the 5% range,
5% to maybe 10%.

01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:57.590
VPs in the 1% to 2 and 1/2%.

01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:00.160
This would be after dilution.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:04.490
Senior managers about 0.25%, and
a senior individual contributor

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:06.790
about 0.10%.

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:12.350
If you're on the
founding management team,

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:16.560
you might get two to three
times this amount, in part

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.596
because you're going
to get diluted.

01:11:18.596 --> 01:11:20.970
And if you're founding employee,
you might get even more.

01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:26.147
So if you have a senior
individual contributor,

01:11:26.147 --> 01:11:27.730
who's really important
to the company,

01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:31.300
and he's going to get 0.10%,
that's the kind of person you

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:37.570
might give 0.25%
or 0.50% up front.

01:11:37.570 --> 01:11:39.920
So let's look at
some examples here.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.910
You get a sense I always
like to look at the endpoint,

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:45.514
and then go back
to the beginning

01:11:45.514 --> 01:11:47.680
and figure out how I'm going
to get to the endpoint.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.620
So my endpoint here is looking
at this whole dilution,

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.215
and here this is
the same spreadsheet

01:11:52.215 --> 01:11:54.060
that we had earlier,
I've just add

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.430
a little more detail
with some names here,

01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:59.130
and some specifics
about the people.

01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:03.450
So looking at this point, this
is where we're going to get to.

01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:05.800
But at the beginning,
we have four founders

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.520
that have split the equity
$2 million, $1 million,

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.580
and $1 million.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.240
OK, that all sounds
well and good.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.800
They have 100% here.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.040
As we bring in our
key employees-- here

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.410
we have a VP of
R&amp;D. He's critical.

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:22.580
Normally, you'd say a VP
of R&amp;D would get about 1%.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:26.550
Well, in reality, by the
time we get out to this,

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:29.590
after all of our dilution
out here, this VP of R&amp;D

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:31.290
is going to be at 1%.

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:36.270
And some other key
employees here.

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:39.080
And maybe a board of
advisors or board members,

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.680
who would get some equity.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.670
We then bring in our angel
investors, who get 10%,

01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:45.790
and everyone up
here gets diluted.

01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:49.290
And we then bring in
our VC round at 50%,

01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:52.560
and, again, everyone
up above gets diluted,

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.010
including the angels.

01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:56.520
One of the things that
got brought up-- you know,

01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:00.020
Axel was talking
about $50 for 10%.

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:04.360
And my initial reaction was
that seems really onerous.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.190
It doesn't seem
like a great deal.

01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:11.080
But when you realize that
he's coming in at this stage,

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:15.300
he's coming in really
as the angel investor,

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:19.340
and by the time this all gets
done-- well, what's my example?

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:21.250
My example actually works out.

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:23.700
Just take a zero off of this.

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:28.600
His 10% is going to get
diluted down to 2.3%.

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:35.310
So if you're getting all that
other value, then that 2.3%

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:39.060
doesn't seem to be
too much to give up.

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.590
I will say that angel investors
are pretty keen on looking

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:44.450
at this spreadsheet, too.

01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:48.530
And while a lot of people think
that angel investors will not

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:53.210
be as tough negotiators
as the VC investors,

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:56.820
I would argue they're investing
their own money rather than

01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:00.470
the firm's money, and they have
seen this spreadsheet as well,

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:08.220
and the angel investors will
be every bit as tough as the VC

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.350
negotiations.

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:12.280
Now, friends and family
is a different story.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.850
And I've had very good success
with friends and family coming

01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:18.060
in, but I mean they're
your friends and family.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:20.200
You're not going to try
and screw them over.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.990
So hopefully you're going
to give them a fair deal

01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:25.080
to begin with.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.330
So it's 9 o'clock on the dot.

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.710
I can take one or two
questions, but then I

01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:34.440
know that Joe's
going to shut me off.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.460
Any-- OK, one here.

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:40.750
AUDIENCE: What are the
usual terms on the vests

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:43.570
with the original founders?

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:45.690
CHARLIE TILLETT: I
think over four years,

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:50.440
what you might say-- so four
years with quarterly vesting.

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.640
I mean, you could do
monthly, but I mean it really

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.330
doesn't matter at that point.

01:14:54.330 --> 01:15:00.010
So four year vesting
with 1/16 every quarter.

01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:01.800
Or you what you could
say is, let's say

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:06.210
you've been working
together for a year,

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:09.520
you say, everyone
starts with 20% vested,

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:13.280
and then the remaining
80% vests over four years,

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.200
or three years.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.380
Something like that,
just so that someone

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:19.020
doesn't get cold
feet when they going

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:23.268
starts to get tough and
bail on the rest the team.

01:15:23.268 --> 01:15:27.100
AUDIENCE: So if they leave after
two years, would they still get

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.834
the part they had
before, or would they--

01:15:29.834 --> 01:15:30.750
CHARLIE TILLETT: Yeah.

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:33.010
So let's say you
were going to get

01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:35.730
160,000 shares over four years.

01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:38.930
That would be $40,000 a
year, or $10,000 a quarter.

01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:41.600
Every quarter, you vest $10,000.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.170
So if you leave after two years,
you have your 80,000 shares,

01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:48.600
and you go, and they're yours.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:53.845
And the $80,000 that
you didn't invest--

01:15:53.845 --> 01:15:55.970
look, if you thought it
was going to be successful,

01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:57.370
you shouldn't be leaving.

01:15:57.370 --> 01:16:00.995
So you've left that,
and those are gone.

01:16:00.995 --> 01:16:02.578
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you could

01:16:02.578 --> 01:16:04.161
talk a little bit
about the difference

01:16:04.161 --> 01:16:06.554
between the CEOs and the CFOs?

01:16:06.554 --> 01:16:09.701
First, the difference, B,
whether a start-up needs

01:16:09.701 --> 01:16:12.701
a CFO at a very early
stage, and the last part

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:15.631
is, you know, who
makes the decision?

01:16:15.631 --> 01:16:18.130
CHARLIE TILLETT: Well, look the
CEO makes all the decisions.

01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:21.173
I serve at the
pleasure of the CEO.

01:16:21.173 --> 01:16:26.930
But the CFO-- I
think by the time

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:30.580
you take your first
venture money,

01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:34.020
first off you have the
money to pay a CFO,

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.470
and it will be money well spent.

01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:39.600
Because as I showed you, all
those rounds of financing

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.340
at Reveal, I can't tell
you how much dilution

01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:48.800
I saved my founders
by thinking ahead

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.960
about what we needed to do.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:58.300
So I saved my salary and
equity for him, you know,

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.860
10 times over.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:01.870
But we did have a deal.

01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:04.520
For the very first
year, I worked half time

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.060
for half salary.

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:11.840
And then, we agreed that as the
company-- I was in a position

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.260
where I could work half time.

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.080
And so I think it's
good to have-- maybe you

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:21.560
have a mentor advisor for that
first year and a controller.

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.210
But the problem is, is that
you really want someone,

01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:28.260
especially when you
start raising money,

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:31.710
you want someone who's been
through the process before.

01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:36.510
And they will save
you-- you know,

01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:41.080
an experienced person will
save you a couple percent

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.100
of dilution right off the bat.

01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:44.130
So what's that worth?

01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:44.755
It all depends.

01:17:44.755 --> 01:17:48.650
So you sell your company for
$200 million, it's worth a lot.

01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:51.227
OK, maybe one more.

01:17:51.227 --> 01:17:52.810
Oh, looks like I've
gotten everything.

01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:53.900
So thank you very much.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:55.069
[APPLAUSE]
