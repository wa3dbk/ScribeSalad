00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.220
BOB JONES: I was working
in this consulting firm.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.410
I got bored.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.280
I wanted to go start
a business, and I

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.100
said it's not like
I'm in my dorm room.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.150
It's not like I haven't
done this before,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.840
so I need to be sensible
about it this time.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.070
Because I've had
start-ups that succeeded

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.000
and start-ups that failed, and
I like the successes more than

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.390
I like the failures.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.570
So I interviewed a bunch of
people, scientists, marketing

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.390
types, et cetera and came
up with about 15 ideas

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.000
and said that's too many.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.920
I need some filters.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.320
The first filter was I need
to solve the right problem,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.940
because I'm good
enough at operations

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.315
that I'm going to
hit the target.

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:06.890
But it's embarrassing if
you pick the wrong target.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.080
So my definition of
the right problem

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.419
is that you would cheerfully
pay for the solution

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:12.710
and you will tell your friends.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.400
So I can lower your
cholesterol with

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.660
a nutritional intervention.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.600
It's not the right target,
because you don't care.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.554
You'll forget to take it, your
medication, most of the time,

00:01:24.554 --> 00:01:26.970
and you're never going to talk
about it with your friends.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.170
And I can't afford to educate
you, because I'm a start up.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.510
If your back hurts, ooh, that's
a whole different matter.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.400
Because if I can help
you with something

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.050
that makes your
back stop hurting,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.356
you will cheerfully pay for it.

00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:40.480
You will tell your friends.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.120
And if furthermore
I can set it up so

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.140
that when you stop taking my
stuff your back starts hurting,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.370
that's the right target.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.420
Second filter, I have to
be able solve the problem.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.830
So if I had an enzyme
that metabolized gluten,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.500
I would be speaking to
you today from my yacht.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.960
So that one's off the table.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.680
That killed all but
about five of the ideas.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.400
The remaining filter
was somebody besides me

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.350
thinks this company
is a cool idea

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.080
and will buy it if
I don't screw it up.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.610
So the last thing I did was
took the remaining ideas

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.450
and called some senior execs
that I was friendly with,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.190
had companies that
could, well, one day

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.450
buy the business-- Procter
&amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.705
Pepsi, et cetera-- and
said, I'm having some ideas.

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:33.330
I'd like to hear your
thoughts on them.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.387
I'm not selling anything.

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:36.970
Well, I knew you
were up to something.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.340
What are you doing?

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.760
And when I would
offer an idea, if I

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.750
would hear crickets and--
OK, on to the next idea.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.770
That's how we arrived at sleep.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.580
There's somewhere between 50
and 70 million people in the US

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.380
that have trouble sleeping,
and they complain about it.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.890
And nobody has to tell them
the benefits of a good night's

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.390
sleep.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.580
Everybody just feels
better, and there

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.570
are nutritional interventions
that will solve the problem.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.280
And the companies
I talked to said

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.700
if you don't screw this up,
we'd like to be first in line

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.290
to talk to you in
about two years.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.720
So with that as background,
I had several businesses

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.800
in the past where we
made nutrition bars

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.290
and sold them
through clinicians.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.360
So my business model was
let's make a nutrition bar,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.850
and let's sell it
through clinicians.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.392
But I talked to a
number of consumers

00:03:26.392 --> 00:03:28.391
and said, how do you feel
about eating something

00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.720
at 10:00 or 10:30 at night
that will have you asleep

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.515
a half hour later?

00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:34.800
And most of them said I don't
feel so good about that.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.560
I don't like the idea
of eating something.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.650
OK, what would you like?

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.950
Well, you know those little
5 Hour Energy drink things?

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.230
Make me one of those, except
with the opposite effect.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.270
Oops, looks like I'm in
the beverage business.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.230
OK, well so maybe
what I can do here

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.230
is find the clinicians that
you are seeing about the fact

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.020
that you're having
trouble sleeping,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.990
and I can do what I did before.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.870
My business model will be I
will call on the clinicians.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.920
The clinicians will
say, this is fabulous.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.380
I will tell my patients.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.950
The patients will
want to buy it.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.630
One day I will call Walgreens.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.520
We'll stock it there.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.920
We've done this before.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.399
You may remember
a little while ago

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.060
I said I had a really bad five
or six weeks where everybody

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.220
told me no.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.910
I called doctors, nurses,
physical therapists,

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.090
dietitians.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.470
I went to assisted living
facilities and retirement

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.340
communities and talked to
resident care directors.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.220
And without exception,
I was told no.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.440
People don't talk to
their doctor about sleep.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.900
They talk to their doctor
about their ear ache.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.010
If they do talk to their
doctor about sleep,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.990
the doctor runs for
cover, because he doesn't

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.720
know how to solve the problem.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.110
And he's been trained that this
is a symptom of something else.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.420
You are depressed and
you need a therapist,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.140
or you have sleep apnea and you
need one of those Darth Vader

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.210
devices that blows
positive air pressure

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.190
and it keeps you
from having apnea.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.550
So let's refer you to
somebody else next.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.850
So nobody was willing to
talk about our intervention.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.170
This was the point--
at this point,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.170
we had made our
minimum viable product,

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.890
and we were offering
free samples.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.860
And they didn't want
it even if it was free,

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.430
so clearly the business
model was flawed.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.320
We weren't going to be able to
get it into Walgreens or places

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.770
like that if we couldn't
find any customers.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.150
And the route I had chosen
to get to the customers

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.108
was not working.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.160
Nevertheless, there
were people who

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.520
were calling us back and buying
our minimum viable product.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.360
The one that looks
bad tastes bad,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.330
and because the little
manufacturer spilled

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.610
a little solution on the threads
and it dried into something

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.790
like superglue, you need a
vise grips to get the cap off.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.960
People were buying it anyway.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.810
Clearly we had
something there, so it

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.030
was time to address the business
model of what is it we have,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.920
and to whom should we be
marketing it, and how.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.670
Along the way I ended up in a
conversation with Whole Foods.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.740
Because when I was running
a soy foods company

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.980
I sold a lot of tofu to
them, and I knew them.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.860
So I thought, oh, OK.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.860
We'll put this together.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.270
We'll sell it
through Whole Foods.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.820
But who is our customer?

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.860
We did a lot of work,
a lot of interviews,

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.270
got told no some
more and concluded

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.540
that there are a number
of niche markets here

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.540
that we could work with.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.640
But the one where we were going
to start was working moms,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.710
and not working moms who have
infants or toddlers at home.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.040
They expect to be
tired, and they

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.656
want to be able to wake
up if the baby's not

00:06:53.656 --> 00:06:54.780
sleeping through the night.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.720
So forget it.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.250
But once their kids are
preschool, kindergarten,

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.410
or older, they've got
the hardest job on earth.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.500
Most of them have
husbands who don't shop,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.740
don't cook, don't pick up their
socks, so they're hardworking.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.450
They're daytime professionals.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.945
They're fussy
about what they buy

00:07:13.945 --> 00:07:15.320
and what they
bring in the house.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.720
They do shop at Whole Foods.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.670
It looks like the
right market for us.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:24.050
So in my conversation
with Whole Foods,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.820
I was pretty direct
with them and said,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.450
look, I can live a
long and happy life

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.567
and never put my
products on your shelf.

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:32.900
The moral of the point, I
don't want to be on your shelf

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.590
if it doesn't make sense.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.010
So really the purpose of
this meeting in my view

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.070
is to figure out will
it ever make sense

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.490
and if so, what's
the trigger point.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.150
And the answer to that was
when we see enough reorders

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:51.660
through Amazon to show
that there's a there there,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.030
come back and see them.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:53.797
Keep them posted.

00:07:53.797 --> 00:07:54.880
They'll remain interested.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.080
We are after all friends,
and it's a provocative idea.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.980
So the revised business
model now having

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.540
gone through this
postulate the idea,

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.240
develop a minimum
viable product,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.010
shake it down in
the marketplace,

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.390
identify the target is
we're reaching working

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.290
moms via mommy bloggers.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.420
We've identified 100
of them, some of whom

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.550
have as many as
100,000 followers.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.640
There's also all manner
of social media ways

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.980
to reach working moms.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.540
So working moms,
we're reaching them.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.250
We're selling the product
through our website which

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.039
will be a minuscule
percentage and through Amazon

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.730
until such point as we have
enough of a reorder stream

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.250
to make a justifiable
approach to Whole Foods

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.799
and other retailers.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:44.590
Shortly after that, we
hope to sell the business.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.580
So Rich, that's sort of an
impromptu summary of how

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.200
our business model
morphed and pivoted,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.240
and it's a work in process.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.328
So if you don't have anything
else to do, wish us luck.

00:08:56.328 --> 00:08:57.244
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:59.925 --> 00:09:00.800
BOB JONES: Thank you.

00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:05.620
PROFESSOR: So the
reason I wanted

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.810
Bob to tell you about
that is to reemphasize

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.670
this is not just an
academic exercise.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.660
He told you about how
he succeeded before.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.430
He told you how he
failed the first time.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.020
He did something
different the second.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.320
He took the second model
into the third market,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.570
which turned out not to be the
right thing for that market.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.730
And he's reinventing it.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.280
And it's been an
interesting thing.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.290
So what we say up here,
we're not giving you

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.490
a formula on how to do it.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.270
We're trying to get you to think
about these kind of issues,

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.640
and this is an example
of an in-process thing.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.690
And it's been an
interesting route.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:47.550
Bob, any other comments or
people from the audience?

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.390
BOB JONES: It's
practically a reality TV

00:09:51.281 --> 00:09:53.114
RICH KIVEL: What were
some of the learnings?

00:09:53.114 --> 00:09:57.050
It sounds like you modified
the business model throughout.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.986
There were learnings
[INAUDIBLE] You integrated

00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:02.462
different approaches.

00:10:02.462 --> 00:10:05.831
What were some of the learnings
that came out of that?

00:10:05.831 --> 00:10:07.330
What would you have
done differently

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.730
if you were
relaunching it today?

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.117
PROFESSOR: Rich, is your mic on?

00:10:12.117 --> 00:10:12.700
BOB JONES: OK.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.150
Rich's question,
for those of you

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.620
who may not have heard it
from the back of the room,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.210
was what were some of
my learnings so far?

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.010
And if I were to relaunch the
business today, what would

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.390
I do differently?

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:36.460
And I think that most
entrepreneurs are stubborn.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.996
I'm no exception to that.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:49.360
Well, you almost
never tackle something

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.730
that's going to be easy.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.180
And I have a guy on my
business advisory board

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:02.810
who will give me 10 reasons why
every idea I have will fail,

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.790
and why every suggestion
I make is dumb.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.000
And it's quite useful because
eight of the 10 things

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.370
he'll rattle off, I've
thought about and addressed.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.730
And two of them I think, ooh,
I'd better think about that.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.740
But you have to be willing
to walk through walls

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.110
because it's hard.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.950
And most of you will fail.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.200
I did.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.505
You'll just need to
decide that as a jockey,

00:11:26.505 --> 00:11:28.840
you need a different horse.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.490
But I found something
that worked.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.460
And I went out and
proudly talked about it

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.450
to the investment community.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.130
And then I tried it.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.270
And I tried it.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.900
And I tried it.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.410
And it didn't work.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.720
So one of the things I
would have done differently,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.370
were I to do it
again, would have

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.910
been to test the idea
right from the get-go,

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.600
rather than just assuming
that because it had worked

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.840
in the past, that this market
and this group of people

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.084
was like the last market and
the last group of people.

00:12:00.084 --> 00:12:01.084
PROFESSOR: That's great.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.960
BOB JONES: Yes sir.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.001
AUDIENCE: It seems like
most of it is [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:25.314 --> 00:12:27.230
BOB JONES: I don't really
know how to do that.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.620
What I like is
translating science,

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.830
which is somewhere near
to the leading edge,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.795
into something that
consumers can buy.

00:12:35.795 --> 00:12:37.920
And I don't want to get
metaphysical with you here.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.670
But I think there are some
really fundamental things

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.960
wrong with our
health care system.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.070
And we don't often enough
provide consumers with stuff

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.420
they can buy, which works,
without a prescription.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.950
And I like being in that arena.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.770
And I like being able to
understand what consumers want

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.930
and translating some
fairly serious science--

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.940
it's pretty sophisticated
biochemistry

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.580
in our little beverage
for sleep-- into something

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.350
that we can describe without
going into all the science.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.440
So I actually don't know.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.120
I don't really
have any experience

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.571
selling the one-off stuff.

00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:16.070
So with that as background, I'm
going to duck your question.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.189
I don't know.

00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:19.230
There was maybe one more.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.642
Yes, sir?

00:13:20.642 --> 00:13:21.624
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.510
BOB JONES: We had three
ingredients in the product.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.190
And there were published
papers on the action

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.790
of each of the three.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.090
So sucrose gets
metabolized here.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.570
Protein gets metabolized here.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.070
And gluconeogenesis runs through
the liver, blah, blah, blah.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.580
And uncooked corn starch
with its complex double bonds

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.390
takes a far longer period
of time to metabolize.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.670
And we would show the
papers to the clinicians.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.410
And they'd say, well
this is a no-brainer.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.240
First of all it's just a food.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.370
So it won't hurt you.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.640
It costs $1.00.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.440
Might help.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.740
Go for it.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.460
That was all the
resistance we found.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.410
There were maybe
3% of the doctors

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.760
out there that we
called on who said,

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.470
when you got a clinical
trial on it, call us back.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.620
And we did in fact eventually
do a clinical trial

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.460
with the Joslin
Diabetes Institute.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.950
It did what it was
supposed to do.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.590
But as an entrepreneur,
I was unwilling to wait.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.370
Let's get in the market.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.430
My measure of whether or not it
works is, do they reorder it?

00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:48.900
PROFESSOR: Hey.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.170
Thank you, Bob.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:56.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.670
OK, so now segueing
from what Bob told you

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.230
about he's doing to find
customers and everything,

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.000
the question again
is business models.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.770
And tonight we have Rich Kivel,
who I've known for many years.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.970
Originally an internet IT
technology entrepreneur,

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.571
moved into the
medical area and bio,

00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:21.230
and more recently into the
financial technology area.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.590
So Rich Kivel-- his
bio is on the website.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.990
And his topic is
business models.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.850
Take it away, Rich.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.370
RICH KIVEL: Thank you very much.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:29.870
Great.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.970
Can everybody hear me OK?

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:32.470
All right.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.594
It's great to be back here.

00:15:33.594 --> 00:15:36.239
I've had the privilege of doing
this class with Joe for-- he's

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:37.530
invited me back for many years.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.560
I won't say how many,
but many, many years.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.670
So it's also great to be here,
being the 25th year of it.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.510
Has anybody here actually
attended this class before?

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.050
All right.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.410
That's good.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.034
So I could tell some
of the same jokes.

00:15:50.034 --> 00:15:53.481
And I will actually get laughs
out of them. [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:54.980
So first of all, I
want to start off

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.920
because I love social media.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.650
And I'm going to include
you in my social media

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.430
life a little bit.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.160
So everybody here
uses Twitter, yes?

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.170
Or most of you?

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.180
That's our hashtag.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.900
So on the count of three, I want
you guys all to cheer and yell

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.790
in a congratulatory way for
Joe celebrating the 25th year

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.030
of this class, all right?

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.585
One, two, three.

00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:23.180
AUDIENCE: [CHEERING AND YELLING]

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.026
RICH KIVEL: You guys.

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:25.940
I love it.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.835
Joe, that is live.

00:16:26.835 --> 00:16:27.710
That was outstanding.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.820
So what I get to talk about
today is actually kind of fun.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.930
It's business models.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.470
And unlike a lot of
aspects of business,

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.120
business models themselves,
they change all the time.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.900
And as a matter of
fact, they become

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.360
an incredibly intricate
and important part

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.230
of how a business succeeds or
fails, which is something new.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.950
As I've worked around MIT for
the past 15 or more years,

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:57.230
so often the
researchers, scientists,

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.660
engineers that I speak with are
so focused on their product,

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.610
their technology,
the intricacies

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.119
of a particular design,
that they actually

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.010
don't think about the customer.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.060
And they don't think
about how it's ever

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.185
going to get to the market.

00:17:11.185 --> 00:17:14.030
They're more interested
in can they actually get

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:20.560
that new particular
engineering-physics combined

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.170
technology to do something
they never did before.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.150
Can they get that
particular molecule

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.400
to operate in a certain way?

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.300
Or can they get that
thin film polymer

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.180
to elude a particular drug?

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.000
And that's fantastic.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.210
But very often we
forget about how

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.540
do we actually impact the
world with our technologies,

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.490
whether it be internet
technologies, applications,

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.630
hardware, software,
biotechnology.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.160
So business models are really
the foundation of that.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.050
And very often that's
left to business students.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.180
And one of the wonderful
things about MIT

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.470
is that there's this
great convergence, where

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.630
business students
actually have discussions

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.580
with engineers and scientists
and researchers and vice versa.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.510
And that doesn't
happen everywhere.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:04.930
So we take it for granted here.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.730
So I'm very privileged
to come and talk

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.400
to you about business models.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.870
My background, as Joe said
is-- I started my career

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.670
in technology, and
then moved very much

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:19.300
into bioscience, biotechnology,
bioinformatics, diagnostics.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.660
I spent about the past
10 years doing that.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.650
I took two years off, and
was focused specifically

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.725
on the financial
services industries.

00:18:27.725 --> 00:18:31.460
So I worked for a very large
fund in Westport, Connecticut.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.170
Now back in the Boston area.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.710
And now focused again more on
not only funding and financing

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.060
of early-stage
development companies,

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.020
but also in identifying
great intellectual property

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.830
and technology, all-around
science and research.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.240
So today's talk is going to
be about business models.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.670
And I'm hoping to share
some insights with you.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.480
Essentially this is how
I think of these things.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.680
We start off with a whole
bunch of disparate data points.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.630
We call that information.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.520
Hopefully we begin to
connect those dots.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.310
It's almost like a
pointillist painting, where

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.667
you have thousands of dots.

00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:09.250
And then slowly as
they come together,

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:10.220
they start to connect.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.320
And then ultimately out
of that, you have wisdom.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.850
You have an image that
is created out of that.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.520
What I hope to do
today is provide you

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.850
each of those three--
information, knowledge,

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.300
and wisdom.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.880
So let's start off with
a simple foundation.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.300
And the foundation is to
say this-- many definitions

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.181
of a business model exist.

00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:32.430
The one that I like the most
is simply this-- a method

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.970
by which a firm uses
its resources-- cash,

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.160
technology, its people-- to
offer its customers better

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.100
value than its competitors,
and make money doing so.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.846
It tells who pays how much,
and how often do they pay.

00:19:46.846 --> 00:19:48.220
For those of you
that are looking

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.810
to start companies, or even
begin to work for companies,

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.560
especially
early-stage companies,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.690
the question that the
board, the investors,

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.870
the new employee coming in
the door are going to ask

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.500
is, what do you do?

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.380
Who do you sell to?

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.430
And how do you make money?

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.360
It's pretty simple.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.460
The how do you make
money part is often

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.500
the challenge for
many start-ups.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.016
They have very cool technology.

00:20:11.016 --> 00:20:13.440
They think they know
who's going to buy it.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.820
But they have no
idea how they're

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.392
going to get it in the
hands of those individuals.

00:20:17.392 --> 00:20:18.850
Are they going to
create a website?

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.710
Are they going to join--
sign on to the app store?

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.520
Are they going to go retail?

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.090
Are they going to
use a distribution

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.440
channel or partner?

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.627
That's the big crux of it.

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:31.210
So that's the question you have
to continue to think about is,

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.960
how do we ultimately make money
from what we are developing?

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.730
So what's changed
a lot in the way

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.800
we operate in this world is
the way that companies operate,

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.244
the way that companies
are formed and developed.

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:46.410
And this chart is not really
meant, in great detail,

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:46.910
to be read.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.910
But overall, what
you have here is

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.790
an example of how over time, you
have points of history where,

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.840
as industries
developed, changed,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.810
they went away, what you had is
different ways of communicating

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.970
with the world, different
ways of actually connecting

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.570
with consumers.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:09.250
If you think about back in the
days of merchants and mechanics

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.700
and industrial
businesses, the way

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.740
they operated and communicated
was much different.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.510
Retail stores existed, but in a
very, very, very different way.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.820
They were family-run stores.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.350
Most of the products and
services we bought from

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.790
were from a few large
retailers like Sears,

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.490
whether that be your
washer and dryer

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.100
or your tools or other things.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.590
As technology continued
to mature, what you saw

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.970
is the financial service
industry becoming very, very

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.144
sophisticated.

00:21:37.144 --> 00:21:38.560
And the financial
service industry

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:44.800
began to allow us to see
business in a global way.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.210
Out of that came complex
advertising campaigns,

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.740
global marketing and
distribution mechanisms.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:55.480
And what you saw is entirely
new ways to buy and reach

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.120
the end user, the products.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.580
What really changed is,
at this end of the world,

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:06.160
where you had technology, was
then introduced in such a way

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.855
that distribution of goods--
ultimately the ability

00:22:09.855 --> 00:22:12.590
to connect an individual
who wants a product

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.240
or service to that
product or service--

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.600
the barriers of distance,
the barriers of manufacturing

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.012
suddenly went away.

00:22:20.012 --> 00:22:21.970
The United States has
probably done this better

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.520
than almost any
place in the world.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.920
We can get something
delivered tomorrow

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.380
that we ordered this afternoon
at 11:00 AM or 1 o'clock

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.440
in the afternoon, whether it be
a product or service, because

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.860
of financial support and
backing for those type

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.740
of organizations, whether it
be the manufacturers, the UPS,

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.450
the FedEx, and others.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.654
The distribution channels
have shrunk greatly.

00:22:47.654 --> 00:22:49.570
When I travel to different
parts of the world,

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:55.200
they find an amazing selection
of products and services

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.000
that we have in
the United States.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.170
And when you go elsewhere,
you notice how limited it is.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.670
If you're living
in parts of Europe,

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.330
if you're living
in parts of Africa,

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.570
parts of Asia, if you're
living in most of Russia--

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.520
the ability to actually
order something today

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:14.470
and see it arrives in the next
month is very, very unlikely.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.470
And the more remote you
are, the less likely

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.060
it is it's ever
going to reach you

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.850
on time, or without
being lost in some part

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.260
of the distribution channel.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.260
So I encourage you
to think about,

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.860
as technology has changed
and distribution channels

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.280
have changed, it has
impacted the way that we

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.020
operate and build companies.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.540
So at MIT, when we
think about how do you

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.070
bring a company from
the idea to the market,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.670
or what is so often called
the lab to the market, the way

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:44.657
you think about that has to
integrate the business model.

00:23:44.657 --> 00:23:47.115
So for those of you here that
are scientists or researchers

00:23:47.115 --> 00:23:50.340
or engineers, as you're thinking
about your new products,

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.770
your service, or
your technology,

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.630
you have to continually test
who is going to buy this.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.110
How am I going to get
it to the consumer?

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.520
How will this ultimately impact
the people that I care about,

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.020
the people that are
going to benefit

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.485
from my product or my service?

00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:06.860
Just as Bob was
sharing with us--

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.830
before-- some of the learnings
he had as he was developing

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.810
his new company, were
those bumps in the road

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.754
as they realized that various
ideas they had about, hey,

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:16.920
we'll give it away for free.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.253
Or perhaps we'll go through
this particular distribution

00:24:19.253 --> 00:24:19.910
channel.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.340
Those things did not work.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.680
You learn from those.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.560
You incorporate.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.870
You speak to more consumers.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.630
You speak to more investors
that are expert in the space.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.620
And you modify your approach.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.045
So as all of you think about
building companies, products,

00:24:33.045 --> 00:24:34.670
and technology, think
about how are you

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.490
getting it to the consumer.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.490
I think the mistake that
a lot of people have is

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.660
they think that as they
read The Wall Street

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.740
Journal or Bloomberg
or MSNBC is,

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.060
they hear about the
stories of these companies,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.530
and the stratospheric
growth of these companies.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.950
But they think success is
this linear process, when

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:51.740
it's really not.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.030
Success is really messy.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.270
It's noisy.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.070
There's lots of bumps, lots
of failures and challenges,

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.780
whether it be because of
market acceptance, technology

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.890
failures, or it
happens just simply

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:07.116
because the market was not
ready for what you were doing.

00:25:07.116 --> 00:25:08.490
The goal is for
you to figure out

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.990
throughout those
bumps and those curves

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.340
how to identify
opportunity, and also

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.820
how to modify your
products and services.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.477
So that brings us to
business models in general.

00:25:18.477 --> 00:25:20.810
There's lots of different
ways to think about a business

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:21.900
model.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.150
Complexity was famous for years.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:25.940
I remember when I was
in graduate school,

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.780
they would talk about
business models, sales

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.440
and marketing and distribution.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.370
And it was mind boggling.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.227
If they pass it out on
an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet,

00:25:35.227 --> 00:25:37.560
you would need a magnifying
glass to figure out what was

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.650
happening because the
distribution channels were not

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:41.450
as sophisticated.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.420
The technology was
not as sophisticated.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.430
So you had complex models.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.830
And within these
complex models, there

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.300
were lots of points
of failure, lots

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.212
of points where your reseller
or your OEM channel--

00:25:54.212 --> 00:25:55.795
your original equipment
manufacturer--

00:25:55.795 --> 00:25:58.472
or your distributor
was failing, lots

00:25:58.472 --> 00:26:00.180
of points where the
manufacturing was not

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.530
succeeding or the retail
environment was struggling.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.220
So what's happened is you've
seen simplification of business

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.150
models-- these ideas that
become simplified in such a way

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.580
where you say to yourself,
I'm building this,

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.260
and I want it to be in
the hands of these people,

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.500
whether that be a consumer, a
doctor, a lawyer, if it happens

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.300
to be a large corporation.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.060
What's the easiest
way to get there?

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.036
And leveraging
technology, leveraging

00:26:26.036 --> 00:26:27.660
all of those things
that are out there,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.010
including the good advice
of experienced people,

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.000
will help simplify this.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.450
An example might be
Zipcar, a company

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.880
we're all very familiar with.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.450
This is a relatively
simple business model.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.460
It almost seems so
simple that you'd

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.620
be amazed if you presented
this to an investor and said,

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.530
this is our model.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.470
This is it.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.510
And we're going to build
basically a company

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.250
worth-- a publicly traded
company-- I don't even

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.700
know what the market
cap is at right now.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.270
Fantastic, successful
organization,

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.610
operating globally in many
cities around the world.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.170
They kept it very simple,
very organized business model.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.710
How many people
here use Dropbox?

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.170
You get 2/3 of the group
here that use Dropbox.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:15.050
When's the last time you saw
a Dropbox advertisement on TV?

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.500
It doesn't exist.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.800
20 years ago, if you were
looking to build a company,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.650
you'd have to have an
advertising budget.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.580
You'd have to think
about how we're

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.290
going to wind up getting
this into the hands

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:23.910
of the right people.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:24.860
Who are the right people?

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.318
Are we going to
sell to businesses?

00:27:26.318 --> 00:27:28.200
Are we going to
sell to individuals?

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.340
What's Dropbox's business model?

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:34.460
How come you guys know
so much about Dropbox?

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.890
RICH KIVEL: How was that?

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:38.524
Word of mouth.

00:27:38.524 --> 00:27:39.440
Other people told you.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.639
It's viral.

00:27:40.639 --> 00:27:42.680
So somebody tells you
about this incredible thing

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.410
called Dropbox.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.030
You can sign up for free.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.380
You can get a certain amount
of megabits of space for free.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.380
And all of a sudden, you
start uploading photos.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.755
Or you're sharing PowerPoint
presentations and documents.

00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:53.797
And your friend signs on.

00:27:53.797 --> 00:27:56.088
And then all of a sudden,
you tell three other friends.

00:27:56.088 --> 00:27:56.970
And they sign on.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.920
And then all of a sudden,
when that is shown as viable,

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.490
before you know it, they've
got an entire model here

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:07.210
that is making them a
fortune, because they now

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:09.960
have businesses and
large-- what they call

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.410
Pro subscribers, large
users-- paying large dollars

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.570
in order to access that data.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:16.620
It's fantastic.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.630
Does that look like a
complicated business model?

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.710
No, not really.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.450
Here's another example
of simplicity rules.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.340
We have the luxury of
leveraging technology.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.210
And we also have different types
of mechanisms in order for us

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.152
to educate consumers.

00:28:34.152 --> 00:28:35.860
Viral marketing is
certainly one of those

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.170
we'll talk about today.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.210
So simply put, your business
model is not your business.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.640
Please remember that.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.090
The business model and
business model innovation

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:47.580
is critical in developing
a quality business,

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.150
attacking new markets and
driving profitability.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:52.950
Just as Bob had shared
earlier, the ability

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.880
to modify change and
dwarf your business model

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.539
is critical because
just one small change

00:29:02.539 --> 00:29:03.830
can make all of the difference.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:04.990
And we're going to talk
about some companies that

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.420
made small changes.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.680
And it's made all of the
difference in their success.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.080
So I'll do the academic
part of this presentation

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.250
to give you components
of the business model.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.830
Then we're going to talk
about some good examples.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.360
And then I'm going to leave
plenty of time for Q&amp;A,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.350
and end on time,
as I promised Joe.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.970
So from a business
model perspective,

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.095
there's lots of components.

00:29:26.095 --> 00:29:28.840
There's aspects of a business
model that should exist.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.200
Overall, they're pretty simple.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.920
What is the value proposition?

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.250
What are the market segments
that you're targeting?

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.580
What is the value chain?

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.660
And what is the structure
of that value chain?

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.620
Who's involved in it?

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.980
What is your position
within that value network?

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.550
Are you at the
early, early stage

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.250
from a standpoint
of manufacturing?

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.059
Are you at the end stage
from a standpoint of actually

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:51.100
delivering the product or
service to the consumer

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.150
or are you somewhere
in the middle?

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.160
How do you generate revenue?

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.100
And how do you generate margins?

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.461
And those are two
very different things.

00:29:59.461 --> 00:30:00.960
There are companies
out there we all

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.610
know that generate tremendous
amounts of revenue.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:07.590
And their margins are very
tiny-- 1%, half a percent

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.940
or less.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.414
But they make it up because
the revenue is so extreme.

00:30:11.414 --> 00:30:12.830
You have other
companies out there

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.840
that have exceptionally
high margins, tremendously

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.470
high margins, not
very large revenues.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.680
Think about luxury
goods resellers.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.360
Take a look at the
average consumer

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.180
that goes out and buys a
luxury bag or a nice suit

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.840
or an expensive watch.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.820
Well I can go buy a
watch from Movado.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.704
Or I can go buy a
watch from Swatch.

00:30:36.704 --> 00:30:37.870
These are beautiful watches.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.530
They're made by large
manufacturing groups.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.120
They're going through a very,
very sophisticated distribution

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:43.680
channel.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.520
And they're made in
the tens of thousands.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.270
Those watches are sold
anywhere between $39.00,

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:52.480
$49.00 up to probably $1,000.00.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.650
And they're sold
in the thousands

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:57.360
through retailers that
you see in the mall,

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.080
through retailers
that are online,

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.850
and also through big-box
sellers like Walmart

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.682
or Costco or others.

00:31:04.682 --> 00:31:06.140
You think, wow,
that's interesting.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.190
Someone like Swatch and also
Movado, which is much higher

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.590
end, they both sell through
similar distribution channels.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.380
They do tremendous volume.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.040
So they have very,
very high revenues.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.760
But their margins
are incredibly small.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.070
The goal is saturate the market.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.780
Get as many people
to buy as possible.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.520
Take a look at other
types of products

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.990
that are similar that
are called watches.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.430
Very often they're
then called timepieces,

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:35.750
where you have watches that
are handmade, where they're

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.130
made in a very, very
subtle way, where it's

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:42.890
a lot of on-hand or craftsman
work and craftsman design,

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.320
very low on the
manufacturing side.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.660
It might take months to
make a particular watch,

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.861
if not longer.

00:31:48.861 --> 00:31:51.110
And the watches sell for
tens of thousands or hundreds

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.600
of thousands of dollars.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.400
You think about
IWC, Patek Philippe.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.200
Many of these watches will sell
for $100,000.00 or $50,000.00

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.850
for a watch.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.630
Totally different
business model.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.020
Their margins are very large.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.680
But their overall revenues are
relatively small because they

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.080
don't sell a lot of pieces.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.140
Think about Mercedes-Benz.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.510
And think about Ford.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.900
If you base success on the
total number of vehicles sold,

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.800
Ford kills them year
in and year out.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.310
If you base it on margins,
slightly different story.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.670
Ford has some products that
are incredibly high margins,

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.120
like their SUVs.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.167
They have other products,
like their low-end cars

00:32:33.167 --> 00:32:34.250
that are very low margins.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:35.750
But they're looking
to get adoption

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.990
within a particular marketplace.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.200
Mercedes, much different story.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.160
Very high margins on virtually
every vehicle they sell.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.102
Much lower volume.

00:32:47.102 --> 00:32:49.560
So all of these things have to
be taken into consideration.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.590
You cannot choose your business
model because it seemed like it

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.300
made sense, because you
saw a competitor doing it.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.070
You have to figure
out where are you

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.770
within that particular
value network.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.540
The competitive strategy
plays into that,

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.710
and what stage of
development is the company.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.960
So I'm going to flip through
a couple of these slides.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.180
And we'll dive
into some examples.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.555
And I'm hoping
you guys have lots

00:33:09.555 --> 00:33:10.830
of questions at that point.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:15.080
So the value proposition, which
is really number one here,

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.870
is really a description
of the customer problem,

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:19.830
the solution that
addresses that problem,

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:22.520
and the value of the
solution from the customer's

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.220
perspective.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.185
The customer's perspective
is very important here.

00:33:27.185 --> 00:33:30.040
If I am buying, let's
say an Apple product,

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.200
which I see a lot of here,
well there's a lot of things

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.260
there that I as a consumer
might be attracted to.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.010
I love the design of it, the
size of it, the feel of it,

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:40.850
the way it operates.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:44.390
If, for example, you're
buying a desktop computer,

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.310
and you chose to
pick out a Dell,

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.870
or you chose to pick out
another type of manufacturer,

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.710
not like Apple--
maybe you're buying it

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:53.830
for entirely different
reasons than that Apple user.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.620
So think about what is it
that the customer perceives

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.800
as value.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.500
Is the customer looking for low
cost or are they looking for

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.259
speed?

00:34:03.259 --> 00:34:04.550
Are they looking for something?

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.880
You need to make sure that your
value proposition offers that.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.050
From a market
segmentation perspective,

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.280
it's choosing your audience.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.440
And we could talk about this
entirely throughout this class.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.840
But I'm going to keep it short.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.630
You have to know who that
ultimate end user is.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.909
Who is that person that's
going to write that check,

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:23.889
recognizing that different
market segments have

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:25.164
different needs.

00:34:25.164 --> 00:34:26.830
If you're selling,
we'll use the example

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.889
I did a moment ago-- if you're
selling to that high-end watch

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:33.780
buyer, who's buying
essentially a timepiece that's

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.684
going to be passed down
for generations, that's

00:34:36.684 --> 00:34:39.100
a different type of buyer, a
different type of a marketing

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:43.460
approach than if you're
selling a Swatch watch, which

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.590
borders on a disposable watch.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.520
If it lasts five
years, it's fantastic.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.478
By then, you probably
have bought three or four

00:34:49.478 --> 00:34:50.310
more watches.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:53.670
Same thing for computers and
cars and many other things.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.239
Additionally value
change structure

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:57.800
and position in the value
network are critical to this.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.920
And they're part of that
initial slide I shared.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.172
So what is the firm's
position in the value chain?

00:35:02.172 --> 00:35:04.130
What are the activities
within the value chain?

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.390
And how the firm will
capture part of the value

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.864
that it creates
within that chain,

00:35:09.864 --> 00:35:12.280
because where you fit within
that chain and how much of it

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.920
you own is really,
really important to know.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.070
If you're Netflix
think about where

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.500
are you in the value chain.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.304
AUDIENCE: Describe
the value chain.

00:35:22.304 --> 00:35:23.220
RICH KIVEL: Excellent.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.090
So you asked if I could
describe the value chain.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.702
So think about the entire cycle.

00:35:28.702 --> 00:35:30.160
And I'll use Netflix
as an example,

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.220
because I mentioned it.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.260
So what does Netflix
do, essentially?

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.760
AUDIENCE: They're distribution.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.134
RICH KIVEL: They're
distribution.

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:38.749
To who?

00:35:38.749 --> 00:35:39.540
AUDIENCE: End user.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.581
RICH KIVEL: The end user.

00:35:40.581 --> 00:35:42.392
They are at the far
end, whichever end

00:35:42.392 --> 00:35:43.600
you want to call the far end.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.410
They're at the far
end of the cycle.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.530
There's not much after that.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:52.970
They're distributing a movie,
something entertaining, to us.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:54.470
If you think about
that entire value

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:58.980
chain or that entire cycle,
it goes all the way back,

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.740
way, way, way back to
somebody, maybe a year ago

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.270
or 20 years ago that had an
idea for a picture, an idea

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.740
for a movie or a
film, who then as they

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.890
moved through that
value chain, maybe

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:13.390
they found a screenwriter.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:15.600
They ultimately,
perhaps, found a studio.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.420
That studio ultimately
made a decision

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.590
whether they were going
to fund it or not,

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.930
just like a venture capitalist.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:26.620
Movies are just like starting
companies-- idea, all the way

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.510
through to the business
plan to the funding.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.020
That venture capitalist,
or in the case of a movie,

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.340
it's the studio that
says, we love it.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.050
We want it.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.260
The story's outstanding.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.324
We want to buy the story.

00:36:38.324 --> 00:36:39.990
We're going to put
this much against it.

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:43.540
They then build the team.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.260
So they find who's
going to be the lead.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.250
Who's going to be the second?

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.090
Who's going to be the third?

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:48.280
Who's going to the
action character?

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.880
Who's going to be the romantic?

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.250
Where is it going to be filmed?

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.150
All of these aspects are
just like a business.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.760
They've got to find the
CEO, the CFO, the CTO.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.554
They have to figure
out where are we

00:36:57.554 --> 00:36:58.720
going to locate the company.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.190
Where's the best
place for it to be?

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.540
And then at that point,
they start working on it,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.330
and toiling away,
and filming it.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:08.680
And filming could take
weeks, months, or even years.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.630
Then ultimately,
it's distributed.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:14.060
Now it might be distributed
directly into theaters.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.140
Or if it doesn't
get great reviews

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.460
in the early, early
days of distribution,

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.970
it might actually
go directly to DVD.

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:25.004
And that's when
Netflix jumps in.

00:37:25.004 --> 00:37:26.920
So if you think about
it, that's a long cycle.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.460
And I probably skipped 30 parts.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.660
So where do you fit within
the distribution channel

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.232
is absolutely critical
for you to understand

00:37:34.232 --> 00:37:36.690
how you think about that, and
where you actually capitalize

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:38.360
and make money.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.860
Netflix also had
the big challenge

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.840
where they were facing a major
competitor at that time when

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.740
they first came to market.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.540
Does anybody even remember
who that competitor was?

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.140
AUDIENCE: Blockbuster.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.870
RICH KIVEL: Blockbuster got
their butt kicked by Netflix.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.740
What happened?

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.460
What happened was
two major things.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.420
Number one, technology changed.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.300
DVDs came out.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.850
VCRs were going away.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.070
So videotapes made perfect sense
when you went into Blockbuster.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.840
It was big, bulky, didn't
even think about shipping it,

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.840
easy to break.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.450
It gets crushed, doesn't work
so well, tape gets pulled out,

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:17.280
whatever.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.170
Blockbuster had a great model.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.000
They were at the end of the
cycle to us, the consumer.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.940
They put little
stores everywhere.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.450
And they made it easy.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.100
But all of a sudden,
the DVD world

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.600
came out, where you
were able to get

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.130
super high-definition
quality picture motion

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:36.180
pictures on a DVD that is
as flat as an envelope.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.990
Netflix said, hey,
why are we building

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:40.280
stores for these things?

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.040
People already know
the movie they want.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.760
Or they could use this new
technology called the internet,

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.340
and figure out what movie they
want, which is mailed to them.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.780
The other big challenge
that Blockbuster had

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.390
was the whole process
of limited supply,

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.690
and demand on that supply.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:01.220
So they penalized you if you
don't return the video on time

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.270
because they were
losing revenue.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:06.320
If you didn't get it put
in that little tiny box

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.261
by 7:00 AM or 10:00 AM the next
morning, you got charged a fee.

00:39:10.261 --> 00:39:10.760
Why?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.290
Because somebody
else wanted their one

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:16.660
of three copies of that movie.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.830
They couldn't have
an unlimited supply.

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.150
Whereas the ability
to reproduce and print

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.570
DVDs-- virtually unlimited.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.100
Everybody in this
room could order

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.830
a DVD today of a hot
movie that just came out.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.780
It could be at your
house tomorrow.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.660
There's no distribution issue.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:36.170
The ability to reproduce that
DVD, drop it in an envelope,

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.650
and mail it to you is
effortless, completely

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.780
automated.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.040
So what you have here
is this convergence,

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.500
where there was an opportunity.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.940
There was technological
change, whether it

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.500
be DVDs or internet or
a combination of both,

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:54.020
that allowed Netflix to
completely crush Blockbuster.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:57.650
And then Netflix changed
themselves, didn't they?

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:00.170
They recognized that
our ability to capture

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.900
more bandwidth, the ability for
us to actually download a movie

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.510
was increasing in many
parts of the United States,

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.000
not everywhere, not everywhere.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.770
But as our ability,
especially in large cities,

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.992
increased to download
movies-- now all of a sudden,

00:40:13.992 --> 00:40:16.450
it changed to we don't even
have to ship it to you anymore.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.110
All you have to
do is download it.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.710
It streams to you.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.210
And then they created
a whole series

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.501
of other distribution channels.

00:40:23.501 --> 00:40:25.570
Now you can get
Netflix on your Roku.

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:28.050
You can get Netflix in
all of these other areas.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.870
So if you think about it, when
the guy that started Netflix

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:34.210
started off, it was
a very simple model.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:35.230
People like movies.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:39.120
They're willing to pay for them
so they can watch them at home.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.280
DVDs are the new thing.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.930
And we've developed a complex
shipping method and mechanism

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.519
and a model of
warehousing DVDs that we

00:40:47.519 --> 00:40:48.810
can get it to people overnight.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:50.040
And they can keep it
for a day, a week.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.498
We don't really
care, because we're

00:40:51.498 --> 00:40:52.770
going to keep shipping more.

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:53.830
It was so simple.

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:55.832
The business model could
not have been easier.

00:40:55.832 --> 00:40:57.290
But what they did
is they continued

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:59.620
to change and morph
their business model

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.420
as the technology changed.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.740
And they continue to stay
far ahead of the curve.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:08.426
What is the latest thing
that Netflix is now doing?

00:41:08.426 --> 00:41:09.550
AUDIENCE: Producing movies.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.091
RICH KIVEL: They're
producing movies.

00:41:11.091 --> 00:41:12.290
How crazy is that?

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.860
But can you imagine if you
were the CEO of Netflix

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.450
and you said to the
VCs when you went in

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:19.930
to talk to them a decade
ago, well here's the thing.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:20.890
I got a business idea.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:23.223
What we're going to do is,
we're going to basically kick

00:41:23.223 --> 00:41:24.920
Blockbuster's ass.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.950
We're going to distribute
these things on DVDs.

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:28.240
And then we're going to
start to do downloadable.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.615
And then, by the
way, we're going

00:41:29.615 --> 00:41:31.750
to become a movie
production studio.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:33.542
Their head would explode.

00:41:33.542 --> 00:41:35.000
And they would just
say, listen you

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.490
have no idea what you're doing.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:39.430
And you don't understand
how complex the market is.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:42.030
That's why earlier
I said, simplicity.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.290
When you launch your
business, keep it simple.

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:46.510
Show that that model
is easy to understand.

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:48.460
And then from there
you continue to expand.

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.910
Who would have thought
Netflix is now producing some

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:53.750
of the best shows out there?

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.880
Orange Is the New Black is one
of the top shows out there,

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.347
produced by Netflix.

00:41:59.347 --> 00:42:00.680
What are some of the other ones?

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.640
AUDIENCE: House of Cards.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.764
RICH KIVEL: House of Cards.

00:42:02.764 --> 00:42:05.579
So you think about--
that's mind boggling.

00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:07.870
What is the difference between
Netflix and Blockbuster?

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.130
Leadership, the ability
to change, the ability

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.550
to see around the next
curve, and actually

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:21.367
change the business model of
the company in order to adapt.

00:42:21.367 --> 00:42:23.950
So I'll finish up this area of
revenue generation and margins.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:25.533
We talked a little
about that earlier.

00:42:25.533 --> 00:42:27.800
Competitive strategy--
how will the company

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.050
attempt to develop and sustain
a competitor advantage?

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.716
And I've shared a
little bit about that.

00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:32.920
Netflix is a great example.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.420
And then one other
component of this

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.629
is where are you on the field?

00:42:36.629 --> 00:42:38.170
Understanding where
your business is.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:40.534
And the Netflix example is
one that is pretty clear.

00:42:40.534 --> 00:42:42.200
When you're over in
this area here where

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.574
you're pilot testing, and
you're in the gestational area,

00:42:44.574 --> 00:42:47.240
or you're doing the roll out,
or you're in slow growth,

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.240
that may not be the time to take
on two or three new business

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.930
models or enter a different part
of the distribution channel.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:59.560
But as you start to get
the terminal velocity,

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.700
that's the time when you
start to really look back

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.980
and say, hey, now let's
take a look at our market

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.040
in a different way.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.760
We've got the velocity, whether
it be the funding, the adoption

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.940
within the marketplace.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.280
And then at that point,
based on the maturity,

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.070
you can start to
think of expanding.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.672
So where are you on the field?

00:43:14.672 --> 00:43:16.130
It's always important
to know that.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.320
A lot of companies--
Blockbuster is clearly

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.150
one of them-- that took
their eye off the ball,

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.480
and they just focused
on what they were doing.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.260
And what they did is just
stuff that we look at now.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.980
We go, gosh, that was so naive.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.260
You thought maybe
eliminating the late fees is

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.470
going to solve your problem.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:35.940
You thought reducing price--
you thought more stores is going

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.770
to-- you look at that now.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:40.495
You say, wow, that's the best
that management team could

00:43:40.495 --> 00:43:42.340
come up with.

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.700
They were not stepping
back and saying, where

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.420
are we on the field, guys?

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.620
What's happening in the entire
space that we're playing in?

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.320
And where do we play?

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.190
A great example is Google.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.360
This is a snapshot of the Google
website launched September 4,

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.720
1998.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.810
Isn't that awesome?

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:03.975
Has it changed very much?

00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:04.600
Think about it.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.500
How cool is that?

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:09.660
That is elegant.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.269
How simple.

00:44:10.269 --> 00:44:10.810
Look at that.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:11.740
What is it up there?

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:18.660
Index contains 25 million
pages, soon to be much bigger.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:22.290
How many trillions of pages does
Google have currently indexed?

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:23.890
Think about that.

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:27.760
But what's also important think
about is this-- Google could

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.890
have state just like this.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:34.041
They could have
stayed a simple what?

00:44:34.041 --> 00:44:35.040
AUDIENCE: Search engine.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:35.956
RICH KIVEL: That's it.

00:44:35.956 --> 00:44:36.702
Search engine.

00:44:36.702 --> 00:44:38.410
It could have been a
great search engine.

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:41.140
They could have been a better
search engine than anyone.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.850
That was what they
were promoting.

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:45.780
We will find you what you're
looking for faster, better.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.650
We prioritize.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.020
We have complex algorithms.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.603
We have a whole bunch
of smart people,

00:44:49.603 --> 00:44:51.580
probably from MIT,
that are helping

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:56.100
you find that weird
shit you're looking for.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.150
Seriously.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:01.370
You're looking for-- you
need a pink doily that

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:03.440
will be eight inches
that is under a lamp

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.530
for your grandmother's house.

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:08.410
Or you're looking for
a new hand-held device

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:09.560
for something else.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.010
They're going to
find it for you.

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:12.960
I'm looking to book
a trip to Paris.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.230
They're going to help prioritize
it, best hotels Paris luxury.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.960
Put those in, boom.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.420
Boolean search, we all remember.

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:24.130
Put in all the complex-- the
word plus this are in quotes.

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:26.110
They have better
algorithms than Yahoo.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:29.140
They have better algorithms than
AltaVista, better algorithms

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.420
than NaviSite.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.960
The list goes on.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.820
They could have stopped
there, and just continued

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.560
to be the best search
engine in the world.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.310
And you know what?

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:42.937
They're still killing everybody
in search, killing them.

00:45:42.937 --> 00:45:45.020
People that like Bing or
others probably disagree.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.810
But I think they kill it.

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.580
But what did they
do as a business?

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.600
Or I should say,
what didn't they

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:57.060
do since 1998 as a business?

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.450
Look at what Google is today.

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:02.460
Give me a few ideas, one
word from a bunch of you.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.140
Just what is Google
today besides search?

00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:08.699
AUDIENCE: Brand.

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:09.740
RICH KIVEL: It's a brand.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.648
What?

00:46:11.648 --> 00:46:12.820
AUDIENCE: Maps.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.820
RICH KIVEL: Google Maps.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.590
Most of us live on Google Maps.

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:16.263
What else?

00:46:16.263 --> 00:46:17.250
AUDIENCE: Mobile.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.190
RICH KIVEL: Mobile.

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:21.540
Think about Google is the
mobile app in so many ways.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:22.110
What else?

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:22.860
AUDIENCE: Browser.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:23.852
Email.

00:46:23.852 --> 00:46:24.935
RICH KIVEL: I missed that.

00:46:24.935 --> 00:46:25.601
AUDIENCE: Email.

00:46:25.601 --> 00:46:26.300
Browser.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.050
RICH KIVEL: Email.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.120
Browser.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.522
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:32.188
RICH KIVEL: Yep.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.240
What I haven't
heard, maybe somebody

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.770
did say is Google is data.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:44.780
What Google is,
is Google is data.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.030
They have figured out
ways to capture, store,

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:51.850
analyze everything we do.

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:57.460
Google knows more about
us than our families do.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.660
And because of that, they're
able to impact the world.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.830
Do you realize that Google
Health, as an example,

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:09.010
actually provides data,
completely anonymous data,

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.480
to groups like the CDC?

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:14.910
If there is an increase
in the number of people

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:18.900
in the Northeast, specifically
Maine, New Hampshire,

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:23.640
Vermont that are in the
increase in searches

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.830
around a particular
series of symptoms

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:31.270
at a particular time of year,
that data is actually given

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:36.930
to groups like the CDC to help
think about positioning cures,

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.190
positioning vaccines,
and positioning hospitals

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.020
and support.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.490
Think about how
powerful that is.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.050
If there is all of a sudden,
thousands of searches,

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:47.810
because a bunch of moms in New
Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:54.250
start Googling high temperature,
all of these symptoms

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:58.720
that might be relevant, or
regular cough or these types

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:03.020
of rashes, and that's regularly
Googled, all of a sudden Google

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.600
has a data set where they
can see trends before anyone

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.570
else can see them.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.570
They know everything
that's happening

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.370
on a very, very global
scale, both micro and macro.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:14.582
And it really helps
make the world better.

00:48:14.582 --> 00:48:16.040
Now people will
get scared and say,

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.331
you know it's about privacy
and all these other things.

00:48:18.331 --> 00:48:20.110
And I absolutely believe that.

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:21.820
But there is good
that can be created.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.820
This is a data company
that is changing the world.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.780
They know more about you
because of what you search,

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:32.420
how long you hover over a
particular part of a website,

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:36.166
what you do on a regular basis,
the time of day that you do it,

00:48:36.166 --> 00:48:37.540
the type of things
that you like,

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.280
whether it be the type of
music, the type of concerts,

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.880
the type of places you
vacation, the type of hotels

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.630
that you shop.

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.990
All of those things
are very powerful.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.479
So Google is a data
company, different than what

00:48:49.479 --> 00:48:51.770
their original business model
was, or at least appeared

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:52.270
to be.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:54.556
And part of it is
because of this.

00:48:54.556 --> 00:48:55.110
This is--

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
accidental business model?

00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:00.456
Bt they weren't going to
make any money. [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:00.456 --> 00:49:03.312
stumbling on [? ad words. ?]

00:49:03.312 --> 00:49:04.520
RICH KIVEL: I think so, yeah.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.519
AUDIENCE: --earned them
the money to do all this

00:49:06.519 --> 00:49:07.286
stuff. [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:07.286 --> 00:49:08.660
RICH KIVEL: I
think you're right.

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.300
I think it may have
been accidental.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.425
It might have been the
genius of Eric Schmidt, when

00:49:12.425 --> 00:49:14.834
he was put in there by
the venture capitalists.

00:49:14.834 --> 00:49:17.000
It might have been a lot
of very smart board people.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.340
It might have been
a lot of factors.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.250
But they harnessed
that opportunity

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:22.350
that everyone else had.

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:26.200
Any of the other search
groups could have done this.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.660
No matter how good the
Google algorithms are,

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.650
they're not that
much different, I'm

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:32.784
sure, than some of the
best search out there.

00:49:32.784 --> 00:49:34.200
Are they much
different than Bing?

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.200
Are they much different
than the other ones?

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.230
I don't know.

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:38.640
Are those companies going
to ever become as important

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.360
on a global basis as Google?

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.610
Think about Google
Maps is great.

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:45.630
What about Google Earth?

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:48.560
How many people here have
not used Google Earth?

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.350
Will both of you stand up?

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.320
Everybody's used Google Earth.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.560
It's the coolest thing.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.520
If I'm booking a hotel,
and I'm booking a hotel

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.697
in the north of Spain-- we go
every year on vacation-- if I'm

00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:02.030
booking a hotel and I've never
stayed at a hotel before,

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.430
I will look at it
on Google Earth

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.140
because I don't believe
the website that

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.650
says across the
street from the beach.

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:11.144
It might mean across the
street from the beach.

00:50:11.144 --> 00:50:13.060
And by the way, the
street is also referred to

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.070
as an eight-lane highway.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.200
I'm not going to be
super happy with that

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.410
when I show up for vacation.

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:19.876
So I'll Google Earth it.

00:50:19.876 --> 00:50:20.750
I'll see where it is.

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.010
And I'll be able to
see what's happening.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.180
It's incredibly powerful,
these little things.

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.740
And they know I'm
searching that.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.340
So it goes back
to the data piece.

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.540
And a lot of it is driven
around this-- the fact

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:35.030
that the change in price
of storage has dropped

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:39.690
so dramatically has transformed
every bit of technology,

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:43.320
whether it be the ability for
Netflix to download movies

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.600
or store them, the ability
for you to get on an airplane

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.610
right now, and while
you're on that airplane,

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:54.090
instead of watching one
terribly chosen movie coming out

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:58.930
of a ceiling projector, you
have a seat in front of you

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.197
that has a screen in it.

00:51:00.197 --> 00:51:01.530
And you can pick from 30 movies.

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:03.410
That's just storage.

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.450
That plane has enough
storage that we

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:07.867
can pick from 30 different
movies at each seat.

00:51:07.867 --> 00:51:09.450
If you're on JetBlue,
you can actually

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.790
watch streaming TV as well.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:13.700
So because of this,
everything's changed.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.710
The rules of the
game have changed.

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:19.850
So the question always is,
what business model, and why?

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:23.190
And if you think about each
of these different businesses

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:25.182
on the surface, if you
didn't know any better,

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:27.140
you would think they were
in the same business.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.060
Apple sells computers.

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:29.250
So does Dell.

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:30.240
Bentley sells cars.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.570
So does Cadillac.

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:33.130
Vertu sells cell phones.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:34.830
And so does Nokia.

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:36.740
But their distribution
channel and models

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.142
are dramatically different.

00:51:38.142 --> 00:51:40.100
So I'm going to give you
a few examples of what

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.920
I consider really
innovative business models.

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.790
Some of these companies we
touched upon already today I'll

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:47.264
touch upon a few of them again.

00:51:47.264 --> 00:51:48.680
And we can go into
any more detail

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.810
you want or ask questions.

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:51.977
But I think Amazon is
probably one of the greatest

00:51:51.977 --> 00:51:52.810
companies out there.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:54.730
Jeff Bezos is an
absolute genius.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:58.541
Might be why he's
worth over $20 billion.

00:51:58.541 --> 00:52:03.210
He has figured out a
company that he started,

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:09.160
based on the concept of selling
books online and harnessing

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.170
what was called user
groups or essentially

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:16.180
peer-to-peer communication
in order to provide reviews.

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:19.050
That was the initial concept.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:20.870
We're going to
sell books online.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.510
And we're going to harness the
power of the internet, where

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:26.841
people provide feedback about
the books they purchased.

00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:27.840
Were they happy with it?

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.460
Was it good?

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.160
Was it-- et cetera.

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.970
We take all this for granted
now, because since then we

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:34.170
can pick movies that way.

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.640
We can pick
restaurants that way.

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.480
We can pick hotels that way.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.490
That user experience is there.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.610
But Amazon has gone
far bigger than that.

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:44.400
So I look at the
Amazon business model.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.380
I say basically it's a business
model of leveraging assets.

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.502
That's the business model.

00:52:50.502 --> 00:52:51.960
How many of you
have been following

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.935
what Amazon's doing lately?

00:52:54.935 --> 00:52:56.560
A couple of big
announcements at Amazon

00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:02.380
in the past 30 days,
the 60 Minutes special.

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.200
How cool is that?

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.850
If anything, it could just
be a project of Bezos.

00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:13.240
But think about just the idea of
the drone concept of delivering

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.700
packages in a way that
actually reaches the consumer,

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.240
essentially the goal being
the same day that they order.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.990
So they've got
this drone concept

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.870
that is going to allow these
robotic drones to provide

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:25.250
people packages.

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:27.240
Now we all know there's
lots of red tape there.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.945
You've got-- you've got
the approval of the FAA.

00:53:30.945 --> 00:53:33.250
You've got all these
other governmental issues.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.250
But the fact that they
are thinking that far out

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.220
of the box-- think about this.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:38.970
I'm going to use that
example from before.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:42.470
Imagine if Jeff Bezos walked
into his investors and said,

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.970
yo dude.

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:45.110
I need some money
because I got this idea.

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:47.730
We're going to
sell books online.

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:49.620
And people are going
to tell us whether they

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.230
like the books or
not, which will then

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:54.150
enforce whether we
sell more books or not,

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:55.940
whether we carry
that author anymore.

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:59.680
And then soon, we're going to
have drones delivering stuff.

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.350
It's crazy.

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:03.880
What can't you buy
on Amazon right now?

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:04.440
It's amazing.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.060
I can buy tools on Amazon.

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.250
I can buy anything on Amazon.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:09.330
The drones is one thing.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:11.110
The latest one that came
out this week was fantastic.

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:12.610
What was the other
release that they

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:17.431
were talking about this
week regarding Amazon?

00:54:17.431 --> 00:54:17.930
I'm sorry.

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:19.260
Say it louder.

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.135
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:21.777 --> 00:54:22.610
RICH KIVEL: Exactly.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:24.540
Did you hear the new word
that came out for this?

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:26.915
This is definitely going to
be one of those things that's

00:54:26.915 --> 00:54:35.440
in the 2014 anticipatory--
so it's anticipatory consumer

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.530
something or other.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:37.470
I don't even
remember what it is.

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.553
I just heard it this week.

00:54:38.553 --> 00:54:39.185
I loved it.

00:54:39.185 --> 00:54:40.810
This is going to be
one of those things

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.309
that next-- at the
end of this year,

00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:47.190
it'll be the new word that
falls in to the dictionary.

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:50.750
The concept that they
know so much about us

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:54.900
that they can actually begin to
anticipate what we might buy,

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.490
very similar to how Google
is a data company-- they can

00:54:57.490 --> 00:55:00.870
anticipate what we're going
to click on next-- Google

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:04.330
can pretty much tell
so much about you, just

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:06.310
on what you're clicking
on next, and the speed

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:08.060
at which you do it, and how
long you spend on a website.

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:09.518
Amazon does exactly
the same thing.

00:55:09.518 --> 00:55:11.340
We all go on to Amazon now.

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:14.430
And it will say, other people
that purchased that product

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:16.560
also bought these eight.

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.780
Or here is your last purchases.

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.420
Here's some
recommendations for you.

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.420
It's gotten so good that
it's so much-- I don't even

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.240
understand why people
do junk male anymore.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.660
It blows my mind.

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:33.790
I get stuff in junk mail for
clearly not my demographic,

00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:36.530
stuff that might be perfect
if I was a 17-year-old girl

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.500
or an 88-year-old guy.

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:42.630
I'm like, why are they
advertising that to me?

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:44.559
It's amazing.

00:55:44.559 --> 00:55:46.600
It's even when it just
shows up, it's in my mail.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.670
I'm talking about inbox.

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:49.010
So this stuff comes in.

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:51.470
You think, what a wacky
way to make money.

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.870
Amazon's got it down.

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:55.430
They recommend things
that make sense

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:56.920
to me because they take a look.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.750
I've been an Amazon
member for years.

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.210
They can say, listen these
are the kind of books

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:00.910
this guy's ordered.

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:02.070
This is the kind of
music he's ordered.

00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:03.450
This is the kind of other stuff.

00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:05.390
Hey, we have some
recommendations.

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:08.000
They're not recommending
to me silly things

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
that just don't make sense.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.240
So now Amazon going to this next
approach, which is absolutely--

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.445
it's so MIT-ish, I loved it.

00:56:15.445 --> 00:56:17.790
It is algorithmically driven.

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:22.524
It is anticipatory shopping,
that anticipatory experience,

00:56:22.524 --> 00:56:24.190
where they actually
believe that they're

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.960
going to reach a
point where they have

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:31.710
such familiarity with you, that
they have an idea what you are

00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:34.610
likely to buy next, based
on prior purchasing habits,

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:38.140
based on the time of day, the
time of year, you name it,

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.030
that what they're envisioning
is that they will actually begin

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:44.830
to ship those things to the
closest warehouse to you,

00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:49.340
and deliver to them to you
that day or the following day.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.130
It's mind boggling.

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:51.950
All-around data.

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:52.870
Amazon's incredible.

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:53.740
They're leveraging assets.

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.550
Apple-- we could talk
about them for years.

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:58.482
Has anybody here seen
the Steve Jobs movie?

00:56:58.482 --> 00:57:00.940
I just watched that, coming
back from California last week.

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:03.020
That thing-- what
a fantastic movie.

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:07.500
And Ashton Kutcher did a
fantastic job as Steve Jobs.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.460
But the genius of
this guy really

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.225
spoke about why Apple succeeded.

00:57:12.225 --> 00:57:15.120
And it was a great story
about how he started, and got

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.480
kicked out, and came back.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.840
But it's really providing
convenient solutions.

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.090
Apple is about quality design.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:25.640
And stuff better
work the first time.

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.550
When you plug it
in, it better sync.

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:29.880
When you go to the app
store, it better be there.

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.200
It better download.

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.700
If it doesn't-- it's
incredible how good they are.

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.840
It's all about convenience.

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.670
That is a totally
different model

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:41.700
than virtually every other
computer company out there.

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.444
Dell's a great company,
has a different model.

00:57:44.444 --> 00:57:45.735
We're going to build it custom.

00:57:45.735 --> 00:57:47.120
You tell us what you want in it.

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.120
We're going to modify it
any which way you wish.

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.960
And we're going
to ship it to you.

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.920
It's not the Apple model.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.206
Who would have thought
years ago-- many of you

00:57:56.206 --> 00:57:58.220
may not even remember,
but years ago there

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.305
was no such thing
as Apple stores.

00:58:01.305 --> 00:58:02.680
How do you buy an
Apple computer?

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.310
Well you bought it
primarily online.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.770
There were very few
distributors of Apple computers.

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:09.960
Apple started off selling
to large school systems

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.920
and others.

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.450
And now the Apple Store is as
common in cities in the United

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:19.750
States and towns as a Starbucks.

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:23.570
What a different model that
is-- totally mind boggling.

00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:28.050
When most people were moving
away from retail box stores--

00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:32.640
those expensive locations--
and moving to everything

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.290
being internet, Apple
said no, no, no.

00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:36.220
We want to be closer
to the consumer.

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:38.760
We want the experience
to be superb.

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.980
We want them to be part
of this experience.

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.182
They've then opened stores.

00:58:43.182 --> 00:58:45.140
And they're making
tremendous money doing that.

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:46.910
Who knows Etsy?

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:48.620
These guys are
cool, aren't they?

00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.450
What a neat idea.

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:54.920
Doing good on a global basis,
something that could never

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.600
been done years ago--
a business model

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.100
where they basically
figured out ways

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:02.050
to harness the
power of creativity,

00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:05.030
the power of different parts
of the world, people living

00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:07.900
in small villages building
beautiful things that

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:11.240
would never be seen outside
of probably a 500-mile radius

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.900
of their village,
if that, are now

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.440
part of this very
special network

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.820
where they can build things.

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.020
And you can go online.

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.430
And you can purchase them.

00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:21.300
And a very small
piece is kept by Etsy.

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:24.710
And most of it goes back to
the artist, to the individual.

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:27.440
It's phenomenal, the thought
that somebody sitting

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:32.380
in Peru or Uganda, or somebody
sitting in a far part of Russia

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:34.860
that builds beautiful
things is actually

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:38.390
selling them to people
sitting in Japan or in Paris

00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:40.380
or in Boston.

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.570
It's absolutely incredible.

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:44.870
Other innovative models Zara
is probably my favorite.

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:47.240
Everybody here knows
Zara at this point.

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:47.940
I love Spain.

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.730
And I love Zara.

00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:52.430
They're an absolutely
mind boggling story.

00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:55.780
Who thought one company could
innovate an industry that

00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:59.140
has been stagnant and
without innovation

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.140
as the fashion industry?

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:03.110
The fashion industry has
operated the same way

01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:06.800
for about 100 years.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.970
They have models.

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:09.170
They have designers.

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:10.710
They have magazines.

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:13.480
The only innovation,
the only innovation

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.840
that's actually hit
the fashion industry

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.320
is they sell some stuff online.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.720
They outsource manufacturing.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.190
They've been doing
that for 75 years.

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:26.480
They have expensive
high-paid designers.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.140
And they basically have
a distribution channel

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:29.980
through retail.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.260
It's been exactly the same way.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.100
The challenge is that many
people who want high fashion

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.060
can't afford high fashion.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.630
These guys came in and
revolutionized the market.

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:42.490
And their business model
was harnessed and built

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:45.110
around time-to-market.

01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:47.060
That is the business model.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.970
They put people at every
fashion show that's important.

01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:54.620
They're in New York,
Paris, Milan, everywhere.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.980
And those people are
there taking sketches,

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:59.970
taking digital photos, and
those things they believe

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:02.110
the Zara consumer would want.

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:05.420
Those things are imaged, sent
back instantly to the factory.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:10.340
50% of all Zara products
are made in Spain.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.540
They're sent back.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.990
They're built. And they're
sent to the stores.

01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:18.626
Virtually none of the
products you find in the Zara

01:01:18.626 --> 01:01:20.250
last in the store
more than four weeks.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:22.124
And they will not continue
to replenish them.

01:01:22.124 --> 01:01:25.810
They've created this concept
of scarcity, this concept

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:28.020
that what you're
buying is high fashion

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:30.910
and it's in a limited supply.

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:34.410
That is fantastic, compared
to you go to Macy's.

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:37.690
And there's 800 of
the same sweaters.

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:40.130
And there's 8,000 of
the same men's shirts.

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:44.210
And if I go to a different
Macy's, it's exactly the same.

01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:46.360
There's no sense
of scarcity there.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.320
Very low design,
very high volume.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.860
However, if I walk
into the Armani shop

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:57.540
on Newbury Street or the Fendi
shop, and look at the bags,

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.700
there's a sense of scarcity--
high price, limited resource.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:02.760
This is this year's bag.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.990
This year's jacket.

01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:07.810
Zara basically turned it on its
head and said, no, no, no no.

01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:12.080
We're going to have scarcity
and volume and price.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.010
And they nailed it
on all of those.

01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:16.430
You don't ever see the Zara
stuff of at Marshalls and T.J.

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.120
Maxx, do you?

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.674
Because they don't
have excess inventory.

01:02:20.674 --> 01:02:22.840
The reason you can walk
into Marshalls and T.J. Maxx

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:26.230
and pick up Burberry and Cartier
and all these other brands

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:31.020
is because Bloomingdale's
and Macy's and all of them

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:31.930
overstocked on them.

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:32.830
The season changed.

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:34.580
They don't know what
to do with the stuff.

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:38.930
So they slash price 60% off, 70%
off, 80% off, then boom, it's

01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:40.875
off to Marshalls.

01:02:40.875 --> 01:02:43.500
And those companies have created
an entirely different business

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.544
model of getting high-quality
goods to consumers.

01:02:46.544 --> 01:02:47.460
Zara said, no, no, no.

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.027
We're not playing that game.

01:02:49.027 --> 01:02:49.860
Let me ask you this.

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:54.280
When's the last time you saw
a Zara advertisement on TV?

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.630
It doesn't exist.

01:02:55.630 --> 01:03:01.150
When's the last time you saw
a Macy's one-day sale on TV?

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:02.870
Once a day.

01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:05.280
Entirely different business
model, same industry.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.170
Zara is amazing.

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:08.160
I want to finish off
these with Gillette who's

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.210
absolutely just fantastic.

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:12.530
Gillette, right here
in Massachusetts.

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:14.360
You see them on your
way to the airport.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.530
This is the company that created
the concept-- they created

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:20.190
the first ever disposable
razor, which is a fantastic

01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:21.887
concept, back in the '20s.

01:03:21.887 --> 01:03:23.470
They then decided
that they were going

01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:25.300
to stay at the cutting
edge of technology.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:31.810
Gillette has over 1,000 patents
just around the Mach3 razor.

01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:34.930
They have thousands of patents
within their entire portfolio.

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:39.420
And they will not start
creating a new razor

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:43.760
until almost a patent life
has expired on the existing

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.810
razors on the market.

01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:47.560
They do not want to
compete against themselves.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.910
They've created this mechanism.

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:50.590
It's absolutely mind boggling.

01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:52.550
We get the Mach3
razor as a [? base ?].

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:55.180
It comes off the assembly
line in the United States.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.350
If you go to other countries,
especially developing

01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.310
countries, they're
getting the razor

01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:03.360
that was hot here five years
ago because they realize

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.650
that they can sell it
for a third of the price

01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:07.140
in large quantities.

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:09.750
Those countries can't
afford the Mach3.

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:12.060
But they can afford the one
that was five years ago,

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:12.950
eight years ago.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:15.227
And they're buying
them by the millions.

01:04:15.227 --> 01:04:17.310
And in addition to that,
they created that concept

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:19.430
of the razor-blade concept.

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:22.069
It's essentially,
you've got the razor.

01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:24.110
All you have to do is just
keep buying the blades

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.026
and buying the blades.

01:04:25.026 --> 01:04:27.360
And they can charge whatever
they want for the blades.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.630
Or you have to start fresh
with Schick or somebody else.

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:35.620
So it's a fantastic concept
of high quality, patents

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:37.880
there in order to
maintain their position

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:43.060
within the marketplace, and
also customer stickiness.

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.490
We gave them this pretty razor.

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:45.150
It's beautiful.

01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:46.100
It's got metal on it.

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.230
It's got nice colors.

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:49.105
They're just going to
keep buying the blades,

01:04:49.105 --> 01:04:50.980
buying the blades,
and buying the blades.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.120
So it's a fantastic series
of different business

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.544
models within one.

01:04:54.544 --> 01:04:55.960
Other ones we're
all familiar with

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.550
are great groups
like Kickstarter,

01:04:57.550 --> 01:05:02.410
PayPal are really leveraging
the whole P2P revolution.

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.990
It's absolutely
amazing what you see.

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:06.470
Craig's List is a
fantastic example of that.

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:09.600
Their website is about as
sexy as the Google page.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.430
There's really nothing
attractive about it.

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:13.660
But it's an incredibly
successful business.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.920
We talked about Dell.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.570
They built their
entire success around

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:18.060
the just-in-time concept.

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.240
We're going to build a computer
exactly the way you want it.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.820
In addition to that, you've got
the one day, one deal business

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.750
model.

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:27.410
We're all familiar
with our inboxes

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:30.290
full of Living Social
and Groupon and all

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:31.187
these other groups.

01:05:31.187 --> 01:05:33.020
In addition to that,
you've got other groups

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.280
like Priceline, which I think is
a phenomenal model, and really

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.379
unique advertising too.

01:05:37.379 --> 01:05:39.670
They've taken an approach,
unlike a lot of these groups

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:42.160
here who you never see on TV.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.020
Priceline has taken the approach
of using somebody like Shatner

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:48.450
or other people that basically
get them excited about-- you

01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:50.560
set your price,
you're in control.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.836
And some of us love that.

01:05:51.836 --> 01:05:52.960
Some people love Priceline.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.830
I have friends that use
Priceline all of the time.

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:56.940
Some of us just jump on.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.190
And we just go to expedia.com.

01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:59.556
And we book our hotel.

01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:01.180
Or we go to the new
one, Hotel Tonight,

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.710
which is my favorite
app, especially when I'm

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:04.120
going to different cities.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.770
You jump onto Hotel Tonight,
entirely different model.

01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:11.260
They only list hotels after
12:00 in the afternoon.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:15.140
They cut these special deals
with the hotels for that night.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.530
So you wind up staying
at fantastic places

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:20.330
because they knew at 11:55
they had availability.

01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:22.140
They released the
rooms to Hotel Tonight.

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:26.550
Hotel Tonight kills hotels.com,
another one, that day.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:29.261
It might not be the way to
book a seven-day vacation.

01:06:29.261 --> 01:06:31.510
But if you're looking for
two nights in New York City,

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:32.310
it's phenomenal.

01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:34.930
It's all on your app,
not on the website.

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:37.020
You can't even do
it on the website.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:39.180
Uber's another fantastic
example of that.

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.890
Instant gratification,
car-service quality,

01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:46.120
not a taxi cab, all
web-based, all app-based.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.670
So to summarize, value
proposition, market segment

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:52.080
and value chain are really
understandings that you

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.577
have to have in this area of
developing a business model.

01:06:55.577 --> 01:06:56.910
Where do you sit in the network?

01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:58.570
Exactly where are
you on the field?

01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:00.440
And revenue generation
and margins-- those

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.330
are two different things.

01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:02.990
You have to think about
what's important to you.

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:04.781
Are you going to be a
high-margin business,

01:07:04.781 --> 01:07:05.290
low volume?

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:07.740
Are you going to be a
high-revenue business

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.684
and low margin?

01:07:08.684 --> 01:07:10.600
Or are you going to try
to do what Apple does,

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.237
which is a combination of both?

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:14.320
Where do you fit within
the competitive landscape?

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.320
And of course, the stage of
development of your company

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:16.980
is critical.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:21.400
Where are you within that
particular growth cycle?

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.720
And always remember
that success consists

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.180
from going from
failure to failure

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:26.845
without a loss of enthusiasm.

01:07:26.845 --> 01:07:27.720
And I'll close there.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.920
Thank you all.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.625
