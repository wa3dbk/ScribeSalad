00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.580
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Welcome
to the final competition.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.060
So you guys survived this far.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.160
And I don't know how.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.760
I think, probably, with
very little sleep.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.690
And knowing all the emails that
I have seen and all the

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.060
check-ins.--

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.845
I don't know how many
people had--

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:39.960
Who had any sleep within
last 24 hours?

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.960
AUDIENCE: Haha.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.560
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Oh, OK.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.946
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:44.650
OK.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.000
And also what we looked at was
the quality of the results

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.300
keep improving because he was
running tests to check

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.270
what's going on.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.550
And when we moved to
a machine, the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.490
things ran very fast.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.660
We're like, wait a minute.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.690
Why is this running that fast?

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.010
Because people had checked in
more and more, faster and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.750
faster versions.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.120
So things improved, not because
we checked in faster

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.470
machines, but you guys actually
did a lot of work.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.300
So first before we
get started, I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.630
want to thank Akamai.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.900
So we and Akamai got
this nice place.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.110
And then we are going
to give a demo.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.630
And we're going to have a party
sponsored by Akamai,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.300
which is really cool.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.890
So you guys actually
see something--

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.810
what the real-life people who
care about performance do.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.850
So it will be really fun.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.640
And also, I also want to thank
most of our MIT POSSE that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.850
help you guys a lot in meeting
with you individually.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.580
So we have people from Akamai,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.580
Digital, Google, Lockheed
Martin, MathWorks, Wordica,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.560
VMWare and couple of independent
consultants who

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.360
basically put lot of their
sweat and edge

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.230
in helping you guys.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.185
CHARLES LEISERSON:
And Microsoft.

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:53.400
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
And Microsoft.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.750
CHARLES LEISERSON: So let's
give a hand for

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.226
the posse, MIT POSSE.

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:56.719
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.170
CHARLES LEISERSON: And a
couple of the sponsors.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.050
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: So here
is the process we

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.090
are going to do today.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.620
Today's about the competition.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.919
So we've set up a very strict
set of rules that we are going

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.410
to go through, which is not
going to be the way we are

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.690
going to grade you guys.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.260
Because we are going to be
little bit more lenient.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.820
So this is the set of rules
we are going to do.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.960
So we had a lot of these images
that you get submitted.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.830
And some images were
not exactly same.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.970
People did little bit things.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.330
They made them look little
bit different.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.355
So what they said was instead
of we're deciding.

00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:35.790
We will let you guys work on
images which can participate.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.340
OK?

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.330
So don't be harsh
to your friends.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.100
So what we'll do, we'll first
go through the images.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.630
And then well you guys can say
which images should be part of

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.610
the competition.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.900
This is for the competition.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.650
Then at the end, after you get
the Akamai sponsored prize--

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.770
not for the grading.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.440
So the fact that the images
start to count, that doesn't

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.080
mean you get zero
in the grade.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.070
But you won't get to
participate in the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.820
competition.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.670
So after that, what
we have done is we

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.770
looked at all your projects.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.830
Ran them on our 12
core machine.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.320
And we will show you
and seed them.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.980
We'll say here is the order
of everything happening.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.310
And there are--

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.747
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:24.310
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
There are some--

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.850
Basically, what we'll do is
we'll pick out the top set of

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.410
seeds in them because
we don't have time

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.850
to run through everybody.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.780
And basically, a lot of these
things live are not for the 48

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.980
core machine.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.750
And then the--

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.680
accepted image that ran faster,
got generated faster

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.680
in the 48 core machine,
wins the prize.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.660
So that doesn't mean that when
you start grading, we will

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.060
look at all the images and we
will do some averaging.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.870
We will do a lot more fair.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.900
But hey, this is
a competition.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.850
We just need to find the top
guy so we have a top group.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.380
So we have a much more
faster thing.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.940
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: So
to get started.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.100
So here are some of the images
people generated.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.530
So what we want to do is show
the reference image.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.830
That's the reference image.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.715
And what we'll do is we'll first
go through everybody's

00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:17.430
images generated, so you
get a feel for all the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.800
variations out there.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.820
And then after that, we'll
ask you to go out.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.010
We'll ask you if you don't
want that image

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.170
to be part of this.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.400
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: You'll see.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.870
OK.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.420
So this is the reference
image.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.840
Why don't you go through--

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.210
Charles.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.580
Mike.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.290
AUDIENCE: Yep?

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.820
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Why
don't you go through

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.870
the rest of the images.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.140
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.120
So before we we get into the
images that we actually

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.880
rendered in the last few hours,
I just wanted to like

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.990
honorable mention for this.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.170
I think this is the coolest.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.570
I'm sure you guys have been
looking at a whole variety of

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.930
broken ray tracer images But I
think this is pretty much the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.840
coolest thing I've seen.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.040
So honorable mention for that.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.390
And so now let's look
at things that

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.645
people actually submitted.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.910
First we're going to go through
all the images and

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.910
sort of look at the range.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.060
And then we'll go back
and vote on them.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.760
And so I'm just going to flip
through the ones on the right

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.866
and give a couple
seconds to each.

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:21.990
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: So
see if they can

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.522
identify the artifacts.

00:05:25.522 --> 00:05:28.826
AUDIENCE: Which one?

00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:31.120
CHARLES LEISERSON: You got to
say when you're going because

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.750
otherwise people aren't going
to realize that you've been

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.900
through three of them already.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.986
Here's image one.

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:37.153
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Image--

00:05:37.153 --> 00:05:38.800
AUDIENCE: Here's the next one.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.161
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Image two.

00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:42.590
CHARLES LEISERSON:
That's five.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.430
Four, five.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.732
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
Image three.

00:05:45.732 --> 00:05:59.142
image four, image five, image
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

00:05:59.142 --> 00:06:09.410
11, SAMAN AMARASINGHE: 12,
13, 14, 15, OK, 15.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.535
There are some groups that we
could not get the rendering.

00:06:12.535 --> 00:06:15.450
Either it crashed, or after
ten minutes it was still

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.420
hadn't produced an image.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.240
So they're not a part
of the competition.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.230
And of course we run them
for the finals.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.120
OK, now the vote time.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.830
OK, so this image, in or out?

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.800
Who thinks out?

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.830
Whoa, you guys are
a harsh crowd.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.710
OK.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.080
CHARLES LEISERSON:
Who thinks in?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.832
Who thinks in?

00:06:32.832 --> 00:06:34.160
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
Who thinks in?

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.700
CHARLES LEISERSON: We've
got to get you both.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.100
Who thinks in?

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.460
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
So we know--

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.460
AUDIENCE: Do we get
screwed for this?

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.070
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
Imagine that.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.862
OK.

00:06:41.862 --> 00:06:43.250
That image is out.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.950
You can take notes, OK.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.200
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.580
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
OK, next image.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.590
AUDIENCE: Number one's out.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.405
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: OK,
this one, in or out?

00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:55.160
Out.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.565
OK.

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:56.420
AUDIENCE: Probably the same.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.770
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
OK, it's out.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.390
AUDIENCE: It's got the funny
ring at the bottom, which I

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.330
guess that's what most of
you are picking up on.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.006
I think that's kind of
disqualifying for the derby.

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:08.590
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: OK,
how about this?

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.670
Out?

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.960
In or out?

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.750
AUDIENCE: Out.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.510
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Out.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.430
Whoa.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.170
CHARLES LEISERSON: Wow,
you guys are vicious.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.446
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Exactly.

00:07:14.446 --> 00:07:17.150
OK, how about this?

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.050
How many people think
they should be out?

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.320
OK, I guess that'll
get in here.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.980
I guess--

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.380
OK, that image is in.

Push!

00:14:46.755 --> 00:14:49.550
We have a survivor.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.434

about other group?

00:15:38.475 --> 00:15:39.700

That survived, too.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.530
Two.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.622
That's all right.

That's a...

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:29.520
So that is a knockout
blow there.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.070
Now what we're going to do is,
we're going to run it on from

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.900
48 core machine from
the bottom.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.230
So we will let other teams also,
if we have time, to come

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.930
and explain what they did.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.050
We are running--

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.680
who's now?

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.920
AUDIENCE: This is a Dobs.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.890
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Dobs.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.132
OK, why don't you guys
explain what you did.

00:16:49.132 --> 00:16:50.608
AUDIENCE: Come up here.

00:16:50.608 --> 00:16:52.084

00:16:52.084 --> 00:16:55.036

the mic is off.

00:16:55.036 --> 00:16:56.410
CHARLES LEISERSON: The
mic is on, but it's

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:56.830
only for the video.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.114
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Video.

00:16:58.114 --> 00:17:01.790
CHARLES LEISERSON: You have to
use the mic but you can't hear

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.495
the speaking.

00:17:04.495 --> 00:17:09.140
AUDIENCE: So we parallelized
the ray tracing part.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.859
The two for loops for going
through all the

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:13.869
pixels on the screen.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:18.069
And then we also parallelized
the main loop for caustic

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.660
elimination.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.829
And we changed the--

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.170
sort of the data structure--

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.069
how that works.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:25.000
Used some like bounding
boxes to make the

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.250
intersection faster.

00:17:28.585 --> 00:17:30.730
I don't know what else we did.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.200
AUDIENCE: We found ways
to get rid of--

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.636
AUDIENCE: Mic, please.

00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:40.200
AUDIENCE: We found ways to get
rid of a lot of trigonometry,

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.270
which actually helped a lot.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:46.970
And we got rid of the recursion
in locate photons,

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.550
which was a major roadblock.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:50.370
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Question.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.101
AUDIENCE: What did
you do for that?

00:17:52.101 --> 00:17:54.850
How'd you get rid of the trig?

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.410
AUDIENCE: Repeat the question.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.355

from XYZ coordinates into

00:18:01.355 --> 00:18:03.820
spherical coordinates and then
back again, over and over.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.320
So we just didn't do that.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.980
Uh-oh.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.550

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.330

on scene one.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:25.630
Right?

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:26.720

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.660
Oh.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.910

00:18:37.006 --> 00:18:37.448
Scene three.

00:18:37.448 --> 00:18:38.780
So there might have
been a slip.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.540
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: No.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.010
But this scene one is
much more simpler.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.150
OK, good.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.490
So you're on the board now?

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:51.220
AUDIENCE: How is the seating
being done in scene one if it

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.160
doesn't have a surface
that's--

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.470

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.350
AUDIENCE: --caustics.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.890
It might be that some
people did really

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:57.940
fast on that one and--

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.834
AUDIENCE: Because we ran
everybody's scene three.

00:18:59.834 --> 00:19:01.810
And we guarantee that the
top end teams are on it.

detained the tape.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.380
OK, good.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.572
First team is in.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:17.490
Then the next team.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.880
AUDIENCE: That's Elizabeth.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.600

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.541
AUDIENCE: Scott, right?

00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:23.530
SAMAN AMARASINGHE:
There we go.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.055
Why their thing is being run.

00:19:25.055 --> 00:19:26.936
AUDIENCE: Are you running it?

00:19:26.936 --> 00:19:27.810
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.020
So I guess for the display
surface, the main optimization

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.060
there was imagining two planes
at the top bound and the

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.900
bottom bound and seeing if a
ray passed through them and

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.560
then only checking that
section of the grid.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.300
And then even within like that
square bounding box--

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.322
AUDIENCE: Like if there's a
square, and then the ray's

00:19:45.322 --> 00:19:46.036
going through like
that, there's a

00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:46.750
bunch of grid squares--

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.671
AUDIENCE: Could you use
the mic, please?

00:19:48.671 --> 00:19:50.955
AUDIENCE: Like if a ray's
intersecting a square, there's

00:19:50.955 --> 00:19:53.700
still a bunch of grid squares
above and below it that you

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.490
don't have to check.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.310
So we kind of imagined
it as a--

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.370
projected it onto
a 2D surface.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:05.530
So we didn't check additional
superfluous grid squares.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.540
We also did the thing where
we got rid of the trig by

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.175
transforming from polar
coordinates to XYZ

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:11.320
coordinates.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.290
Although, before that, we used
the fast sign and cosign

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:16.300
approximation, which
was almost as fast.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.096
Using a quadratic curve,
which was kind of cool.

00:20:20.096 --> 00:20:22.477
AUDIENCE: I think those
are the main--

00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:26.910
AUDIENCE: We did an SSE matrix
multiply, which barely speeded

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.835
it up, but whatever.

00:20:28.835 --> 00:20:29.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.790
AUDIENCE: We moved
stuff into...

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.620
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: So you are
the team that had issue going

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.125
to Intel to AMD.

00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:35.965
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:35.965 --> 00:20:39.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we were
complaining about--

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.500
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.580
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: If you use
Intel, certain instruction is

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.830
not the same in AMD.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.500
OK, good.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.140
So we are waiting for
the time to come?

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.270
AUDIENCE: So we ran it once,
but we forgot to time it.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.590

that we could run it again--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.370
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: So by the
way, I want to give a chance

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.710
for the top team that
get knocked out,

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:07.930
explain what they did.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.770
Even though they are not in
competition because they ran

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.520
much faster in the same run.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.210
Who's the top team?

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.202

SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Inversion
off that.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.045
OK, next team.

00:21:49.488 --> 00:21:52.165
AUDIENCE: So our team also
did a same trick.

00:21:52.165 --> 00:21:54.550
That was done in the
previous two teams.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.800
We got rid of the
trigonometry.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.600
And also used a bounding box.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.310
Basically described in
the previous team.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.160
And we also tried to use SSE.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:13.430
But as soon as the news
about an AMD machine,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:14.927
we got rid of that.

00:22:14.927 --> 00:22:15.324
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:15.324 --> 00:22:18.300
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Oh, my
look at that speed.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.089
AUDIENCE: Whoa.

00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:20.466
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Whoa.

00:22:20.466 --> 00:22:20.925
Woo!

00:22:20.925 --> 00:22:24.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:24.445
OK.

00:22:24.445 --> 00:22:25.535
AUDIENCE: If you want to take--
could we take more time

00:22:25.535 --> 00:22:25.790
to talk about it--

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.920
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: Yeah, sure.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.130
Yes.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.945
AUDIENCE: Because I'm sure you
guys have some things that are

00:22:28.945 --> 00:22:30.100
different than everybody
else's.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.595
In fact, I know it.

00:22:30.595 --> 00:22:31.585
AUDIENCE: It's on.

00:22:31.585 --> 00:22:32.380
It's just on.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:32.920
SAMAN AMARASINGHE: It's on.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.180
It's on.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.460
It's already recording.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.630
So for the cache I use like
a three-dimensional grid.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.420
Because I realized that as the
old times, the torrents is

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.910
like usually one, unless
there's some outlier.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.820
But I don't see one
in my case.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.950
So I use a three-dimensional
grid.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:49.240
And use a lot of locks to
prevent contention.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.780
So I do the same thing
for photon map.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.470
I basically implement my
own photon map and

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.650
just get rid of theirs.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.940
And also, the same thing,
like using a grid.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.300
And I spent a lot of
time debugging.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.515
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:02.515 --> 00:23:06.490
AUDIENCE: And we also do some
minor optimization.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.870
We implement the rendering
crest as a reducer.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.112
So that we--

00:23:12.112 --> 00:23:17.820
a hyper rod object So that every
time Cilk steals some

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.340
other's job, you will create
a local view of

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.650
the rendered object.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:28.200
And we found there is a artifact
that-- because we are

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.750
seeding the rendered object.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.090
The default that seed
is two, right?

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:38.810
And it will create some artifact
in our image, so we

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.780
use a random number to seed
that rendered object.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.750
That's what we do.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:48.050
And also, we do something
like we change the--

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.363
no, we don't have
locate photon.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.620
Yeah OK.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.310
So we have done a lot of thing
to improve the original photon

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:03.415
med but after that we decide to
change our implementation

00:24:03.415 --> 00:24:06.145
of photon med so we
don't use that.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.450
OK.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:14.670
PROFESSOR 1: OK, good.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.740
Thank you.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.215
OK.

00:24:18.215 --> 00:24:20.170
OK, the suspense is on.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.460
So the final team.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.870
OK.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.050
STUDENT 8: So one of the first
things that happened is that

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.700
we looked at the code and, like,
it was all a KD tree.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:37.980
And we're like, what's that?

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.330
So we got rid of that
immediately and we turned it

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:41.280
into something--

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.950
I think the other groups might
have talked about it, but we

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.750
gave it a nifty marketing
name, we

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.470
called it a photon cube.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:50.310
And so we created
lots of these.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.070
We partitioned the large cube
environment into many small

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.260
photon cubes so we could just
jump in and look in the

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.860
relative air vicinity
of photons that

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.630
you're looking for.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.850
STUDENT 9: Yeah.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:06.490
So this is like, when you do
locate photon, you know the

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:10.070
reference photon and you
can create a sphere.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:15.360
So we can do constant time to
find the boundary of the

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.810
photon cube.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:22.400
Like go from x1 to x something,
y to y and z to z.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.790
So then we don't have to
traverse the tree.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:30.280
And we basically parallelized
two part, so the one in render

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.750
and another one in the trace
photon that when we try to put

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:38.180
the photon in the map.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:43.030
And also when we create a photon
to the cube, there is a

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.170
reused vector to start a
photon in each cube.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:50.770
But then it's not really good,
because when you put the

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.510
photon in the cube, you have
to, like, new photon.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.410
Which means that the memory,
it's like spurts throughout

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:57.860
your program.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:03.190
So after that we convert that
into a block of memory.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.805
And we use that when we
call locate photon.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:13.485
STUDENT 10: And for the last,
about surfaces that intersect.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.930
There were four kinds
of optimizations.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:27.140
First one is checking if the
origin of ray is outside of

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:32.980
the maximum bound and lower
bound of surface, then and

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:40.930
check whether by direction is
outside or if it's toward the

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:45.480
outside then we don't have to
check, just return false.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.280
And second thing is like
the square cube thing.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:58.220
When rays intersect we can make
a boundary by directly

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:06.330
mapping to the XYZ at the
surface at the maximum

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:10.530
boundary and lower boundary
of the surface.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:18.850
And also when you iterate
through the x index, we can

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:27.930
cut off again because
a bitmap.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:35.680
We only have to check with the
indexes which correspond to

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:41.880
ray's z index at that cube,
at that x location.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:50.510
And the last thing was for each
square we pre-computed

00:27:50.510 --> 00:28:02.200
the minimum value and maximum
value of y and we compared the

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:08.890
rays by value within
that range.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:13.755
And we just cut off if
it doesn't intersect.

00:28:13.755 --> 00:28:15.413
It doesn't overlap.

00:28:15.413 --> 00:28:16.400
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.250
Good.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.120
OK, now this is the
suspense part.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.550
OK.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.240
We are going to run
this and see.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.090
The time to beat is 18.7.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:24.900
OK, right?

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.630
Again.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:26.460
OK.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.140
There we go.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.560
Let's see.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.040
How many people think it's
going to beat 18.7.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.660
18.6.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.510
OK.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.070
AUDIENCE: 8, 9, 10--

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.530
PROFESSOR 1: It's
the excitement.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:36.370
Keep counting.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:36.900
OK.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.550
There we go.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:44.890
AUDIENCE: 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19--

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.020
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, oh, oh.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:52.960
AUDIENCE: 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.260
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, OK.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.170
It came out as 26.41.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:57.790
OK.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:06.150
PROFESSOR 1: So you guys
are the winners.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.400
Come up here.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.110
AUDIENCE: Danielle.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.222
PROFESSOR 1: Where's Danielle?

00:29:14.222 --> 00:29:17.614
AUDIENCE: Uh, Danielle
disappeared.

00:29:17.614 --> 00:29:19.854
AUDIENCE: Yes, she did.

00:29:19.854 --> 00:29:20.550
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.250
Let's see whether she
can find her, so OK.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.650
Just hold on a second until--

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.990
AUDIENCE: Yep, there we go.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.395
PROFESSOR 1: You can put
it down now, though.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.560
PRESENTER: So this one's
the reference.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.820
PROFESSOR 1: Put a text meter
in, that's better.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.680
AUDIENCE: Which one's
reference?

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.930
PRESENTER: This one's
the reference.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.880
PROFESSOR 1: I think
they don't align.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.200
Can you align them?

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.070
PRESENTER: There we go.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:03.180
PROFESSOR 1: OK, so we
have a winning team.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.070
PROFESSOR 2: We have
a winning team.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:10.870
And so it's my pleasure to
introduce Danielle Smith, who

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:19.220
is the University relations for
Akamai, and she's here to

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.980
give you guys your prize.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.671
So we have three winners.

00:30:23.671 --> 00:30:25.770
DANIELLE: I just wanted
to make an entrance

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.640
is why I came in.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.160
Thank you.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.900
First of all, welcome to all of
you guys for coming in, and

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.610
we wanted to give you
these prizes.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:38.810
So we have some cool iPod Nanos,
which you may or may

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.720
not have already, but it can't
hurt to have another.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.690
They kind of burn out
or you lose one or

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:50.946
someone steps on it.

00:30:50.946 --> 00:30:55.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.790
DANIELLE: Congratulations.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.230
You guys have worked
really hard.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.120
PROFESSOR 1: Congratulations.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.140
Congratulations.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.740
Congratulations.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.410
OK.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.150
So what's next.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:11.970
That's it.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:12.790
We are done?

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:13.120
DANIELLE: All righty.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.600
So we have plenty of food,
it's going to be

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.270
right on the atrium.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:20.370
I know that's the most
exciting part.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.690
But it should be arriving in the
next 10 to 15 minutes, so

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.260
we have a few minutes.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.230
I thought maybe this would
go a little bit longer.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.180
PROFESSOR 1: We do
have a couple of

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.900
things we can chat about.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.400
DANIELLE: Yeah.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.510
So just a couple of housekeeping
things.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.810
If you need to use the ladies'
room or the men's room, it's

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.040
actually right outside
that door.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:44.050
Out the double doors, you'll
see it right there.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:47.150
I have invited some other Akamai
employees to come and

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.840
mingle and say hello to you
guys, so I encourage you, if

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.120
you see any faces that aren't
familiar, to kind of go up and

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.310
talk about your projects
and introduce yourself.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:59.480
And thanks for coming.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.230
I know we wanted to switch it up
a little bit because it was

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.040
the last class.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.140
We wanted to get you out of the
classroom and just kind of

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.670
shake it up.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.490
So I'm glad that you
came to join.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.050
PROFESSOR 1: And the
knock tours.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.230
DANIELLE: And the knock tours.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.660
Thank you.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.160
So on the back of your name
tags, there's a number, one,

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.410
two or three.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:18.950
One, two or three.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.120
So that correlates with
the knock tour that

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.310
you're going to be on.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.240
We have to keep it to relatively
small groups.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.620
So the first tour will be at 10
past 4, the second one will

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.840
be at 4:40, and the last
one will be at 5:10.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.550
PROFESSOR 1: I guess if we don't
have too many people we

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.000
might be able to
compress some--

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.440
DANIELLE: Yes.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.310
PROFESSOR 1: So we'll
see whether we

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.100
can do that, compress--

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:38.360
DANIELLE: Yes.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.550
So I'll just call the first tour
and you guys can go down.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:45.120
And obviously it's optional.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.900
Don't feel-- if you're not
interested, you don't have to

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.310
go on the knock tour.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.360
I think that's it.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:50.550
PROFESSOR 1: Good.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:51.615
Thank you.

00:32:51.615 --> 00:32:56.265
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:56.265 --> 00:32:58.070
PROFESSOR 1: We can talk
about a little bit.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.720
So one thing.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:07.060
We are trying to get HKN
feedback up to hopefully 90%,

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.990
and we are right now
at what, 11?

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.980
PROFESSOR 2: No, we're
a little bit higher.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.910
We're now at about 16 or so.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.550
PROFESSOR 1: 16.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.150
So that's a little more way
to go from 16 to 90.

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.790
I hope you guys go back and
then fill out this survey.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.310
Very important.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:23.420
PROFESSOR 2: Please take a
few minutes to do that.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.370
It really helps us in,
even if you want to

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:28.470
say bad things, OK?

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.100
It really helps overall to
give feedback and the

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.300
department likes to
see these things.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.530
Oh yeah, thanks.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:37.370
Likes to see how it
is that people are

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.530
responding to the courses.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.320
So if you hated the course, if
you liked the course, in

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.640
particular, we have some
questions on there that are

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.650
specific to how we teach
the course next year.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.890
One of the ideas we have for
next year is to introduce our

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.190
recitation sections,
which would focus

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.300
on the use of tools.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:55.650
OK?

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.200
So basically the conceptual
stuff, much as we have the

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.710
lectures now, but then also
having something where it

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:06.400
really takes you through each
tool, and teaches how the use

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.040
of those tools which would
be taught once a week.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.280
So if you think that's a good
idea, that's going to really

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.449
help to have that kind
of feedback.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.120
And it will certainly help the
students who take it next year

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.150
if we can persuade the
department that that's worth

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.389
staffing the sections
next year.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:27.340
Also if you have any positive
things to say about teaching

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.030
assistants, that's a great
place to put it.

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.320
OK?

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.949
If they helped you get through
this term, this is a great

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.760
place to say thank you and it
only takes a few minutes.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.650
OK?

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:41.380
So I'm sure that some of the
TAs put in more than a few

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.969
minutes, OK, on your thing.

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:47.040
So to take a few minutes
and say thank you on

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.570
that form would be--

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:51.820
I'm sure they would very,
very much appreciate.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.580
PROFESSOR 1: One thing, as
Charles mentioned, what we are

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:58.110
trying to do in recitation is do
a little bit of programmer

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.360
life skills.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.810
So I know all of you guys are
probably very smart, can think

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.920
about the complex algorithms
and stuff like that.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.040
But there are a lot of tools
that, it's not the smartness

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.090
but you can spend hours
trying to figure out.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:14.280
But if you know it,
it will be useful.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.930
So what we are trying to do is
have these recitations to say

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.010
OK, how to use a debugger.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:23.800
And even how to change
a makefile.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.130
Things like that.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:28.760
So one thing, until the food
arrives, I'd like to say is,

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.560
get some feedback.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.160
Think of what is a tool you'd
like to know or like to learn,

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.270
or something you think is very
useful for people coming next

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:37.110
year to learn.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:42.310
That if you have spent a lot of
time worrying and you think

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:44.910
you spent way too much time
trying to understand, it would

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.220
be easier for us to
think about that.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.950
I mean, I would like to
get your feedback.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.150
And also some of you probably
will open up with some general

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.922
feedback on class.

00:35:52.922 --> 00:35:56.820
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
you want to repeat that.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.410
A more in depth thing
on how to use git

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:00.850
would be really useful.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:04.040
Because I know it has things to
make your life easier, but

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.802
I don't know how to
use any of them.

00:36:06.802 --> 00:36:08.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah. women are always
breaking the branches.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.160
And it's like, yeah, we maybe
know how to do this and it is

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:11.790
really easy.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.610
And then we're like, use
this git command.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.434
And it's like, now your
branch is broken.

00:36:15.434 --> 00:36:17.819
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:18.300
PROFESSOR 2: Good.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.340
So git

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:19.710
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.480
I mean that's because those are
interesting tools because,

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.370
if you know everything
right, you can do

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:25.560
a lot of fun things.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.690
But if you do it wrong, you end
up in huge mess that all

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.590
you do is scored all over the
place and you don't know.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:32.330
So yes.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:34.655
I mean I can relate to that.

00:36:34.655 --> 00:36:36.927
AUDIENCE: If you use git
correctly, if you

00:36:36.927 --> 00:36:39.000
know how to use git--

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.190
If you learn how to use git you
will find yourself using

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:46.250
it even when you're working
on a one person project.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.400
git is awesome.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.181
I can highly recommend
learning it.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.920
AUDIENCE: What would be helpful
is that telling us

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.700
that you are running on an AMD
box and AMD doesn't support

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.905
SSE 4.1 instructions.

00:36:59.905 --> 00:37:03.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.140
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, I mean, this
is supposed to be X86

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.440
compatible, all those things.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.860
But I mean, some people learn
the hard way that, OK, the

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.760
word is not the same
even though--

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.830
PROFESSOR 2: But that is part
of the lesson of the course,

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.090
is how do you make high
performance portable?

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:19.450
OK?

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:25.080
And so what you choose or
don't choose to use is--

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.140
But I agree.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.990
PROFESSOR 1: That's why we ran,
we want to run it the

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:33.510
night before because we knew
things like this would happen.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.300
So we can at least give some
time to say OK, look.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:36.975
Go change something.

00:37:36.975 --> 00:37:37.930
Were you able to fix that?

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:38.500
OK.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.340
Good.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.766
So yes.

00:37:40.766 --> 00:37:41.520
PROFESSOR 2: Good.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.320
PROFESSOR 1: And sometimes the
problem is, a lot of these

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.595
small changes you don't know
until you run into things like

00:37:47.595 --> 00:37:52.100
this and oh, somewhere in page
256 in the manual that there's

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.550
a footnote say, oh,
by the way.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.880
And that's what happens
in there.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.650
I mean if you had listed
everything that would be

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:00.150
probably and entire encyclopedia
of things that

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.300
you will see.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.780
PROFESSOR 2: So one other thing
that people ask about

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.050
is, what comes after
this course?

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.010
OK?

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:13.510
So next term Saman is teaching
the compiler course.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:15.005
PROFESSOR 1: It's Martin.

00:38:15.005 --> 00:38:16.200
PROFESSOR 2: Are you
teaching with him?

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:16.495
PROFESSOR 1: No.

00:38:16.495 --> 00:38:17.475
PROFESSOR 2: Oh, you're
not teaching.

00:38:17.475 --> 00:38:17.770
OK.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:19.110
I thought you were.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:19.810
OK.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.690
So in any case, compiler
course is a

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:22.550
good follow-on course.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:26.210
For those who haven't done
6.046, that's a good course

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:29.180
and I'll be teaching that
course next term.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.040
In addition, how many people
here have done a UROP?

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:35.710
Few of you.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.790
So let me encourage you
to look for UROPs.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.730
You now have some skills that
will make you really valuable.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.370
And in particular my group
is looking for--

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:44.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:48.070
PROFESSOR 2: Probably two more
UROPs than I have already.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.390
Already Boone is one of my
UROPs, started just a

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.070
couple weeks ago.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:57.360
And so we do have some other
projects in both architecture

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.070
and in software-related things.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:02.920
And so.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.540
if you're interested, you go
to my group's web page.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:09.560
It tells you five things you
have to submit if you want to

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.660
work in my group.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:10.950
OK?

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.880
That includes things like
samples of your code.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.580
Well, you ought to
have that by now.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.250
And so forth.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.090
So let me encourage
you to do that.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:23.330
And Saman also has active
participation of

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.670
UROPs in his group.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.950
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:28.860
So my employees already
started doing a

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.790
project in my group.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:32.890
And I'm also looking for a
couple more people to do some

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:36.950
compiler, runtime system, and
a bunch of high performance

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:38.980
type projects I have.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.490
And also for future course,
one course I want to also

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:45.670
mention is this IAP.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.320
There's a course that is done
with collaboration with VMware

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.550
to look at how to build scalable
large systems using

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:56.480
this the Spring and
Java platforms.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.650
So if they're interested in
trying to see how things were

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:02.040
running on one machine and run
something that can scale up to

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.050
hundreds of machines.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.490
If you have ideas of creating
an I 8 with web 2.0,

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:09.330
interesting thing.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:10.930
Here is an opportunity
to do that.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:15.590
So if you're looking
for interesting IAP

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:16.630
courses, this is great.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.830
PROFESSOR 2: I really encourage
every single person

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:23.580
who completed this class
to do a UROP with

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.430
somebody before you leave.

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.550
It's really a way of integrating
your knowledge.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:32.050
And it is one of the most
valuable experiences that you

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:36.390
can have at MIT is to do a UROP
for a professor and get

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.680
involved in the research
of a group.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:43.210
Because in some ways it's like
this course, in that it

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.470
integrates knowledge from a
lot of different sources.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.140
And it isn't just one thing.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:49.890
But even more than
this course.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.070
This course we still
are dealing

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.320
with artificial things.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.040
And in the researcher
arena, you're

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.870
dealing with real problems.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:01.900
So let me just once again
encourage you to spend some

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:07.160
time getting a UROP and
certainly looking

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:11.030
for AUPs and MEng.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.400
How many people here are
looking at MEng as a

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.982
possibility?

00:41:14.982 --> 00:41:16.670
So a fair number.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.560
Yeah, that's good.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.530
That's great.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:20.760
PROFESSOR 1: I want
to add to that.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.730
So these days there has been a
big philosophical discussion

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:27.080
saying why do you have
to have universities?

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:32.000
You go to OCW and sit home in
your bedroom and you can

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.930
follow all these courses,
and you don't have to

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.040
pay a mighty tuition.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.460
And wouldn't that
be good enough?

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.390
One part that's not good
enough is this class.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:42.230
So I mean think about it.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:45.960
I mean you can't go get the OCW
catalog and have this kind

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.970
of a dynamic.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.220
There's no seventh floor.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.810
All in OCW.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.430
And you have from there to
go and get motivated.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:56.980
So that's one part of that.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:03.080
PROFESSOR 2: There's no John
or Reed or Eric or Josh to

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.990
respond quickly about
what's going on.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.640
PROFESSOR 1: That's one.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.280
But I think one other thing that
a lot of people miss when

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.740
they look at all of the
curriculum and stuff like that

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.090
is the UROP ability.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.890
So a lot of these people, that
is something, it's very unique

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:23.080
to MIT and a lot of people
benefit hugely with UROPs.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.560
I have had UROPs who started
with me as seniors.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.040
By the time they are graduating
with their MEng

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.480
they have two first out
papers in the best

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.700
conference out there.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.030
And everybody thinks, when they
say they are looking for

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.000
a job, they are finishing their
Ph.D and looking for

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.560
academic jobs.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:38.730
No.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.700
They are just finishing
up their masters.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.270
And I have a couple of students
that managed to

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:46.870
become really expert in an
area by being a UROP.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:50.120
So they are finishing up at MIT
as a generalist, saying

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.990
give me a job.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.770
But you're finishing up
and have some deep

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:55.750
knowledge in some area.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:59.880
Sitting in and at the same level
as most Ph.Ds or most

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.800
really deep practicing engineers
in that area.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.980
So that level, even if you don't
do that, just seeing

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.900
what happens in a research
group, being

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.540
participating on that.

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.980
Pushing, seeing something
to the maximum limit.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.950
I mean in the class,
that's a limit.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.670
I mean even though this class is
somewhat open, says make it

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:21.200
run as fast as possible.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.830
But most of the time in the
class, it's like, we give you

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:26.650
something, if you made that,
OK, you're done with it.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:27.530
In research, there's no limit.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:30.175
You really, really push
your boundaries.

00:43:30.175 --> 00:43:31.130
What's that?

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.600
PROFESSOR 2: So what do
we have here, John?

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.620
JOHN: I counted in my mailbox
how many messages came from

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.580
6.172 staff, and it's
about 3,500 over the

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.960
course of this term.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.692
PROFESSOR 2: Wow.

00:43:44.692 --> 00:43:49.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.555
PROFESSOR 1: How much time--

00:43:50.555 --> 00:43:53.350
PROFESSOR 2: So, this is also,
as Saman mentions, a

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.100
programmer life skills course.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.810
And one of the things that you
should get used to in life is

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.760
thanking people who help you.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.110
OK?

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:06.770
I think that all of the MIT
POSSE members, all the people

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:11.530
who devoted, volunteered their
time to help you, could really

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:17.350
appreciate an email that says
thank you and what exactly you

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:18.960
feel you learned from them.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.500
OK?

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.250
Because it's one thing
to just say

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:23.500
thanks, so long, et cetera.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:28.270
In addition, these people are
contacts, part of your network

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:33.125
of understanding what the world
of software developers

00:44:33.125 --> 00:44:38.490
is all about, and can serve as
useful contacts to keep.

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.620
How many people use a service
like LinkedIn

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.580
or something to--

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.280
You probably all you mostly
use Facebook.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.410
Anybody use LinkedIn
at this point?

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:47.180
So many professionals use--

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.380
I don't want to pitch for
LinkedIn, but it is one of the

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.470
services that lots
of people are on.

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:56.990
So what are some of the other
services that people use for

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:58.210
professional contacts?

00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:59.524
AUDIENCE: The only thing
people try to

00:44:59.524 --> 00:45:00.840
contact me on is LinkedIn.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.590
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.870
So, good idea to start
connecting and building a

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:08.770
network of people who you
know and who can answer

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.280
questions for you.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:10.660
OK?

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.410
Such as, gee, I'm considering
these two kinds of job offers.

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.470
What should I be looking for?

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.660
It might be good to get a
professional software

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.350
engineer's input to that.

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:18.580
OK?

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.460
Because you know these folks.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.150
You've had a few meetings
with them.

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.480
OK?

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.380
And they know you.

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:26.150
And they may be able to say
here's my take on that, as

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:28.920
well as getting input from your
family and your friends

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.710
and your professors and other
people that you know.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:42.170
But I do think that courtesy
goes a long way in life.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.930
And they really have, these are
all people, as I say, who

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:46.620
spent time looking
over your code.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.530
And you should have heard some
of the comments we got from

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:50.790
them after project one.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:53.830
Oh my God, they have a single
letter variable names for the

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.590
whole thing.

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:57.510
Or, what are you teaching
these students?

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:01.450
And I said no, this is exactly
why we want you there.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:02.380
OK?

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:06.350
So I think that if you feel in
particular, whether or not you

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:08.110
feel you got anything
out of it, OK?

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:10.550
But in particular, if you did
get something out of it, it

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:14.100
would be really good idea to not
forget to send some email

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.330
off to thank them.

00:46:19.394 --> 00:46:22.030
PROFESSOR 1: OK, we want to get
some feedback from them.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.470
PROFESSOR 2: Sure.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:23.130
PROFESSOR 1: Have open mic?

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:23.660
PROFESSOR 2: Open mic?

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.970
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.860
PROFESSOR 2: Actually, open mic,
let's do it like this.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.400
Because I think it'll be easier
and better for the

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:33.190
video if we just have
people come up and--

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:35.435
PROFESSOR 1: I don't know that
they're going to be too

00:46:35.435 --> 00:46:35.590
intimidating.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:38.290
PROFESSOR 2: That's OK.

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:39.070
They can handle it.

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:40.370
These are seasoned--

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.790
So, comments about the class.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.315
PROFESSOR 1: How
we can improve?

00:46:48.315 --> 00:46:49.460
We'd really like to hear that.

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.720
I mean things you liked
and didn't like.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.620
For example, these absolute
gradings we did for projects

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:02.300
had passionate support and
control let's say before.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.370
I mean, did you guys feel giving
the top marke for the

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:08.400
fastest and having at least a
log scale, no, we didn't do a

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.790
linear scale going down.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:12.540
I mean, hey.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.270
Was it motivating
or demotivating?

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.750
PROFESSOR 2: So what do people
think was the most valuable

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.510
thing out of the course?

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:23.610
I've had dinner with a few
of you, and you were very

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:26.470
opinionated over dinner.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:30.480
So I don't mind hearing those
comments again, but making

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.360
them for other people.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.680
So I know it's intimidating,
but what I want

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.520
to do is get a line.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.360
As one person's talking
I want other

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.400
people to line up behind.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.420
And just give us
some feedback.

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.260
PROFESSOR 1: Come on.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.740
PROFESSOR 2: OK, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:43.270
Who's brave?

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:44.270
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:47.130
You got halfway of your seat.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:47.560
Yeah.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.330
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, come on.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:49.350
PROFESSOR 2: I'm sure
you have an opinion.

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:51.235
Who here does not
have an opinion?

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:51.700
PROFESSOR 1: Sure.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:52.630
Yeah.

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.030
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah, yeah, good.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.820
And then you can
line up right--

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.590
there you go.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:47:59.150
OK?

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:00.350
There you go.

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:04.580
And then others can come up
behind as they're motivated.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:05.550
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:08.240
First of all, I'd like to thank
the professors and the

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.320
TAs for this opportunity.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.310
This is absolutely wonderful.

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:13.460
And all the students
I worked with.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:14.710
You were all great.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.780
I just wanted to say when you
were talking about what the

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.030
most valuable thing in the class
people thought was, I

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.290
don't even know how to pick.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:30.530
Of the projects that we worked
on, or that they worked on, I

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:34.440
looked at every one and just
thought, what of the content

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.700
of this project have I used
just in the past year?

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:41.230
And the amount of stuff that
I've made significant use of

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:47.500
that you guys covered has been
at least 75%, maybe even more,

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.100
of the material of the class.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.210
And that means that if you look
over multiple engineers,

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:55.580
you probably pretty quickly get
coverage of 100% of it.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.750
All these projects, profiling,
parallelism, algorithms, bit

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:04.640
hacks, these are all things
that I use on.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.033
if not a daily basis,
then a weekly basis.

00:49:07.033 --> 00:49:07.920
PROFESSOR 2: OK.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.330
Good.

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:09.827
Thanks.

00:49:09.827 --> 00:49:10.821
Thank you.

00:49:10.821 --> 00:49:13.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.370
AUDIENCE: So for me, like, I
really had no experience with

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:20.130
C or C++ or really distributed
version

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:21.770
control before this class.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:24.440
So a lot of my time I think was
spent kind of learning the

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.210
basics of that.

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:27.800
I spent a lot of time initially
learning the basics

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.280
like pointer arithmetic and
that kind of stuff.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.330
And then a lot of time learning
the profiling tools.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.860
So I wish, I really do wish more
time was spent kind of--

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.170
well, your recitation, I think,
would be a good way to

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:39.810
really get that out
of the way.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.300
Because the algorithmic stuff
was more easy for me, which I

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.245
thought was kind of ridiculous.

00:49:43.245 --> 00:49:44.190
You know?

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:45.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.250
AUDIENCE: The fact that these
tools are what's holding back,

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.050
that I have to spend a
lot of time learning.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.000
PROFESSOR 1: This is actually
something very interesting

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.200
people have observed.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.720
So if you do physics problems
or math problems, if you run

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.550
into an issue, after a certain
amount of time you will just

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:04.090
go ask somebody.

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:08.500
But in programming, people seem
to go on and on and on

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.760
trying to debug this
simple thing.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:15.830
And part of that, part of what
we try to get is also not just

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:19.930
all the cool algorithms
and stuff like that.

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:21.490
To give you a process.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:23.480
Because there are times when you
start saying this program

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:24.940
is slow, what you do?

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.130
And I think that's a missing
part sometimes about the

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:28.690
process of debugging.

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:30.980
If the program doesn't
work, what do you do?

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.870
Where do you start?

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:34.680
I think that's why we are trying
to do a little bit of,

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.670
basically, these life skills.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:38.760
AUDIENCE: It was great to
learn but it was more

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.150
stressful to learn.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:43.630
I'm not as willing to ask as a
lot of people, so it's hard

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:44.440
for me to--

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.750
PROFESSOR 1: So one thing we're

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:46.650
trying to do is probably--

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:47.530
PROFESSOR 2: That's
great feedback.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:51.130
PROFESSOR 2: We will try to
formalize next year the

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:53.160
seventh floor lounge, because
a lot of people

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.520
who came there benefited.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.940
But have it a little bit more.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:59.610
And also get a little bit
more life skills type

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:00.470
things early on.

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:02.330
Like if you find a problem,
what will happen?

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:03.770
AUDIENCE: It could be a
lot longer than that.

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:04.250
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:06.220
PROFESSOR 2: Yes, so that's
our goal, is to make it so

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.880
that people come up to
speed more quickly.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.260
But in some sense, another goal
but I have here, next

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:16.760
year, is that the C students
will stay in the class.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.050
OK?

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:21.810
So what happened is most of the
C students dropped out.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:23.900
So in case you want to know,
most people are going to get

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.210
A's and B's.

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:26.130
OK?

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:27.810
So most of the C students
dropped out.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:30.270
And I would like to have people
complete the course,

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:33.680
even the C students, feeling
that it's useful to complete

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.930
the course.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.320
AUDIENCE: So I think again,
as the person before me, I

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:40.980
learned a lot.

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.990
I hadn't had almost any
experience in C or

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:45.620
C++ before the class.

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:46.700
I had some experience
with git.

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.060
But I think that the class
has a lot to offer.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.720
There's a lot of content
covered.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:55.220
And I wish that, for example,
there are things that I wish

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.160
that I could have learned more
about, how to implement in a

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.260
formal way.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.990
Things like SSE instructions.

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:05.265
So I feel that like there was a
clear cut off of people who

00:52:05.265 --> 00:52:07.880
had a lot of experience and they
could be like, OK, I know

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.420
how to do assembly, I know how
to do other things, and if I

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.280
want to optimize this function
I can, whatever.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.190
Write it down.

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:17.180
And then there's these other
people that don't have that

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:21.066
much experience that in a class
it mentions this is how

00:52:21.066 --> 00:52:23.850
you use SSE or compiler
optimizations.

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:27.870
It's kind of mentioned but
not really more in depth.

00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:31.190
This is a case of how do you
actually do this in real life?

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:33.950
I mean, I think maybe the
examples given in class were

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.410
useful but very superfluous.

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:37.340
Like you don't really know.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:40.470
I know that I was looking
through other projects that

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:42.750
were similar to ours
for the final.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:45.810
And I think it's a class
that you taught in IAP.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.960
There was a team of people that
did a ray tracer in the

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.010
multi-programming.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:52.630
And they used SSE and
CMD everywhere.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.090
They packaged everything.

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:57.670
But that's something that I
said, it'll be really awesome

00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:00.510
to do, but I have no idea
how to start doing it.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.940
And I think that there's still
a lot of room to actually

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.660
apply the concepts that are
trying to be taught.

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.710
PROFESSOR 2: I think it's our
intention actually to increase

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:10.235
that part of the course,
the data

00:53:10.235 --> 00:53:12.030
parallel part of the course.

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.690
Which I think we'll
be able to do.

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:17.000
One of our concerns about adding
material has been, OK,

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.500
that means you guys have
to learn it too.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:26.720
But I think that if we're able
to reduce the workload of the

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:30.430
learning of the tools by having
recitations, we then

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:36.420
can look at adding other
material, and expect that the

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.270
load on students won't go up.

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.480
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.870
I mean even what
I want to say.

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:43.510
It's not even adding material,
what I think.

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:46.080
I feel that I was going to
class, learning all of these

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:46.670
cool things.

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:48.950
And then I was looking at my
project and it's like well,

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:50.610
these are the things that
I know how to do.

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:51.610
And I know that they
mentioned all these

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:52.580
other things in class.

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:56.980
I don't know how to make
them in my project.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:57.720
PROFESSOR 2: Great comment.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:01.130
PROFESSOR 1: So I think one
thing both good and bad about

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:04.340
this class is what
happened in--

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:05.550
I think it applied
to all of you.

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:09.810
When you try to teach computer
science, you get people who

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:12.450
are for the first time they are
writing any piece of code

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.120
more than 20 lines.

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:18.170
And you get people who are
checking in code for Apache.

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:21.660
And you have that entire range
of people in the class.

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.440
So how do you teach everybody?

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.500
And a lot of times when you give
a fixed project, either

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.290
somebody's completely struggling
to finish that, or

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:30.360
they are like in
a day is done.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.510
They are like, so what's this?

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:32.150
What's new?

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:35.150
The thing about performance
is, asked lot of people,

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.830
figured out there's
no end to it.

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:38.820
And you can keep doing
it, you can do more,

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:40.120
you can do more deeper.

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.440
So the nice thing about--

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.580
one thing about this class is
that there's something for

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.080
everybody in that.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.715
So if you are struggling still,
if you're learning, you

00:54:47.715 --> 00:54:49.540
can still get to someplace,
learn a lot.

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:53.420
But if you have done that when
you are in the fourth grade,

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.540
you can still go and do
something more, push that.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.140
So we try to keep that
balance in there.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.450
So we don't want to
bore anybody.

00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:01.860
And also we don't want a lot of
people dropping out of the

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.470
class either.

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:06.650
AUDIENCE: So continuing on with
what other people said, I

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:08.750
also ran into the same
problems with that.

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:10.440
Just the syntax,
just the tools.

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.140
So I guess I'll start off
thanking John and Reed,

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:17.330
they're really fast and good
at what they're doing.

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:20.070
And I feel like I've asked a
lot of dumb questions, and

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:23.488
they're good at answering
those.

00:55:23.488 --> 00:55:26.356
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:30.560
PROFESSOR 2: So John and
Reed and Josh all took

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.500
the class last year.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:32.910
OK?

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:36.040
And it's amazing, if you
ask John how he did

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.619
on the final project--

00:55:38.619 --> 00:55:40.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:42.380
PROFESSOR 2: He didn't
do so well.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.580
OK?

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:44.780
But it's amazing.

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:47.260
You'll discover, it's amazing
what you guys are going to

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.440
learn next semester after
being out of the class.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.400
Because you're on a path to
learning this stuff for

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.800
yourself now.

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.080
OK?

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.280
And you'll find that in all
kinds of things you do that

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.730
all these skills, you can
keep building them.

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:02.530
We will definitely be looking
for TAs next fall.

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:05.910
And so people who are
interested should--

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:09.710
who are going to be
MENGs should--

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:12.840
and even if you're
undergraduate, you're still

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.070
allowed to work hourly
for the class.

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:18.530
In fact, that's what
John is doing.

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:21.990
So if you're interested,
please let us know.

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:23.010
Please let us know.

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:29.230
PROFESSOR 1: So you can have
this nice experience as a TA.

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so, and then I
want to say something that I

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:34.770
really love about this course.

00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:37.410
I feel like it's such an
integrated experience.

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:42.340
It's, maybe except project one,
everything after that is,

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.450
you get a piece of code, as you
would normally, and then

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:48.410
everything is within
your bounds of--

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:49.980
you can do anything
that you want.

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:53.270
So I really like how it's not
limited to like, oh, we're on

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:57.040
this topic so we're going to
write a little algorithm that

00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:00.090
implements this particular
algorithm, and then move on to

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:02.560
next unit, and then nothing
ever comes together.

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.780
So that's something I really
love about this course.

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:12.210
And the next thing I want to
say is the beta grading.

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:14.900
For project three, I was working
with Angela, I feel

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:21.510
like from beta to final, because
I don't have much

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:27.670
experience with C, so it takes
me so long to just get the

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.830
syntax right, to get
my own going.

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:32.580
So for beta, we didn't have
anything working.

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:33.780
It doesn't even build.

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:38.240
But with two or three more
hours, we got it working.

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.190
It's not super fast, but
we kept working on it.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:44.290
And by the final we have
something I felt pretty proud.

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:47.160
But the beta grading doesn't
take that into account.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.590
Like if you are not very
experienced with C, it takes

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.890
you a long time, longer than
other people have experienced

00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:56.700
to get something going
in the first place.

00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:00.290
But beta kind of penalizes you
for just not having enough

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.710
time to do things you want.

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:04.060
PROFESSOR 1: I think it's
a double-edged sword.

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:08.440
Because if you don't do beta,
then you have very harsh.

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.240
You have one time code,
it's in and out.

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:14.680
If you just really don't do,
give that much grading for

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.790
beta and make it optional
and stuff like that,

00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:17.550
people just drop beta.

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:19.100
They don't just do
anything in it.

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:21.570
So we try to do something, give
everybody a true chance

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:24.562
and get everybody a real
motivation to actually work

00:58:24.562 --> 00:58:25.250
for both sides.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.840
Because for a lot of you
guys, beta defined and

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:28.910
you learned a lot.

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:30.560
Because you got something
in beta.

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.150
And for most of the classes I
have, we had things called

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:35.450
checkpoints.

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:38.810
For example, compiler class, you
had to do a checkpoint and

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:42.800
checkpoint will be used more
like subjectivity to grade.

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.510
We don't say how many grade
percent checkpoint.

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:47.630
But if checkpoint has nothing,
then we'll be very harsh

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:48.495
grading later.

00:58:48.495 --> 00:58:49.490
We always provide that.

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:51.960
But still, people don't take
checkpoint that seriously.

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.140
But here we have to try to make
something to make people

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:58.210
get beta seriously, do something
there, and then give

00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:00.350
them the opportunity
to improve.

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:01.490
I think there's a balance
in that somewhere.

00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:03.513
PROFESSOR 2: And I wouldn't
worry about your grade.

00:59:03.513 --> 00:59:05.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.850
AUDIENCE: Maybe like one idea
I was thinking is maybe

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:09.660
there's some component
of improvement

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.490
from beta to final.

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:13.680
Like the proportional
improvement that you made from

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:13.950
beta to final.

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.020
PROFESSOR 2: Oh, that's
a good idea, actually.

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:15.835
That's a good idea.

00:59:15.835 --> 00:59:17.920
Yeah, to say, if you made a--

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.650
Although you want to be
careful about people

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:20.270
sandbagging.

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:21.566
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:21.566 --> 00:59:22.430
PROFESSOR 1: Exactly.

00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.840
AUDIENCE: And then one
last small thing--

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.080
PROFESSOR 2: I want to make
sure we get to everybody.

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:25.350
AUDIENCE: OK, sorry.

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:26.765
PROFESSOR 2: So if you
want to go around to

00:59:26.765 --> 00:59:28.390
the end of the line.

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:30.410
AUDIENCE: That's actually
mostly all of it.

00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:30.770
PROFESSOR 2: OK.

00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:32.340
Thank you.

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:35.130
AUDIENCE: So I've said some of
this on my evaluation, which I

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:35.690
already turned in.

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:38.560
But I'll repeat it for
everyone else.

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.590
AUDIENCE: A couple things.

00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:45.170
One relating to the grading
which you mentioned.

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:47.790
Honestly, I found it incredibly
stressful knowing

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:49.170
that it was competitive
grading.

00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:51.490
Because we had no idea where
the benchmark was.

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:53.290
So it's like, well we've
improved it.

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:54.400
But did we improve it enough?

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.670
Did everyone else not improve
it any more than we did?

00:59:56.670 --> 01:00:00.140
And it was just like having it
be a complete unknown was

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:00.840
pretty stressful.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.300
So I don't know if there's some
way you could do like a--

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.450
like maybe the TAs got some
speed up, and that's the

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:10.260
benchmark to start with
or something.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:13.390
PROFESSOR 1: I guess what we did
this time is basically we

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:16.050
gave the best grade as a
benchmark for the final.

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:19.960
And if you go above that, it's
just bragging rights.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.699
AUDIENCE: I mean, when you're
working on the beta, you have

01:00:21.699 --> 01:00:22.990
no idea what's going on.

01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:24.590
But I did like that.

01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:27.338
Once you know where the
benchmark is, then it's nice

01:00:27.338 --> 01:00:28.000
to know what you're
aiming for.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.530
PROFESSOR 1: So the thing about
that is, the flip side

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:31.940
of that is, we don't want
somebody that a lot of courses

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.770
they say OK, I'm done.

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:36.000
When you go there something, Oh
yeah, I met the thing, OK,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.010
I'm getting a good grade,
OK, I move on.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:40.990
I mean, we want people kind of
to keep pushing in time.

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.260
Because sometimes
the thing is--

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.620
If I have a minute, I'll
tell the story.

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:49.570
There's this guy named Tony
Danzig who basically invented

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.690
the simplex method.

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:54.210
His thing was, he was always
late to class.

01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:56.180
He went to class one
day and there was--

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.420
normally the professor writes
the problems on the board.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.010
So he copied the problems
down and went home.

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.360
And they were really
hard problems.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.200
And so he was like, damn.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.080
I don't know how
to solve this.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.260
And he worked very hard
and solved it.

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:08.310
And wrote a note to the
professor saying I'm sorry

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:10.440
this is late, and put
it on his desk.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.645
And a couple of hours later he
gets this excited professor

01:01:13.645 --> 01:01:15.090
running around trying
to find him.

01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:17.940
Because what the professor had
done is written two unsolved

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.190
problems on the board.

01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:23.890
He came late to the class, he
didn't know that, he had two

01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:25.010
problems, he copied them down.

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:26.904
He worked very hard
and solved it.

01:01:26.904 --> 01:01:27.670
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:29.730
PROFESSOR 1: And so the
professor said divide this up,

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:30.640
you get your pay at the end.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.680
Then there's lots of it.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.850
So this is something
like that.

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:36.160
If you give the thing, if you
know where we are going, for

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.100
some people it will
be a hard climb.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.102
But other people, they will get
there faster, they'll say

01:01:40.102 --> 01:01:40.820
OK, I'm done.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.530
And what we want to do is give
them the ability to kind of

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:46.130
really push to their limits,
not some artificial limit.

01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:48.270
But not to penalize
too much for that.

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:49.630
We try to balance this out.

01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:52.990
So I want everybody to go
to their best limits.

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:54.790
AUDIENCE: I had one other
thing to say.

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:57.490
Have you considered or would
it be possible to make the

01:01:57.490 --> 01:01:59.540
class more than a 12
credit course?

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.030
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:01.610
AUDIENCE: No, seriously.

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:04.280
Since there is so much material
and we keep talking

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.390
about wouldn't it be nice to
add this and add that.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.550
But I don't know about you, but
I spend a lot of time in

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:09.600
this course already.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.320
And I mean, I think it's the
kind of class where you could

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.190
pack 16 or 18 credits worth
of material into it.

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:18.360
PROFESSOR 2: More realistic
would be to have a follow-on.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.720
PROFESSOR 1: Try to make
it as two classes.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.980
PROFESSOR 2: To make a
two-semester sequence.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:30.710
But I think Saman and I still
feel that this, it's like, OK,

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:32.810
that's a new development
effort.

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:33.780
That this class still--

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.550
I think we feel that there's
more than incremental

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:38.770
improvement we can do to make
the class teachable.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:41.240
For example, by introducing
recitations.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.290
And so I think once--

01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:50.160
maybe after next semester,
next fall we can we can--

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.280
But thank you, because I think
that that would be good.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.010
And the whole idea of the
sections is to try

01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:57.540
to reduce your load.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.550
There used to be a thing that
was on all the evaluations

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:02.080
that they no longer do.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.930
And this is actually before
I got to MIT.

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:08.880
They had a measure called
cums per tooling hour.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.220
OK?

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:15.040
So a cum is how many units of
knowledge you're using in

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.650
whatever measure, and tooling
hours, like how hard you work.

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:23.870
And they got rid of it because
they said it was not

01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:24.370
quantitative.

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:26.580
After all, what's a cum?

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:26.870
All right.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:30.520
Well, regardless of the fact
they got rid of that, because

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.140
I think that it actually was a
very useful measure, even if

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:35.910
people are subjective
about it.

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:37.820
That's our goal in the course.

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.120
It's not to make people spend
a lot of time and then have

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.920
learned epsilon.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.540
It's to have them, for the time
they put in, learn as

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:47.940
much as possible.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:50.480
And so I think that we recognize
it's a lot more work

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.070
right now that you folks
are going through.

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.480
We hope that it's
rewarding work.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.400
But we hope we can do even
better in terms of giving

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.520
people the opportunity to
learn these things.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.740
PROFESSOR 1: So we are thinking
about cutting things.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:02.530
We all are thinking about
what to eliminate

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:03.790
even if we add something.

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:05.680
It's very hard because we
think a lot things are

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.250
useful-- important.

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:08.510
But something has to give.

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:09.580
So that's the hard decision.

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.950
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah, we're
thinking of cutting caching

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:12.546
and parallelism.

01:04:12.546 --> 01:04:16.830
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.360
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:18.630
PROFESSOR 2: OK.

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:21.300
We have to hurry because we
gotta be out of the room by 4.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.865
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to say that I agree.

01:04:22.865 --> 01:04:24.970
That I didn't really like the
way the course was graded.

01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:26.540
But I did like the material
in the course a lot.

01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.950
So that was good.

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:30.560
But for one thing, the thing
about the competitive grading

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.860
was that it was way more
stressful than necessary.

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.660
My luck was good because
we had the kind

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:37.350
of benchmark thing.

01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:41.330
It was a reasonable high
performance to attain.

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:45.650
And also I didn't like
the way some of

01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:46.780
the stuff was weighted.

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.900
For example, it didn't really
correspond to how much time I

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.960
spent on it.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.360
The pset was worth like 3% or
4% of the grade and it took

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.970
like hours, I think.

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:56.220
Many, many hours.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.630
That's all.

01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:00.744
PROFESSOR 1: OK, thank you.

01:05:00.744 --> 01:05:02.512
PROFESSOR 2: OK.

01:05:02.512 --> 01:05:06.340
AUDIENCE: There is one thing
that's pretty general about

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:07.790
course six, I guess,
is that they're

01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:09.190
really lenient on prereqs.

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:12.555
Since I've only been at MIT
for like three months.

01:05:12.555 --> 01:05:12.820
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.270
AUDIENCE: So yes,
I'm a freshman.

01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:16.460
PROFESSOR 1: One freshman
in the class.

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:17.205
There you go.

01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:20.960
AUDIENCE: I'm really thankful
that Professor Leiserson and

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.670
Professor Amarasinghe
let me into the

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.540
course without any prereqs.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:28.610
And I like the breadth
of the topics.

01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:32.600
But I think with office hours
we could have gotten a bit

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.090
deeper into them.

01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:38.050
And one suggestion I'd like to
make is that get the nightly

01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:39.300
builds working.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:46.161
It was there for one night for
project one, and that was it.

01:05:46.161 --> 01:05:49.570
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:51.840
AUDIENCE: So I decided
this is my last--

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.080
PROFESSOR 2: Can you
talk in the mic?

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.550
AUDIENCE: So this is my
last term at MIT.

01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:58.600
And I decided to take things
easy by not taking that many

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.729
courses and TAing this course.

01:06:01.729 --> 01:06:07.600
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.230
AUDIENCE: So yeah.

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.183
It would be nice to have
48 unit TA shifts too.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.290
PROFESSOR 2: Thank you.

01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:19.850
AUDIENCE: I just want to say
that this was like--

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:21.010
should I take it?

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:21.730
PROFESSOR 1: Sure.

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:21.950
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:24.330
That this was like
an amazing class.

01:06:24.330 --> 01:06:27.100
I think everyone can agree that
we learned so much that

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.060
is not found in textbooks.

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.750
And what I thought was really
weird is that every little

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:35.480
random thing I've ever read
on the internet related to

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.440
coding, I guess, has come up in
this class in like, useful,

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.610
come up like useful
in this class.

01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:42.550
Like every little bit of outside
knowledge that you

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:46.240
take yourself has appeared
useful in this class later on.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.480
And I thought was really cool.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.850
And related to the hardness that
people are talking about.

01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:54.970
I think everyone came into the
class bracing for the absolute

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:57.610
worst, because we've heard
about you guys.

01:06:57.610 --> 01:07:00.610
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:02.340
AUDIENCE: But, yeah.

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:05.190
I was actually really pleasantly
surprised that

01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:11.400
there were helpful TAs waiting
in the G7 lounge for you, even

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.020
before office hours start.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.580
And so I was actually really
pleasantly surprised by--

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:17.630
just like everyone, the class.

01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:20.960
I feel like everyone who has
survived until this point has

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.690
some sort of magic skill.

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:25.560
That you really learn a lot
by working with them

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.110
on the group projects.

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:29.890
And so I was just
really inspired.

01:07:29.890 --> 01:07:31.610
And I thought it was
a great class.

01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:32.030
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you.

01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:32.886
PROFESSOR 2: Thank you.

01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:34.600
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.850
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.280
I love the class.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.600
I appreciate you Professor
Leiserson, and everything that

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.800
everybody else before me said.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.960
I just wanted to mention
two things I

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.730
don't think were mentioned.

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:51.680
Beta programming, to be honest,
was amazing because

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.230
except the final project,
everything I did was beta

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:56.920
programming in the projects.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.470
And the amount of bugs that we
avoided because of that is

01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.990
ridiculous.

01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:03.990
Especially when we're doing
pointers, and if it doesn't

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:07.400
work, make it a pointer, and all
those philosophies that we

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.500
came up with.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.110
That's the first thing.

01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:14.140
Second thing is, and I've
already mentioned this.

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:17.220
A book or readings for
this class or links.

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:20.859
Because as amazing as the
lecture slides are, a lot of

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:22.979
work done there, so
thanks a lot.

01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:25.370
They're hard to connect
together, especially when

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:26.656
you're trying to figure out
what our cache-oblivious

01:08:26.656 --> 01:08:32.270
algorithm is trying
to do with those.

01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:34.278
So that's pretty much it.

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:38.760
Are you telling me the
stack overflow is as

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.600
much as this course?

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.479
Well, thanks a lot again
for the TAs.

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:46.184
Most of my learning came from
them, to be honest.

01:08:46.184 --> 01:08:48.112
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:48.112 --> 01:08:51.979
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:53.060
AUDIENCE: Hands on learning.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.220
Hands on.

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.140
Thank you.

01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:58.399
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:58.399 --> 01:08:59.020
GUEST SPEAKER: Hi.

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.130
my name is Harold Pokob,
I'm the head of

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:03.930
engineering at Akamai.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:06.700
So I wanted to use the
opportunity to thank all of

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:10.029
you for taking the class.

01:09:10.029 --> 01:09:14.250
Charles was my adviser when I
was at MIT and he told me

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.649
about his plans for the class.

01:09:15.649 --> 01:09:17.229
I thought it was a great idea.

01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:22.910
Getting a lot more hands-on
experience going.

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:26.290
Back when I spent time at MIT,
it was a lot more theory, and

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:30.870
Scheme was one of the main
programming languages.

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:36.029
So in that context I really
like this type of class.

01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:40.359
And I'm glad MIT is investing
in that and

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:41.800
supported from Akamai.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.660
So I'm honored that we
could sponsor it.

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.630
I'm very happy you're here.

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:48.010
There is, I think, refreshments
downstairs in a

01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:48.474
few minutes.

01:09:48.474 --> 01:09:48.760
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:54.560
I'd also like to ask Harold to
say what the topic of his

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.282
master's thesis was.

01:09:56.282 --> 01:09:57.545
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:57.545 --> 01:10:00.340
GUEST SPEAKER: My master's
thesis was cache oblivious

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.600
algorithms.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.360
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.280
PROFESSOR 2: So you have Harold
to thank for one of the

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.770
papers that you read
during the term.

01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:13.480
GUEST SPEAKER: It's nice that
something that I did in

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.740
academia is still used.

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:19.950
Not all now practical business
stuff that I do these days.

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:25.650
Great to have you here, and
I hope to see some of you

01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:26.320
downstairs.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.950
And I've got to actually go
into a meeting at 4:00 for

01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:31.570
half an hour, but I'll be
back down afterwards.

01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:32.250
Thank you.

01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:34.180
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you very much
for sponsoring this event

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.840
and getting all the food.

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.310
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:39.223
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:10:39.223 --> 01:10:41.230
Now we have food.

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:43.330
AUDIENCE: We also have
quizzes here.

01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:44.880
