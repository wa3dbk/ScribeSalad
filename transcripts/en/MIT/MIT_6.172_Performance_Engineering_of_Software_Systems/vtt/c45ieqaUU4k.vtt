00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.900
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.340
We're going to get
started now.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.700
For those of you who don't know
me, I'm Josh Slocum, one

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.240
of your TAs.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.430
And today's lecture is going to
be a primer on ray tracing

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.830
to help you get started
on the final project.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.870
So first, we're going to start
with a little background.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.190
Tell you about ray tracing.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.510
Ray tracing is essentially
a physics simulation.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.070
You simulate the way photons
bounce around and interact

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.670
with materials.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.050
And from that, you generate
an image of a scene.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.599
It's extremely parallel because
you can trace a whole

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.140
bunch of photons bouncing
around at the same time.

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:14.610
And it has a huge capacity
for photorealism.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.550
So like this sample seen here,
you have all sorts of

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.140
reflections and light working in
ways that you don't see in

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.390
a normal rendering program.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.450
The final project, as you know
if you've read the handout, is

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.580
going to be groups of two
or three people each.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.840
And you'll be given a working
ray tracer program.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.370
A very slow one, but
one that works.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.840
And your objective is to make
it run as fast as possible.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.230
You can do pretty much anything
you want with a few

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.680
restrictions we'll
talk about later.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.910
You can make algorithmic
improvements, parallelize it,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.780
change the way the rendering
works slightly.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.640
All sorts of things.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.310
Pretty much anything
you can think of.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.920
The only deliverables for the
final project are the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.260
preliminary report due next
week, in which you'll have to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.130
show us that you've profiled the
project, tell us what hot

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.420
spots you've identified, and
ideas you have for speeding up

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.460
the ray tracer, as well
as any actual work

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.210
you've already done.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.330
The final project comes with two
built-in scenes that can

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.260
be ray traced.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.340
Scene one, this one here,
is rendered much

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.690
faster than scene two.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.730
And you're going to want to
work on that one first.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.470
And then, there's scene two,
which is slightly different.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.780
It has water and one
less sphere.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.750
These are the restrictions
on what you can do

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.650
for the final project.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.350
The purpose of these
restrictions is basically just

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.690
to make sure that everyone's
ray tracer is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.850
doing the same thing.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.360
So you're all working on the
same problem, and you're not

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.620
achieving speed ups by
simplifying out some

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.865
functionality of the program.

00:03:25.982 --> 00:03:28.730
Does anyone have any questions
about the final project

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.980
before I move on?

00:03:35.408 --> 00:03:37.610
All right.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.743
Go ahead.

00:03:38.743 --> 00:03:39.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.195
we're going to do a third scene
similar to the first

00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:44.030
two, right?

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.430
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.630
Yeah.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.230
In order to make sure that
you're following these rules,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.490
we're going to test your ray
tracer on one or more other

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.040
scenes and make sure that
they render properly.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.510
But these are the two scenes
that you will be benchmarked

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.010
on for your performance grade.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.880
All right.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.040
Next, we're going to go over how
ray tracing works and the

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.550
big concepts used in the ray
tracer you'll be working on.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.470
So the basic idea behind the
rendering is you're going to

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.300
construct a geometric model of
the scene you want to render,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.160
and so it will be made
of polygons,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.690
or spheres, or planes.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.490
And then within that model, you
insert a grid of pixels.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.240
They'll form the image you're
going to render.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.110
And then, you just project the
scene onto the grid of pixels,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.090
and you have some image.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.870
The way you do this with ray
tracing is you use a method

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:00.140
called ray casting where you
take some camera and cast rays

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.920
through each pixel
onto the scene.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.810
And then, whatever color object
the ray hits is the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.750
color that that pixel gets
shaded in the scene.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.490
This method of tracing rays is
called backwards ray tracing,

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.710
because you're going in opposite
direction that

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.790
photons go in when you're
actually observing something.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.400
So if this was an actual
scene, you'd have light

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.560
bouncing here and
into you're eye.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.560
Whereas what you're doing is
you're tracing backwards from

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.810
the eye to the object.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.710
Ray casting--

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.930
this image here is
a ray image--

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.480
is very primitive.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.130
It doesn't really
get you much.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.900
So what you can do is you
can improve your physics

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.307
simulation by adding a whole
bunch more things on top of

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:57.640
it, like shadows, and
reflections, and global

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.090
illumination.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.450
All sorts of fun stuff.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.430
So if you want to start
simulating shadows, and

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.830
reflections, and defraction, you
need to start recursively

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.460
casting rays, which is
called ray tracing.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.950
So when your ray bounces off of
an object, you can cast a

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.690
reflection ray at the same
angle mirrored from the

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.600
perpendicular of the object and
see what color object that

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.940
ray hits, and then, shade this
object with that color.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.010
You can also cast a refracted
ray, and use Snell's a lot to

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.520
tell which direction it goes
in and do the same thing.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.530
And then, you can cast a shadow
ray at all the light

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.470
sources in the scene.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.370
And if the shadow ray hits an
object before hitting the

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.570
light source, then you know
that this object is in the

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.420
shade and make it darker.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.430
And obviously, you have to limit
the recursion depth for

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.380
your recursive tracing, because
otherwise, you'll

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.630
never finish rendering.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:18.240
So, first way of improving
lighting is to start using

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.380
direct illumination, which is
you have a light source at the

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.940
top of the scene.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:29.320
And when you hit something like
a wall here, you then

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.900
bounce a ray at the
light source.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.320
And depending on how far this
intersection A is from the

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.350
light source, you shade either
brighter or darker.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.120
So it might be hard to see in
this light, but the wall gets

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.170
darker the further away
it is from the light.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.960
And then, you do shadows the
same way, except at point B

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.530
here, the rate it bounces from
the ground hits this ball.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.400
And so, point B is
in the shade.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.990
Now, you can improve on shadows
by making what's

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.490
called soft shadows.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.160
Soft shadows are shadows
that form a gradient

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.950
from darker to lighter.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.200
They happen when you have a
light source that's not a

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.360
point light.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.510
So if you look at the shadows
around you in the room, you'll

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.420
see there are gradients,
not just a

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.540
solid block of darkness.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.660
And the way you achieve that
is when you get an

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:29.430
intersection, when your ray
intersects a point, you cast

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.289
multiple shadow rays at
different points along the

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.390
light source.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.250
And depending on how many of
these rays hit something

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:41.039
before hitting the light
source, you shade some

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:45.570
proportion of the light being
casted, or the light coming

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.980
from this light source.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.890
So you can see point D here,
none of the rays hit the light

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.480
source, and so, it's in
a very dark area.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.300
Whereas point C, one of the rays
hits the light source,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.130
and so it's in a slightly
brighter area.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.620
And then reflection and
refraction work very similarly

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.880
to shadows, except instead of
bouncing from here to the

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.430
light source, you bounce off
this metal ball at the angle

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.680
of reflection.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.650
And you bounce through this
glass ball using the angle of

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.260
refraction.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.290
You can calculate using
Snell's law.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.590
Any questions before
we move on?

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:43.920
All right.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.320
So as you can see pretty clearly
in this image, there's

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.400
still some problems.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.620
The ceiling is completely
black.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.170
Shadows are mostly black.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.100
And there's no light being
transmitted through this glass

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.810
ball either into the
shadow here.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.730
So there's definitely some
improvements we can make on

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.310
our physics simulation.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.100
The first thing we're going to
look at is called global

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.410
illumination, which is pretty
much any sort of illumination

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.650
that doesn't come directly
from light sources.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:24.090
Now the reason this sort of
illumination is important is

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:29.240
that there's actually a lot of
light that gets bounced around

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.360
the room that doesn't
come directly

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.780
from the light source.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.945
Like that white wall, if I shine
this laser pointer at

00:10:36.945 --> 00:10:38.730
it, as you can see, there's
still a lot of light

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.580
bouncing off of it.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.330
It's not all being absorbed.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:51.590
So what you can do is you can
take your ray intersection,

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.460
and you can use what's called
the Monte Carlo method, which

00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:00.330
is you take a whole bunch of
random samples and interpolate

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:05.020
those samples to get some value
that approximates what

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.550
the illuminant should be here.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.950
The problem with that, though,
is that when you trace

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.430
backwards, you get this
exponential explosion of

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.950
recursively cast rays.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.940
And you have no guarantee that
any of these paths will ever

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.860
get to this light source.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:29.130
So what you have to do is trace
forwards, so you start

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.500
at the light source, and you
cast photons in random

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:38.040
directions and let them bounce
all around the scene until

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.750
they get absorbed.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.600
Now, when a photon bounces, a
bunch of light gets absorbed.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.650
But not all the light.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:51.090
And so, the rest of the light
keeps reflecting.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.090
And depending on the kind of
material, different amounts

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.700
and colors of light
will be reflected.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.670
So as you can see, this
ray here bounces

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.060
off the orange wall.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.270
And so, orange light
gets reflected.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.380
This ray bounces off
the blue wall.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.280
And so, blue light
gets reflected.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.330
And this ray bounces off this
metal ball, and so it gets

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.600
completely reflected up
towards the ceiling.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.880
So if you remember each bounce
in something called a photon

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.190
map, then later, you can come
back and say, oh, there's so

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.800
many photons in this area.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.560
And that's what these
yellow circles are.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.136
So the illuminance is going
to be approximately this.

00:12:36.136 --> 00:12:40.870
The problem with that is unless
you're simulating an

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.090
extremely large number of
photons, you'll have an uneven

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.060
distribution.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.650
So what you can do is you can
hybridize forwards ray tracing

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.970
and the Monte Carlo method.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.400
So you construct your photon
map, which is represented in

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.170
this image by all the red dots
scattered everywhere.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.150
And then you do backwards
ray tracing.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:08.030
Then when you reach a point, you
randomly sample different

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.780
reflection rays and average
their illuminance to get the

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.800
illuminance at this point.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.290
So you have blue illuminance
from the wall here.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.720
And then light gray from here
and darker gray from here.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.430
And the result is this sort of
pale blue, which you can't

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.880
really see in the image because
the light's bad.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.060
Yeah, so backwards trace,
randomly sample, illumination.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.054
And any questions
before we go on?

00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:01.260
So it turns out even with
building a photon map and then

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.300
randomly sampling the photon
map, calculating the

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.120
irradiance can still
be very expensive.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.390
So what we've implemented to
speed that up is what's called

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.360
an irradiance cache.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.550
And the way the irradiance
cache works is there are

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:23.030
certain areas on objects that
will have pretty much the same

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.840
irradiance.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.360
It's pretty much the same
irradiance levels.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.300
So you can interpolate
from nearby points.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.390
So what we do with the
irradiance cache is as the

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:40.670
scene is rendering, if there
is a cache miss, then we

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:45.050
calculate the irradiance for
some pixel which corresponds

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.290
to a point in the scene.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.840
And then, if we then trace a
ray very near to that same

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.880
pixel, you can then interpolate
from nearby cached

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:03.000
irradiances and get something
that looks right.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.800
So if you take a look at this
image, where the green dots

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:14.940
represent cache misses on these
big planer objects here.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.150
There's very few cache misses.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.650
And it's almost entirely
cache hits.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:26.850
Whereas at the interface between
different objects, the

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:31.160
cache misses become
much more common.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.650
But overall, the number of
irradiance calculations is

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.900
greatly reduced.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.400
And then, the third kind of
illumination that we implement

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.270
is called caustics.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:53.220
Caustics are just light being
lensed into patterns of

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:58.520
brighter and darker spaces, such
as you get from a light

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.340
pointing towards a glass ball.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.310
Or if you ever see the sort of
wavy pattern on the bottom of

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.720
a pool, that's also
from caustics.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.100
Caustics are also implemented
with the photon map, except

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.660
it's created slightly
differently.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.770
Instead of bouncing photons
everywhere, photons are

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.070
absorbed as soon as they
hit a diffuse object.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:24.840
So a photon might bounce off of
this metal sphere and then

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.010
hit the wall, and it will
be immediately absorbed.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.330
Whereas if it hits this sphere,
it'll bounce, and

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.000
bounce, and then be absorbed.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.240
So the objective of caustics
is to trace how photons are

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.750
grouped based on the optical
properties of

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.000
materials in the scene.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:54.075
And then, caustics are rendered
pretty simply.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:03.330
Because there's much fewer
photons than in the photon map

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.920
for global illumination, you
don't need to use an

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.440
irradiance cache.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.410
So you simply trace a ray to
a point and then sample the

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.359
number of photons nearby.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.700
And you end up with something
like this if you just do

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.950
caustics shading.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:29.810
So then at the end, you take
your direct illumination, and

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:33.380
then add it to caustics, and
then add it to global

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.800
illumination.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.250
And you get something that
looks like this.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.060
Any questions before we go
to the code overview?

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.610
Go ahead.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:53.000
AUDIENCE: Do we weight
them equally?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.110
PROFESSOR: So the
question was, do

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.830
we weight them equally?

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.150
And the answer is yes.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.470
And you just sum
them together.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:13.560
Ideally, you were clever and
constructed your ray tracer so

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.510
that they should be weighted
equally, because there's

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.080
weighting done internally,
basically.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.630
So next, we're going to do a
quick overview of the code

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.610
that will be in your
repositories just get you

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.055
started and help you understand
how it works.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.200
First, we're going to start by
explaining some of the classes

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.030
you'll find.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:57.580
First is SceneObject, which is
the parent class for all of

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.530
the objects that will be used to
construct the scenes you'll

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.030
be rendering.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.900
Every scene object has a ray
intersection method that's

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.830
called whenever you
trace a ray.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:14.100
And it'll return where the ray

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:19.700
intersection is and the object.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.310
And SceneObject is inherited by
these objects here, which

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:31.120
all of the objects will
inherit from.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.700
Then we've got the Raytracer
class, which

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.960
contains the main method.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.920
So it starts the program.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.770
And it also contains methods for
constructing the scene and

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.760
then rendering the
scene once you've

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.690
constructed the scene first.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:58.150
We have the LightSource class,
which is a base class for any

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.450
light sources.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:04.330
In our ray tracer, the only
subclass is square photon

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:10.660
light, which is this light at
the top of the scene here.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.520
And what that does, or what the
light class does, is it

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.990
contains methods for
constructing the photon maps

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:24.900
and getting illumination from
either global, or caustic, or

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.890
direct sources.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:32.720
And then there's also the
iCache class, which

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.610
essentially just implements
the iCache for you.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.070
Any questions?

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.530
So basic execution overview.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.770
You have the main method
for Raytracer.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.910
Parses the command line.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.970
Constructs the scene.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.590
And the scene is just a
command line switch.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.750
So if you say S1, it'll
construct scene one.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.780
If you say S2, it'll construct
scene two.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.680
Then for each light source, it
tells the light source to make

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.800
photon maps for the global
and caustic illumination.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.058
GUEST SPEAKER: I should mention
that we actually moved

00:21:19.058 --> 00:21:22.502
the main functionality
into [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:22.502 --> 00:21:23.486
so you can replace the data.

00:21:23.486 --> 00:21:25.454
You don't have to touch that.

00:21:25.454 --> 00:21:28.160
It just constructs the scene,
so that we can then add a

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.390
scene [INAUDIBLE] from that.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.100
So you shouldn't need
to do that.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.670
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:37.020
So that's changed then.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.890
Then, main calls the render
function of Raytracer.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.800
What the render function
does--

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.760
excuse me, method does--

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.720
is it casts a ray for each
pixel in the scene you're

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:55.440
going to render, finds the
nearest intersection, and then

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.760
computes the shading at that
intersection by recursively

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.730
bouncing rays and [? painting ?]
the illuminance

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:03.980
cache for illumination.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.720
And that's basically what
the Raytracer does.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.900
It's pretty simple.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.740
So we're also going to quickly
go over how the light source

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.810
traces photons for direct
and global illumination.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:30.320
The difference is kind of
settled, but pretty important.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:36.160
With global illumination, you
want some total number of

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.710
photons to be put in the map.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:45.380
And you put a photon in the
map whenever it hits some

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.630
diffuse surface.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.040
And then, that photon then
continues bouncing around

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.290
until it's absorbed.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.660
For caustic illumination,
it's pretty similar.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.640
You have some set number
of photons you want to

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.400
get into the map.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.410
You cast a ray in some
random direction.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:15.960
And then, the ray intersects
with a diffuse material.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.990
You store the intersection
in the photon map.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.850
And then you break.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.811
You don't keep bouncing
the photons around.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:29.500
So that's basically it for
the code overview.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.070
This slide has some resources
that you can use if you want

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.770
to learn more about
ray tracing.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.080
Some of these will explain
concepts that we haven't

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.840
implemented.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.710
They're an interesting read,
but not needed if you don't

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.210
want to read them.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:57.260
And also, there's no standard
way of doing global

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.090
illumination or direct
illumination.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:03.750
So you may come across resources
that do things

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.320
slightly different than our
reference implementation.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.740
That doesn't mean either
one is wrong.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.480
But you should be aware that
there will almost certainly be

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.730
differences.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.338
Does anyone have
any questions?

00:24:28.338 --> 00:24:28.792
Go ahead.

00:24:28.792 --> 00:24:30.154
AUDIENCE: So we can use one
of those alternatives?

00:24:30.154 --> 00:24:32.190
PROFESSOR: Can you say
that louder please?

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.820
AUDIENCE: So we can use one
of those alternatives?

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.290
PROFESSOR: These aren't
implementations.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.920
They're descriptions of
how ray tracing works.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:48.920
You should not change your
code to work in this way.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.040
These are just to help with
clarification if you want to

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.620
learn more about what's being
done in the code.

00:24:57.796 --> 00:24:58.282
Go ahead.

00:24:58.282 --> 00:24:59.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:06.544
what specifically are we allowed
to change for the

00:25:06.544 --> 00:25:08.280
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.230
PROFESSOR: So what
specifically are

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.003
you allowed to change?

00:25:11.003 --> 00:25:13.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.530
Which ever one's smaller
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.280
PROFESSOR: Anything not
prohibited by these rules,

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:28.390
which are paraphrased from the
project handout, you can do.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.650
So basically, as long as you're
still performing the

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:36.756
same essential calculations,
you're fine.

00:25:36.756 --> 00:25:37.254
Hmm?

00:25:37.254 --> 00:25:40.574
GUEST SPEAKER: I would say the
criteria for correctness is to

00:25:40.574 --> 00:25:42.860
look at the images, and
say that they look

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.160
more or less the same.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.060
They don't give you a pixel
by pixel accurate.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:51.020
This isn't a graphics class
that actually does that.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:56.000
This should be almost
like a [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.180
PROFESSOR: They should visually
look the same.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:12.160
If you find some approximation
that looks almost the same and

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.880
runs 100 times faster,
go for it.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.570
You can't say, for example,
simplify your ray tracer

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.720
though by saying, OK, we're
only going to be able to

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.380
render these two scenes,
but we'll be able to

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.630
do it really fast.
