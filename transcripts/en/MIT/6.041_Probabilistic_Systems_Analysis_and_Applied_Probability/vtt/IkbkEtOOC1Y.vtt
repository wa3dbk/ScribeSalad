00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.020
PROFESSOR: So we're going to
start now with a new chapter.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.720
We're going to talk about
Markov processes.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.390
The good news is that this is
a subject that is a lot more

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.040
intuitive and simple in many
ways than, let's say, the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.410
Poisson processes.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.590
So hopefully this will
be enjoyable.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.680
So Markov processes
is, a general

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.420
class of random processes.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.610
In some sense, it's more
elaborate than the Bernoulli

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.780
and Poisson processes, because
now we're going to have

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.820
dependencies between difference
times, instead of

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.960
having memoryless processes.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.100
So the basic idea is
the following.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.060
In physics, for example, you
write down equations for how a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.240
system evolves that has
the general form.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.780
The new state of a system one
second later is some function

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.970
of old state.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.020
So Newton's equations and all
that in physics allow you to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.490
write equations of this kind.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.260
And so if that a particle is
moving at a certain velocity

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.790
and it's at some location, you
can predict when it's going to

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.510
be a little later.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.760
Markov processes have the same
flavor, except that there's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.810
also some randomness thrown
inside the equation.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.720
So that's what Markov process
essentially is.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.820
It describes the evolution of
the system, or some variables,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.450
but in the presence of some
noise so that the motion

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.110
itself is a bit random.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.880
So this is a pretty
general framework.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.850
So pretty much any useful or
interesting random process

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.280
that you can think about, you
can always described it as a

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.050
Markov process if you
define properly the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.720
notion of the state.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.960
So what we're going to do is
we're going to introduce the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.630
class of Markov processes by,
example, by talking about the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.900
checkout counter in
a supermarket.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.650
Then we're going to abstract
from our example so that we

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.580
get a more general definition.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.410
And then we're going to do a
few things, such as how to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.250
predict what's going to happen
n time steps later, if we

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.210
start at the particular state.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.460
And then talk a little bit
about some structural

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.640
properties of Markov processes
or Markov chains.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.050
So here's our example.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.670
You go to the checkout counter
at the supermarket, and you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.460
stand there and watch the
customers who come.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.090
So customers come, they get in
queue, and customers get

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.250
served one at a time.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.730
So the discussion is going to
be in terms of supermarket

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.950
checkout counters, but the
same story applies to any

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.420
service system.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.470
You may have a server, jobs
arrive to that server, they

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.580
get put into the queue, and
the server processes those

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.750
jobs one at a time.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.480
Now to make a probabilistic
model, we need to make some

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.240
assumption about the customer
arrivals and the customer

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.290
departures.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.150
And we want to keep things
as simple as

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.160
possible to get started.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.220
So let's assume that customers
arrive according to a

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.230
Bernoulli process with
some parameter b.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.380
So essentially, that's the same
as the assumption that

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.590
the time between consecutive
customer arrivals is a

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.280
geometric random variable
with parameter b.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.740
Another way of thinking about
the arrival process--

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.260
that's not how it happens, but
it's helpful, mathematically,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.330
is to think of someone who's
flipping a coin with bias

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.510
equal to b.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.750
And whenever the coin
lands heads,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.050
then a customer arrives.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.960
So it's as if there's a coin
flip being done by nature that

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.580
decides the arrivals
of the customers.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.110
So we know that coin flipping
to determine the customer

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.550
arrivals is the same as having
geometric inter-arrival times.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.200
We know that from our study
of the Bernoulli process.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.630
OK.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.790
And now how about the customer
service times.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.610
We're going to assume that--

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.660
OK.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.120
If there is no customer in
queue, no one being served,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.040
then of course, no
one is going to

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.530
depart from the queue.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.270
But if there a customer in
queue, then that customer

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.200
starts being served, and is
going to be served for a

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.870
random amount of time.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.820
And we make the assumption that
the time it takes for the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.470
clerk to serve the customer has
a geometric distribution

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.270
with some known parameter q.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.630
So the time it takes to serve a
customer is random, because

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.060
it's random how many items they
got in their cart, and

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.990
how many coupons they have
to unload and so on.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.730
So it's random.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.230
In the real world, it has some
probability distribution.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.240
Let's not care exactly about
what it would be in the real

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.830
world, but as a modeling
approximation or just to get

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.200
started, let's pretend that
customer service time are well

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.150
described by a geometric
distribution,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.500
with a parameter q.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.010
An equivalent way of thinking
about the customer service,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.640
mathematically, would
be, again, in

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.350
terms of coin flipping.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.490
That is, the clerk has a coin
with a bias, and at each time

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.620
slot the clerk flips the coin.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.470
With probability q,
service is over.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.100
With probability 1-q, you
continue the service process.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.370
An assumption that we're going
to make is that the coin flips

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.220
that happen here to determine
the arrivals, they're all

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.860
independent of each other.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.610
The coin flips that determine
the end of service are also

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.930
independent from each other.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.160
But also the coin flips involved
here are independent

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.740
from the coin flips that
happened there.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.190
So how arrivals happen is
independent with what happens

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.490
at the service process.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.330
OK.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.240
So suppose now you
want to answer a

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.200
question such as the following.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.830
The time is 7:00 PM.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.640
What's the probability that the
customer will be departing

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.990
at this particular time?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.870
Well, you say, it depends.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.740
If the queue is empty at that
time, then you're certain that

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.200
you're not going to have
a customer departure.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.970
But if the queue is not empty,
then there is probability q

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.880
that a departure will
happen at that time.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.230
So the answer to a question like
this has something to do

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.460
with the state of the
system at that time.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.770
It depends what the queue is.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.770
And if I ask you, will the
queue be empty at 7:10?

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.870
Well, the answer to that
question depends on whether at

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.630
7 o'clock whether the queue
was huge or not.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.770
So knowing something about the
state of the queue right now

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.480
gives me relevant information
about what may

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.790
happen in the future.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.770
So what is the state
of the system?

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.080
Therefore we're brought to
start using this term.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.720
So the state basically
corresponds to

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.980
anything that's relevant.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.900
Anything that's happening
right now that's kind of

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.120
relevant to what may happen
in the future.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.360
Knowing the size of the queue
right now, is useful

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.700
information for me to make
predictions about what may

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.100
happen 2 minutes
later from now.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.510
So in this particular example,
a reasonable choice for the

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.410
state is to just count
how many customers

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.950
we have in the queue.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.330
And let's assume that our
supermarket building is not

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.230
too big, so it can only
hold 10 people.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.480
So we're going to limit
the states.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.230
Instead of going from 0 to
infinity, we're going to

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.580
truncate our model at ten.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.240
So we have 11 possible states,
corresponding to 0 customers

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.620
in queue, 1 customer in queue,
2 customers, and so on, all

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.190
the way up to 10.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.600
So these are the different
possible states of the system,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.340
assuming that the store cannot
handle more than 10 customers.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.360
So this is the first step, to
write down the set of possible

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.950
states for our system.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.820
Then the next thing to do is
to start describing the

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.570
possible transitions
between the states.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.750
At any given time step,
what are the

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.030
things that can happen?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.180
We can have a customer
arrival, which

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.830
moves the state 1 higher.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.560
We can have a customer
departure, which moves the

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.320
state 1 lower.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.080
There's a possibility that
nothing happens, in which case

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.710
the state stays the same.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.470
And there's also the possibility
of having

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.800
simultaneously an arrival and a
departure, in which case the

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.700
state again stays the same.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.290
So let's write some
representative probabilities.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.630
If we have 2 customers, the
probability that during this

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.800
step we go down, this is the
probability that we have a

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.940
service completion, but to
no customer arrival.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.060
So this is the probability
associated with this

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.730
transition.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:37.280
The other possibility is that
there's a customer arrival,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.910
which happens with probability
p, and we do not have a

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.120
customer departure, and so the
probability of that particular

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.690
transition is this number.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.960
And then finally, the
probability that we stay in

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.530
the same state, this can happen
in 2 possible ways.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:00.360
One way is that we have an
arrival and a departure

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.930
simultaneously.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.690
And the other possibility is
that we have no arrival and no

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.670
departure, so that the
state stays the same.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.870
So these transition
probabilities would be the

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.420
same starting from any other
states, state 3, or

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.050
state 9, and so on.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.010
Transition probabilities become
a little different at

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.750
the borders, at the boundaries
of this diagram, because if

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.350
you're in a state 0, then you
cannot have any customer

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.130
departures.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.940
There's no one to be served, but
there is a probability p

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.040
that the customer arrives, in
which case the number of

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.110
customers in the system
goes to 1.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.150
Then probability 1-p,
nothing happens.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:46.020
Similarly with departures, if
the system is full, there's no

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.780
room for another arrival.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.300
But we may have a departure that
happens with probability

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:55.250
q, and nothing happens
with probability 1-q.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:00.260
So this is the full transition
diagram annotated with

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.150
transition probabilities.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.970
And this is a complete
description of a discrete

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.000
time, finite state
Markov chain.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.010
So this is a complete
probabilistic model.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.520
Once you have all of these
pieces of information, you can

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.370
start calculating things, and
trying to predict what's going

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.140
to happen in the future.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.460
Now let us abstract from this
example and come up with a

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.530
more general definition.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:37.010
So we have this concept of the
state which describes the

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.560
current situation in the system
that we're looking at.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.440
The current state is random, so
we're going to think of it

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:50.570
as a random variable Xn is the
state, and transitions after

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.560
the system started operating.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.450
So the system starts operating
at some initial state X0, and

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:00.190
after n transitions, it
moves to state Xn.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.020
Now we have a set of
possible states.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.930
State 1 state 2, state
3, and in general,

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.680
state i and state j.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.870
To keep things simple, we
assume that the set of

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.700
possible states is
a finite set.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.350
As you can imagine, we can
have systems in which the

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.160
state space is going
to be infinite.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.240
It could be discrete,
or continuous.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.870
But all that is more difficult
and more complicated.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.110
It makes sense to start from the
simplest possible setting

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.770
where we just deal with the
finite state space.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:39.430
And time is discrete, so we can
think of this state in the

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.660
beginning, after 1 transition,
2 transitions, and so on.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.600
So we're in discrete time and we
have finite in many states.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.900
So the system starts somewhere,
and at every time

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.506
step, the state is,
let's say, here.

00:12:54.506 --> 00:12:59.850
A whistle blows, and the state
jumps to a random next state.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:05.120
So it may move here, or it may
move there, or it may move

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.510
here, or it might stay
in the place.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.400
So one possible transition is
the transition before you

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.880
jump, and just land
in the same place

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.760
where you started from.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.410
Now we want to describe the
statistics of these

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.490
transitions.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.760
If I am at that state, how
likely is it to that, next

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.885
time, I'm going to find
myself at that state?

00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:30.390
Well, we describe the statistics
of this transition

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:35.730
by writing down a transition
probability, the transition

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:41.420
probability of going from
state 3 to state 1.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.180
So this transition probability
is to be thought of as a

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.960
conditional probability.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.620
Given that right now I am
at state i what is the

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:55.650
probability that next time
I find myself at state j?

00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:00.100
So given that right now I am
at state 3, P31 is the

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.090
probability that the next
time I'm going to find

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.740
myself at state 1.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.340
Similarly here, we would have
a probability P3i, which is

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.710
the probability that given that
right now I'm at state 3,

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:17.680
next time I'm going to find
myself at state i.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.390
Now one can write such
conditional probabilities down

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.110
in principle, but we
need to make--

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.040
so you might think of this as a
definition here, but we need

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.050
to make one additional big
assumption, and this is the

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.360
assumption that to
make a process

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.540
to be a Markov process.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.210
This is the so-called
Markov property, and

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.770
here's what it says.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.760
Let me describe it first
in words here.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.230
Every time that I find myself
at state 3, the probability

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.380
that next time I'm going to find
myself at state 1 is this

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.890
particular number, no matter
how I got there.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.870
That is, this transition
probability is not affected by

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.560
the past of the process.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.930
It doesn't care about what
path I used to find

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.150
myself at state 3.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.060
Mathematically, it means
the following.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.700
You have this transition
probability that from state i

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.480
jump to state j.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.530
Suppose that I gave you some
additional information, that I

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.780
told you everything else that
happened in the past of the

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.410
process, everything that
happened, how did you

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.570
get to state i?

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.550
The assumption we're making is
that this information about

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.940
the past has no bearing in
making predictions about the

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.890
future, as long as you know
where you are right now.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.300
So if I tell you, right now, you
are at state i, and by the

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.010
way, you got there by following
a particular path,

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.940
you can ignore the extra
information of the particular

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.410
path that you followed.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.610
You only take into account
where you are right now.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.800
So every time you find yourself
at that state, no

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.050
matter how you got there, you
will find yourself next time

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.980
at state 1 with probability
P31.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.740
So the past has no bearing into
the future, as long as

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.600
you know where you are
sitting right now.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:27.390
For this property to happen, you
need to choose your state

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.650
carefully in the right way.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.950
In that sense, the states
needs to include any

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.310
information that's relevant
about the

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.280
future of the system.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.580
Anything that's not in the state
is not going to play a

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.340
role, but the state needs to
have all the information

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.580
that's relevant in determining
what kind of transitions are

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.080
going to happen next.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.690
So to take an example, before
you go to Markov process, just

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.660
from the deterministic world,
if you have a ball that's

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.630
flying up in the air, and you
want to make predictions about

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.730
the future.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.369
If I tell you that the state of
the ball is the position of

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:11.579
the ball at the particular time,
is that enough for you

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:15.240
to make predictions where the
ball is going to go next?

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:15.700
No.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.460
You need to know both the
position and the velocity.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.710
If you know position and
velocity, you can make

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.490
predictions about the future.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:27.520
So the state of a ball that's
flying is position together

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.450
with velocity.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.430
If you were to just take
position, that would not be

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.290
enough information, because if
I tell you current position,

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.640
and then I tell you past
position, you could use the

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.120
information from the past
position to complete the

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.930
trajectory and to make
the prediction.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.870
So information from the past
is useful if you don't know

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:48.580
the velocity.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.650
But if both position and
velocity, you don't care how

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.220
you got there, or what
time you started.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.660
From position and velocity, you
can make predictions about

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.800
the future.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.330
So there's a certain art, or a
certain element of thinking, a

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.400
non-mechanical aspect into
problems of this kind, to

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.840
figure out which is the
right state variable.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.670
When you define the state of
your system, you need to

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:19.870
define it in such a way that
includes all information that

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.735
has been accumulated that has
some relevance for the future.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.250
So the general process for
coming up with a Markov model

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.970
is to first make this big
decision of what your state

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.480
variable is going to be.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.570
Then you write down if it
may be a picture of

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.150
the different states.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.720
Then you identify the possible
transitions.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.810
So sometimes the diagram that
you're going to have will not

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.970
include all the possible arcs.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.040
You would only show those arcs
that correspond to transitions

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.770
that are possible.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.850
For example, in the supermarket
example, we did

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.660
not have a transition from state
2 to state 5, because

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.590
that cannot happen.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.360
You can only have 1 arrival
at any time.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.330
So in the diagram, we only
showed the possible

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.280
transitions.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.200
And for each of the possible
transitions, then you work

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.060
with the description of the
model to figure out the

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.380
correct transition
probability.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.090
So you got the diagram by
writing down transition

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.340
probabilities.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:30.930
OK, so suppose you got
your Markov model.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.900
What will you do with it?

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.900
Well, what do we need
models for?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.580
We need models in order to
make predictions, to make

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.890
probabilistic predictions.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.750
So for example, I tell you that
the process started in

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.790
that state.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.070
You let it run for some time.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.980
Where do you think it's going to
be 10 time steps from now?

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.540
That's a question that you
might want to answer.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.660
Since the process is random,
there's no way for you to tell

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.610
me exactly where it's
going to be.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.480
But maybe you can give
me probabilities.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.880
You can tell me, with so
much probability, the

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.240
state would be there.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.080
With so much probability,
the state would be

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.680
there, and so on.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.010
So our first exercise is to
calculate those probabilities

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:16.720
about what may happen to the
process a number of steps in

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.790
the future.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.800
It's handy to have some
notation in here.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.700
So somebody tells us that this
process starts at the

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.560
particular state i.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.800
We let the process run
for n transitions.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.190
It may land at some state j, but
that state j at which it's

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.060
going to land is going
to be random.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.440
So we want to give
probabilities.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.750
Tell me, with what probability
the state, n times steps

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:49.100
later, is going to be that
particular state j?

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.830
The shorthand notation is to use
this symbol here for the

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.730
n-step transition probabilities
that you find

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:02.610
yourself at state j given that
you started at state i.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.930
So the way these two indices are
ordered, the way to think

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.130
about them is that from
i, you go to j.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.040
So the probability that from
i you go to j if you have n

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.210
steps in front of you.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.890
Some of these transition
probabilities are, of course

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.190
easy to write.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:29.530
For example, in 0 transitions,
you're going to be exactly

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:30.860
where you started.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:35.590
So this probability is going to
be equal to 1 if i is equal

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:40.870
to j, And 0 if i is
different than j.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.360
That's an easy one
to write down.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.250
If you have only 1 transition,
what's the probability that 1

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.740
step later you find yourself
in state j given that you

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.310
started at state i?

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.830
What is this?

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.450
These are just the ordinary
1-step transition

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.180
probabilities that we are given
in the description of

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.780
the problem.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.965
So by definition, the 1-step
transition probabilities are

00:22:08.965 --> 00:22:10.215
of this form.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.980
This equality is correct just
because of the way that we

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.680
defined those two quantities.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.670
Now we want to say something
about the n-step transition

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.760
probabilities when n
is a bigger number.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:31.700
OK.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.450
So here, we're going to use the
total probability theorem.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.750
So we're going to condition in
two different scenarios, and

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.580
break up the calculation of this
quantity, by considering

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.850
the different ways that
this event can happen.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.110
So what is the event
of interest?

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.040
The event of interest
is the following.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.070
At time 0 we start i.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.310
We are interested in landing
at time n at the

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:59.640
particular state j.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.860
Now this event can happen in
several different ways, in

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.120
lots of different ways.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.630
But let us group them
into subgroups.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.640
One group, or one sort of
scenario, is the following.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.200
During the first n-1 time steps,
things happen, and

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.750
somehow you end up at state 1.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:24.180
And then from state 1, in the
next time step you make a

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.160
transition to state j.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.770
This particular arc here
actually corresponds to lots

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.600
and lots of different possible
scenarios, or different spots,

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.110
or different transitions.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:43.770
In n-1 time steps, there's lots
of possible ways by which

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.010
you could end up at state 1.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.650
Different paths through
the state space.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.630
But all of them together
collectively have a

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:55.360
probability, which is the
(n-1)-step transition

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:02.200
probability, that from state
i, you end up at state 1

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.960
And then there's other
possible scenarios.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.120
Perhaps in the first n-1 time
steps, you follow the

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.370
trajectory that took
you at state m.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:17.430
And then from state m, you did
this transition, and you ended

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.980
up at state j.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.580
So this diagram breaks up
the set of all possible

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.360
trajectories from i to j into
different collections, where

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.340
each collection has to do with
which one happens to be the

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:37.070
state just before the last time
step, just before time n.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.040
And we're going to condition
on the state at time n-1.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:48.180
So the total probability of
ending up at state j is the

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.090
sum of the probabilities of
the different scenarios --

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.380
the different ways that you
can get to state j.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:00.650
If we look at that type of
scenario, what's the

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.030
probability of that scenario
happening?

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:08.290
With probability Ri1(n-1),
I find myself at

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.810
state 1 at time n-1.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:15.000
This is just by the definition
of these multi-step transition

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.160
probabilities.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.990
This is the number
of transitions.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.690
The probability that from state
i, I end up at state 1.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:27.130
And then given that I found
myself at state 1, with

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.350
probability P1j, that's the
transition probability, next

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.710
time I'm going to find
myself at state j.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:39.610
So the product of these two is
the total probability of my

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.500
getting from state i to
state j through state

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.340
1 at the time before.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:53.160
Now where exactly did we use
the Markov assumption here?

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.750
No matter which particular path
we used to get from i to

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.660
state 1, the probability that
next I'm going to make this

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.510
transition is that
same number, P1j.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.170
So that number does not depend
on the particular path that I

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.240
followed in order
to get there.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.090
If we didn't have the Markov
assumption, we should have

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.610
considered all possible
individual trajectories here,

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.360
and then we would need to use
the transition probability

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.840
that corresponds to that
particular trajectory.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.130
But because of the Markov
assumption, the only thing

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.930
that matters is that right
now we are at state 1.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.100
It does not matter
how we got there.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.240
So now once you see this
scenario, then this scenario,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.160
and that scenario, and you add
the probabilities of these

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.820
different scenarios, you end
up with this formula here,

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.540
which is a recursion.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.810
It tells us that once you have
computed the (n-1)-step

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:53.830
transition probabilities, then
you can compute also the

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.990
n-step transition
probabilities.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:01.390
This is a recursion that you
execute or you run for all i's

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.320
and j's simultaneously.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.180
That is fixed.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:08.280
And for a particular n, you
calculate this quantity for

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.620
all possible i's, j's, k's.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.710
You have all of those
quantities, and then you use

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.730
this equation to find those
numbers again for all the

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.340
possible i's and j's.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:26.620
Now this is formula which is
always true, and there's a big

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.810
idea behind the formula.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.050
And now there's variations of
this formula, depending on

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.610
whether you're interested
in something

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.200
that's slightly different.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:42.070
So for example, if you were to
have a random initial state,

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.850
somebody gives you the
probability distribution of

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.300
the initial state, so you're
told that with probability

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.250
such and such, you're going
to start at state 1.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.760
With that probability, you're
going to start at

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.200
state 2, and so on.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.560
And you want to find the
probability at the time n you

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.530
find yourself at state j.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.880
Well again, total probability
theorem, you condition on the

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.120
initial state.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.430
With this probability you find
yourself at that particular

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.570
initial state, and given that
this is your initial state,

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.840
this is the probability that
n time steps later you find

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.980
yourself at state j.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:20.080
Now building again on the same
idea, you can run every

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.330
recursion of this kind
by conditioning

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.950
at different times.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.200
So here's a variation.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.520
You start at state i.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.240
After 1 time step, you find
yourself at state 1, with

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.630
probability pi1, and you find
yourself at state m with

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.930
probability Pim.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:49.250
And once that happens, then
you're going to follow some

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.070
trajectories.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.390
And there is a possibility that
you're going to end up at

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:58.285
state j after n-1 time steps.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.160
This scenario can happen
in many possible ways.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.130
There's lots of possible paths
from state 1 to state j.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:12.680
There's many paths from
state 1 to state j.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.940
What is the collective
probability of all these

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.190
transitions?

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.150
This is the event that, starting
from state 1, I end

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:27.560
up at state j in
n-1 time steps.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:34.240
So this one has here probability
R1j of n-1.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.980
And similarly down here.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.350
And then by using the same way
of thinking as before, we get

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:48.650
the formula that Rij(n) is the
sum over all k's of Pik, and

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:49.940
then the Rkj(n-1).

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.050
So this formula looks almost the
same as this one, but it's

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.810
actually different.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:05.570
The indices and the way things
work out are a bit different,

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.500
but the basic idea
is the same.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.940
Here we use the total
probability theory by

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.770
conditioning on the state just
1 step before the end of our

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:17.020
time horizon.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.260
Here we use total probability
theorem by conditioning on the

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.300
state right after the
first transition.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.340
So this generally idea has
different variations.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.920
They're all valid, and depending
on the context that

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.600
you're dealing with, you might
want to work with one of these

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.130
or another.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.070
So let's illustrate
these calculations

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.090
in terms of an example.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:46.910
So in this example, we just have
2 states, and somebody

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.510
gives us transition
probabilities to be those

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.740
particular numbers.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.530
Let's write down
the equations.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:31:02.760
So the probability that starting
from state 1, I find

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.580
myself at state 1 n
time steps later.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.270
This can happen in 2 ways.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:15.440
At time n-1, I might find
myself at state 2.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:21.370
And then from state 2, I make a
transition back to state 1,

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.050
which happens with
probability--

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:25.260
why'd I put 2 there --

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.890
anyway, 0.2.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:32.230
And another way is that from
state 1, I go to state 1 in

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:38.170
n-1 steps, and then from state
1 I stay where I am, which

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:42.830
happens with probability 0.5.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.810
So this is for R11(n).

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:54.740
Now R12(n), we can
write a similar

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.780
recursion for this one.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.010
On the other hand, seems these
are probabilities.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.270
The state at time n is
going to be either

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.420
state 1 or state 2.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:09.270
So these 2 numbers need to add
to 1, so we can just write

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.520
this as 1 - R11(n).

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:19.660
And this is an enough of a
recursion to propagate R11 and

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.010
R12 as time goes on.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:29.105
So after n-1 transitions, either
I find myself in state

00:32:29.105 --> 00:32:33.910
2, and then there's a point to
transition that I go to 1, or

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.810
I find myself in state 1, which
with that probability,

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:41.230
and from there, I have
probability 0.5 of staying

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:42.880
where I am.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.830
Now let's start calculating.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:49.500
As we discussed before, if I
start at state 1, after 0

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.320
transitions I'm certain to be at
state , and I'm certain not

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.100
to be at state 1.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:59.390
If I start from state 1, I'm
certain to not to be at state

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.980
at that time, and I'm certain
that I am right

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.520
now, it's state 1.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:09.970
After I make transition,
starting from state 1, there's

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:13.790
probability 0.5 that
I stay at state 1.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.830
And there's probability 0.5
that I stay at state 2.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:22.060
If I were to start from state
2, the probability that I go

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.690
to 1 in 1 time step is this
transition that has

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:30.160
probability 0.2, and
the other 0.8.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:30.510
OK.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.850
So the calculation now becomes
more interesting, if we want

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.920
to calculate the next term.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.890
How likely is that at time 2,
I find myself at state 1?

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:50.060
In order to be here at state 1,
this can happen in 2 ways.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:54.510
Either the first transition left
me there, and the second

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.620
transition is the same.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.380
So these correspond to this 0.5,
that the first transition

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.660
took me there, and the
next transition was

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.140
also of the same kind.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.880
That's one possibility.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.510
But there's another scenario.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:15.100
In order to be at state 1
at time 2 -- this can

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.239
also happen this way.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.690
So that's the event
that, after 1

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:22.449
transition, I got there.

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:26.920
And the next transition happened
to be this one.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.020
So this corresponds
to 0.5 times 0.2.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.250
It corresponds to taking the
1-step transition probability

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:39.070
of getting there, times the
probability that from state 2

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:43.070
I move to state 1, which
in this case, is 0.2.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:47.480
So basically we take this
number, multiplied with 0.2,

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.250
and then add those 2 numbers.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:54.090
And after you add them,
you get 0.35.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:59.090
And similarly here, you're
going to get 0.65.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:02.390
And now to continue with the
recursion, we keep doing the

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.960
same thing.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:08.290
We take this number times 0.5
plus this number times 0.2.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:10.780
Add them up, you get
the next entry.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.390
Keep doing that, keep doing
that, and eventually you will

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:19.970
notice that the numbers
start settling into a

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.810
limiting value at 2/7.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.690
And let's verify this.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:29.220
If this number is 2/7, what is
the next number going to be?

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:41.100
The next number is going to
be 2/7 -- (not 2.7) --

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.410
it's going to be 2/7.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:44.870
That's the probability that I
find myself at that state,

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.890
times 0.5--

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:51.200
that's the next transition that
takes me to state 1 --

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.020
plus 5/7--

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.700
that would be the remaining
probability that I find myself

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.180
in state 2 --

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.760
times 1/5.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.210
And so that gives
me, again, 2/7.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:15.840
So this calculation basically
illustrates, if this number

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.360
has become 2/7, then
the next number is

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.570
also going to be 2/7.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.260
And of course this number here
is going to have to be 5/7.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:32.020
And this one would have to
be again, the same, 5/7.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:36.620
So the probability that I find
myself at state 1, after a

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:41.830
long time has elapsed, settles
into some steady state value.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.140
So that's an interesting
phenomenon.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.850
We just make this observation.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:50.390
Now we can also do the
calculation about the

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:53.660
probability, starting
from state 2.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.050
And here, you do the
calculations --

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.460
I'm not going to do them.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.040
But after you do them, you find
this probability also

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:07.405
settles to 2/7 and this one
also settles to 5/7.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.320
So these numbers here are the
same as those numbers.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.770
What's the difference
between these?

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:24.790
This is the probability that I
find myself at state 1 given

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.050
that I started at 1.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.890
This is the probability that I
find myself at state 1 given

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:34.220
that I started at state 2.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:39.110
These probabilities are the
same, no matter where I

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.460
started from.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:45.790
So this numerical example sort
of illustrates the idea that

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:51.070
after the chain has run for a
long time, what the state of

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:55.010
the chain is, does not care
about the initial

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.530
state of the chain.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:02.590
So if you start here, you know
that you're going to stay here

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.350
for some time, a few
transitions, because this

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.090
probability is kind of small.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:10.440
So the initial state does that's
tell you something.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.710
But in the very long run,
transitions of this kind are

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.340
going to happen.

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.510
Transitions of that kind
are going to happen.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.920
There's a lot of randomness
that comes in, and that

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.820
randomness washes out any
information that could come

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:28.580
from the initial state
of the system.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:33.290
We describe this situation by
saying that the Markov chain

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:37.210
eventually enters
a steady state.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:41.050
Where a steady state, what
does it mean it?

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:46.630
Does it mean the state itself
becomes steady and

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.750
stops at one place?

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:52.490
No, the state of the chain
keeps jumping forever.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:55.380
The state of the chain will keep
making transitions, will

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.780
keep going back and forth
between 1 and 2.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.920
So the state itself, the
Xn, does not become

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.970
steady in any sense.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:07.950
What becomes steady are
the probabilities

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.860
that describe Xn.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.900
That is, after a long time
elapses, the probability that

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:19.700
you find yourself at state 1
becomes a constant 2/7, and

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.520
the probability that you
find yourself in

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.810
state 2 becomes a constant.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:28.000
So jumps will keep happening,
but at any given time, if you

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.590
ask what's the probability that
right now I am at state

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:34.630
1, the answer is going
to be 2/7.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.650
Incidentally, do the numbers
sort of makes sense?

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:42.270
Why is this number bigger
than that number?

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:46.500
Well, this state is a little
more sticky than that state.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.000
Once you enter here, it's kind
of harder to get out.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.380
So when you enter here, you
spend a lot of time here.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.240
This one is easier to get out,
because the probability is

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.370
0.5, so when you enter there,
you tend to get out faster.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:04.150
So you keep moving from one to
the other, but you tend to

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.510
spend more time on that state,
and this is reflected in this

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.930
probability being bigger
than that one.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:14.540
So no matter where you start,
there's 5/7 probability of

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:18.650
being here, 2/7 probability
being there.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.480
So there were some really
nice things that

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.730
happened in this example.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.830
The question is, whether things
are always as nice for

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.410
general Markov chains.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.380
The two nice things that
happened where the following--

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.020
as we keep doing this
calculation, this number

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.660
settles to something.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.620
The limit exists.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.520
The other thing that happens
is that this number is the

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.740
same as that number, which means
that the initial state

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.280
does not matter.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.130
Is this always the case?

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:54.570
Is it always the case that as
n goes to infinity, the

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:58.490
transition probabilities
converge to something?

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:02.680
And if they do converge to
something, is it the case that

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:07.830
the limit is not affected by the
initial state i at which

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.400
the chain started?

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.970
So mathematically speaking, the
question we are raising is

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:19.180
whether Rij(n) converges
to something.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:25.440
And whether that something to
which it converges to has only

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.780
to do with j.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.680
It's the probability that you
find yourself at state j, and

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.170
that probability doesn't care
about the initial state.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.950
So it's the question of whether
the initial state gets

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:39.970
forgotten in the long run.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:46.260
So the answer is that usually,
or for nice chains, both of

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.420
these things will be true.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.500
You get the limit which
does not depend

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.900
on the initial state.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:59.020
But if your chain has some
peculiar or unique structure,

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:01.160
this might not happen.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.905
So let's think first about
the issue of convergence.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:12.720
So convergence, as n goes to
infinity at a steady value,

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.520
really means the following.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.710
If I tell you a lot of time has
passed, then you tell me,

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.220
OK, the state of the
probabilities are equal to

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.630
that value without having
to consult your clock.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:29.340
If you don't have convergence,
it means that Rij can keep

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.230
going up and down, without
settling to something.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.640
So in order for you to tell me
the value of Rij, you need to

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.200
consult your clock to
check if, right now,

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.670
it's up or is it down.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.230
So there's some kind of periodic
behavior that you

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:46.020
might get when you do not get
convergence, and this example

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.490
here illustrates it.

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:50.120
So what's happened
in this example?

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.470
Starting from state 2, next time
you go here, or there,

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:56.760
with probability half.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.820
And then next time, no matter
where you are, you move back

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.200
to state 2.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.950
So this chain has some
randomness, but the randomness

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.050
is kind of limited type.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.260
You go out, you come in.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.500
You go out, you come in.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:14.290
So there's a periodic pattern
that gets repeated.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:19.850
It means that if you start at
state 2 after an even number

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:24.100
of steps, you are certain
to be back at state 2.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.730
So this probability here is 1.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.430
On the other hand, if the number
of transitions is odd,

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:33.900
there's no way that you can
be at your initial state.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.150
If you start here, at even times
you would be here, at

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:39.570
odd times you would
be there or there.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.170
So this probability is 0.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:46.540
As n goes to infinity, these
probabilities, the n-step

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.220
transition probability does
not converge to anything.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.950
It keeps alternating
between 0 and 1.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:54.090
So convergence fails.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.440
This is the main mechanism by
which convergence can fail if

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.720
your chain has a periodic
structure.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.520
And we're going to discuss next
time that, if periodicity

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.790
absent, then we don't have an
issue with convergence.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:13.950
The second question if we have
convergence, whether the

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.850
initial state matters or not.

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:19.560
In the previous chain, where you
could keep going back and

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.830
forth between states 1 and 2
numerically, one finds that

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.040
the initial state
does not matter.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.460
But you can think of situations
where the initial

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.070
state does matter.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:33.120
Look at this chain here.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.520
If you start at state 1, you
stay at state 1 forever.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.840
There's no way to escape.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:46.040
So this means that R11(n)
is 1 for all n.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:50.390
If you start at state 3, you
will be moving between stage 3

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:54.400
and 4, but there's no way to
go in that direction, so

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.730
there's no way that
you go to state 1.

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:01.410
And for that reason,
R31 is 0 for all n.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:16.100
OK So this is a case where the
initial state matters.

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:21.640
R11 goes to a limit, as
n goes to infinity,

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.720
because it's constant.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.460
It's always 1 so
the limit is 1.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.050
R31 also has a limit.

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.010
It's 0 for all times.

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:32.830
So these are the long term
probabilities of finding

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.730
yourself at state 1.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.990
But those long-term
probabilities are affected by

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:39.470
where you started.

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.830
If you start here, you're sure
that's, in the long term,

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:42.860
you'll be here.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.260
If you start here, you're sure
that, in the long term, you

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.120
will not be there.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.550
So the initial state
does matter here.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.780
And this is a situation where
certain states are not

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.120
accessible from certain other
states, so it has something to

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.150
do with the graph structure
of our Markov chain.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:04.640
Finally let's answer this
question here, at

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.560
least for large n's.

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:12.140
What do you think is going to
happen in the long term if you

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.555
start at state 2?

00:46:14.555 --> 00:46:18.840
If you start at state 2, you
may stay at state 2 for a

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.860
random amount of time, but
eventually this transition

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.680
will happen, or that transition
would happen.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.720
Because of the symmetry, you are
as likely to escape from

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.170
state 2 in this direction, or in
that direction, so there's

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:37.510
probability 1/2 that, when the
transition happens, the

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:40.020
transition happens in
that direction.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:47.660
So for large N, you're
certain that the

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.640
transition does happen.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.380
And given that the transition
has happened, it has

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.560
probability 1/2 that it has
gone that particular way.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.380
So clearly here, you see that
the probability of finding

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.770
yourself in a particular state
is very much affected by where

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:05.400
you started from.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:09.310
So what we want to do next is
to abstract from these two

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:13.550
examples and describe the
general structural properties

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:16.360
that have to do with
periodicity, and that have to

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.990
do with what happened here with
certain states, not being

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:20.720
accessible from the others.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.530
We're going to leave periodicity
for next time.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.380
But let's talk about
the second kind of

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.540
phenomenon that we have.

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:32.420
So here, what we're going to do
is to classify the states

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:35.230
in a transition diagram
into two types,

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.000
recurrent and transient.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.330
So a state is said to
be recurrent if the

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:43.560
following is true.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:49.470
If you start from the state i,
you can go to some places, but

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:55.390
no matter where you go, there
is a way of coming back.

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:59.390
So what's an example for
the recurrent state?

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.000
This one.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.510
Starting from here, you
can go elsewhere.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.510
You can go to state 7.

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.540
You can go to state 6.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.050
That's all where
you can go to.

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:15.730
But no matter where you go,
there is a path that can take

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.190
you back there.

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:20.640
So no matter where you go, there
is a chance, and there

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.470
is a way for returning
where you started.

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.770
Those states we call
recurrent.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.750
And by this, 8 is recurrent.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.960
All of these are recurrent.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.080
So this is recurrent,
this is recurrent.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.570
And this state 5 is
also recurrent.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:40.080
You cannot go anywhere from
5 except to 5 itself.

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.860
Wherever you can go, you can
go back to where you start.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.830
So this is recurrent.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:49.190
If it is not the recurrent, we
say that it is transient.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:50.890
So what does transient mean?

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.900
You need to take this
definition, and reverse it.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:58.860
Transient means that, starting
from i, there is a place to

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:05.010
which you could go, and from
which you cannot return.

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:07.160
If it's recurrent, anywhere
you go, you

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.170
can always come back.

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:12.100
Transient means there are places
where you can go from

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.270
which you cannot come back.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:18.320
So state 1 is recurrent -
because starting from here,

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.880
there's a possibility that
you get there, and then

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.310
there's no way back.

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:26.120
State 4 is recurrent, starting
from 4, there's somewhere you

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.520
can go and--

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.260
sorry, transient, correct.

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.180
State 4 is transient starting
from here, there are places

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.670
where you could go, and from
which you cannot come back.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:40.380
And in this particular diagram,
all these 4 states

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.110
are transients.

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:49.800
Now if the state is transient,
it means that there is a way

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.150
to go somewhere where you're
going to get stuck and not to

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:54.840
be able to come.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:59.350
As long as your state keeps
circulating around here,

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:02.460
eventually one of these
transitions is going to

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:05.820
happen, and once that happens,
then there's no way that you

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:06.960
can come back.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:11.360
So that transient state will
be visited only a finite

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.650
number of times.

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:15.100
You will not be able
to return to it.

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.760
And in the long run, you're
certain that you're going to

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.150
get out of the transient states,
and get to some class

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:25.100
of recurrent states, and
get stuck forever.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:29.050
So, let's see, in this diagram,
if I start here,

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:32.580
could I stay in this lump
of states forever?

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.780
Well as long as I'm staying in
this type of states, I would

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:40.000
keep visiting states 1 and 2
Each time that I visit state

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.480
2, there's going to be positive

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.550
probability that I escape.

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:47.935
So in the long run, if I were
to stay here, I would visit

00:50:47.935 --> 00:50:50.130
state 2 an infinite number
of times, and I would get

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:52.210
infinite chances to escape.

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:56.840
But if you have infinite chances
to escape, eventually

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.810
you will escape.

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:01.760
So you are certain that with
probability 1, starting from

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.050
here, you're going to move
either to those states, or to

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.150
those states.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:09.710
So starting from transient
states, you only stay at the

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:14.660
transient states for random
but finite amount of time.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:19.000
And after that happens,
you end up in a class

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.180
of recurrent states.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:23.090
And when I say class, what they
mean is that, in this

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:26.440
picture, I divide the recurrent
states into 2

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.280
classes, or categories.

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.220
What's special about them?

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.300
These states are recurrent.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.000
These states are recurrent.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.150
But there's no communication
between the 2.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:36.780
If you start here, you're
stuck here.

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.750
If you start here, you
are stuck there.

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:42.970
And this is a case where the
initial state does matter,

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:45.180
because if you start here,
you get stuck here.

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.130
You start here, you
get stuck there.

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:49.970
So depending on the initial
state, that's going to affect

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:52.590
the long term behavior
of your chain.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.470
So the guess you can make at
this point is that, for the

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:59.210
initial state to not matter,
we should not have multiple

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:00.160
recurrent classes.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.710
We should have only 1.

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:04.030
But we're going to get back
to this point next time.
