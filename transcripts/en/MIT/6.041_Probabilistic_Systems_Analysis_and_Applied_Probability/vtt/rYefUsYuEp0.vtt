PROFESSOR: OK, if you have not
yet done it, please take a

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.510
moment to go through the course
evaluation website and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.880
enter your comments
for the class.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.250
So what we're going to do today
to wrap things up is

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.070
we're going to go through
a tour of the world of

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.320
hypothesis testing.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.500
See a few examples of hypothesis
tests, starting

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.280
from simple ones such as the
one the setting that we

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.220
discussed last time in which you
just have two hypotheses,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.130
you're trying to choose
between them.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.040
But also look at more
complicated situations in

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.600
which you have one
basic hypothesis.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.720
Let's say that you have a fair
coin and you want to test it

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.450
against the hypotheses that
your coin is not fair, but

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.770
that alternative hypothesis is
really lots of different

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.000
hypothesis.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.310
So is my coin fair?

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.700
Is my die fair?

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.980
Do I have the correct
distribution for random

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.510
variable, and so on.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.960
And I'm going to end up with a
few general comments about

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.190
this whole business.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.370
So the sad thing in simple
hypothesis testing problems is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.990
the following--

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.610
we have two possible models,
and this is the classical

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.680
world so we do not have any
prior probabilities on the two

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.850
hypotheses.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.340
Usually we want to think of
these hypotheses as not being

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.730
completely symmetrical, but
rather one is the default

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.180
hypothesis, and usually it's
referred to as the null

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.630
hypothesis.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.400
And you want to check whether
the null hypothesis is true,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.170
whether things are normal as you
would have expected them

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.900
to be, or whether it turns out
to be false, in which case an

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.750
alternative hypothesis
would be correct.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.710
So how does one go about it?

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.720
No matter what approach you use,
in the end you're going

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.220
to end up doing the following.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.620
You have the space of all simple
observations that you

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.980
may obtain.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.630
So when you do the experiment
you're going to get an X

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.050
vector, a vector of data
that's somewhere.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.760
And for some vectors you're
going to decide that you

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.410
accept H. Note for some vectors
that you reject H0 and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.160
you accept H1.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.100
So what you will end up doing
is that you're going to have

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.130
some division of the space of
all X's into two parts, and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.660
one part is the rejection
region, and one part is the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.050
acceptance region.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.440
So if you fall in here you
accept H0, if you fall here

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.240
you'd reject H0.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.750
So to design a hypothesis test
basically you need to come up

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.360
with a division of your X
space into two pieces.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.770
So the figuring out how to do
this involves two elements.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.640
One element is to decide what
kind of shape so I want for my

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.740
dividing curve?

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.240
And having chosen the shape of
the dividing curve, where

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.540
exactly do I put it?

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.980
So if you were to cut this
space using, let's say, a

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.360
straight cut you might put it
here, or you might put it

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.930
there, or you might
put it there.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.730
Where exactly are you
going to put it?

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.530
So let's look at those
two steps.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.700
The first issue is to decide
the general shape of your

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.440
rejection region, which is the
structure of your test.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.420
And the way this is done for the
case of two hypothesis is

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.050
by writing down the likelihood
ratio between the two

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.840
hypothesis.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.860
So let's call that quantity l of
X. It's something that you

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.280
can compute given the
data that you have.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.660
A high value of l of X basically
means that this

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.140
probability here tends to be
bigger than this probability.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.150
It means that the data that you
have seen are quite likely

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.650
to have occurred under H1,
but less likely to have

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.399
occurred under H0.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:22.360
So if you see data that they
are more plausible, can be

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.630
better explained, under H1, then
this ratio is big, and

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.030
you're going to choose in favor
of H1 or reject H0.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.950
That's what you do if you
have discrete data.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.380
You use the PMFs.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.450
If you have densities, in the
case of continues data, again

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.740
you consider the ratio
of the two densities.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.250
So a big l of X is evidence
that your data are more

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.570
compatible with H1
rather than H0.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:59.140
Once you accept this kind of
structure then your decision

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.920
is really made in terms
of that single number.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.270
That is, you had your data that
was some kind of vector,

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.930
and you condense your data
into a single number-- a

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.080
statistic as it's called--

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.150
in this case the likelihood
ratio, and you put the

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.880
dividing point somewhere
here call it Xi.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.600
And in this region you
accept H1, in this

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.940
region you accept H0.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.410
So by committing ourselves to
using the likelihood ratio in

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.650
order to carry out the test
we have gone from this

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.030
complicated picture of finding a
dividing line in x-space, to

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.860
a simpler problem of just
finding a dividing point on

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.280
the real line.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.960
OK, how are we going?

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.290
So what's left to do is to
choose this threshold, Xi.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.920
Or as it's called, the
critical value,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.560
for making our decision.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.930
And you can place it anywhere,
but one way of deciding where

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.240
to place it is the following--

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.740
look at the distribution of this
random variable, l of X.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.760
It's has a certain distribution
under H0, and it

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.210
has some other distribution
under H1.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.650
If I put my threshold here,
here's what's going to happen.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.360
When H0 is true, there is this
much probability that I'm

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.360
going to end up making an
incorrect decision.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.000
If H0 is true there's still a
probability that my likelihood

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.100
ratio will be bigger than Xi,
and that's the probability of

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.590
making an incorrect decision
of this particular type.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.720
That is of making a false
rejection of H0.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.330
Usually one sets this
probability to a certain

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.230
number, alpha.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.770
For example alpha being 5 %.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.680
And once you decide that you
want this to be 5 %, that

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.630
determines where this number
Psi(Xi) is going to be.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:07.340
So the idea here is that I'm
going to reject H0 if the data

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.350
that I have seen are quite
incompatible with H0.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.860
if they're quite unlikely to
have occurred under H0.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.690
And I take this level, 5%.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.670
So I see my data and then I say
well if H0 was true, the

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.380
probability that I would have
seen data of this kind would

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.390
be less than 5 %.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.390
Given that I saw those data,
that suggests that H0 is not

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.860
true, and I end up
rejecting H0.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.150
Now of course there's the
other type of error

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.190
probability.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:50.550
If I put my threshold here, if
H1 is true but my likelihood

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.470
ratio falls here I'm going
to make a mistake of

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.250
the opposite kind.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.780
H1 is true, but my likelihood
ratio turned out to be small,

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.370
and I decided in favor of H0.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.680
This is an error of the other
kind, this probability of

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.030
error we call beta.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.070
And you can see that
there's a trade-off

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.300
between alpha and beta.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.710
If you move your threshold this
way alpha become smaller,

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.320
but beta becomes larger.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.120
And the general picture is, in
your trade-off, depending on

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.970
where you put your threshold
is as follows--

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:31.370
you can make this beta to be 0
if you put your threshold out

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.809
here, but in that case you are
certain that you're going to

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.000
make a mistake of the
opposite kind.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.360
So beta equals 0, alpha equals
1 is one possibility.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.420
Beta equals 1 alpha equals 0
is the other possibility if

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.620
you send your thresholds
complete to the other side.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.950
And in general you're going
to get a trade-off

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.930
curve of some sort.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.720
And if you want to use a
specific value of alpha, for

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.030
example alpha being 0.05, then
that's going to determine for

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.820
you the probability for beta.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.410
Now there's a general, and quite
important theorem in

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.640
statistics, which were
are not proving.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.500
And which tells us that when we
use likelihood ratio tests

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.670
we get the best possible
trade-off curve.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.720
You could think of other ways
of making your decisions.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.780
Other ways of cutting off your
x-space into a rejection and

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.090
acceptance region.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.050
But any other way that you do
it is going to end up with

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.900
some probabilities of error
that are going to be above

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.990
this particular curve.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.570
So the likelihood ratio test
turns out to give you the best

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.200
possible way of dealing
with this trade-off

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.750
between alpha and beta.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.090
We cannot minimize alpha and
beta simultaneously, there's a

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.280
trade-off between them.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:02.420
But at least we would like to
have a test that deals with

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.380
this trade-off in the
best possible way.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.770
For a given value of alpha we
want to have the smallest

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.490
possible value of beta.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.900
And as the theorem is that the
likelihood ratio tests do have

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.240
this optimality property.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.270
For a given value of alpha they
minimize the probability

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.610
of error of a different kind.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.380
So let's make all these concrete
and look at the

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.680
simple example.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.980
We have two normal
distributions

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.610
with different means.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.850
So under H0 you have
a mean of 0.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.790
Under H1 you have a mean of 1.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.810
You get your data, you actually
get several data

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.770
drawn from one of the
two distributions.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.560
And you want to make a
decision, which one

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.050
of the two is true?

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.400
So what you do is you write
down the likelihood ratio.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.730
The density for a vector of
data, if that vector was

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.490
generated according to H0 --

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.470
which is this one, and the
density if it was generated

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.810
according to H1.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.510
Since we have multiple data the
density of a vector is the

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.830
product of the densities of
the individual elements.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.800
Since we're dealing with
normals we have those

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.500
exponential factors.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.550
A product of exponentials
gives us an

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.340
exponential of the sum.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.170
I'll spare you the details, but
this is the form of the

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.230
likelihood ratio.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.960
The likelihood ratio test
tells us that we should

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.360
calculate this quantity after we
get your data, and compare

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.750
with a threshold.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:35.340
Now you can do some algebra
here, and simplify.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.150
And by tracing down the
inequalities you're taking

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.840
logarithms of both
sides, and so on.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.350
One comes to the conclusion that
using a test that has a

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:52.150
threshold on this ratio is
equivalent to calculating this

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:56.920
quantity, and comparing
it with a threshold.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.220
Basically this quantity here is
monotonic in that quantity.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.510
This being larger than the
threshold is equivalent to

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.400
this being larger than
the threshold.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.310
So this tells us the general
structure of the likelihood

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.770
ratio test in this
particular case.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.640
And it's nice because it tells
us that we can make our

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.340
decisions by looking at this
simple summary of the data.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.810
This quantity, this summary of
the data on the basis of which

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:29.130
we make our decision is
called a statistic.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.850
So you take your data, which is
a multi-dimensional vector,

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.850
and you condense it to a single
number, and then you

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.630
make a decision on the
basis of that number.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.750
So this is the structure
of the test.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.430
If I get a large sum of Xi's
this is evidence in favor of

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.430
H1 because here the
mean is larger.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.990
And so I'm going to decide in
favor of H1 or reject H0 if

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.650
the sum is bigger than
the threshold.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.750
How do I choose my threshold?

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.080
Well I would like to choose
my threshold so that the

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.990
probability of an incorrect
decision when H0 is true the

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.980
probability of a false
rejection equals

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.890
to a certain number.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.400
Alpha, such as for
example 5 %.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.210
So you're given here
that this is 5 %.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.660
You know the distribution
of this random

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.240
variable, it's normal.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.980
And you want to find the
threshold value that makes

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.430
this to be true.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.300
So this is a type of problem
that you have

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.360
seen several times.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.910
You go to the normal tables,
and you figure it out.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.790
So the sum of the Xi's has some

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.160
distribution, it's normal.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.090
So that's the distribution
of the sum of the Xi's.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.620
And you want this probability
here to be alpha.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.520
For this to happen what is the
threshold value that makes

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.870
this to be true?

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.570
So you know how to solve
problems of this kind using

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.420
the normal tables.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.730
A slightly different example is
one in which you have two

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.900
normal distributions that
have the same mean --

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.580
let's take it to be 0 --

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.580
but they have a different
variance.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:15.080
So it's sort of natural that
here, if your X's that you see

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.880
are kind of big on either side
you would choose H1.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.500
If your X's are near 0 then
that's evidence for the

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.120
smaller variance you
would choose H0.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.740
So to proceed formally you again
write down to the form

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.190
of the likelihood ratio.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:39.780
So again the density of an X
vector under H0 is this one.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.680
It's the product of
the densities of

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.410
each one of the Xi's.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.030
Product of normal densities
gives you a product of

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.180
exponentials, which is
exponential of the sum, and

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.070
that's the expression
that you get.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.560
Under the other hypothesis
the only thing that

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.530
changes is the variance.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.800
And the variance, in the normal
distribution, shows up

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.970
here in the denominator
of the exponent.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.560
So you put it there.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.390
So this is the general structure
of the likelihood

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.650
ratio test.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.400
And now you do some algebra.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.110
These terms are constants
comparing this ratio to a

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.190
constant is the same as just
comparing the ratio of the

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.050
exponentials to a constant.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:23.710
Then you take logarithms, you
want to compare the logarithm

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.650
of this thing to a constant.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.210
You do a little bit of algebra,
and in the end you

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.180
find that the structure of the
test is to reject H0 if the

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.740
sum of the squares of the Xi's
is bigger than the threshold.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.360
So by committing to a likelihood
ratio test you are

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.060
told that you should be making
it your decision according to

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.940
a rule of this type.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.450
So this fixes the shape or the
structure of the decision

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.670
region, of the rejection
region.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.660
And the only thing that's left,
once more, is to pick

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.190
this threshold in order to have
the property that the

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:05.340
probability of a false rejection
is equal to say 5 %.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.490
So that's the probability that
H0 is true, but the sum of the

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.450
squares accidentally
happens to be

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.080
bigger than my threshold.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.330
In which case I end
up deciding H1.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.570
How do I find the value
of Xi prime?

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.150
Well what I need to do is to
look at the picture, more or

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.100
less of this kind, but now
I need to look at the

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.870
distribution of the sum
of the Xi's squared.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.190
Actually the sum of the Xi's
squared is a non-negative

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.580
random variable.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.280
So it's going to have a
distribution that's

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.910
something like this.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:50.540
I look at that distribution, and
once more I want this tail

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.300
probability to be alpha, and
that determines where my

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.370
threshold is going to be.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.595
So that's again a simple
exercise provided that you

00:17:00.595 --> 00:17:03.650
know the distribution
of this quantity.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.540
Do you know it?

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.980
Well we don't really know it,
we have not dealt with this

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.859
particular distribution
in this class.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:15.730
But in principle you should be
able to find what it is.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.459
It's a derived distribution
problem.

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:22.920
You know the distribution
of Xi, it's normal.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.410
Therefore, by solving a derived
distribution problem

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.400
you can find the distribution
of Xi squared.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.180
And the Xi squared's are
independent of each other,

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.400
because the Xi's are
independent.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.190
So you want to find the
distribution of the sum of

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.750
random variables with
known distributions.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.410
And since they're independent,
in principle, you can do this

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.470
using the convolution formula.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.720
So in principle, and if you're
patient enough, you will be

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.830
able to find the distribution
of this random variable.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:57.430
And then you plot it or tabulate
it, and find where

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:02.870
exactly is the 95th percentile
of that distribution, and that

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.290
determines your threshold.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.310
So this distribution actually
turns out to have a nice and

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.000
simple closed-form formula.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.740
Because this is a pretty common
test, people have

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.220
tabulated that distribution.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.370
It's called the chi-square
distribution.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.512
There's tables available
for it.

00:18:19.512 --> 00:18:23.390
And you look up in the tables,
you find the 95th percentile

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.900
of the distribution,
and this way you

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.280
determine your threshold.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.140
So what's the moral
of the story?

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.800
The structure of the likelihood
ratio test tells

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.470
you what kind of decision region
you're going to have.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.880
It tells you that for this
particular test you should be

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.360
using the sum of the Xi
squared's as your statistic,

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.460
as the basis for making
your decision.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.840
And then you need to solve a
derived distribution problem

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.110
to find the probability

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.500
distribution of your statistic.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.290
Find the distribution of this
quantity under H0, and

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.000
finally, based on that
distribution, after you have

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.330
derived it, then determine
your threshold.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.360
So now let's move
on to a somewhat

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.090
more complicated situation.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:18.090
You have a coin, and you
are told that I tried

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.040
to make a fair coin.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.450
Is it fair?

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.200
So you have the hypothesis,
which is the default--

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.320
the null hypothesis--

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.890
that the coin is fair.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.690
But maybe it isn't.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.880
So you have the alternative
hypothesis that

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.030
your coin is not fair.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.690
Now what's different in this
context is that your

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:41.830
alternative hypothesis is not
just one specific hypothesis.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.990
Your alternative hypothesis
consists of many alternatives.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.270
It includes the hypothesis
that p is 0.6.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.930
It includes the hypothesis
that p is 0.51.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:58.850
It includes the hypothesis that
p is 0.48, and so on.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:05.030
So you're testing this
hypothesis versus all this

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.070
family of alternative
hypothesis.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.080
What you will end up doing is
essentially the following--

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.480
you get some data.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.080
That is, you flip the coin
a number of times.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.640
Let's say you flip
it 1,000 times.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.290
You observe some outcome.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.580
Let's say you saw 472 heads.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:31.650
And you ask the question if
this hypothesis is true is

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.790
this value really possible
under that hypothesis?

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.450
Or would it be very much
of an outlier?

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:44.220
If it looks like an extreme
outlier under this hypothesis

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.780
then I reject it, and I accept
the alternative.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.800
If this number turns out to be
something within the range

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.690
that you would have expected
then you keep, or accept your

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.080
null hypothesis.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.200
OK so what does it mean to
be an outlier or not?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.430
First you take your data,
and you condense

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.220
them to a single number.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.240
So your detailed data actually
would have been a sequence of

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.440
heads/tails, heads/tails
and all that.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.370
Any reasonable person would tell
you that you shouldn't

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.430
really care about the exact
sequence of heads and tails.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.570
Let's just base our decision on
the number of heads that we

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.380
have observed.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.870
So using some kind of reasoning
which could be

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.650
mathematical, or intuitive,
or involving artistry--

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:38.400
you pick a one-dimensional, or
scalar summary of the data

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.450
that you have seen.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.250
In this case, the summary of the
data is just the number of

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.330
heads that's a quite
reasonable one.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.880
And so you commit yourself to
make a decision on the basis

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.080
of this quantity.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.670
And you ask the quantity that
I'm seeing does it look like

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:53.680
an outlier?

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.710
Or does it look more
or less OK?

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.540
OK, what does it mean
to be an outlier?

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.900
You want to choose the shape of
this rejection region, but

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.750
on the basis of that
single number s.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.240
And again, the reasonable thing
to do in this context

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.170
would be to argue as follows--
if my coin is fair I expect to

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.850
see n over 2 heads.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:18.540
That's the expected value.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.330
If the number of heads I see
is far from the expected

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.030
number of heads then I consider

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.750
this to be an outlier.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.470
So if this number is bigger
than some threshold Xi.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.600
I consider it to be an outlier,
and then I'm going to

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.100
reject my hypothesis.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.930
So we picked our statistic.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:44.990
We picked the general form of
how we're going to make our

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:50.000
decision, and then we pick a
certain significance, or

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.690
confidence level that we want.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.470
Again, this famous 5% number.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:58.310
And we're going to declare
something to be an outlier if

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.380
it lies in the region
that has 5% or less

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.270
probability of occurring.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.560
That is I'm picking my rejection
region so that if H0

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.870
is true under the default, or
null hypothesis, there's only

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:17.380
5% chance that by accident I
fall there, and the thing

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.540
makes me think that H1
is going to be true.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.770
So now what's left to
do is to pick the

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.920
value of this threshold.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.410
This is a calculation
of the usual kind.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:39.580
I want to pick my threshold,
my Xi number so that the

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.150
probability that s is further
from the mean by an amount of

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:47.200
Xi is less than 5%.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.630
Or that the probability
of being inside

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.300
the acceptance region--

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.240
so that the distance
from the default is

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.380
less than my threshold.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.880
I want that to be 95%.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.380
So this is an equality that you
can get using the central

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.760
limit theorem and the
normal tables.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.230
There's 95% probability that the
number of heads is going

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:14.920
to be within 31 from
the correct mean.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.910
So the way the exercise is done
of course, is that we

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.640
start with this number, 5%.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.410
Which translates to
this number 95%.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.960
And once we have fixed that
number then you ask the

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:34.370
question what number should
we have here to make this

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.500
equality to be true?

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.360
It's again a problem
of this kind.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.820
You have a quantity whose
distribution you know.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.950
Why do you know it?

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.390
The number of heads by the
central limit theorem is

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:47.970
approximately normal.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.560
So this here talks about the
normal distribution.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.330
You set your alpha to be 5%, and
you ask where should I put

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.690
my threshold so that this
probability of being out there

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.530
is only 5%?

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.750
Now in our particular example
the threshold

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.970
turned out to be 31.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.170
This number turned out
was just 28 away

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.960
from the correct mean.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.150
So these distance was less
than the threshold.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.280
So we end up not rejecting H0.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.820
So we have our rejection
region.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.900
The way we designed it is that
when H0 is true there's only a

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.960
small chance, 5%, that we get
to data out of there.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.510
Data that we would
call an outlier.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.330
If we see such an outlier
we reject H0.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.930
If what we see is not an outlier
as in this case, where

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.090
that distance turned out to
be kind of small, then we

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.980
do not reject H0.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.700
An interesting little piece
of language here, people

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.490
generally prefer to use
this terminology--

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:01.820
to say that H0 is not rejected
by the data.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:06.490
Instead of saying that
H0 is accepted.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.260
In some sense they're both
saying the same thing, but the

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.940
difference is sort of subtle.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:17.240
When I say not rejected what I
mean is that I got some data

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.560
that are compatible with
my hypothesis.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.470
That is the data that I got do
not falsify the hypothesis

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.520
that I had, my null
hypothesis.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.500
So my null hypothesis is still
alive, and may be true.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.700
But from data you can never
really prove that the

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.360
hypothesis is correct.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.190
Perhaps my coin is not fair in
some other complicated way.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.980
Perhaps I was just lucky, and
even though my coin is not

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.930
fair I ended up with
an outcome that

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.270
suggests that it's fair.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.600
Perhaps my coin flips are
not independent as I

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.020
assumed in my model.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:11.860
So there's many ways that my
null hypothesis could be

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.010
wrong, and still I got data
that tells me that my

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.970
hypothesis is OK.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.980
So this is the general way that
things work in science.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.340
One comes up with a
model or a theory.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:28.480
This is the default theory, and
we work with that theory

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.100
trying to find whether
there are examples

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.450
that violate the theory.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.550
If you find data and examples
that violate the theory your

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.560
theory is falsified, and you
need to look for a new one.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:43.090
But when you have your theory,
really no amount of data can

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:45.810
prove that your theory
is correct.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.950
So we have the default theory
that the speed of light is

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:54.620
constant as long as we do not
find any data that runs

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.210
counter to it.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.650
We stay with that theory, but
there's no way of really

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:03.710
proving this, no matter how
many experiments we do.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.590
But there could be experiments
that falsify that theory, in

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.580
which case we need to do
look for a new one.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.450
So there's a bit of an asymmetry
here in how we treat

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.510
the alternative hypothesis.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:22.900
H0 is the default which we'll
accept until we see some

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.350
evidence to the contrary.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:30.170
And if we see some evidence to
the contrary we reject it.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.580
As long as we do not see
evidence to the contrary then

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.940
we keep working with it,
but always take it

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.200
with a grain of salt.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.210
You can never really prove that
a coin has a bias exactly

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.860
equal to 1/2.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:50.360
Maybe the bias is equal
to 0.50001, so

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.440
the bias is not 1/2.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.180
But with an experiment with
1,000 coin tosses you wouldn't

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.200
be able to see this effect.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.870
OK, so that's how you go about
testing about whether your

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.120
coin is fair.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.150
You can also think about testing
whether a die is fair.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:17.130
So for a die the null hypothesis
would be that every

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:21.830
possible result when you roll
the die has equal probability

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.860
and equal to 1/6.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.720
And you also make the hypothesis
that your die rolls

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.900
are statistically independent
from each other.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:36.050
So I take my die, I roll it a
number of times, little n, and

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:40.240
I count how many 1's I got, how
many 2's I got, how many

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.430
3's I got, and these
are my data.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:48.400
I count how many times I
observed a specific result in

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.660
my die roll that was
equal to sum i.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.410
And now I ask the question--

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:58.050
the Ni's that I observed, are
they compatible with my

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:01.000
hypothesis or not?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.560
What does compatible to
my hypothesis mean?

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:12.570
Under the null hypothesis Ni
should be approximately equal,

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:17.750
or is equal in expectation
to N times little Pi.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:23.170
And in our example this little
Pi is of course 1/6.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:28.210
So if my die is fair the number
of ones I expect to see

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.110
is equal to the number
of rolls times 1/6.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:35.070
The number of 2's I expect to
see is again that same number.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.970
Of course there's randomness,
so I do not expect to get

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.420
exactly that number.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.420
But I can ask how far
away from the

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.380
expected values was i?

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:51.470
If my capital Ni's turn to be
very different from N/6 this

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:55.110
is evidence that my
die is not fair.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:31:01.000
If those numbers turn out to be
close to N times 1/6 then

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.180
I'm going to say there's no
evidence that would lead me to

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.870
reject this hypothesis.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.850
So this hypothesis
remains alive.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:16.390
So someone has come up with this
thought that maybe the

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:20.730
right statistic to use, or the
right way of quantifying how

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.910
far away are the Ni's from
their mean is to

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:25.590
look at this quantity.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.520
So I'm looking at the expected
value of Ni under the null

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.700
hypothesis.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.760
See what I got, take the square
of this, and add it

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.040
over all i's.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.930
But also throw in these terms
in the denominator.

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:46.010
And why that term is there,
that's a longer story.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:49.740
One can write down certain
likelihood ratios, do certain

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.010
Taylor Series approximations,
and there's a Heuristic

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:58.120
argument that justifies why this
would be a good form for

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.810
the test to use.

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:02.660
So there's a certain art that's
involved in this step

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.370
that some people somehow decided
that it's a reasonable

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.730
thing to do is to calcelate.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.300
Once you get your results to
calculate this one-dimensional

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.740
summary of your result, this is
going to be your statistic,

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.550
and compare that statistic
to a threshold.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.680
And that's how you make
your decision.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:27.310
So by this point we have fixed
the type of the rejection

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.740
region that we're
going to have.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.780
So we've chosen the qualitative
structure of our

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.230
test, and the only thing that's
now left is to choose

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.820
the particular threshold
we're going to use.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.550
And the recipe, once
more, is the same.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:44.840
We want to set our threshold so
that the probability of a

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.320
false rejection is 5%.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.040
We want the probability that our
data fall in here is only

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.990
5% when the null hypothesis
is true.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:33:01.040
So that's the same as setting
our threshold Xi so that the

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.940
probability that our
test statistic is

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.960
bigger than that threshold.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:11.470
We want that probability
to be only 0.05.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:15.140
So to solve a problem of
this kind what is it

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.820
that you need to do?

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.490
You need to find the probability
distribution of

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:23.810
capital T. So once more
it's the same picture.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:32.200
You need to do some calculations
of some sort, and

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.550
come up with the distribution
of the random variable T,

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.060
where T is defined this way.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.400
You want to find this
distribution

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.190
under hypothesis H0.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.780
Once you find what that
distribution is then you can

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.480
solve this usual problem.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.470
I want this probability
here to be 5%.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.860
What should my threshold be?

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.930
So what does this
boil down to?

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:08.510
Finding the distribution of
capital T is in some sense a

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:13.350
messy, difficult, derived
distribution problem.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:16.239
From this model we know
the distribution

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.489
of the capital Ni's.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.800
And actually we can even write
down the joint distribution of

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.840
the capital Ni's.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.690
In fact we can make an
approximation here.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:33.219
Capital Ni is a binomial
random variable.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:39.790
Let's say the number of 1's that
I got in little N rolls

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.090
off my die.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.300
So that's a binomial
random variable.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.860
When little n is big
this is going to be

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.040
approximately normal.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:52.060
So we have normal random
variables, or approximately

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.260
normal minus a constant.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.770
They're still approximately
normal.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:01.070
We take the squares of these,
scale them so you can solve a

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.730
derived distribution problem
to find the distribution of

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:04.930
this quantity.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:08.550
You can do more work, more
derived distribution work, and

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:12.080
find the distribution of
capital T. So this is a

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:17.500
tedious matter, but because this
test is used quite often,

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.080
again people have done
those calculations.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.600
They have found the distribution
of capital T, and

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.250
it's available in tables.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:29.090
And you go to those tables, and
you find the appropriate

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.370
threshold for making a decision
of this type.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.720
Now to give you a sense of how
complicated hypothesis one

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:47.190
might have to deal with let's
make things one level more

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.370
complicated.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:55.200
So here you can think this X is
a discrete random variable.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.770
This is the outcome
of my roll.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:02.760
And I had a model in which the
possible values of my discrete

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.030
random variables they
have probabilities

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.870
all equal to 1/6.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:13.280
So my null hypothesis here was
a particular PMF for the

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.810
random variable capital X. So
another way of phrasing what

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.950
happened in this
problem was the

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.700
question is my PMF correct?

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:30.580
So this is the PMF of the
result of one die roll.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.950
You're asking the question
is my PMF correct?

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.740
Make it more complicated.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:41.510
How about the question of the
type is my PDF correct when I

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:45.220
have continuous data?

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:50.900
So I have hypothesized that's
the probability distribution

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.780
that I have is let's say
a particular normal.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.990
I get lots of results from
that random variable.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:04.450
Can I tell whether my results
look like normal or not?

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.650
What are some ways of
going about it?

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.450
Well, we saw in the previous
slide that there is a

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:13.110
methodology for deciding
if your PMF is correct.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:19.090
So you could take your normal
results, the data that you got

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:23.200
from your experiment, and
discretize them, and so now

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.500
you're dealing with
discrete data.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:31.200
And sort of used in previous
methodology to solve a

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.900
discrete problem of the type
is my PDF correct?

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:41.320
So in practice the way this is
done is that you get all your

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:49.920
data, let's say data points
of this kind.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:56.400
You split your space into bins,
and you count how many

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.190
you have in each bin.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:07.180
So you get this, and that,
and that, and nothing.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.020
So that's a histogram that
you get from the

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.020
data that you have.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.670
Like the very familiar
histograms that you see after

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.860
each one of our quizzes.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:21.760
So if you look at these
histogram, and you ask does it

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.060
look like normal?

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.700
OK, we need a systematic
way of going about it.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:33.140
If it were normal you can
calculate the probability of

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.760
falling in this interval.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.120
The probability of falling in
that interval, probability of

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.890
falling into that interval.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:45.480
So you would have expected
values of how many results, or

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.210
data points, you would have
in this interval.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:52.170
And compare these expected
values for each interval with

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.830
the actual ones that
you observed.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.290
And then take the sum of
squares, and so on, exactly as

00:38:58.290 --> 00:38:59.700
in the previous slide.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.010
And this gives you a way
of going about it.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.710
This is a little messy.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:14.530
It gets hard to do because you
have the difficult decision of

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:19.180
how do you choose
the bin size?

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:22.430
If you take your bins to be very
narrow you would get lots

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:25.680
of bins with 0's, and a few
bins that only have one

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.840
outcome in them.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.120
It probably wouldn't
feel right.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.110
If you choose your bins to be
very wide then you're losing a

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:33.680
lot of information.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:39.240
Is there some way of making a
test without creating bins?

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:43.330
This is just to illustrate
the clever ideas of what

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.640
statisticians have
thought about.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:51.960
And here's a really cute way of
going about a test, whether

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.750
my distribution is
correct or not.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.790
Here we're essentially
plotting a PMF, or an

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:02.630
approximation of a PDF.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:06.040
And we ask does it look like
the PDF we assumed?

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.930
Instead of working with PDFs
let's work with cumulative

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.800
distribution functions.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.840
So how does this go?

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:20.160
The true normal distribution
that I have hypothesized, the

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.310
density that I'm hypothesizing--
my null

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.350
hypothesis--

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.950
has a certain CDF
that I can plot.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:36.820
So supposed that my hypothesis
H0 is that the X's are normal

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:42.630
with our standard normals, and I
plot the CDF of the standard

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:46.360
normal, which is the sort of
continuous looking curve here.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:53.310
Now I get my data, and I
plot the empirical CDF.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.930
What's the empirical CDF?

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.830
In the empirical CDF you ask the
question what fraction of

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.940
the data fell below 0?

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.450
You get a number.

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.920
What fraction of my
data fell below 1?

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.730
I get a number.

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:12.590
What fraction of my data fell
below 2, and so on.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.780
So you're talking about
fractions of the data that

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:18.760
fell below each particular
number.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.640
And by plotting those fractions
as a function of

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.740
this number you get something
that looks like a CDF.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:31.670
And it's the CDF suggested
by the data.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:35.800
Now the fraction of the data
that fall below 0 in my

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.530
experiment is--

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:43.280
if my hypothesis were true--

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.470
expected to be 1/2.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:49.280
1/2 is the value of
the true CDF.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.730
I look at the fraction
that I got, it's

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.470
expected to be that number.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:56.800
But there's randomness, so
it's might be a little

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.300
different than that.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:03.490
For any particular value, the
fraction that I got below a

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:04.350
certain number--

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:09.970
the fraction of data that
we're below, 2, its

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:15.310
expectation is the probability
of falling below 2, which is

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:16.740
the correct CDF.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:21.060
So if my hypothesis is true the
empirical CDF that I get

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.900
based on data should, when
n is large, be very

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.100
close to the true CDF.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:31.350
So a way of judging whether my
model is correct or not is to

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:38.300
look at the assumed CDF, the
CDF under hypothesis H0.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.880
Look at the CDF that I
constructed based on the data,

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.440
and see whether they're
close enough or not.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.150
And by close enough, I mean I'm
going to look at all the

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:52.000
possible X's, and look at the
maximum distance between those

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.300
two curves.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:59.140
And I'm going to have a test
that decides in favor of H0 if

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:03.550
this distance is small,
and in favor of H1 if

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:06.110
this distance is large.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.790
That still leaves me
the problem of

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:09.570
coming up with a threshold.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:13.180
Where exactly do I
put my threshold?

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:17.230
Because this test is important
enough, and is used frequently

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:20.990
people have made the effort
to try to understand the

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:23.240
probability distribution
of this quite

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.280
difficult random variable.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.220
One needs to do lots of
approximations and clever

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:32.550
calculations, but these have
led to values and tabulated

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.570
values for the probability
distribution

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.210
of this random variable.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.340
And, for example, those
tabulated values tell us that

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:45.030
if we want 5% false rejection
probability, then our

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:48.860
threshold should be 1.36
divided by the

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.570
square root of n.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.870
So we know where to put
our threshold for

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:55.280
this particular value.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:59.680
If we want this particular
error or error

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.380
probability to occur.

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:06.320
So that's about as hard and
sophisticated classical

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.070
statistics get.

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:12.920
You want to have tests for
hypotheses that are not so

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.910
easy to handle.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:21.260
People somehow think of
clever ways of doing

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.500
tests of this kind.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.970
How to compare the theoretical
predictions with the observed

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:29.650
predictions with the
observed data.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:34.430
Come up with some measure of the
difference between theory

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:38.270
and data, and if that difference
is big, than you

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:39.520
reject your hypothesis.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.640
OK, of course that's not
the end of the field of

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:49.000
statistics, there's
a lot more.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
In some ways, as we kept
moving through today's

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.240
lecture, the way that we
constructed those rejection

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.680
regions was more and
more ad hoc.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:02.220
I pulled out of a hat a
particular measure of fit

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.980
between data and the model.

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:09.470
And I said let's just use
a test based on this.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.890
There are attempts at more or
less systematic ways of coming

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:17.350
up with the general shape of
rejection regions that have at

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:20.540
least some desirable or
favorable theoretical

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.790
properties.

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:28.300
Some more specific problems
that people study--

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.690
instead of having a test,
is this the correct PDF?

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:33.140
Yes or no.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:37.670
I just give you data, and I
ask you tell me, give me a

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:41.270
model or a PDF for those data.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:45.000
OK, my thoughts of this kind
are of many types.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.640
One general method is you form a
histogram, and then you take

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.570
your histogram and plot a smooth
line, that kind of fits

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:55.680
the histogram.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.140
This still leaves the question
of how do you choose the bins?

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.780
The bin size in your
histograms.

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.620
How narrow do you take them?

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:05.920
And that depends on how many
data you have, and there's a

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.190
lot of theory that tells you
about the best way of choosing

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:12.890
the bin sizes, and the best
ways of smoothing the data

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:14.640
that you have.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.090
A completely different topic
is in signal processing --

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.200
you want to do your inference.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.810
Not only you want it to be good,
but you also want it to

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:25.520
be fast in a computational
way.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.010
You get data in real
time, lots of data.

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:31.330
You want to keep processing and
revising your estimates

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:35.220
and your decisions as
they come and go.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.950
Another topic that was briefly
touched upon the last couple

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:43.010
of lectures is that when you set
up a model, like a linear

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:46.540
regression model, you choose
some explanatory variables,

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:50.230
and you try to predict y from
your X, these variables.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:52.720
You have a choice of
what to take as

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.440
your explanatory variables.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:02.560
Are there systematic ways of
picking the right X variables

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.520
to try to estimate a Y.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.360
For example should I try to
estimate Y on the basis of X?

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.320
Or on the basis of X-squared?

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.960
How do I decide between
the two?

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:17.000
Finally, the rage these days has
to do with anything big,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.490
high-demensional.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:23.410
Complicated models of
complicated things, and tons

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:24.650
and tons of data.

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:27.430
So these days data are
generated everywhere.

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:30.230
The amounts of data
are humongous.

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:33.120
Also, the problems that people
are interested in tend to be

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.500
very complicated with
lots of parameters.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.800
So I need specially tailored
methods that can give you good

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:44.220
results, or decent results even
in the face of these huge

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:47.290
amounts of data, and possibly
with computational

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:48.310
constraints.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.720
So with huge amounts of data
you want methods that are

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:56.460
simple, but still can deliver
for you meaningful answers.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:00.170
Now as I mentioned some time
ago, this whole field of

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:03.960
statistics is very different
from the field of probability.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.530
In some sense all that we're
doing in statistics is

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:08.100
probabilistic calculations.

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.360
That's what the theory
kind of does.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.870
But there's a big
element of art.

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:16.550
You saw that we chose the shape
of some decision regions

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.840
or rejection regions in
a somewhat ad hoc way.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.660
There's even more
basic things.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.260
How do you organize your data?

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:26.690
How do you think about which
hypotheses you would like to

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:28.300
test, and so on.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.710
There's a lot of art that's
involved here, and there's a

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:33.510
lot that can go wrong.

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:36.630
So I'm going to close with a
note that you can take either

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:39.050
as pessimistic or optimistic.

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:42.880
There is a famous paper that
came out a few years ago and

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.440
has been cited about a
1,000 times or so.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.110
And the title of the paper is
Why Most Published Research

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:51.850
Findings Are False.

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:56.080
And it's actually a very good
argument why, in fields like

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.900
psychology or the medical
science and all that a lot of

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.160
what you see published--

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.410
that yes, this drug
has an effect on

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:05.000
that particular disease--

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.030
is actually false, because
people do not do their

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:09.780
statistics correctly.

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.130
There's lots of biases
in what people do.

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:16.300
I mean an obvious bias is that
you only published a result

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:19.190
when you see something.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:22.770
So the null hypothesis is that
the drug doesn't work.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:26.820
You do your tests, the drug
didn't work, OK, you just go

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:27.960
home and cry.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:33.380
But if by accident that 5%
happens, and even though the

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.320
drug doesn't work, you got
some outlier data, and it

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.760
seemed to be working.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.990
Then you're excited,
you publish it.

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:42.760
So that's clearly a bias.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.980
That gets results to be
published, even though they do

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.330
not have a solid foundation
behind them.

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:53.050
Then there's another
thing, OK?

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.440
I'm picking my 5%.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:59.940
So H0 is true there's a small
probability that the data will

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:04.160
look like an outlier,
and in that case I

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.270
published my result.

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.160
OK it's only 5% --

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.300
it's not going to happen
too often.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.200
But suppose that I go and do
a 1,000 different tests?

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.540
Test H0 against this hypothesis,
test H0 against

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.000
that hypothesis , test H0
against that hypothesis.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.230
Some of these tests, just by
accident might turn out to be

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:29.350
in favor of H1, and
again these are

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:31.170
selected to be published.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:35.720
So if you do lots and lots of
tests and in each one you have

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.980
a 5% probability of error,
when you consider the

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.980
collection of all those tests,
actually the probability of

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:46.940
making incorrect inferences
is a lot more than 5%.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:51.400
One basic principle in being
systematic about such studies

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:55.950
is that you should first pick
your hypothesis that you're

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:59.230
going to test, then get
your data, and do

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:00.880
your hypothesis testing.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:05.640
What would be wrong is to get
your data, look at them, and

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.890
say OK I'm going now to test
for these 100 different

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:13.060
hypotheses, and I'm going to
choose my hypothesis to be for

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:16.580
features that look abnormal
in my data.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.520
Well, given enough data, you
can always find some

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.650
abnormalities just by chance.

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:24.380
And if you choose to make
a statistical test--

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:26.710
is this abnormality present?

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:28.090
Yes, it will be present.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:31.020
Because you first found the
abnormality, and then you

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.130
tested for it.

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:35.210
So that's another way that
things can go wrong.

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:37.520
So the moral of this story is
that while the world of

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.200
probability is really beautiful
and solid, you have

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:40.960
your axioms.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.630
Every question has a unique
answer that by now you can,

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:48.250
all of you, find in a
very reliable way.

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.740
Statistics is a dirty and
difficult business.

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.010
And that's why the subject
is not over.

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.430
And if you're interested in
it, it's worth taking

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:58.920
follow-on courses in
that direction.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:03.950
OK so have good luck in the
final, do well, and have a

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:05.200
nice vacation afterwards.
