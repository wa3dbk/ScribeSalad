JOHN TSITSIKLIS: Today we're
going to finish our discussion

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.480
of the Poisson process.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.280
We're going to see a few of
its properties, do a few

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.660
interesting problems, some more
interesting than others.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.000
So go through a few examples and
then we're going to talk

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.170
about some quite strange things
that happen with the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.980
Poisson process.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.500
So the first thing is to
remember what the Poisson

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.200
processes is.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.300
It's a model, let's say, of
arrivals of customers that

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.940
are, in some sense, quote
unquote, completely random,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.990
that is a customer can arrive
at any point in time.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.670
All points in time are
equally likely.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.330
And different points in time
are sort of independent of

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.450
other points in time.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.160
So the fact that I got an
arrival now doesn't tell me

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.050
anything about whether there's
going to be an arrival at some

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.950
other time.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.230
In some sense, it's a continuous
time version of the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.760
Bernoulli process.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.130
So the best way to think about
the Poisson process is that we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.240
divide time into extremely
tiny slots.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.750
And in each time slot, there's
an independent possibility of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.120
having an arrival.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.860
Different time slots are
independent of each other.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.660
On the other hand, when the slot
is tiny, the probability

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.760
for obtaining an arrival during
that tiny slot is

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.910
itself going to be tiny.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.950
So we capture these properties
into a formal definition what

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.380
the Poisson process is.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.390
We have a probability mass
function for the number of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.250
arrivals, k, during an interval
of a given length.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.590
So this is the sort of basic
description of the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.200
distribution of the number
of arrivals.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.520
So tau is fixed.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.350
And k is the parameter.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.660
So when we add over all k's, the
sum of these probabilities

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.780
has to be equal to 1.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.330
There's a time homogeneity
assumption, which is hidden in

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.840
this, namely, the only thing
that matters is the duration

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.880
of the time interval, not where
the time interval sits

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.230
on the real axis.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.260
Then we have an independence
assumption.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.570
Intervals that are disjoint are
statistically independent

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.650
from each other.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.110
So any information you give me
about arrivals during this

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.200
time interval doesn't change my
beliefs about what's going

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.930
to happen during another
time interval.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.050
So this is a generalization
of the idea that we had in

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.970
Bernoulli processes that
different time slots are

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.930
independent of each other.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.770
And then to specify this
function, the distribution of

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.120
the number of arrivals, we
sort of go in stages.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.750
We first specify this function
for the case where the time

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.920
interval is very small.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.630
And I'm telling you what those
probabilities will be.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.540
And based on these then, we do
some calculations and to find

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.510
the formula for the distribution
of the number of

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.420
arrivals for intervals of
a general duration.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.000
So for a small duration, delta,
the probability of

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.730
obtaining 1 arrival
is lambda delta.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.220
The remaining probability is
assigned to the event that we

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.980
get to no arrivals during
that interval.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.330
The probability of obtaining
more than 1 arrival in a tiny

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.630
interval is essentially 0.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.190
And when we say essentially,
it's means modular, terms that

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.620
of order delta squared.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.440
And when delta is very small,
anything which is delta

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.690
squared can be ignored.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.850
So up to delta squared terms,
that's what happened during a

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.660
little interval.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.210
Now if we know the probability
distribution for the number of

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.260
arrivals in a little interval.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.470
We can use this to get the
distribution for the number of

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.370
arrivals over several
intervals.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.870
How do we do that?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.850
The big interval is composed
of many little intervals.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.410
Each little interval is
independent from any other

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.720
little interval, so is it is
as if we have a sequence of

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.310
Bernoulli trials.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.910
Each Bernoulli trial is
associated with a little

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.580
interval and has a small
probability of obtaining a

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.850
success or an arrival during
that mini-slot.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.800
On the other hand, when delta
is small, and you take a big

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.680
interval and chop it
up, you get a large

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.410
number of little intervals.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.240
So what we essentially have here
is a Bernoulli process,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.690
in which is the number of
trials is huge but the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.030
probability of success during
any given trial is tiny.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:02.580
The average number of trials
ends up being proportional to

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.740
the length of the interval.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.410
If you have twice as large an
interval, it's as if you're

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.860
having twice as many over these
mini-trials, so the

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.080
expected number of arrivals will
increase proportionately.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.380
There's also this parameter
lambda, which we interpret as

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.600
expected number of arrivals
per unit time.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.940
And it comes in those
probabilities here.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.810
When you double lambda, this
means that a little interval

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.160
is twice as likely to
get an arrival.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.300
So you would expect
to get twice as

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.880
many arrivals as well.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.990
That's why the expected number
of arrivals during an interval

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.580
of length tau also scales
proportional to

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.850
this parameter lambda.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.740
Somewhat unexpectedly, it turns
out that the variance of

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.750
the number of arrivals is also
the same as the mean.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.540
This is a peculiarity
that happens

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.310
in the Poisson process.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.100
So this is one way of thinking
about Poisson process, in

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.640
terms of little intervals, each
one of which has a tiny

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.690
probability of success.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.370
And we think of the distribution
associated with

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.030
that process as being
described by

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.100
this particular PMF.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.800
So this is the PMF for the
number of arrivals during an

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.880
interval of a fixed
duration, tau.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.970
It's a PMF that extends all
over the entire range of

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.810
non-negative integers.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.730
So the number of arrivals you
can get during an interval for

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.890
certain length can
be anything.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.690
You can get as many arrivals
as you want.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.400
Of course the probability of
getting a zillion arrivals is

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.620
going to be tiny.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.110
But in principle, this
is possible.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.440
And that's because an interval,
even if it's a fixed

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.460
length, consists of an infinite
number of mini-slots

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.770
in some sense.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.880
You can divide, chop
it up, into as many

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.130
mini-slots as you want.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.400
So in principle, it's
possible that every

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.860
mini-slot gets an arrival.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.190
In principle, it's possible to
get an arbitrarily large

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.210
number of arrivals.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.250
So this particular formula here
is not very intuitive

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.560
when you look at it.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.630
But it's a legitimate PMF.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.360
And it's called the
Poisson PMF.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.970
It's the PMF that describes
the number of arrivals.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.660
So that's one way of thinking
about the Poisson process,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.650
where the basic object of
interest would be this PMF and

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.520
you try to work with it.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.600
There's another way of thinking
about what happens in

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.060
the Poisson process.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.780
And this has to do with letting
things evolve in time.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.160
You start at time 0.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.080
There's going to be a time at
which the first arrival

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.000
occurs, and call that time T1.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.130
This time turns out to have an
exponential distribution with

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.340
parameter lambda.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.120
Once you get an arrival,
it's as if the

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.300
process starts fresh.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.830
The best way to understand why
this is the case is by

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.740
thinking in terms of
the analogy with

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.840
the Bernoulli process.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.660
If you believe that statement
for the Bernoulli process,

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.510
since this is a limiting case,
it should also be true.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.150
So starting from this time,
we're going to wait a random

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.710
amount of time until we get the
second arrival This random

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.250
amount of time, let's
call it T2.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.360
This time, T2 is also going
to have an exponential

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.140
distribution with the same
parameter, lambda.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.615
And these two are going to be
independent of each other.

00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:27.750
OK?

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.520
So the Poisson process has all
the same memorylessness

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.820
properties that the Bernoulli
process has.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.630
What's another way of thinking
of this property?

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:43.360
So think of a process where
you have a light bulb.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.070
The time at the light bulb burns
out, you can model it by

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.855
an exponential random
variable.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:58.170
And suppose that they tell you
that so far, we're are sitting

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.550
at some time, T. And I tell you
that the light bulb has

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.510
not yet burned out.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.290
What does this tell you about
the future of the light bulb?

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.700
Is the fact that they didn't
burn out, so far, is it good

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.720
news or is it bad news?

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.640
Would you rather keep this light
bulb that has worked for

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.950
t times steps and is still OK?

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.770
Or would you rather use a new
light bulb that starts new at

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.740
that point in time?

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.920
Because of the memorylessness
property, the past of that

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.220
light bulb doesn't matter.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.040
So the future of this light bulb
is statistically the same

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.740
as the future of a
new light bulb.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.700
For both of them, the time until
they burn out is going

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.580
to be described an exponential
distribution.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.990
So one way that people described
the situation is to

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.450
say that used is exactly
as good as a new.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.220
So a used on is no worse
than a new one.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.950
A used one is no better
than a new one.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.130
So a used light bulb that
hasn't yet burnt out is

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.180
exactly as good as
a new light bulb.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.740
So that's another way of
thinking about the

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.150
memorylessness that we have
in the Poisson process.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.350
Back to this picture.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.410
The time until the second
arrival is the sum of two

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.990
independent exponential
random variables.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.050
So, in principle, you can use
the convolution formula to

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.330
find the distribution of T1
plus T2, and that would be

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.750
what we call Y2, the time until
the second arrival.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.210
But there's also a direct
way of obtaining to the

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.580
distribution of Y2, and this is
the calculation that we did

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.340
last time on the blackboard.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.320
And actually, we did
it more generally.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.990
We found the time until the
case arrival occurs.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.860
It has a closed form formula,
which is called the Erlang

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.960
distribution with k degrees
of freedom.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.170
So let's see what's
going on here.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.230
It's a distribution
Of what kind?

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.210
It's a continuous
distribution.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.150
It's a probability
density function.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.620
This is because the time is a
continuous random variable.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.580
Time is continuous.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.320
Arrivals can happen
at any time.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.090
So we're talking
about the PDF.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.230
This k is just the parameter
of the distribution.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.450
We're talking about the
k-th arrival, so

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.210
k is a fixed number.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.440
Lambda is another parameter of
the distribution, which is the

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.660
arrival rate So it's a PDF over
the Y's, whereas lambda

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.060
and k are parameters of
the distribution.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:40.860
OK.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.630
So this was what we knew
from last time.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:51.550
Just to get some practice, let
us do a problem that's not too

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.730
difficult, but just to see how
we use the various formulas

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.470
that we have.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.930
So Poisson was a mathematician,
but Poisson

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.730
also means fish in French.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.130
So Poisson goes fishing.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:11.680
And let's assume that fish
are caught according

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.420
to a Poisson process.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.310
That's not too bad
an assumption.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.180
At any given point in time, you
have a little probability

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.840
that a fish would be caught.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.930
And whether you catch one now
is sort of independent about

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:28.210
whether at some later time a
fish will be caught or not.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.030
So let's just make
this assumption.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:35.270
And suppose that the rules of
the game are that you--

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:40.350
Fish are being called it the
certain rate of 0.6 per hour.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.390
You fish for 2 hours,
no matter what.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.190
And then there are two
possibilities.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.710
If I have caught a fish,
I stop and go home.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.320
So if some fish have been
caught, so there's at least 1

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.250
arrival during this interval,
I go home.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.760
Or if nothing has being caught,
I continue fishing

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.630
until I catch something.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.300
And then I go home.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.410
So that's the description of
what is going to happen.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.940
And now let's starts asking
questions of all sorts.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.450
What is the probability that
I'm going to be fishing for

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.060
more than 2 hours?

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.200
I will be fishing for more than
2 hours, if and only if

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.400
no fish were caught during those
2 hours, in which case,

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.140
I will have to continue.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.600
Therefore, this is just
this quantity.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.630
The probability of catching
2 fish in--

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:43.450
of catching 0 fish in the next
2 hours, and according to the

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:47.170
formula that we have, this is
going to be e to the minus

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.820
lambda times how much
time we have.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.040
There's another way of
thinking about this.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.790
The probability that I fish for
more than 2 hours is the

00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:01.230
probability that the first catch
happens after time 2,

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.990
which would be the integral
from 2 to infinity of the

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.610
density of the first
arrival time.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.770
And that density is
an exponential.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.910
So you do the integral of an
exponential, and, of course,

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.160
you would get the same answer.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.550
OK.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.730
That's easy.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.880
So what's the probability of
fishing for more than 2 but

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.420
less than 5 hours?

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.570
What does it take for
this to happen?

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:35.540
For this to happen, we need to
catch 0 fish from time 0 to 2

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:43.020
and catch the first fish
sometime between 2 and 5.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.400
So if you--

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.510
one way of thinking about what's
happening here might be

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.900
to say that there's a
Poisson process that

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.770
keeps going on forever.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:57.090
But as soon as I catch the
first fish, instead of

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.990
continuing fishing and obtaining
those other fish I

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.070
just go home right now.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:11.060
Now the fact that I go home
before time 5 means that, if I

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.990
were to stay until time
5, I would have

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.850
caught at least 1 fish.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.350
I might have caught
more than 1.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.970
So the event of interest here
is that the first catch

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.560
happens between times 2 and 5.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:32.050
So one way of calculating
this quantity would be--

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.300
Its the probability that the
first catch happens between

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.700
times 2 and 5.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.060
Another way to deal with it
is to say, this is the

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.880
probability that I caught 0 fish
in the first 2 hours and

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.170
then the probability that I
catch at least 1 fish during

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.130
the next 3 hours.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:54.780
This.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.080
What is this?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.180
The probability of 0 fish in
the next 3 hours is the

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.600
probability of 0 fish
during this time.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.480
1 minus this is the probability
of catching at

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.850
least 1 fish, of having
at least 1 arrival,

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.730
between times 2 and 5.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.310
If there's at least 1 arrival
between times 2 and 5, then I

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.140
would have gone home
by time 5.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.660
So both of these, if you plug-in
numbers and all that,

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.170
of course, are going to give
you the same answer.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.820
Now next, what's the probability
that I catch at

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.560
least 2 fish?

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.370
In which scenario are we?

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.570
Under this scenario, I go home
when I catch my first fish.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.560
So in order to catch
at least 2 fish, it

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.340
must be in this case.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.830
So this is the same as the event
that I catch at least 2

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.020
fish during the first
2 time steps.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.410
So it's going to be the
probability from 2 to

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:56.780
infinity, the probability that
I catch 2 fish, or that I

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.860
catch 3 fish, or I catch
more than that.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.109
So it's this quantity.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.730
k is the number of fish
that I catch.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.599
At least 2, so k goes
from 2 to infinity.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:13.180
These are the probabilities of
catching a number k of fish

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.859
during this interval.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.920
And if you want a simpler form
without an infinite sum, this

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.619
would be 1 minus the probability
of catching 0

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:24.880
fish, minus the probability of
catching 1 fish, during a time

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.050
interval of length 2.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.520
Another way to think of it.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.230
I'm going to catch 2 fish, at
least 2 fish, if and only if

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:40.630
the second fish caught in this
process happens before time 2.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.950
So that's another way of
thinking about the same event.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:46.230
So it's going to be the
probability that the random

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:51.440
variable Y2, the arrival time
over the second fish, is less

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.690
than or equal to 2.

00:17:55.387 --> 00:17:56.310
OK.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.000
The next one is a
little trickier.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.380
Here we need to do a little
bit of divide and conquer.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.490
Overall, in this expedition,
what the expected number of

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.840
fish to be caught?

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.550
One way to think about it is
to try to use the total

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.100
expectations theorem.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.830
And think of expected number of
fish, given this scenario,

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.010
or expected number of fish,
given this scenario.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.190
That's a little more complicated
than the way I'm

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.290
going to do it.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.240
The way I'm going to do is
to think as follows--

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.310
Expected number of fish is the
expected number of fish caught

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:37.520
between times 0 and 2 plus
expected number of fish caught

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.800
after time 2.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.580
So what's the expected number
caught between time 0 and 2?

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.860
This is lambda t.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:52.310
So lambda is 0.6 times 2.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.380
This is the expected number of
fish that are caught between

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.260
times 0 and 2.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.440
Now let's think about the
expected number of fish caught

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.630
afterwards.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.300
How many fish are being
caught afterwards?

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.110
Well it depends on
the scenario.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.750
If we're in this scenario,
we've gone home

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.800
and we catch 0.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.570
If we're in this scenario, then
we continue fishing until

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.980
we catch one.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.970
So the expected number of fish
to be caught after time 2 is

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.520
going to be the probability
of this scenario times 1.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.020
And the probability of that
scenario is the probability

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.490
that they call it's 0 fish
during the first 2 time steps

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.420
times 1, which is the number of
fish I'm going to catch if

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.790
I continue.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.960
The expected total fishing time
we can calculate exactly

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.150
the same way.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.890
I'm jumping to the last one.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.580
My total fishing time has a
period of 2 time steps.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.910
I'm going to fish for 2 time
steps no matter what.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.190
And then if I caught 0 fish,
which happens with this

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:04.540
probability, my expected time
is going to be the expected

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.920
time from here onwards, which is
the expected value of this

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.490
geometric random variable
with parameter lambda.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.430
So the expected time
is 1 over lambda.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:22.460
And in our case this,
is 1/0.6.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:31.180
Finally, if I tell you that I
have been fishing for 4 hours

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:37.800
and nothing has been caught so
far, how much do you expect

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.630
this quantity to be?

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:46.330
Here is the story that, again,
that for the Poisson process

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.720
used is as good as new.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.060
The process does not
have any memory.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.930
Given what happens in the past
doesn't matter for the future.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:58.430
It's as if the process starts
new at this point in time.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.420
So this one is going to be,
again, the same exponentially

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.910
distributed random
variable with the

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.270
same parameter lambda.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:12.270
So expected time until an
arrival comes is an

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.740
exponential distribut --

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.910
has an exponential distribution
with parameter

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.660
lambda, no matter what has
happened in the past.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.730
Starting from now and looking
into the future, it's as if

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.910
the process has just started.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:32.440
So it's going to be 1 over
lambda, which is 1/0.6.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.690
OK.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.500
Now our next example is going
to be a little more

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.780
complicated or subtle.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.800
But before we get to the
example, let's refresh our

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.300
memory about what we discussed
last time about merging

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.110
Poisson independent
Poisson processes.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.090
Instead of drawing the picture
that way, another way we could

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.260
draw it could be this.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.260
We have a Poisson process with
rate lambda1, and a Poisson

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.440
process with rate lambda2.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.320
They have, each one of these,
have their arrivals.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.780
And then we form the
merged process.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.580
And the merged process records
an arrival whenever there's an

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.930
arrival in either of
the two processes.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.730
This process in that process are
assumed to be independent

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.760
of each other.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:32.590
Now different times in this
process and that process are

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.780
independent of each other.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:39.400
So what happens in these two
time intervals is independent

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.780
from what happens in these
two time intervals.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.560
These two time intervals to
determine what happens here.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.750
These two time intervals
determine what happens there.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:53.740
So because these are independent
from these, this

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.600
means that this is also
independent from that.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.020
So the independence assumption
is satisfied

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.150
for the merged process.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:05.030
And the merged process turns out
to be a Poisson process.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:10.340
And if you want to find the
arrival rate for that process,

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.550
you argue as follows.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.000
During a little interval of
length delta, we have

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.280
probability lambda1
delta of having an

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.620
arrival in this process.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.700
We have probability lambda2
delta of an arrival in this

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.890
process, plus second
order terms in

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.860
delta, which we're ignoring.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.270
And then you do the calculation
and you find that

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.870
in this process, you're going
to have an arrival

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:37.830
probability, which is lambda1
plus lambda2, again ignoring

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.490
second order in delta--

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.650
terms that are second
order in delta.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.130
So the merged process is a
Poisson process whose arrival

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.760
rate is the sum of the
arrival rates of

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.080
the individual processes.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.290
And the calculation we did at
the end of the last lecture--

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:59.240
If I tell you that the new
arrival happened here, where

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.610
did that arrival come from?

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.910
Did it come from here
or from there?

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.720
If the lambda1 is equal to
lambda2, then by symmetry you

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.240
would say that it's equally
likely to have come from here

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.660
or to come from there.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.720
But if this lambda is much
bigger than that lambda, the

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.850
fact that they saw an arrival
is more likely to have come

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:17.850
from there.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:22.410
And the formula that captures
this is the following.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:27.300
This is the probability that my
arrival has come from this

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:32.360
particular stream rather than
that particular stream.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:38.900
So when an arrival comes and you
ask, what is the origin of

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.690
that arrival?

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:43.760
It's as if I'm flipping a
coin with these odds.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.910
And depending on outcome of that
coin, I'm going to tell

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.790
you came from there or
it came from there.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.850
So the origin of an arrival
is either this

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.610
stream or that stream.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.190
And this is the probability that
the origin of the arrival

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.510
is that one.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:04.160
Now if we look at 2 different
arrivals, and we ask about

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.570
their origins--

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.130
So let's think about the origin
of this arrival and

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:12.060
compare it with the origin
that arrival.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.010
The origin of this arrival
is random.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.720
It could be right be either
this or that.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.840
And this is the relevant
probability.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.750
The origin of that arrival
is random.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.360
It could be either here or is
there, and again, with the

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.880
same relevant probability.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.730
Question.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.780
The origin of this arrival, is
it dependent or independent

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.710
from the origin that arrival?

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.500
And here's how the
argument goes.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.740
Separate times are
independent.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:45.050
Whatever has happened in the
process during this set of

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:48.040
times is independent from
whatever happened in the

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.980
process during that
set of times.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.040
Because different times have
nothing to do with each other,

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.650
the origin of this, of an
arrival here, has nothing to

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.480
do with the origin of
an arrival there.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.890
So the origins of different
arrivals are also independent

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.850
random variables.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:12.710
So if I tell you that--

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.150
yeah.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:15.310
OK.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:19.600
So it as if that each time that
you have an arrival in

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.820
the merge process, it's as if
you're flipping a coin to

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.410
determine where did that arrival
came from and these

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:31.516
coins are independent
of each other.

00:26:31.516 --> 00:26:32.766
OK.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:35.920
OK.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.770
Now we're going to use this--

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:42.970
what we know about merged
processes to solve the problem

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:48.240
that would be harder to do, if
you were not using ideas from

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.720
Poisson processes.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.250
So the formulation of the
problem has nothing to do with

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.370
the Poisson process.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:57.450
The formulation is
the following.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.870
We have 3 light-bulbs.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.490
And each light bulb is
independent and is going to

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.920
die out at the time that's
exponentially distributed.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.170
So 3 light bulbs.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:16.630
They start their lives and
then at some point

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:21.260
they die or burn out.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.150
So let's think of this as X,
this as Y, and this as Z.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:31.220
And we're interested in the
time until the last

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.200
light-bulb burns out.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.930
So we're interested in the
maximum of the 3 random

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:41.480
variables, X, Y, and Z. And in
particular, we want to find

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.170
the expected value
of this maximum.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.490
OK.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.760
So you can do derived
distribution, use the expected

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.880
value rule, anything you want.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.230
You can get this answer using
the tools that you already

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:58.180
have in your hands.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.070
But now let us see how we can
connect to this picture with a

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.550
Poisson picture and come up
with the answer in a very

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.240
simple way.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.630
What is an exponential
random variable?

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:14.450
An exponential random variable
is the first act in the long

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:19.570
play that involves a whole
Poisson process.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:23.020
So an exponential random
variable is the first act of a

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.650
Poisson movie.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:25.660
Same thing here.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.700
You can think of this random
variable as being part of some

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.850
Poisson process that
has been running.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.040
So it's part of this
bigger picture.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.370
We're still interested in
the maximum of the 3.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.780
The other arrivals are not going
to affect our answers.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.640
It's just, conceptually
speaking, we can think of the

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.840
exponential random variable as
being embedded in a bigger

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.110
Poisson picture.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:29:00.980
So we have 3 Poisson process
that are running in parallel.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:06.150
Let us split the expected time
until the last burnout into

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.800
pieces, which is time until the
first burnout, time from

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.810
the first until the second,
and time from the

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.690
second until the third.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.570
And find the expected values of
each one of these pieces.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:24.620
What can we say about the
expected value of this?

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.310
This is the first arrival
out of all of

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.540
these 3 Poisson processes.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.070
It's the first event that
happens when you look at all

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.080
of these processes
simultaneously.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.660
So 3 Poisson processes
running in parallel.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.750
We're interested in the time
until one of them, any one of

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.380
them, gets in arrival.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.690
Rephrase.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.330
We merged the 3 Poisson
processes, and we ask for the

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:56.820
time until we observe an arrival
in the merged process.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.250
When 1 of the 3 gets an arrival
for the first time,

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.880
the merged process gets
its first arrival.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.300
So what's the expected
value of this time

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.820
until the first burnout?

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.940
It's going to be the
expected value of a

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.720
Poisson random variable.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.050
So the first burnout is going
to have an expected

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.430
value, which is--

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:21.540
OK.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.690
It's a Poisson process.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:28.530
The merged process of the 3 has
a collective arrival rate,

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:32.750
which is 3 times lambda.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:36.250
So this is the parameter over
the exponential distribution

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.870
that describes the time until
the first arrival in the

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.220
merged process.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.990
And the expected value
of this random

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.670
variable is 1 over that.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.190
When you have an exponential
random variable with parameter

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.150
lambda, the expected value
of that random

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.330
variable is 1 over lambda.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.660
Here we're talking about the
first arrival time in a

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.720
process with rate 3 lambda.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.680
The expected time until
the first arrival

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.000
is 1 over (3 lambda).

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.870
Alright.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:08.710
So at this time, this bulb, this
arrival happened, this

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.490
bulb has been burned.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:15.760
So we don't care about
that bulb anymore.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:21.610
We start at this time,
and we look forward.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.640
This bulb has been burned.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.810
So let's just look forward
from now on.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:28.900
What have we got?

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:34.030
We have two bulbs that
are burning.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.320
We have a Poisson process that's
the bigger picture of

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.270
what could happen to that light
bulb, if we were to keep

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.190
replacing it.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.880
Another Poisson process.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.610
These two processes are,
again, independent.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:50.850
From this time until that time,
how long does it take?

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.930
It's the time until either
this process records an

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:57.090
arrival or that process
records and arrival.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:01.210
That's the same as the time
that the merged process of

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.810
these two records an arrival.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.430
So we're talking about the
expected time until the first

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.710
arrival in a merged process.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.030
The merged process is Poisson.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:14.240
It's Poisson with
rate 2 lambda.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.690
So that extra time is
going to take--

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:21.390
the expected value is going to
be 1 over the (rate of that

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:22.580
Poisson process).

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.170
So 1 over (2 lambda) is
the expected value

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:26.980
of this random variable.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.870
So at this point, this bulb
now is also burned.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.620
So we start looking
from this time on.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.110
That part of the picture
disappears.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:40.150
Starting from this time, what's
the expected value

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:43.650
until that remaining light-bulb
burns out?

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:47.130
Well, as we said before, in
a Poisson process or with

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:50.090
exponential random variables,
we have memorylessness.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.120
A used bulb is as good
as a new one.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.990
So it's as if we're starting
from scratch here.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.700
So this is going to be an
exponential random variable

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.690
with parameter lambda.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:05.540
And the expected value of it is
going to be 1 over lambda.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.990
So the beauty of approaching
this problem in this

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:10.930
particular way is, of course,
that we manage to do

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:14.100
everything without any calculus
at all, without

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.990
striking an integral, without
trying to calculate

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:19.220
expectations in any form.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.150
Most of the non-trivial problems
that you encounter in

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:28.540
the Poisson world basically
involve tricks of these kind.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.830
You have a question and you try
to rephrase it, trying to

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:35.240
think in terms of what might
happen in the Poisson setting,

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.200
use memorylessness, use merging,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.080
Now we talked about merging.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.480
It turns out that the splitting
of Poisson processes

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.400
also works in a nice way.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.160
The story here is exactly
the same as for

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.820
the Bernoulli process.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.870
So I'm having a Poisson
process.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:06.060
And each time, with some rate
lambda, and each time that an

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.790
arrival comes, I'm going to send
it to that stream and the

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.179
record an arrival here with some
probability P. And I'm

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:16.120
going to send it to the other
stream with some probability 1

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.469
minus P. So either of this
will happen or that will

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.940
happen, depending on
the outcome of the

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.550
coin flip that I do.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.449
Each time that then arrival
occurs, I flip a coin and I

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:30.929
decide whether to record
it here or there.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:32.620
This is called splitting
a Poisson

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.719
process into two pieces.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:37.120
What kind of process
do we get here?

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.250
If you look at the little
interval for length delta,

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:41.810
what's the probability
that this little

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.090
interval gets an arrival?

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.739
It's the probability that this
one gets an arrival, which is

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:51.260
lambda delta times the
probability that after I get

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.210
an arrival my coin flip came out
to be that way, so that it

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:56.270
sends me there.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.740
So this means that this little
interval is going to have

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:03.620
probability lambda delta P. Or
maybe more suggestively, I

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:09.480
should write it as lambda
P times delta.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.350
So every little interval has
a probability of an arrival

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:13.470
proportional to delta.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.780
The proportionality factor is
lambda P. So lambda P is the

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.590
rate of that process.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.500
And then you go through the
mental exercise that you went

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.170
through for the Bernoulli
process to argue that a

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.520
different intervals here are
independent and so on.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.710
And that completes checking that
this process is going to

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.360
be a Poisson process.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:38.060
So when you split a Poisson
process by doing independent

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:41.040
coin flips each time that
something happens, the

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.330
processes that you get is again
a Poisson process, but

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.490
of course with a reduced rate.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:50.040
So instead of the word
splitting, sometimes people

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.330
also use the words
thinning-out.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.650
That is, out of the arrivals
that came, you keep a few but

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.000
throw away a few.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.730
OK.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:08.570
So now the last topic over
this lecture is a quite

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.270
curious phenomenon that
goes under the

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.595
name of random incidents.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.950
So here's the story.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:22.550
Buses have been running
on Mass Ave. from time

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.070
immemorial.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:29.060
And the bus company that runs
the buses claims that they

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:33.150
come as a Poisson process with
some rate, let's say, of 4

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.970
buses per hour.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:39.250
So that the expected time
between bus arrivals is going

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.500
to be 15 minutes.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.180
OK.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:45.840
Alright.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.130
So people have been complaining
that they have

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.150
been showing up there.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:51.500
They think the buses are
taking too long.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.270
So you are asked
to investigate.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.840
Is the company--

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.730
Does it operate according
to its promises or not.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:05.880
So you send an undercover agent
to go and check the

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.940
interarrival times
of the buses.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.660
Are they 15 minutes?

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.690
Or are they longer?

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:17.660
So you put your dark glasses
and you show up at the bus

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.110
stop at some random time.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:25.530
And you go and ask the guy in
the falafel truck, how long

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.370
has it been since the
last arrival?

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.310
So of course that guy works
for the FBI, right?

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:36.900
So they tell you, well, it's
been, let's say, 12 minutes

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.360
since the last bus arrival.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.960
And then you say,
"Oh, 12 minutes.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.780
Average time is 15.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.000
So a bus should be coming
any time now."

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.230
Is that correct?

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.660
No, you wouldn't
think that way.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.010
It's a Poisson process.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.810
It doesn't matter how long
it has been since

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.270
the last bus arrival.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.920
So you don't go through
that fallacy.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.970
Instead of predicting how long
it's going to be, you just sit

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:03.300
down there and wait and
measure the time.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:08.820
And you find that this is,
let's say, 11 minutes.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.260
And you go to your boss and
report, "Well, it took--

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.410
I went there and the time from
the previous bus to the next

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.310
one was 23 minutes.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.360
It's more than the 15
that they said."

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.830
So go and do that again.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:23.590
You go day after day.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:28.350
You keep these statistics of the
length of this interval.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:32.160
And you tell your boss it's
a lot more than 15.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.720
It tends to be more
like 30 or so.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.170
So the bus company
is cheating us.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:43.490
Does the bus company really run
Poisson buses at the rate

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.490
that they have promised?

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:51.270
Well let's analyze the situation
here and figure out

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:55.010
what the length of
this interval

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:57.900
should be, on the average.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.120
The naive argument is that
this interval is an

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.590
interarrival time.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:06.410
And interarrival times, on the
average, are 15 minutes, if

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:10.610
the company runs indeed Poisson
processes with these

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:11.850
interarrival times.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.970
But actually the situation is
a little more subtle because

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:19.940
this is not a typical
interarrival interval.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.440
This interarrival interval
consists of two pieces.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.810
Let's call them T1
and T1 prime.

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:32.250
What can you tell me about those
two random variables?

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:35.940
What kind of random
variable is T1?

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.950
Starting from this time, with
the Poisson process, the past

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:41.290
doesn't matter.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:43.870
It's the time until an
arrival happens.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:49.110
So T1 is going to be an
exponential random variable

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.425
with parameter lambda.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.620
So in particular, the expected
value of T1 is

00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:00.260
going to be 15 by itself.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.720
How about the random
variable T1 prime.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.130
What kind of random
variable is it?

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:14.180
This is like the first arrival
in a Poisson process that runs

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:17.650
backwards in time.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:20.330
What kind of process is a
Poisson process running

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:21.200
backwards in time?

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.030
Let's think of coin flips.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.130
Suppose you have a movie
of coin flips.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:29.480
And for some accident, that
fascinating movie, you happen

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.100
to watch it backwards.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.610
Will it look any different
statistically?

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:33.780
No.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.940
It's going to be just the
sequence of random coin flips.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.770
So a Bernoulli process that's
runs in reverse time is

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.410
statistically identical
to a Bernoulli

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.290
process in forward time.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:46.600
The Poisson process is a
limit of the Bernoulli.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.950
So, same story with the
Poisson process.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.410
If you run it backwards in
time it looks the same.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.190
So looking backwards in time,
this is a Poisson process.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:58.930
And T1 prime is the time until
the first arrival in this

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:00.260
backward process.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.910
So T1 prime is also going to
be an exponential random

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.340
variable with the same
parameter, lambda.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:11.000
And the expected value
of T1 prime is 15.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.860
Conclusion is that the expected
length of this

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:22.860
interval is going to
be 30 minutes.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.690
And the fact that this agent
found the average to be

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:31.230
something like 30 does not
contradict the claims of the

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:35.010
bus company that they're running
Poisson buses with a

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.370
rate of lambda equal to 4.

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:38.780
OK.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.390
So maybe the company can this
way-- they can defend

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:44.970
themselves in court.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.490
But there's something
puzzling here.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:50.360
How long is the interarrival
time?

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.910
Is it 15?

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.216
Or is it 30?

00:41:53.216 --> 00:41:55.750
On the average.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:59.960
The issue is what do we
mean by a typical

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.360
interarrival time.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.940
When we say typical, we mean
some kind of average.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.690
But average over what?

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:13.280
And here's two different ways
of thinking about averages.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.080
You number the buses.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.120
And you have bus number 100.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.120
You have bus number 101,
bus number 102, bus

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.660
number 110, and so on.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:29.370
One way of thinking about
averages is that you pick a

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:32.150
bus number at random.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:36.070
I pick, let's say, that bus,
all buses being sort of

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:37.760
equally likely to be picked.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:41.610
And I measure this interarrival
time.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:45.380
So for a typical bus.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:50.390
Then, starting from here until
there, the expected time has

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:56.600
to be 1 over lambda, for
the Poisson process.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.370
But what we did in
this experiment

00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:59.720
was something different.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.040
We didn't pick a
bus at random.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.090
We picked a time at random.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.870
And if the picture is, let's
say, this way, I'm much more

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:12.770
likely to pick this interval
and therefore this

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:16.290
interarrival time, rather
than that interval.

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:20.480
Because, this interval
corresponds to very few times.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.680
So if I'm picking a time at
random and, in some sense,

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.430
let's say, uniform, so that all
times are equally likely,

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:31.190
I'm much more likely to fall
inside a big interval rather

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:32.710
than a small interval.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:37.140
So a person who shows up at the
bus stop at a random time.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:42.040
They're selecting an interval in
a biased way, with the bias

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.350
favor of longer intervals.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:47.850
And that's why what they observe
is a random variable

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:51.830
that has a larger expected
value then the ordinary

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:53.080
expected value.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.780
So the subtlety here is to
realize that we're talking

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.590
between two different kinds
of experiments.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:05.250
Picking a bus number at random
verses picking an interval at

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:11.500
random with a bias in favor
of longer intervals.

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.840
Lots of paradoxes that one
can cook up using Poisson

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:19.190
processes and random processes
in general often have to do

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.340
with the story of this kind.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.780
The phenomenon that we had in
this particular example also

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.970
shows up in general, whenever
you have other kinds of

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:30.470
arrival processes.

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:34.210
So the Poisson process is the
simplest arrival process there

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:36.830
is, where the interarrival
times are

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.820
exponential random variables.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.280
There's a larger class
of models.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.580
They're called renewal
processes, in which, again, we

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.900
have a sequence of successive
arrivals, interarrival times

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.100
are identically distributed and
independent, but they may

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.320
come from a general
distribution.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.100
So to make the same point of the
previous example but in a

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.250
much simpler setting, suppose
that bus interarrival times

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.830
are either 5 or 10
minutes apart.

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.930
So you get some intervals
that are of length 5.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.790
You get some that are
of length 10.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.810
And suppose that these
are equally likely.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.990
So we have -- not exactly --

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:20.380
In the long run, we have as many
5 minute intervals as we

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.490
have 10 minute intervals.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:30.590
So the average interarrival
time is 7 and 1/2.

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:35.850
But if a person shows up at a
random time, what are they

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:37.100
going to see?

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.150
Do we have as many 5s as 10s?

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:47.490
But every 10 covers twice
as much space.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:52.640
So if I show up at a random
time, I have probability 2/3

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:57.180
falling inside an interval
of duration 10.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:00.990
And I have one 1/3 probability
of falling inside an interval

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.460
of duration 5.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.710
That's because, out of the whole
real line, 2/3 of it is

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.810
covered by intervals
of length 10, just

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:09.590
because they're longer.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.280
1/3 is covered by the
smaller intervals.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:19.530
Now if I fall inside an interval
of length 10 and I

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:23.260
measure the length of the
interval that I fell into,

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.030
that's going to be 10.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:27.780
But if I fall inside an interval
of length 5 and I

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.320
measure how long it is,
I'm going to get a 5.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:37.270
And that, of course, is going
to be different than 7.5.

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:38.010
OK.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:42.310
And which number should
be bigger?

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:45.110
It's the second number that's
bigger because this one is

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:48.930
biased in favor of the
longer intervals.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.380
So that's, again, another
illustration of the different

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:54.640
results that you get when you
have this random incidence

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.990
phenomenon.

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:59.320
So the bottom line, again, is
that if you talk about a

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.380
typical interarrival time, one
must be very precise in

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:05.370
specifying what we
mean typical.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:08.120
So typical means
sort of random.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.250
But to use the word random,
you must specify very

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:15.070
precisely what is the random
experiment that you are using.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:18.920
And if you're not careful, you
can get into apparent puzzles,

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.770
such as the following.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:25.170
Suppose somebody tells you the
average family size is 4, but

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:30.340
the average person lives
in a family of size 6.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.330
Is that compatible?

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:36.610
Family size is 4 on the average,
but typical people

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:40.110
live, on the average, in
families of size 6.

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:41.590
Well yes.

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:43.080
There's no contradiction here.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.450
We're talking about two
different experiments.

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:50.000
In one experiment, I pick a
family at random, and I tell

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.960
you the average family is 4.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:55.910
In another experiment, I pick a
person at random and I tell

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:58.310
you that this person, on the
average, will be in their

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.080
family of size 6.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.140
And what is the catch here?

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:05.440
That if I pick a person at
random, large families are

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.160
more likely to be picked.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.710
So there's a bias in favor
of large families.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.270
Or if you want to survey, let's
say, are trains crowded

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.495
in your city?

00:48:16.495 --> 00:48:19.170
Or are buses crowded?

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:22.040
One choice is to pick a bus
at random and inspect

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.220
how crowded it is.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:27.260
Another choice is to pick a
typical person and ask them,

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.080
"Did you ride the bus today?

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:33.500
Was it's crowded?" Well suppose
that in this city

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.265
there's one bus that's extremely
crowded and all the

00:48:36.265 --> 00:48:38.520
other buses are completely
empty.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.300
If you ask a person. "Was your
bus crowded?" They will tell

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.040
you, "Yes, my bus was crowded."
There's no witness

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.460
from the empty buses to testify
in their favor.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.780
So by sampling people instead
of sampling buses, you're

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.940
going to get different result.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.320
And in the process industry, if
your job is to inspect and

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.450
check cookies, you will be
faced with a big dilemma.

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:05.190
Do you want to find out how many
chocolate chips there are

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.940
on a typical cookie?

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.990
Are you going to interview
cookies or are you going to

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:13.880
interview chocolate chips and
ask them how many other chips

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.520
where there on your cookie?

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.020
And you're going to
get different

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.210
answers in these cases.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.670
So moral is, one has to be
very precise on how you

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:26.160
formulate the sampling procedure
that you have.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.330
And you'll get different
answers.
