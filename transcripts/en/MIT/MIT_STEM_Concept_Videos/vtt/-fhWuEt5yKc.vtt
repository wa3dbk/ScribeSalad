00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.380
You know gravity as the force that keeps us
from falling off this planet. But it's so

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.890
much more than that. Gravity predicts the
formation of planets, explains why they are

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.500
spherical and why the orbits of planets around
the sun are elliptical. It helped us discover

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.689
one of the planets in our own solar system,
and the formation of Saturn’s rings. Gravity

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.470
can bend and even trap light, and it governs
some of the behavior of the universe itself.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.529
In this video, we’ll look at the different
models of gravity and explore how each helps

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.440
us understand these diverse phenomena.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.850
This video is part of the Governing Rules
video series. A small number of rules describe

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.149
the physical and chemical interactions that
are possible in our universe.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.519
Hello. My name is Nergis Mavalvala. I am a
professor in the physics department at MIT,

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.769
and today I'll be talking with you about gravity.

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.890
After watching this video, you should be able
to recognize several different expressions

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.059
for gravity, and to analyze situations involving
gravity in preparation for problem-solving.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.640
We also hope that you gain an appreciation
for the universal nature of gravity and the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.730
many places its effects can be seen.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.110
There are three expressions of gravity that
scientists find useful. We're going to talk

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.120
about all three of them today: gravity near
the earth's surface, Newton's universal law

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.720
of gravity, and Einstein's gravitational field
equations, which are the core of general relativity.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.110
We'll be spending most of our time with the
second one, but we're going to start with

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.190
the simplest item and build upward and outward
from there. You should make sure that the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.560
first two equations are in your notes.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.310
Let's start with the basics: gravity near
Earth's surface. In studying Newton's Laws

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.310
we all learn that F = ma. Near Earth's surface,
that "a," acceleration, is provided by Earth's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.060
gravity. The value is almost constant, so
we use this small "g" constant to represent

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.520
it.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.360
We're all familiar with the most basic applications
of gravity - that we stay on the ground, that

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.520
objects fall downward, that we have to work
harder walking up a hill than down.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.480
There are also many applications of gravity
that are hidden from us in our day-to-day

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.100
experience. For instance, elevators use counterweights
to ease the load on the motor. As gravity

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.420
pulls on the counterweight, the tension it
puts on the cable pulls the elevator upward

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.480
and helps to balance the force of gravity
on the elevator itself.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.030
Some older mountain railways also use counterbalancing,
with one train car moving upward as the other

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.280
moves down.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.010
Pile drivers are construction machines that
rely on the pull of gravity to slam large

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.010
weights into the ground, digging holes and
driving foundations for buildings.

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.650
As useful as this simple view of gravity is,
it's fairly limited - it can't explain why

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.459
the planets are spherical instead of, say,
cube-shaped. It also can't explain the orbits

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.050
of the planets, or the action of the tides.
Let's move to a more complex expression for

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.800
gravity that can help us understand these
things.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.110
Newton's law of universal gravitation is a
powerful model that can explain many different

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.430
phenomena. Let's dive right in.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.709
Unlike the most basic view of gravity, in
which it pulls straight down, leaving Canadians

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.790
to wonder why penguins don't fall off the
planet, Newton's gravity shows that all objects

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.790
are pulled toward each other's centers. Thus,
we all stay firmly planted on Earth's surface.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.099
Because the gravitational force pulls equally
in all directions, large bodies in space tend

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:03.099
to be spherical. The Sun, all planets, and
even larger moons tend towards a spherical

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.950
shape for this reason.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.069
Newton's law of gravity also means that all
objects are pulled toward each other, such

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.839
as planets toward the sun. By solving the
differential equations that come from this

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:22.370
law, we can obtain the elliptical orbits that
all planets have as they move around their

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.219
stars.

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:29.229
We can get all sorts of ellipses, from the
near-circles we see in the inner planets,

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:36.229
to Pluto's elongated orbit, to comets that
swing far out of the solar system.

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.099
The smaller pulls that planets have toward
each other can be useful too. They're what

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:48.029
allowed us to discover Neptune, by looking
at the disturbances in the orbit of Uranus.

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:55.029
Newton's law of gravity also gave us new insight
into events on Earth, like our tides. Objects

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.439
on one side of the Earth are pulled more strongly
toward the moon than objects on the other

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.699
side, in a phenomenon called tidal forces.

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:13.699
Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, has gravitational
interactions with other smaller galaxies nearby.

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:20.620
Its disc-like shape and spiral arms may have
come from tearing those galaxies apart.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.930
We see other galaxies colliding in many other
places in the universe, as gravity pulls them

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.259
together. It actually seems to be fairly common.

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:36.819
Speaking of galaxies, Newton's law also tells
us how fast galaxies should rotate. We can

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.860
predict a particular A curve for how fast
the stars will be moving according to their

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.009
distance from the center - that's curve A
here. But when we measure the actual velocity

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:54.419
of those stars, we get B curve B instead.
This was our first indication of the existence

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.990
of dark matter - some sort of substance that
produces gravity but doesn't interact with

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.710
light. We couldn't see it, but we could see
its effects. Dark matter surrounds and is

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:13.430
part of every galaxy. In fact, there's so
much that it makes up most of the galaxy!

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.129
Physicists are still trying to figure out
what this dark matter might be.

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:23.669
We can also use Newton's law of gravity to
look beyond the structure of individual galaxies

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:30.669
- we can look at clusters of galaxies, superclusters,
and even the entire visible universe.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.360
Fair enough.

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:39.529
When we do look at things on that scale, where
individual galaxies become just dots, we can

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:45.699
see massive structures of galaxies, like this
Great Wall here, or these empty intergalactic

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.419
voids.

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:53.240
In recent years supercomputers have become
powerful enough to simulate the formation

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:59.210
of such structures in our universe. Here you
can see the result of one such simulation,

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.659
with each speck of light representing a galaxy
worth of stars or dark matter. Using Newton's

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:12.110
law of gravity, superclusters of galaxies
and intergalactic voids appear naturally!

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:19.069
A real triumph of Newton's approach was that
it worked for everything from people on Earth

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:24.249
out to some of the most distant objects we
can see.

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:30.270
But it couldn't handle everything, and that's
why we need this next part.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.759
The most powerful model of gravity is described
by Einstein's field equations, which are the

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:41.589
core of general relativity. This equation
may not make sense to you now, but later in

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:47.699
your career you may learn about something
called tensors, which are related to vectors.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:53.899
In this equation, tensors describe the gravitational
effects of both matter and energy on all

00:07:53.899 --> 00:08:01.639
things around them. This equation is very
hard to solve, even for experts. Some of the

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:06.830
cases we know how to solve tell us about black
holes and gravitational lensing, and give

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:13.169
us insight into the universe when it was very young.

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:18.520
Black holes were one of the first solutions
to Einstein's field equations. You've probably

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:24.300
heard of black holes, which are objects so
massive that they warp space and time, and

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.589
even light cannot escape their gravitational pull.

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:35.078
At the center of our galaxy, and of many large
galaxies, are supermassive black holes. We

00:08:35.078 --> 00:08:42.078
can see their effects as stars near the center
of the galaxy whip around them at high speed.

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:48.060
While black holes trap light, other massive
objects can have an effect too. Light bends

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.740
in its path as it moves past heavy objects
like stars.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.880
This can lead to gravitational lensing, in
which light from a distant object is bent

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:04.240
around both sides of a heavy object. This
lets us see multiple views of an object, or

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.630
even warped images.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:13.630
Einstein's field equations also include this
lambda value: the cosmological constant.

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:20.259
This value can be used to describe a universe
that collapses or holds steady, expands slowly,

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:25.949
or expands at an accelerating rate. Astronomers
are working to measure this value, and we

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:32.019
seem to be in the third case - a universe
that expands faster and faster.

00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:36.959
Einstein's theory of gravity remains one of
the best-tested and most accurate theories

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:43.410
in all of science. It can explain everything
that Newtonian gravity can and more, things

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.589
we wouldn't otherwise be able to predict or
understand, it can even make predictions about how

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:54.790
the universe will end. You can see why people
would be interested in studying it.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:10:00.860
These three gravitational equations describe
a huge range of phenomena in our natural world,

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:06.180
from things in our own home to the farthest
objects we can see. I hope that you will be

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:11.670
motivated to learn more about them. Understanding
these laws and being able to use them will

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:16.160
lead you to a greater appreciation of the
natural world.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.740
Now it's time to take some of the examples
we saw and examine them in a different way.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:27.550
You will need paper and something to write
with for this part of the video.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:33.339
Knowing that gravity causes a particular phenomenon
is good, but we also want to know how to describe

00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:35.310
these phenomena mathematically.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:42.230
We'll be giving you some situations that can
be described through gravity. Your job, working

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.889
in pairs or groups of three, is to determine
what information you would want in order to

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:50.110
solve a particular problem.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:55.319
For instance, let's say that we drop a rock
and want to know how long it would take to

00:10:55.319 --> 00:11:00.339
fall. We would want to know the rock's initial
height and whether air resistance would be

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:06.379
important. We might also want to double-check
the value for gravity on Earth.

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:13.069
That example is pretty simple. Let's do a
more complicated one. Given an asteroid headed

00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:18.860
toward Earth, and its velocity and location,
which approach would we need to find out whether

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:25.860
the asteroid will hit the Earth, and if so,
how long it will be before the impact?

00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:31.509
To understand an object's trajectory we need
to know about its starting point - the position

00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:37.949
of the asteroid as compared to Earth. We also
want to know how fast it's moving and in what

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:42.440
direction. We'll need to know the mass of
the Earth and of the asteroid, because both

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.860
will factor into the force applied on the
asteroid.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.910
Some things are arbitrary choices - for instance,
we can pick any coordinate system we like.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.819
Since gravity pulls objects together, we might
want to choose polar coordinates centered

00:11:57.819 --> 00:12:00.199
on the Earth to make things easier.

00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:05.769
Finally, there are some things that we'll
want to know that are of a more general nature.

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:11.529
For instance, how do we take into account
gravity from the Sun? Can we measure all of

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:16.089
our positions and velocities from the Earth's
reference frame as if it were moving with

00:12:16.089 --> 00:12:21.600
constant velocity? Should we track the Earth
as it moves in its orbit?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.959
These are things we might not know when we
start to solve a problem, and it's important

00:12:25.959 --> 00:12:27.790
to write them down.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:33.230
Now it's your turn. We'll put four problems
on the screen. Your instructor will assign

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:38.529
problems to different groups. Each group's
job is to write up a list of what information

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:43.819
you would need in order to solve the problem.
Remember, you don't need to actually solve

00:12:43.819 --> 00:12:48.649
it - just write down what you would need to
know in order to find a solution.

00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:52.591
Here are the problems. Thank you for watching our video, and good
luck with your class.
