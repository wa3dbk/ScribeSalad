00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.450
Here's a pan on a stove top. The pan's body
and handle are made out of the same material.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.139
The burner has been turned on for a little
while, and the pan body is hot enough to cook

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.730
this egg. But what about the handle? Is it
too hot to touch? Or is it cool enough to

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.759
hold? Let's find out.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.529
This video is part of the Equilibrium video
series. It is often important to determine

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.060
whether or not a system is at equilibrium,
to do this we must understand how a system's

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.660
equilibrium state is constrained by its boundary
and surroundings.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.620
Hi, my name is John Lienhard, and I am a professor
of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.310
Today, I am going to talk to you about Equilibrium
and Steady State. It's a common misconception

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.540
that Equilibrium and Steady State are the
same. In this video, we'll take a closer look

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.690
at these concepts and see how they differ.
In order to understand this video, you should

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.970
be familiar with the First and Second Laws
of Thermodynamics, the meaning of thermal

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.800
equilibrium, and the concept of heat flow
rate, which is heat transfer per unit time.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.960
After watching this video, you will be able
to identify whether a system is at equilibrium

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.960
or at steady state, and to describe the difference
between Thermal Equilibrium and Steady State.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.780
This metal bar has been sitting in a large
room for a long period of time. In this example,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.190
we can assume that the room, which acts as
the surroundings, is very large, much larger

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.250
than the bar, which acts as our system. Heat
transfer from the bar to the room acts as

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.710
energy transfer across the system boundary.
We'll assume that the volume of the bar and

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.658
pressure of the room are constant. In other
words, no mechanical work is done.

00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:04.659
The temperature of the bar is 25°C and the
temperature of the room is also 25°C. Even

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.449
though the molecules in the air are colliding
with the atoms on the surface of the bar,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:14.700
there is no net transfer of energy between
the room and the bar. The temperature of both

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.700
the bar and the room remain constant at 25°C.
In thermodynamic terms, we say that the bar

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.450
and the room are in thermal equilibrium.
Because there is no difference in temperature,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.290
there is no heat transfer between the bar
and the room. What if we wanted the temperature

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.230
of the bar to be larger than that of the room,
and we wanted it to remain that way? Pause

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.230
the video and think about how we might do
this.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.170
Of course, if we simply place a bar at 45°C
in the room, the small bar will lose energy

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.440
to the large room until both the bar and room
are once again at thermal equilibrium at a

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.440
temperature approximately equal to but ever
so slightly higher than 25°C.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.690
You might have suggested connecting some sort
of heating element to the bar. Let's try this

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.569
and see what happens. Here's the bar after
it has been left on a heater for a long time.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.030
As you might have expected, the bar is hottest
where it's touching the heater, and coolest

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.319
at the opposite end. There is a temperature
gradient between these two points, but this

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.920
gradient doesn't change over time.
In this case, would you say the bar is at

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.329
thermal equilibrium with the room? Why or
why not? Pause the video here and discuss

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:50.329
this with a partner.
We know that energy is being continuously

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.400
transferred from the heater to the metal bar.
And we also know that the temperature profile

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.959
of the bar is not changing; in other words,
it's not getting any hotter or cooler. That

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.459
means the bar must be transferring the energy
it's gaining from the heater to the air in

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:17.060
the room. And that means it cannot be in thermal
equilibrium with the room.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.060
Now, in order for the temperature profile
to be constant in time, the heat flow rate

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.970
from the heater into the bar must be constant
and equal to the heat flow rate from the bar

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.240
to the room. We could use a new term to describe
these conditions -- we could say that the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.050
bar is at steady state.
A quantity is at Steady State when it is constant

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.870
with respect to time. In other words, the
partial derivative of the quantity with respect

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.310
to time is zero. The metal bar is at steady
state because the time derivative of its temperature

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.870
at any point is zero. This happens when the
heat flow rate into the bar and out of the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.870
bar are equal and constant.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.750
Let's go back to the heated pan which was
left on the stove for a long time. Do you

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.160
think the pan handle will be too hot to touch,
or cool enough to hold?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.550
Use the concepts of thermal equilibrium and
steady state temperature to think of circumstances

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.340
in which the handle might be too hot, or cool
enough, to hold. You might consider how the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.880
handle is attached to the pan, or how well
the handle transfers heat to the room. Pause

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.880
the video here and discuss.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.630
How many scenarios did you come up with? There
are many, but let's start with two extreme

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.500
cases.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.680
What would happen if the handle and pan were
in perfect thermal contact, and both were

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.270
completely isolated from the room? Eventually,
the handle would reach the same temperature

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.610
as the pan. This is what that would look like:
the temperature of the pan and handle are

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.610
identical and constant. So, the handle is
in thermal equilibrium with the pan. What

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.100
can you say about the transfer of heat from
the pan to the handle once the pan and handle

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:24.100
are in this situation? Pause the video and
discuss. The rate of heat transfer must be

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.250
zero -- if it wasn't, the handle would keep
getting hotter, which is impossible, assuming

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.150
that the temperature of the pan is constant.
The heat flow rate from the handle to the

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.530
room is also zero, because we assumed the
handle is isolated from the room.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:54.530
So, the heat flow rates into and out of the
handle are exactly the same - zero and constant.

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.919
And steady state occurs when the flow rate
in equals the flow rate out, even if they're

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:07.919
both zero. So this scenario, which we've been
describing as "equilibrium," is really just

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:14.699
a limiting case of steady state. And that's
true for all systems at thermal equilibrium:

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:21.389
they are all at steady state with respect
to temperature. But the opposite is not true:

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:27.270
not all systems at steady state are in thermal
equilibrium. In this case, the handle will

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:33.169
obviously be too hot to hold, since it's the
same temperature as the pan.

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:38.199
Now let's consider the opposite case. What
would happen if the handle were completely

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:44.909
insulated from the pan? The handle would be
at thermal equilibrium with the room, and

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:49.849
would stay that way no matter how hot the
pan got. The temperature of the handle would

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:56.849
be exactly the same as that of the air. Just
as in our first case, both the heat flow rate

00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:04.520
from the pan to the handle and from the handle
to the air are zero and constant. Thus, this

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.910
case of "thermal equilibrium" is really just
another limiting case of steady-state temperature,

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:16.349
except, of course, the handle will be cool
enough to hold. Both of these cases are great

00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:21.030
thought experiments. But they could never
happen in real life, because it's impossible

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:27.160
to completely isolate one component of a system
from another. In case 1, it would be impossible

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:33.179
to isolate the pan and handle from the room;
and in case 2, it would be impossible to isolate

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.219
the handle from the pan. So are we any closer
to figuring out whether we can pick up this

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:42.499
pan or not? Let's keep going...

00:08:42.499 --> 00:08:47.319
Let's go back to our first case and refine
our thinking. We originally assumed that the

00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:52.670
pan and handle were in perfect thermal contact,
and that the pan and handle were totally isolated

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:59.209
from the room. Let's keep the first assumption,
but change the second assumption. In other

00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:05.850
words, we will allow for some flow of heat
from the handle to the room. Now what happens

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:11.019
as we heat up the pan? We can assume that
the heat flow rate from the pan to the handle

00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:16.899
is initially larger than the heat flow rate
from the handle to the room. This is reasonable

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:21.459
because the pan is initially much hotter than
the handle.

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:27.489
So the handle will definitely heat up, just
like our metal bar from before. As long as

00:09:27.489 --> 00:09:30.899
the flow of heat from the pan to the handle
is greater than the flow of heat from the

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:37.050
handle to the room, the handle will get hotter.
And also just like our metal bar, it will

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:42.509
be hottest closest to the pan, and coolest
far away from it.

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:46.699
As the temperature of the handle rises, the
heat flow rate from the handle to the room

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:53.480
will also rise. And eventually, it will equal
the heat flow rate from the pan to the handle.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.050
In other words, after some length of time
the handle will be losing energy to the room

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:05.050
at exactly the same rate as it's gaining energy
from the pan. When this happens, the temperature

00:10:05.199 --> 00:10:10.379
gradient along the handle will stop changing,
and the system will be at steady state with

00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:17.379
respect to temperature. But, remember: it
will not be in thermal equilibrium. So, can

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:25.329
we say whether the handle is too hot to hold?
No! That depends on the exact temperature

00:10:25.329 --> 00:10:30.779
distribution when the system reaches steady
state. Take a moment to sketch a temperature

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:36.449
profile that describes a steady-state situation
wherein all or part of the handle is too hot

00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:43.449
to touch. What values of the heat flow rate
from the pan to the handle could result in

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:49.350
a handle that is too hot to touch. What characteristics
of the pan, handle and/or room could produce

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:56.350
this profile? Pause the video and discuss
this with a partner.

00:10:58.269 --> 00:11:05.269
Okay, we're at our final scenario. Let's review
the previous cases.

00:11:08.309 --> 00:11:13.689
In case 1, we assumed the pan and handle were
in perfect thermal contact and that the system

00:11:13.689 --> 00:11:19.459
was completely isolated from the room. In
case 2, the handle was completely isolated

00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:21.559
from the pan.

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:27.049
In both case 1 and case 2, the handle was
in thermal equilibrium -- there was no transfer

00:11:27.049 --> 00:11:32.709
of heat into or out of the system. The handle
was also at steady state with respect to temperature.

00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:37.100
Make sure that you can explain why this is
true.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.249
In case 3, we went back to our assumption
of perfect thermal contact between the pan

00:11:41.249 --> 00:11:48.009
and the handle, but we allowed for some heat
transfer from the handle to the room. For

00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:52.999
this final case, let's pick and choose the
most reasonable assumptions from our previous

00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:58.689
cases and build from there. We'll assume that
the handle can exchange heat with the room.

00:11:58.689 --> 00:12:04.970
We'll also assume that the pan and handle
are insulated from each other. This is reasonable,

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:11.220
because if you're a pan designer, you don't
want your customers burning their hands! But

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:17.029
of course, there is no such thing as perfect
insulation, so we have to allow for at least

00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:23.139
some heat transfer between the pan and handle.
If the rate of heat flow from the pan to the

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:28.170
handle is extremely small, what can you say
about the temperature profile across the handle

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:33.949
once the system reaches steady state? Pause
the video and sketch a possible steady state

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:37.470
temperature profile in the handle.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:44.470
Here's one. If the rate of heat flow from
the pan to the handle is very low, the system

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:51.959
will reach a steady state temperature well
before the majority of the handle gets hot.

00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:56.739
There will be a very small region near the
pan where the handle is hotter than the room,

00:12:56.739 --> 00:13:03.420
but most of the handle will be close to the
temperature of the room. So let's answer our

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:08.569
original question. Will the pan handle be
too hot to hold or will it be comfortable

00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:14.949
to touch? Let's look at a thermal image of
the pan after it has been left on the stove

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:21.949
for 30 minutes. It looks like we predicted
in case 4! A very small portion of the handle

00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:28.389
is warmer than the room, but most of the handle
is at room temperature. Remember, this does

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:33.929
not mean that the handle is in thermal equilibrium
with the room. There is a constant but small

00:13:33.929 --> 00:13:39.239
rate of heat flow from the pan to the handle,
and an equal rate of heat flow from the handle

00:13:39.239 --> 00:13:41.259
to the room.

00:13:41.259 --> 00:13:45.109
The handle was designed to reach a steady-state
temperature that is comfortable to hold without

00:13:45.109 --> 00:13:52.109
a glove. This is a well-designed pan!

00:13:53.589 --> 00:13:57.989
You now have the tools to understand that
Thermal Equilibrium and Steady State temperature

00:13:57.989 --> 00:14:03.589
are different. We saw that if the temperatures
of all parts of a system do not change with

00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:10.199
time, the system can either be at steady state
or at thermal equilibrium. If the net heat

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:15.790
flow is constant and nonzero as for our metal
bar on the heater, the system will have a

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:22.790
steady temperature profile. If it is constant
and zero, as for our metal bar at room temperature,

00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:29.569
the system is at thermal equilibrium. So,
equilibrium is just a special case of steady

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:35.889
state. We were able to apply our understanding
of thermal equilibrium and steady state temperature

00:14:35.889 --> 00:14:41.499
to describe the temperature profile of a pan
left on the stove for a long time and to understand

00:14:41.499 --> 00:14:48.339
the design elements that led to that profile.
I hope you enjoyed this video.

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:54.579
Good luck in your studies.
