00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.580
How do neurons send chemical signals to neighboring
neurons? Why do you wear a jacket in the winter?

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.270
Why do some animals have circulatory systems?
These questions depend on random walks and

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.450
diffusion.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.880
In this video, using a very simple model,
you will learn the fundamental difference

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.029
between a regular and a random walk, and be
able to predict the consequences of that difference

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.720
for biophysical systems.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.120
This video is part of the Probability and
Statistics video series.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.559
Many events and phenomena are probabilistic.
Engineers, designers, and architects often

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.790
use probability distributions to predict system
behavior.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.479
Hi, my name is Sanjoy Mahajan, and I'm a professor
of Applied Science and Engineering at Olin

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:49.690
College.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.960
Before watching this video, you should be
familiar with moments of distributions and

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.010
with concentration gradients.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790
After watching this video, you will be able
to:

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.659
Describe the difference between regular and
random walks.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:08.659
And, explain the structure of Fick's law for
flux.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.650
Between neurons, molecules travel by diffusion.
They wander a bit, collide, change directions,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.980
wander back, collide again, and higgle and
jiggle their way across the neural gap (the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.350
synaptic cleft).

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.550
Here is a diagram of it. This is the inside
of one neuron, here is the inside of the other

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.039
neuron, and here is the synaptic cleft in
which there are molecules wandering across

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.300
from the left neuron to the right where they
are received and picked up and used to generate

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.800
a signal in the second neuron.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.080
An extremely simple model of this process,
which has the merit of containing all the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.340
essential physics, is a molecule making a
random walk on a one-dimensional number line:

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.780
To further simplify our life, this model molecule
moves only at every clock tick, and sits peacefully

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.810
waiting for the clock tick. At each clock
tick, it moves left or right by one unit,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.170
with equal probability (50 percent) of moving
in each direction.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.970
Our molecule here, after a few ticks, has
reached x=4. So the probability of finding

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.970
it at x=4 is 1. What will happen to it in
the next time ticks? After the next tick,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.849
the molecule is equally likely to be at 3
or 5. That changes the probability distribution

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.180
to the following.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.019
Thus, although we don't know exactly where
it will be, we know that the expected value

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.209
of x is still 4.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.060
Pause the video here, and find the expected
value after one more tick -- that is, two

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.060
ticks after it was known to be at 4.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:53.389
You should have found that the expected value
is still 4. Here is the probability distribution.

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:59.279
It has a one-fourth chance to be at 2, a one-half
chance to be at 4, and a one-fourth chance

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.519
to be at 6.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:07.519
Thus, the expected value of x is ¼ times
2 + ½ times 4 + ¼ times 6, which equals

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.989
4. In short, the expected value never changes.
Alone, it is thus not a good way of characterizing

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.730
how the molecule wanders. We also need to
characterize the spread in its position.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.730
Thus, we use a higher moment, the second moment,
the expected value of x-squared. At first

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.168
when the molecule was at x=4 right here, and
it was for sure there, then the expected value

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:39.819
of x^2 was just 4^2 or 16.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:46.819
What about after one clock tick? Pause the
video here and work out

00:03:54.668 --> 00:04:01.669
You should have found that

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.918
We find that the expected value of x-squared
equals 18.

00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:26.880
Hmm, it seems like the expected value increases
by 1 with every clock tick. That's true in

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.950
general, no matter how many ticks you wait,
or where the molecule started. Thus, for a

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.909
molecule starting at the origin (at 0), the
expected value of x-squared is just the number

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:43.370
of clock ticks.
This equality is fascinating, because it contains

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.030
the difference between this kind of walk,
a random walk, and a regular walk. If the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.250
molecule did a regular walk, moving one step
every clock tick, without switching directions,

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.100
then the number of clock ticks would be the
expected value of x, not x^2.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.060
The random walk is fundamentally different,
and that fundamental difference will explain,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.120
among a vast number of physical phenomena,
why you wear a jacket in the winter, and why

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.260
some animals have circulatory systems.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.420
Now, instead of speaking of counting clock
ticks, let's measure actual time. Instead

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.420
of counting units left or right, let's measure
actual distance. If each clock tick takes

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.860
time tau, and each distance unit is lambda,
instead of one, as before, then these relationships

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.810
here change slightly to include the dimensions
and units. For the regular walk, x is lambda

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:45.280
times the number of ticks. The number of clock
ticks is t/tau, so the expected value of x

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.900
squared is lambda squared times t/Tau here.
And here we have lambda times T/Tau for the

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.230
regular walk.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.650
In the regular walk we can rewrite that as
Lambda/Tau times T. That lambda/tau here has

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:07.650
a special name: the speed. In a random walk,
the constant of proportionality is lambda^2/tau.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.240
This constant lambda squared/Tau, which has
dimensions of length squared/time, is the

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.990
diffusion constant D.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.400
Let's see how "fast" a random walk goes, in
comparison with a regular walk.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.750
Suppose that the molecule has to cross the
narrow gap between two neurons, a synaptic

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:33.750
cleft, which has width L. If we wait long
enough, until

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:45.100
How long do we wait on average? Until "t"
here is about L^2 / D. Thus, the "speed" of

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.680
the random walk is something like the distance
divided by this time t, and that time t is

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.659
the distance squared divided by the diffusion
constant. So this speed is the diffusion constant

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:57.790
divided by distance.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.170
Again we see the fundamental difference between
a regular and a random walk. A regular walk

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:09.320
has a constant speed here of lambda over tau,
as long as lambda and tau don't change. In

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:16.320
contrast, in a random walk, the speed is inversely
proportional to the gap L.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.050
This result explains the structure of Fick's
Law for the flux of stuff. Flux is particles

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.640
per area per time.
Flux, say's Fick's law, equals the diffusion

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.450
constant times the concentration gradient
dn/dx, where n is the concentration.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.150
How are the flux and diffusion velocity connected?

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:47.150
Well flux is also equal to the concentration
n times the speed. And here the speed is D/L.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.720
But where did the dx here and the dn here
come from? What do those have to do with n

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.550
and L?

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:02.110
Imagine two regions. One with concentration
n1 and another with concentration n2, separated

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.480
by a distance delta x.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.930
So this is the concentration of neurotransmitter
here at one end and concentration of neurotransmitter

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.870
here at the other end of say, a gap. We could
use this same model for oxygen in a circulatory

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.580
system.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:23.430
Then the flux in one direction is this and
in the reverse direction, it's this. The net

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:28.360
flux is n2-n1 times D/delta x.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.979
So we've explained the d and the delta x in
Fick's law over here. What about the dn? Well

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:41.979
n2-n1 is the difference in n, or just dn,
so this piece here is dn. This is dx, and

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.760
this is D.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:49.320
So we arrive at Fick's Law based on the realization
that flux is concentration times speed, and

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.029
the speed here in a random walk is the diffusion
constant divided by L. And that's why you

00:08:55.029 --> 00:09:00.700
wear a coat, rather than a thin shirt, in
the winter. The thin shirt has a dx of maybe

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.420
2 mm. But the winter coat may be 2 cm thick.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.450
That reduces the heat flux by a factor of
10 through your coat compared to the shirt.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:15.040
And you can stay warm just using the heat
produced by your basal metabolism -- about

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.950
100 Watts.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.640
For our final calculations, let's return to
the neurotransmitter and then discuss circulatory

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.920
systems.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.370
How long would it take a neurotransmitter
molecule to diffuse across a 20 nm synaptic

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:33.260
cleft? The diffusion constant for a typical
neurotransmitter molecule wandering in water,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:39.340
which is mostly what's in between neurons,
is about 10^-10 m^2/s.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:46.340
Pause the video here and make your estimate
of the time.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.370
You should have found that the time is about
4 microseconds.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.690
Is that time short or long? It's short, because
it's much smaller than, say, the rise time

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:04.260
of a nerve signal or the timing accuracy of
nerve signals. Over the short distance of

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:10.430
the synaptic cleft, diffusion is a fast and
efficient way to transport molecules.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.980
How does this analysis apply to a circulatory
system? Imagine a big organism, say you or

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.520
me, but without a circulatory system.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.960
How long would oxygen need to diffuse from
the lung to a leg muscle say, one meter away?

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.550
That's where the oxygen is needed to burn
glucose and produce energy. Oxygen, a small

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.400
molecule, has a slightly higher diffusion
constant than a neurotransmitter molecule

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.560
does--D is roughly 1x10^-9 meters squared/sec.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:45.560
Pause the video and make your estimate of
the diffusion time.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:53.580
You should have found that the diffusion time
is roughly...10 to the ninth seconds!

00:10:53.580 --> 00:11:00.580
That's roughly 30 years! Over long distances,
diffusion is a lousy method of transport!

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:06.089
That's why we need a circulatory system. Using
a dense network of capillaries, the circulatory

00:11:06.089 --> 00:11:11.680
system brings oxygen-rich blood near every
cell...and only then, when the remaining distance

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:18.680
is tiny, does it let diffusion finish the
job!

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.720
In this video, we saw how a random walk, which
is the process underlying diffusion, is fundamentally

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.210
different from a regular walk, and how that
difference explains the structure of Fick's

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.120
law and allows us to estimate diffusion times.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.790
The moral is that we live and breathe based
on the random walk, whose physics we can understand

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:46.790
with a simple number line and moments of distributions.
