00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.129
What is light? Scientists have been trying
to answer this question for hundreds of years.

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:14.049
The process goes a little like this: we set
up an experiment and make observations about

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.100
what light does. Then, using the data from
our experiment and all the previous experiments,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.170
we make a model—or models—of what we think
light is. This process continues as more experiments

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.190
are done and the models are refined. In this
video, we'll use everything we know about

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.629
what light does to explain the different models
of what light is.

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.760
This video is part of the Representations
video series. Information can be represented

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.839
in words, through mathematical symbols, graphically,
or in 3-D models. Representations are used

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.920
to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding
of objects, systems, and processes.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.299
Hello. My name is Paola Rebusco. I am a physics
instructor in the Experimental Studies Group

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:07.299
at MIT. Today I'll be talking with you about
different models of light.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.450
In order to understand this video, you'll
need to be familiar with the electromagnetic

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.640
spectrum—particularly, the idea that there
are varieties of light that our eyes cannot

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.079
see. You should also be familiar with the
behavior of waves, especially diffraction

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:30.579
and interference. Finally, you should have
some experience solving problems with collisions,

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.090
so that you better understand how particles
interact with each other.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.320
After watching this video, you should be able
to explain the major models of light, and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.869
should also be able to explain the different
facets of light in terms the models that best

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.158
describe them. This video should also help
you to understand how models are used and

00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:54.929
verified in science.

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.109
Let's start by looking at the things that
light does. We cannot expect to describe what

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.990
light is without having a good picture of
its behavior. We are going to make a list

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.990
and refer to it later, so be sure to take
notes. First, we know that light moves very

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.220
quickly.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.700
When it reaches an object, light can interact
in many ways. It might be transmitted through

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.930
the object, be reflected off, or be absorbed.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.750
However, beams of light that pass through
each other come out unchanged.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.300
Light can refract, changing directions as
it moves from one material to another.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.100
It can also diffract as it passes through
small openings.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.060
When light passes by a charged particle, it
can make that particle oscillate back and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.430
forth.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.010
There are many kinds of light, some of them
invisible to us.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.650
It can strip electrons away from atoms, ionizing
them almost instantly.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.010
Light can collide with particles.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.150
Finally, light can transfer energy and momentum
almost instantaneously, but it can also do

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.150
so in a gradual way. Some of the atomic-scale
phenomena listed are actually the reason for

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.650
the macroscopic phenomena. For instance, light
that strips away electrons from atoms is absorbed

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.010
in the process.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:37.010
Take a moment to make sure you have all of
this in your notes. These observations can

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.320
help us create a model for light. When we
talk about "what light is," what we're really

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.230
doing is creating a model. A model in physics
is a representation -- a mental analogy that

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.230
we can use to better understand the physical
world. Once we have a model, we can predict

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.930
the behavior of an object or phenomenon based
on the ways that the model would behave.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.040
It's important to understand that no model
is perfect -- all models go through cycles

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.040
of testing and refinement. There are typically
conditions under which a model can break down,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.710
giving incorrect results. However, because
models are just analogies, we often create

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.660
a new and improved one to better describe
how something works. A single phenomenon can

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.659
be modeled in many different ways, with different
assumptions or simplifications. Therefore,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.750
we can even use more than one model for the
same thing. To give an example, imagine describing

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.720
gravity as an invisible rope holding objects
together. There are several good things about

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.720
this model. Ropes can only pull, not push,
and this is true for gravity. Ropes can be

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.650
used to swing objects in curved paths, the
same way that gravity makes the planets move

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.670
in curved paths.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:15.670
Unfortunately, the model breaks down quickly.
The amount of force a rope exerts does not

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.870
change with the length of the rope, whereas
gravity's force definitely does depend on

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.590
distance. Ropes can become tangled, whereas
gravity has nothing to tangle.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.810
We can see that this model works for some
purposes, but not for others. Let's consider

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.659
some of the things we might want to use to
build our model for light. We know from our

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:51.190
list that light can pass through other light,
can diffract and refract, and that it can

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.330
make charged particles oscillate.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.419
You may have heard light described in terms
of rays of light, or waves, or particles called

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:08.419
photons. Which one of these models seems to
fit these observations? Pause the video to

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.320
consider.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.320
If we consider waves, we know that waves can
pass through each other, that they diffract

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:31.150
and refract, and that waves can make particles
oscillate. These match the properties of light

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.490
that we chose very well.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:41.470
The fact that light specifically makes charged
particles oscillate is an indication that

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:47.790
we are likely dealing with an electromagnetic
phenomenon. Therefore, we can model light

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:54.790
as an electromagnetic wave. As you probably
know, this is a common model for light. We

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.850
imagine a situation similar to the animation
shown to the right, where electromagnetic

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:07.830
waves propagate in the direction that the
light is shining. This animation shows the

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:14.830
electric field vectors as the wave moves to
the right. Below is another image that shows

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:21.900
the electric field in red and the magnetic
field in blue, perpendicular to each other.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:28.760
However, there is a problem. Light cannot
be just a wave. Let's look at the reasons

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.310
why.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:36.699
In addition to the aspects that are wave-like,
light has other properties. Light can also

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:43.699
collide with particles of matter. Waves, on
the other hand, move through or around particles.

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:52.300
Light can transfer momentum and energy almost
instantaneously through these collisions;

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:59.300
waves must transfer energy and momentum gradually.
Finally, light can ionize atoms almost instantly,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.270
but electromagnetic waves would need more
time to do this because of that gradual energy

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.210
transfer.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:15.210
It is clear that light cannot be just a wave.
Waves model some aspects of light well, but

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:22.669
not others. How else might we model light?
Consider the aspects that we just discussed,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:31.040
and try to come up with an alternative model.
Pause the video here to discuss.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:42.299
The other major model for light is the particle
model. Particles can collide with each other,

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:48.329
and in the process, they transfer momentum
and energy almost instantly. Through these

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:53.569
collisions, they can quickly knock electrons
loose from their atoms.

00:08:53.569 --> 00:08:59.660
It is because of this that a beam of light
can also be modeled as a large number of tiny

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:06.660
particles, called photons. If we return to
our list, we can see that some of the items,

00:09:06.749 --> 00:09:13.629
shown in red, are described well by the wave
model. Others, shown in blue, are the items

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:20.029
we just discussed for the particle model.
We cannot deny that light does all of these

00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:27.019
things. Experiments show us that it behaves
like a particle in some ways, and like a wave

00:09:27.019 --> 00:09:34.019
in other ways. This leads to a phenomenon
called "wave-particle duality." In some situations

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:42.649
light seems to behave in a manner predicted
by the wave model. At other times it behaves

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:49.360
in a particle-like way. We cannot rely just
on the wave model of light, or just on the

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:56.360
particle model. Neither of our models works
in every possible situation. Scientists and

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:03.149
engineers typically set up situations to take
advantage of one model or the other, using

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:08.879
the particle-like or wave-like behaviors of
light to their advantage.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:13.929
We should also mention here that it's not
just light that has the properties of both

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:20.929
particles and waves. All things -- electrons,
protons, any form of matter -- can be made

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:28.160
to behave like particles or like waves. This
was one of the driving forces behind the development

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.509
of quantum physics in the early 19th century.
One of the most striking experiments in this

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:41.199
area is the double-slit experiment, in which
light is directed towards a pair of thin slits

00:10:41.199 --> 00:10:44.990
and a pattern appears on a detecting screen.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:50.860
The screen is capable of detecting individual
photons one at a time, which can be explained

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.480
by the particle model.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.879
However, the pattern is created through the
interference and diffraction of light, which

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:06.879
can only be explained through the wave model.
This experiment gives the same results with

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:14.220
matter as with light. If we use an electron
source rather than a laser, we can create

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:21.220
a beam of electrons forming the same pattern.
This shows that matter can also be represented

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:28.740
as a particle and as a wave. In the modern
view of quantum physics, objects are often

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:35.309
represented as "probability wave packets."
These are localized collections of waves that

00:11:35.309 --> 00:11:42.309
describe where those objects may be found.
The wavepacket approach is more accurate than

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:47.610
the wave model or the particle model, but
is also difficult to fully understand and

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:53.550
to make calculations with. The separate wave
and particle models are both still in common

00:11:53.550 --> 00:12:00.550
use today. Models are useful for many purposes.
Two of the most common are describing the

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:09.259
mechanism for an existing phenomena and predicting
new phenomena that may be discovered. Rather

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:13.809
than ask you to come up with entirely new
predictions of what light might be able to

00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:20.809
do, we will instead look at some known phenomena
that we have not yet discussed.

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:25.920
Each of the four phenomena listed here can
be described using either the wave model or

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.149
the particle model of light. Your professor
will lead the class in a debate as to which

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:38.149
model is most could best describe each phenomenon.
Pause the video here. Let's look at #3 on

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:50.379
that list: that an accelerating electric charge
can generate light. Would the wave model or

00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:54.769
the particle model predict this result?

00:12:54.769 --> 00:13:01.350
The fact that an electric charge is involved
definitely points toward an electromagnetic

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:08.019
wave description of light. We know that moving
electric charges create both magnetic and

00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:15.019
electric fields. If our charge is accelerating,
then the fields that it creates must be changing.

00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:22.989
As we learned earlier in this course, changing
electromagnetic fields obey a wave equation.

00:13:22.989 --> 00:13:29.989
It seems like this particular phenomenon is
best described using a wave model. Let's review.

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:36.999
The core idea for today's video was the concept
of a model. We saw that light can be modeled

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:43.999
as an electromagnetic wave, or as a particle.
Models like these are used to describe existing

00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:51.110
phenomena and to improve our understanding.
They can also be used to predict new phenomena.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:57.259
I hope you have enjoyed this introduction
to light and wave-particle duality. Good luck

00:13:57.259 --> 00:14:04.139
in your further studies of physics.
