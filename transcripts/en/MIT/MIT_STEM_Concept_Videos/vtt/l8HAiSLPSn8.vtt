00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.520
Molecules aren't flat. They're three dimensional,
and that has implications for their physical

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.500
and chemical properties. For example, X-ray
crystallography labs at MIT determine the

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.599
3D shapes of protein molecules to design drugs
that will fit into these proteins. In this

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.050
video, you'll learn about an empirical model
chemists use to predict a molecule's 3D shape

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.589
from its Lewis structure.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.720
This video is part of the Representations
video series. Information can be represented

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.809
in words, through mathematical symbols, graphically,
or in 3-D models. Representations are used

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.879
to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding
of objects, systems, and processes.

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.829
Hi. My name is Cathy Drennan and I am a professor
in the chemistry department at MIT. I hope

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.539
you have been enjoying your general chemistry
course at SUTD.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.500
After watching this video, you will be able
to use the VSEPR model to predict 3D molecular

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.089
structures from 2D Lewis structures and...
...discuss some of the assumptions of the

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.880
VSEPR model. Before watching this video, you
should be able to draw Lewis structures for

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.759
simple molecules.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:08.240
We can determine molecular shape experimentally
or predict it with varying degrees of accuracy

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.409
using empirical and theoretical models.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:08.850
The model that will be introduced in this
video, the Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.659
Model, or the VSEPR model, is an empirical
model, but works quite well for most simple

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:09.810
Because it is an empirical model, the VSEPR
model was constructed by looking for patterns

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.130
The VSEPR model, which builds off of Lewis
theory, is based on the idea that regions

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.729
of high electron density repel one another.
Let's take a look at the Lewis structure for

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.600
NF3 to see what that means. The VSEPR model
focuses on the central atoms of molecules...

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.680
...and assumes that bonding atoms... ...and
lone pairs on the central atom are spaced

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.590
as far apart as possible from each other to
minimize electron repulsions, but at the same

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.789
time are equidistant from the central atom.
The VSEPR model attributes lone pairs of electrons

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.539
with having a stronger repulsion than bonded
electrons. And finally, the VSEPR model treats

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.829
multiple bonds between 2 atoms as a single
region of electron density.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.399
Let's apply the VSEPR model to a few molecules.
For example, if we look at nitrous oxide,

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.570
we see that there are... ...2 atoms bonded
to the central atom and zero lone pairs of

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.789
electrons on the central atom. To minimize
electron repulsions, we will maximize the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.400
distance between the two bonded atoms by placing
them along a line on either side of the central

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.310
N atom. We can also see that if we placed
one of the bonded atoms elsewhere, we would

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.090
not have maximized the distance between the
bonded atoms. We would describe nitrous oxide

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.090
as having a linear geometry. In a linear molecule,
the bond angle between atoms is 180 degrees.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.870
Note that when we examined the Lewis structure
for nitrous oxide, the triple bonded nitrogen

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.319
was treated the same as the single bonded
oxygen atom. Chapter Break Now, if we followed

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.110
a similar procedure for sulfur trioxide, ... we
see that there are 3 atoms bonded to the central

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.610
atom and zero lone pairs on the central atom.
To maximize the distance of the bonding atoms

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.769
from each other, we will space them 120 degrees
apart around the central atom... ...on the

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.769
vertices of an equilateral triangle. We would
describe sulfur trioxide as a trigonal planar

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.890
molecule... ...with bond angles of 120 degrees.
Chapter Break Now let's take a look at SO2.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.159
Notice that you can draw resonance structures
for SO2, but because VSEPR doesn't distinguish

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.459
b/w single and multiple bonds, we can look
at any resonance structure when predicting

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.709
geometry. So let's just focus on one of these
structures. What do you think the geometry

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.060
of this molecule will be? Pause the video,
draw a picture or construct the molecule using

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.329
a molecule kit, and continue playing the video
to see if you are correct.

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:48.329
Remember, the VSEPR model assumes that bonding
atoms AND lone pairs on the central atom are

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:58.790
spaced as far apart as possible. On SO2 we
have two atoms bonded to the central atom

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.439
and one lone pair on the central atom. So,
we have 3 regions of electron density total.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.519
Think about how you would space these 3 regions
as far apart as possible. By placing them

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.640
on the vertices of an equilateral triangle.
On our model, this (pointing at electron cloud)

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.100
represents the lone pair of electrons. While
we have to think about lone pairs of electrons

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.200
when predicting geometry, the naming convention
actually ignores them. So, if we were to name

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.409
this shape, we would focus on the shape that
is determined by the atoms.

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:39.390
We call this shape "bent". It's tempting to
say that the bond angle will be 120 degrees,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.230
but bond angles in molecules with lone pairs
on the central atom have been observed to

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.600
be smaller than expected. One possible explanation
is that a lone pair can spread over a larger

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.500
region than bonded electrons causing the bonded
atoms to move farther from the lone pair and

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.860
closer to each other, compressing the bond
angle. The VSEPR model accounts for this by

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.950
saying that lone pairs repel more strongly
than bonded electrons. The result is that

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.550
the bond angle on sulfur dioxide will be less
than 120 degrees, but VSEPR theory cannot

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.520
tell us what the precise bond angle will be.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.520
Chapter Break Let's do another example - CH3Cl
(chloromethane, a.k.a. methyl chloride). What

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.310
do you think the geometry of this molecule
will be? Pause the video, draw a picture or

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.870
construct the molecule using a molecule kit,
and continue playing the video to see if you

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.870
are correct. How many atoms are bonded to
the central atom? 4 How many lone pairs are

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.530
on the central atom? 0 If we are only thinking
in 2-dimensions, it's tempting to place the

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.480
4 regions of electron density at 90 degree
angles to each other, ...but this would be

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.710
incorrect. Remember, we're working in 3-dimensions.
To maximize the distance of 4 regions of electron

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.280
density, we can think about them lying at
the 4 corners of a tetrahedron. It may help

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.020
to review what a tetrahedron looks like. A
tetrahedron is a pyramid constructed from

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.590
4 equilateral triangles. It has a triangular
base and sides made from triangles. This results

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:27.590
in 4 corners, or vertices. We imagine our
central atom to be at the center of the tetrahedron.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.630
In a tetrahedral geometry, the bond angle
between bonding atoms is 109.5. This is larger

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:41.650
than the 90 degrees predicted by putting all
4 regions in the same plane The correct model

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.650
of CH3Cl would look like this. This shape
is aptly named a tetrahedron. Chapter Break

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.810
Let's do another example -- nitrogen trifluoride.
What do you think the geometry of this molecule

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.670
will be? Pause the video, draw a picture or
construct the molecule using a molecule kit,

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:06.670
and continue playing the video to see if you
are correct. How many atoms are bonded to

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:16.180
the central atom? 3 How many lone pairs are
on the central atom? 1 Again, we have to make

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.910
sure we count the lone pair of electrons.
Again, to maximize the distance of 4 regions

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:27.080
of electron density, we can think about them
lying at the 4 corners of a tetrahedron with

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.680
the central atom at the center of the tetrahedron.
If we build this with our kit, it looks like

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.500
this. As we said earlier, the nomenclature
that is used to describe molecular shapes

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.840
only focuses on the positions of atoms. So,
if we ignore the lone pair, we're left with

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:50.840
a shape called a trigonal pyramid. Because
the trigonal pyramid is based off of the tetrahedron,

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:56.830
we would normally predict the bond angles
to be 109.5 degrees. However, the lone pair

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:02.590
will repel the bonded electrons more strongly,
causing a compression of bond angles. The

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:08.330
bond angles in a trigonal pyramid will be
less than 109.5 degrees. Chapter Break Now

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.680
I encourage you to predict the geometry of
sulfur hexafluoride. Pause the video, draw

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.440
a picture or construct the molecule using
a molecule kit, and continue playing the video

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:25.440
to see if you are correct. How many atoms
are bonded to the central atom? 6 How many

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:37.049
lone pairs are on the central atom? 0 To maximize
the distance of 6 regions of electron density,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:43.760
they lie at the vertices of an octahedron.
Let's take a closer look at the octahedron.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.760
An octahedron is composed of 8 triangles and
has 8 sides, but only 6 vertices. If we constructed

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:08.830
sulfur hexafluoride with our kit, it would
look like this. This shape is called an octahedron.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:15.640
The bond angle in an octahedral geometry is
90 degrees. Chapter Break Let's try one that's

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.590
a little different—bromine pentafluoride.
Pause the video, draw a picture or construct

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:28.590
the molecule using a molecule kit, and continue
playing the video to see if you are correct.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:38.830
How many atoms are bonded to the central atom?
5 How many lone pairs are on the central atom?

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:45.710
1 Again, to maximize the distance of 6 regions
of electron density, they lie at the vertices

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:52.710
of an octahedron. Our model would look like
this. Remember, we only name geometric shapes

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.960
in chemistry based on the position of atoms,
so we ignore the lone pair. This shape is

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:04.960
called a square pyramid. Because the square
pyramid is based off of the octahedral geometry,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.310
we would normally predict the bond angles
to be 90 degrees. However, the lone pair will

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:15.030
repel the bonded electrons more strongly,
causing a compression of bond angles. The

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.610
bond angles in a square pyramid will be less
than 90 degrees.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:24.980
Chapter break These were just a few examples
to help get you started with visualizing molecules

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.500
in 3D. There are other variations of these
base geometries listed in your textbook that

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:32.370
you should make sure you are familiar with.
The VSEPR model is a simple, empirical model

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.140
that works well for predicting the geometry
of most simple molecules, but it's important

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.970
to remember that as is true for all models,
it is based on some assumptions that limit

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:48.200
its range of validity. As you progress in
your studies and begin to look at more complex

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.840
molecules such as proteins, you will find
that you will need to use more complicated

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:59.370
models in order to generate 3D representations
of these molecules. In this video, you learned

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:06.370
that the VSEPR model can be used to help understand
a simple molecule's 3D structure. In order

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.460
to do this, you need to start with the Lewis
structure for the molecule of interest and

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:17.150
count how many atoms are bonded to the central
atom and how many lone pairs are on the central

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:24.150
atom. Then, you need to think about how you
can position those regions as far apart from

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:29.990
one another as possible. This is where thinking
about polyhedra is useful because the vertices

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:35.550
of polyhedra are at a maximum distance from
each other. Finally, you should remember that

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:42.550
the naming convention for molecular geometries
focuses on the locations of the atoms only.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:48.000
Because of the simplicity of the VSEPR model,
it is an easy way for you to learn how to

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.740
translate 2D representation of molecules into
3D. With some practice, visualizing molecules

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:59.740
in 3D can become second nature to you.
