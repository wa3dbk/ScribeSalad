00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.620
In beer and wine production, enzymes in yeast
aid the conversion of sugar into ethanol.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.600
Enzymes are used in cheese-making to degrade
proteins in milk, changing their solubility,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.789
and causing the proteins to precipitate. Many
industrial processes ranging from fruit juice

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.770
production to paper production to biofuel
production utilize enzymes. In this video

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.330
you'll see that studying how enzymes catalyze
reactions can help us design better therapeutics.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.489
This video is part of the Differential Equations
video series. Laws that govern a system's

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.610
properties can be modeled using differential
equations.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.070
Hi. My name is Krystyn Van Vliet and I am
a professor in the Materials Science and Engineering

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.380
and Biological Engineering departments at
MIT.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.320
of reactions and after some practice, you
will be able to derive a rate law for a general

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.620
enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.329
In order to understand the topic of this video,
you should be familiar with determining rate

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.450
laws from experimental data, predicting rate
laws from proposed chemical reaction mechanisms,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:05.450
and have some basic understanding of the effects
of catalysts on the kinetics of a reaction.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.689
The 
study of enzyme catalysis has become important
for drug development. Many drugs work by inhibiting

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.459
an enzyme.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:29.069
For example, enzymes thought to be important
for the survival and replication of the parasite

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.499
that causes malaria are being explored as
therapeutic targets. The parasites enter the

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:41.499
red blood cells of the host and use proteases
to catalyze the degradation of the hemoglobin

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.240
inside of the red blood cells. Degrading hemoglobin,
a protein, yields amino acids, which can then

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.709
be used by the parasite for its own protein
synthesis. Protease inhibitors could help

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.749
slow the degradation of hemoglobin, which
in turn would slow the growth and reproduction

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:02.369
of the malaria parasite.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.679
When a potential inhibitor is identified,
kinetic data is used to evaluate its efficacy.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.770
In order to understand how this can be done,
let's start by describing the kinetics of

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.550
a simpler case -- that of an enzyme catalyzed
reaction without an inhibitor present. Then

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.720
we'll think about what might happen if we
throw an inhibitor into the mix.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.200
This video will help you describe enzyme catalysis
mathematically by first reviewing some common

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.700
biochemical terms, then by describing the
general characteristics of enzyme-catalyzed

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.633
you will encounter throughout your undergraduate
experience.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.040
a reactant is called a substrate. This is
really just a matter of different fields using

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.280
different terms, but it's important for you
to be aware of this. Next, catalysts found

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.830
in biological organisms are called enzymes.
Textbooks frequently abbreviate "substrate"

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.860
using the letter "S" and enzyme using the
letter "E."

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.700
How do enzymes work? If we look at a reaction
coordinate, recall that the transition state

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.190
represents a chemical species intermediate
between the reactant, or substrate in this

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.620
case, and the product. The potential energy
difference between the transition state and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.340
the reactants is the activation energy for
the forward reaction. The potential energy

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.550
difference between the transition state and
the products is the activation energy for

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.480
the reverse reaction. Only reactants with
the energy to overcome the activation energy

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.760
will form products.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.000
Like synthetic catalysts, enzymes accelerate
the rates of reactions by stabilizing the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.400
transition state, lowering its potential energy,
and providing a new pathway by which the reaction

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.500
can occur. This new reaction pathway has a
lower activation energy than the uncatalyzed

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.250
path making it more likely that a greater
number of reactant molecules will have the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.620
energy needed to overcome the activation energy
and proceed to product.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.040
Enzymes facilitate reactions, but, like other
catalysts, are not consumed in the reaction.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.250
Enzymes are typically proteins, but RNA has
also been shown to catalyze reactions.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.350
While there are different theories about how
enzymes work to catalyze reactions, there

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.620
are a couple of things that are agreed upon.
One is that enzymes have a region called an

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.959
active site. Substrates bind to this region.
The shape and chemistry of the active site

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.689
determine the selectivity of the enzyme for
particular substrates.

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:29.460
The second point is that when a substrate
binds to an enzyme, an enzyme-substrate complex

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.460
is formed. This enzyme-substrate complex is
a reaction intermediate, meaning that it is

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.650
formed and consumed in the reactions, but
does not appear in the overall chemical equation.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.919
For many enzyme-catalyzed reactions, if we
were to measure the rate of reaction at various

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.919
substrate concentrations, we would see that
the rate of reaction appears to follow first

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.080
order kinetics at low substrate concentrations
and then transitions to behavior that resembles

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.270
zero-order kinetics at high substrate concentrations.
Please pause the video here, turn to the person

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.289
beside you and discuss what it means for a
reaction to be first-order or zero-order.

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:25.289
Remember, in a first-order reaction, the reaction
rate is directly proportional to the concentration

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.229
of substrate. In a zero-order reaction, the
reaction rate is constant as the reaction

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:40.449
progresses and is unaffected by substrate
concentration. So, if we look at this data,

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.330
we see that, for a given enzyme concentration,
the addition of substrate above a certain

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.139
value has no effect on the rate of reaction.

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:55.180
So let's think about what reaction mechanism
might explain this data.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.620
Some scientists hypothesized that after an
enzyme and substrate combine to form the enzyme-substrate

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.620
complex, this complex yields the product and
degrades to regenerate free enzyme. Does the

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:14.300
rate law derived from this reaction mechanism
fit the experimental data?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.740
Let's derive the rate law and see. We can
derive this rate law just as we would for

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.889
other chemical systems.

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:28.889
Remember, each step of a reaction mechanism
is assumed to be an elementary reaction. Please

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.389
pause the video here, turn to the person beside
you and discuss how you determine the rate

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:40.620
law for an elementary reaction.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.620
Remember, for an elementary reaction, you
CAN predict the rate law from the chemical

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:50.389
equation.

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:55.490
With this in mind, can you write a differential
equation for the rate of product formation

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.849
with time? Please pause the video, try to
write the equation, and continue playing the

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:08.849
video to see if you are correct.

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:16.979
From the 2nd step of the reaction mechanism,
we can write that the rate of formation of

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:24.979
product is equal to the rate constant k2 multiplied
by the concentration of our enzyme-substrate

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:27.659
complex.

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:33.409
The enzyme-substrate complex is a reaction
intermediate and not something that is easily

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:40.409
measured in experiments. How can we verify
if this expression is correct? It would be

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:47.729
nice to restate the rate in terms of quantities
that are more easily measured such as the

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:52.830
substrate concentration and the initial enzyme
concentration.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:58.499
To get an expression for the concentration
of the enzyme-substrate complex, let's write

00:07:58.499 --> 00:08:05.499
a differential equation for the net rate of
change of the enzyme-substrate complex concentration

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:12.759
with time. Please pause the video here, try
to write the differential equation, and then

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:21.270
continue playing the video to see if you are
correct.

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:30.889
If we want to write an expression for d[ES]/dt,
we see that in the first step of our mechanism,

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:35.640
the enzyme-substrate complex is produced in
the forward direction and consumed in the

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:42.520
reverse direction. In the second step, the
enzyme-substrate complex is converted into

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.580
product.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:49.940
This equation introduces two additional unknowns:
the free enzyme concentration and substrate

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:56.150
concentration. So, we need two additional
equations in order to solve it.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:01.190
Can you write an equation for the rate of
change of substrate concentration with time?

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.690
Please pause the video here, try to write
the differential equation, and then continue

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:12.690
playing the video to see if you are correct.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:19.150
If we want to write an expression for d[S]/dt,
we see that the substrate will be consumed

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:24.000
in the forward direction and produced in the
reverse direction of the first step of the

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.160
reaction mechanism.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:33.710
We still need one more equation. This equation
is a simple relationship that says we know

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:40.470
how much enzyme we added to our reaction mixture
at time zero, so at any time, we know that

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:46.710
the amount of free enzyme plus the amount
of enzyme bound in the enzyme-substrate complex

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:53.020
should equal the initial amount added. This
could also be written in differential form

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:58.000
as d[E]/dt plus d[ES]/dt is equal to zero.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So, we have a system of four ordinary differential
equations with four variables that all depend

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:12.580
on time. Equation 1 and Equation 4 have analytic
solutions, but Equations 2 and 3 contain a

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.740
non-linear term. When you learn about differential
equations in your future courses, you'll see

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.930
why these equations are difficult to solve
and that you will need numerical methods to

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.600
solve them.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.600
Here, we have integrated these equations numerically
using the boundary conditions that at time

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:45.010
equals zero, the substrate concentration is
S0, the product concentration is zero, the

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:54.280
enzyme concentration is E0 and the concentration
of enzyme bound to substrate is zero.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:01.350
We see that after a short start-up period,
the concentration of enzyme bound to substrate

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:07.810
remains approximately constant. In this region,
where the substrate concentration is much

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:14.810
greater than E0, as enzyme is released from
the enzyme-substrate complex, it quickly recombines

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.410
with available substrate.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:23.190
As more substrate is converted to product
and the substrate concentration approaches

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:30.190
E0, the concentration of enzyme bound to substrate
is no longer constant.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:36.840
In the regime where the substrate concentration
IS greater than E0, we can make a steady-state

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:43.840
approximation and set d[ES]/dt equal to zero.
This approximation will allow us to obtain

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:51.600
an analytic expression for the concentration
of enzyme bound to substrate.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.360
Setting d[ES]/dt equal to zero allows us to
solve for the concentration of enzyme-substrate

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:04.360
complex, which is equal to the rate constant
k1 times the concentration of free enzyme

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:11.630
times the concentration of substrate divided
by the sum of k-1 and k2.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:18.950
Let's lump the rate constants into a new term
called Km and substitute this into our expression

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:24.100
for the concentration of enzyme-substrate
complex.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.920
Now we can use this expression... ... to rewrite
d[P]/dt.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:35.140
Let's try to eliminate the concentration of
free enzyme from this expression. We can use

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.260
the enzyme balance that we wrote earlier,
which said that the concentration of free

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:46.260
enzyme plus the concentration of enzyme-substrate
complex should equal the initial enzyme concentration.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:53.680
Substituting our expression for the concentration
of ES into the enzyme balance and doing a

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.700
little bit of algebra, we can solve for the
concentration of free enzyme.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:06.700
And finally, we can substitute this into our
equation for d[P]/dt and obtain this expression.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:14.880
Let's check this rate law against our experimental
data. At low substrate concentration, the

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.400
expression reduces to a first-order rate law
and at high substrate concentration; the expression

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.320
reduces to a zero order rate law.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.310
It turns out that the rate law that we just
derived is called the Michaelis-Menten equation.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:35.310
To make our equation look more like the version
of the Michaelis-Menten equation that you

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.530
will see in textbooks, there are a couple
of terms that we will use because they are

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:49.530
the convention in enzyme kinetics. Instead
of saying d[P]/dt is the rate of the reaction,

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:57.480
we will call it the velocity of the reaction
and use the notation of 'v.'

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:04.480
Finally, we'll lump k2[E]o into a term called
vmax. At high substrate concentration, the

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.370
reaction velocity approaches vmax.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:17.370
Remember that lump parameter Km? We can determine
Km from experimental data. If we look at the

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:23.620
substrate concentration needed to reach half
of vmax, we see that the concentration of

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:30.620
substrate required equals Km. Km values for
many enzyme-substrate pairs can be found in

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:36.910
the literature allowing for comparison.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.440
You may be wondering why we went through all
of this. Let's go back to our drug development

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.140
example.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.640
Let's say that you have designed a drug that
you think will inhibit one of the proteases

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:54.420
used by the malaria parasite to degrade hemoglobin.
How will you test its effectiveness?

00:14:54.420 --> 00:15:01.420
First, you might add a fixed amount of protease
to solutions of varying hemoglobin concentration

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:07.240
in order to measure reaction rates. Let's
say that this reaction follows Michaelis-Menten

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.640
kinetics well and that you are able to estimate
vmax and Km.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:17.470
Next, you repeat the experiment, but this
time, you also add a fixed amount of the drug

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:23.460
candidate to all of your solutions. You get
your rate data and see that the apparent vmax

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:30.460
has decreased. But what does this mean? Can
you speculate how this inhibitor works?

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:38.040
Is the drug interacting with the enzyme and
preventing it from binding substrate?

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.850
Is the drug interacting with the enzyme-substrate
complex? Is it something else entirely?

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:50.050
The thought process that you used today to
derive the Michaelis-Menten equation can be

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:56.750
used to derive rate laws for other reaction
mechanisms. Then you can see which mechanism

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:02.050
is best supported by the data.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:08.010
Today we learned a little bit about the importance
of enzymes and derived a rate law from a general

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:14.350
reaction mechanism using differential equations
and a steady-state approximation. This rate

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:19.590
law was compared against experimental rate
data for an enzyme catalyzing the conversion

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:25.960
of a substrate to a product. The equation
that we derived is called the Michaelis-Menten

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:32.290
equation. While all enzyme-catalyzed reactions
may not exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics,

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.240
the same logic that you used to derive the
equation can be used to derive rate laws for

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.279
other proposed reaction mechanisms.
