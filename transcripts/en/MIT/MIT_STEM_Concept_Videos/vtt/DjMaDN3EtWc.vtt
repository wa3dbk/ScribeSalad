00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.950
Servomotors are widely used electro-mechanical
components. For example, they are used in

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.740
steering systems for scale model helicopters
and other radio controlled cars, robots, and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.790
aircraft, including military "drones".

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.919
A servomotor includes an electric motor, circuitry
to control its speed and direction, and gearing

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.759
to attain the high torques needed to apply
moderately large forces over relatively short

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.759
linear displacements. The gearing inside this
servo is a compound gear train with four stages.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.499
In this video, we will understand how linear
algebra can help us to predict the losses

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:49.929
and understand the design trade-offs when
converting high speeds and low torques into

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.670
low speeds and high torques using a gear train.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.129
This video is part of the Linearity Video
Series. Many complex systems are modeled or

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.110
approximated linearly because of the mathematical
advantages.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.590
Hi, my name is Dan Frey, and I am a professor
of Mechanical Engineering and Engineering

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.710
Systems at MIT.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.570
Before watching this video, you should be
able to identify and describe the forces and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.760
torques that act on a system.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.200
After watching this video and some practice,
you will be able to:

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.110
Model the forces and torques in a gear train
as a system of linear equations.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.950
Combine these linear equations into a matrix
equation.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.950
First, let's get a quick overview of the design.
Here's a servomotor with the case opened.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.960
Inside the case is a DC motor with a small
pinion gear on it. The pinion has 10 teeth

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.960
and is mated to a gear with 72 teeth. So the
first pair provides a speed reduction of 7.2:1.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.769
This large, 72 tooth gear is part of a single
molding with a 10 tooth gear.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:15.120
The 10 tooth gear on top of the 72 tooth gear
is mated to a plastic gear with 48 teeth as

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.120
you see here. So that stage provides a speed
reduction of 4.8:1. The 48 tooth gear is molded

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.849
to another 10 tooth gear.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.849
The 11-tooth gear is mated to a black 36-tooth
gear. This 36-tooth gear is molded to a 16-tooth

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.280
gear. The 16-tooth gear is mated to this black
42 tooth gear, which is splined onto the output

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.090
shaft.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.090
The overall sequence of gear pairs is: 10
teeth mated to 72 teeth, 10 mated to 48, 11

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:00.010
mated to 36 and finally 16 mated to 42 teeth
on the splined output shaft.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.459
The overall gear ratio is the product of all
the gear ratios of the gear pairs in the train.

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.769
Therefore about 326 to 1 as shown by this
formula.

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.879
Based on the motor's output and some measurement
and calculation, we would expect an output

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.099
torque of 6.8 Newton meters in an idealized
gear train.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.180
But there are frictional losses at every stage
of the power transmission process, so we guess

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.049
the output shaft will provide substantially
less torque than that. So let's start by measuring

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.150
the maximum force at the output shaft, and
convert that to an output torque.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.659
We attach weights to a servo horn that has
been connected with the output shaft on the

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:48.169
servomotor. An electrical power source (in
this case, a battery) is connected through

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.340
a radio controller.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.340
Here you see the servomotor lifting 1 kg.
Here it is lifting about 2kg. And here it

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.150
lifts even 3kg! This lightweight (100 gram)
servomotor produces large amounts of torque,

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.069
which can apparently lift more than 30 times
its own weight.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.180
In this set-up, the servomotor will lift a
4.42kg weight starting from a 90 degree angle.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.979
As the motor lifts the weight, the readout
on the scale should change.

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:29.949
Here you see the initial weight, with slack
in the string, is 9.75 lbs. This is about

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:36.949
4.42kg. With the motor pulling at maximum
capacity, the scale reads 3.70 lbs, which

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.190
is 1.68 kg.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.340
A calculation tells us that the maximum torque
available at the output shaft according to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.340
our tests is 1.47 Newton meters.

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.310
We can use linear algebra to work out a better
estimate. The force transmission and frictional

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:08.220
losses in each step of the train can be modeled
by a set of linear equations, (summing forces

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.520
and summing torques on the rigid body). For
the three rigid bodies that are comprised

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.169
of two gears molded together, we will need
three equations (sums of separate x and y

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.840
forces and sums of torques).

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.860
The pinion gear and last gear in the train
are simpler, because there is only one gear

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.080
in the body, so we can combine each of those
into a single equation.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.909
The equations modeling the entire train can
be assembled by linking together the five

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:46.909
sets of equations with four additional equations
to link each mating pair, so the overall system

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:54.199
will have 15 equations--- 3 sets of 3 each
(9 total) plus 1 each for the input and output

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:01.229
gears plus 4 equations that model the connections
between the mating gears. The solution to

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:06.919
that set of equations helps us to estimate
performance of the machine and also gives

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.720
us insight into its design.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.349
Let's make the model of just one gear body
now, say the 10 tooth and 48 tooth molded

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:23.039
gear seen here. One way to model the system
is to posit that there are three unknown forces

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:28.110
acting on this single body of two gears molded
together.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:35.110
We can name these forces F-TL2, F-TS2 , F-ShaftX2,
and F-ShaftY2. The force F-TL2 is a force

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.949
tangent to the gear pitch circle on the larger
of the two gears. The T is for Tangent, the

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:55.949
L is for Large, and the 2 indicates that this
is the second compound gear in the train.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.969
The force F-TS2 is a force tangent to the
gear pitch circle on the smaller of the two

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:09.289
gears. Again the T means tangent, and the
S here means small.

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:16.270
Recall that these tangential forces really
come from forces normal to the gear teeth.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.000
These gears are designed so that all of the
gears in this servomotor have a pressure angle

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
of 20 degrees. So there is a X component to
this force, the separation force between the

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:35.169
mating gears, which has magnitude given by
FTL2 and FTS2 times tan 0.35, where 0.35 is

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:44.990
20 degrees expressed in radians.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:51.990
The forces F-ShaftX2 and F-ShaftY2 are the
X and Y components of the normal force to

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.060
the shaft, which is applied to the gear it
supports.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.539
There are also frictional forces associated
with the normal force supporting the shaft,

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:10.539
but they are not separate unknowns, they link
the X and Y components normal forces by the

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.340
friction coefficient, mu2.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.650
This completes the description of the unknown
forces in our model. Those four forces appear

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.909
in three different linear equations as represented
by this matrix:

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:38.260
Take a moment to verify that these equations
balance the forces and torques.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:45.260
The 
first row in the matrix represents a sum of
the forces on the gear in the X direction.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:57.760
The second row represents a sum of the forces
on the gear in the Y direction. The third

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.610
row represents a sum of the torques or moments
on the gear in the direction parallel to the

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.339
gear shaft.

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:10.680
Now let's work on the model of the next gear
in the train -- the one with 16 teeth and

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:17.680
36 teeth molded together. Again, we model
the system by positing that there are four

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:24.230
unknown forces acting on this single body
having two gears molded together and we can

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:31.230
name these forces FTL3, FTS3 , FShaftX3, and
FShaftY3. And we obtain this matrix.

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:44.120
How can we link these two matrices together
to get a model of the second and third gears

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:50.589
combined? We see that the smaller gear on
body 2 is in contact with the larger gear

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:57.350
on body 3. According to Newton's third law,
the reaction force on body 2 should be equal

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.630
and opposite to that on body 3.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:07.630
In fact, the situation is more complex. As
the gears enter mating they slide into engagement.

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:15.449
As the gears depart contact, they slide back
out. There are losses at the interface that

00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:21.290
are complex to model, and we will represent
them simply using the efficiency in the average

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.430
transmitted force.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:29.040
Now we can join the model of the second gear
and the third gear into a single system of

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.800
linear equations represented by this matrix:

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.529
The row in the middle is like "glue" holding
the two models together. The force on the

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:44.820
large gear on body 3 is equal to the force
on the large gear on body 2 except a penalty

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:51.790
is applied for inefficiencies. The principal
mechanism for loss of power and torque is

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:58.120
sliding friction -- in this case, shearing
the lubricant on the gear faces.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.839
Before going on to assemble more of the model,
it is worth inspecting our work so far for

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:10.839
patterns. Note that the top right and bottom
left of our matrices are filled with 3x4 matrices

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:18.760
of zeros. That is a clue that our matrix is
shaping up to be banded in structure. Although

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.690
every variable affects every other variable,
the influences propagate locally (in some

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:31.149
sense). For example, the frictional losses
on shaft 2 do influence the frictional losses

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:38.149
on shaft 3, but only indirectly through their
effect on the force between the two bodies.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.730
Because we arranged the variables in our vectors
in a way that respects this structure, our

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:50.300
matrix has a band in the middle from the top
left corner to the bottom right. We will try

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.980
to keep this up as we continue building the
model. It will clarify interpretation of the

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:01.980
model and also aid in efficiency and stability
of the computations needed to solve it.

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:07.779
Now it's your turn, take a moment to write
a matrix that models the force and torque

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:14.779
balance on the first rigid body gear in the
gear train.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:26.740
This matrix is completely analogous to the
matrices we obtained in for the 2nd and 3rd

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.320
gear bodies.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.560
When we add the pinion gear and fourth gear
into the model, we need to take additional

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:38.610
care. These will have slightly different structure.
The gear connected to the pinion on the motor

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:45.389
has an applied torque due to the motor. The
reaction at the output shaft is an externally

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:52.389
applied torque, due entirely to the large
fourth gear. It is possible to combine these

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.560
into a single equation for each gear.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.350
Pause the video and try to write out the full
system of linear equations for the overall

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:07.350
4 gear train system.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:14.170
Placing these into the model as the first
and last rows, the overall system of linear

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.990
equations is:

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:22.440
Note that the matrix has 15 rows and 15 columns.
This should be expected as the system should

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.940
be neither overdetermined nor underdetermined.
Given a particular torque input at the motor,

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.350
there should be a single value of output torque
consistent with our gear train model and its

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.709
deterministically defined parameters.

00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:44.709
By solving this system, we find unique values
for all the unknowns. When we assembled the

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.920
equations, we guessed the direction of each
force in the free body diagram. So, it's useful

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.800
to inspect the solution for negative values.
For the parameter values we chose, the reaction

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:02.800
force at the shaft of the third body in the
x direction turns out to be negative.

00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:07.350
We should ask ourselves, did we guess wrong
about the direction of the force, or is there

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:14.350
something wrong with our matrix? Looking at
the forces computed it seems that the friction

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:25.569
in the x direction due to support of the large
y reaction on this gear was more dominant

00:14:25.569 --> 00:14:27.920
that we expected.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.509
It's sensible to run some sanity checks in
a case like this. If the friction on that

00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:38.410
gear were very low, would the sign be positive
as expected? We ran that scenario, and the

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:44.360
sign did become positive. So our guess about
the direction of the reaction force was wrong.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:50.519
Our assumptions for the magnitude of the friction
were too low. But it seems the model is behaving

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:56.569
in reasonable ways.

00:14:56.569 --> 00:15:01.360
Now that we have a reasonable level of confidence
in the model, we can begin to use it to explore

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.420
the design decisions that the engineers made.
If we put in reasonable values for the gear

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:12.690
mating efficiency, such as 96%, and reasonable
values for the friction coefficients at the

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:19.569
bushings, such as 0.3, we find an overall
efficiency of the gear train is about 52%.

00:15:19.569 --> 00:15:24.209
This is in reasonable agreement with our simple
measurements. We found that the maximum torque

00:15:24.209 --> 00:15:30.230
available at the output shaft is 1.47 Newton
meters, which would imply an efficiency closer

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.110
to 25%.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:37.930
But our measurement used an overhanging load,
which caused the shaft to bend. Our simple

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:44.019
model makes a large and optimistic assumption
of loading the servomotor with torques only.

00:15:44.019 --> 00:15:49.149
It's not surprising that the answers differ
substantially. It suggests installing the

00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:55.529
servo so that bending loads are supported
elsewhere, not in the servo itself.

00:15:55.529 --> 00:16:01.470
The gears in automotive transmissions with
similar ratios are much more efficient, perhaps

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:08.060
90% to 95% efficient. But for a compact and
inexpensive gear train, this design performs

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.810
well, especially since the plastic the gears
are molded from adds a great deal of rolling

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:09.920
friction.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:15.360
To summarize, we built an engineering model
of a servomotor gear train using systems of

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:21.110
linear equations. The matrix representations
helped us to explore the interactions among

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.690
variables in the system like separation forces
between gears and friction at the shafts.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.600
Since the 15 by 15 system of equations is
so fast and easy to solve on a modern computer,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.240
we could run a large number of "what if" scenarios.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.040
We hope this video helped you see how linear
algebra can be used to make and understand

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.430
engineering design decisions.
