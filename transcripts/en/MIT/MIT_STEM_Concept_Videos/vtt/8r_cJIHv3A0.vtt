00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.160
Any time you begin a communication, whether
face-to-face, in writing, or over the phone,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.230
it's important to think about why you've opened
that line of communication, what the goal

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.170
of your interaction is, and how you're going
to deliver your message.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.990
In this video, we'll watch 3 segments of a
presentation created by MIT students. You

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.060
will analyze the strategy used to develop
the message, and hear how and why the presenters

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.919
chose this strategy.

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.470
This video is part of the Communication video
series. Successful professional communication

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.809
begins with the ability to analyze situational
variables and make strategic decisions.

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.890
Hi, my name is Joanne Yates, and I'm a Sloan
Distinguished Professor of Management and

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.520
Deputy Dean in the Sloan School of Management
at MIT.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.640
After watching this video, you should be able
to use a strategic approach in order to communicate

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.680
effectively. This means that you will be able
to

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.670
Analyze your audience, context and purpose
Examine and build your own credibility with

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.100
the audience
Decide on content, structure, channel, and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.610
style, and
Evaluate your own and other's messages for

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.610
sound arguments and effective strategy.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.500
As we watch the student presentation, think
about the following elements:

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.250
Purpose: what is the objective of the presentation?
Credibility: Do the speakers have credibility

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.940
with the audience when they start the presentation?
If not, how do they establish it? For example,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.670
do they build an argument that shows expertise?
Content: Does the material support the objective?

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.770
Is the argument sound? Does the content answer
the audience's questions?

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.950
Structure: Does the organization of the presentation
support what the speakers are trying to achieve?

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.390
Channel: What methods (demos, schematics,
animations, text, narration) were used to

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.560
convey the points, and were they effective?
Style: Did the style fit the context? For

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.560
example, were the speakers projecting a formal
or informal style? Were they poised and confident?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.680
This presentation was the last requirement in our class for engineering processes.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.800
The presentation was made in a large auditorium, to around a hundred or two hundred

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.900
audience members. Ranging from Industry members to students, to mentors, to late men who didn't know

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.440
much about engineering processes.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.900
For anyone that uses a walker many everyday occurrences loom as obsticles.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.180
Walkers can't be used on steps in the home or in the community.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.660
They don't fit in the narrow aisles of trains, planes, buses, performance venues, or sports stadiums.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.540
There's no room for them in the tight corners of restaurants, or most Boston Area apartments.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.680
On behalf of Green Team we'd like to introduce to you a solution.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.520
Our product, Walker Prime. A walker that can be transformed into a cane.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.460
Through conversations with over 20 users and their representatives.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.920
We've established at the market for this product is community ambulators.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.560
These are older adults who independently drive, but need the added stability of a walker.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.360
For instance one user we spoke to recalled recently going to a fancy restaurant 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.200
and chose to bring his cane rather than his walker fearing that their wouldn't be space in the restaurant.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.220
Unfortunately the restaurant had a very large parking garage and in traveling from his car to the restaurant

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.580
he became fatigued and really wished he had his walker.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.660
To take a look at how Walker Prime could have improved his situation

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.940
were going to do a demonstration with Ran Dedia

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.960
If she was going to meet a friend for lunch in a restaurant downtown and parked a block away 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.700
They could use Walker Prime in walker mode to get to the base of the stairs leading up to the restaurant

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.660
She could then by pressing on the lower locks convert Walker Prime into a cane mode

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.760
And using the cane in one hand and the railing in the other she could ascend the stairs.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.680
The wheels are lifted above the skids, so there's no chance of them touching the ground.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.300
She can then after she's finished with lunch descend the stairs in the same manner.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.780
And to get back to her car she can change it back to walker mode to walk the extra block.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.920
Unfortunately sometimes there's a narrow foot path leading to a parking area too narrow for a walker

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.340
Again with Walker Prime this is no longer an obstacle.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.580
To see how this played out with an actual user

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.820
We visited a rehabilitation center yesterday and worked with a gentleman who is recovering from hip replacement surgery.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.920
He too.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.340
He too was able to walk using Walker Prime in Walker mode.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.940
And as he approached the bottom of the stairs he was able to compress it transforming into a cane.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.860
And then ascend the stairs using the cane in one hand and for stability the railing in the other.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.360
Later he was able to descend the steps in the same fashion.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.100
This is what Walker Prime does. If stairs are a thing of your past Walker Prime is not going to change that.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.180
But if what's keeping you from the stairs is your walker, that's a job for Walker Prime.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.780
What was the purpose of the presentation?

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.860
The purpose of our presentation was to explain why our product was important

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.240
Why would anyone need this kind of transformable walker?

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.980
To do that we showed different use cases. For example we tried to appeal the audience by

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.700
talking about narrow spaces in Boston which people could relate to.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.740
We also showed another use case of a user having to walk for a long while in a parking lot.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.340
This helped us show the audience that our product is important.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.580
Would the audience have found the presenters credible?

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.140
What did they do to convince the audience that their arguments were sound?

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
Their team's next presentation.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.560
And we actually had a bad one for our fifth presentation because the aesthetics of our product.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.440
And because we were pretty late in putting it all together.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.780
So, and our mentors and the staff of 009 have seen this.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.920
So we had to re-establish credibility with our final design with our mentors and staff

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.840
and we tried to convey that in our presentation.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.340
We tested walker prime with two users in a rehabilitation facility and

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.320
we had a video with one of the users showing how he was able to use our product pretty easily

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.880
climbing up the stairs, climbing down the stairs and transitioning it from a walker to a cane.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.380
This was important because one, it showed that in reality this is a viable product

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:20.260
it reaffirmed how functional the product was and it gave us enough credibility with the audience to show

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.780
that this would actually be a good product and actually I think a lot of our reviews that came in

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.020
after the presentation did say that we could possibly make this a real product.

00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:35.253
Let's continue watching the video.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.560
For Walker Prime we wanted to focus on three things.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.460
Stability, simplicity, and ergonomic.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.920
This is an interesting design challenge because for each of the modes there were different requirements

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:55.740
For Walker mode we used similar dimensions to those of other walkers on the market.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.820
We had to be able to make sure that you could adjust the height and still have a stable walker.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.360
The legs extend from hip height and are angled outward to create lateral stability.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:14.800
In Cane mode we wanted to make sure that you maintain the same handle height in both modes

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.160
which also motivated many of our other design decisions.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.500
We also looked at other canes on the market and consulted physical therapist

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.240
to determine what an appropriate cane footprint would be so that it would also fit on a stair.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:37.640
Let's take a look at the Walker at the intuitive transition from walker to cane mode.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:44.300
We accomplished this by linking the motion in both directions so that it was simple to use

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.360
so that all the user has to do is grab the two locks on either side, disengage them

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.580
and bring your hands together into cane mode.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.460
Let's take a look at the handles. There are 2 handles in walker mode that become 1 in cane mode.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:05.140
The wave allows the handles to come together nicely and also provides an ergonomic contour for your fingers.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.420
Just below the handles are the safety locks.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.180
There are two different locks but they are both passive for simplicity.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:24.200
In order to use active these locks first the user must disengage the upper lock and pull the handles apart.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.640
Then the locks on either side engage and lock it into Walker mode.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.080
Then if the user wanted to make it into a cane again they would just simply

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.760
hit either of the two locks on either side, push the walker together, and form a cane again.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.100
Moving down to the bottom we have the wheels. 

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.960
We wanted to make sure that the user would be able to use this both indoors and outdoors 

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:03.680
so we did some research and found that 5 inch wheels were necessary for outdoor use.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:11.340
We also need the wheels to clear the ground in cane mode, so we had to make the geometry such that

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:17.680
as you collapse the walker into cane mode the wheels would lift off the ground and above the skids.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.040
This brings up to our dual purpose skids

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.980
These skids were designed to be stable in both modes

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.900
There's a low friction surface for sliding in walker mode and a high friction rubber surface

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.980
for functionality in cane mode.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.760
How did you decide what material to include in your presentation?

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.440
 

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.680
To some extent the material was stated by the requirements of the class they said that you need to

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.660
do a financial analysis, you need to tell us how you made this product, you need to tell us why anyone

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.520
would ever buy this product or why anyone would make this product.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:57.080
So that was the main reason we included what we did. How we arranged it was a little bit more up to us.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.980
So we felt especially given that we had a significant non technical portion of our audience

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:09.420
It was important to motivate the "how" and "why" and show who can benefit from our products...
