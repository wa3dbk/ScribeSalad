00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.460
You have probably heard entropy defined or
described as "disorder." The usual example

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.280
is that of a college dorm room, which, without
regular tidying, becomes "messier" or "less

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.100
ordered" over time. Supposedly the entropy
of the messy room is higher than that of the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.340
tidy room. This analogy is easy to picture,
but it's misleading. In this video, you'll

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.380
learn a more accurate description of entropy
and understand how it relates to the concept

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.550
of spontaneity.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.880
This video is part of the Governing Rules
video series. A small number of rules describe

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.040
the physical and chemical interactions that
are possible in our universe.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.390
Hi. My name is John Lienhard and I am a professor
in the Department of Mechanical Engineering

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.660
at MIT.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.660
Today, I'm going to talk to you about entropy,
a fascinating, but often confusing topic.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.520
In order to understand the topic of this video,
you should be familiar with the idea that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.320
energy is quantized and the thermodynamic
definition of a system and its surroundings.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.950
After watching this video, you should be able
to describe, at a basic level, the concept

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.899
of a microstate. You should also be able to
discuss what entropy measures in a conceptual

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.240
way.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.240
First, what do we mean by a spontaneous process?
In thermodynamics, a spontaneous process is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.810
one that will occur without any outside intervention
given enough time.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.279
In the world around us, many everyday events
proceed in a particular manner. We would call

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:37.020
them spontaneous. You have observed spontaneous
processes yourself, but because they seem

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.450
so natural, you may not have taken particular
note of them.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.630
For example, think of an inflated balloon
that hasn't been tied and is simply pinched

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.630
between someone's fingers. Once the person
releases the balloon, what is going to happen?

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.840
Experience tells us that the gas inside the
balloon will rapidly escape from the opening,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.639
moving from high pressure to low pressure.
This will propel the balloon through the air,

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:08.910
until finally, we are left with a deflated
balloon. The gas that was once in the balloon

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.970
is now dispersed throughout the surroundings.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.800
You have probably also seen food coloring
or hydrophilic dye dropped into water. What

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.390
happens? From experience, you may know that
the dye disperses.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.730
You may also have had some experience removing
hot pans from the stovetop. While they come

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.020
off of the stovetop hot, we know they will
eventually cool. Here, we see a liquid crystal

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.640
in the pan change color, first as the pan
is heated, and then again, as the pan cools.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.830
Experience tells us in which direction these
everyday events will proceed. But what about

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.470
processes with which we don't have experience?

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.120
For example, it would be nice if we had a
way of knowing whether or not a given chemical

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.940
reaction will happen at given conditions.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.300
The 2nd law of thermodynamics can help us
with this.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.900
The 2nd law of thermodynamics states that
during any spontaneous process, the total

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.990
entropy change of a system and its surroundings
is positive. In other words, the entropy of

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.180
the "universe," that is, the system plus surroundings,
can only increase.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.290
But what is entropy? Is entropy a magical
force that overturns your furniture and creates

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.600
havoc in your office or home? No.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.020
Entropy is a measure of the number of possible
ways energy can be distributed in a system

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.840
of molecules. Molecules in a system at equilibrium
have the same average energy. However, at

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.069
a given instant in time, it is highly unlikely
that all of the molecules have the same exact

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.350
energy.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.319
Molecules in a system are constantly interacting
and transferring energy amongst each other.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.360
As a result, one molecule may have a certain
amount of energy at one instant and at the

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.640
next; it could have more or less. Depending
on the energy the molecule has, it will be

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.150
able to access different energy levels.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.900
The total energy of the system, determines
what energy levels will be accessible to the

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.289
molecules. Higher energy levels will not be
accessible because the energy required to

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.189
reach them is not available.

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:25.099
So when we say that entropy is a measure of
the number of possible ways energy can be

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:31.249
distributed in a system of molecules, we have
to account for all of the possible combinations.

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.580
And the way we do that is by considering the
microstates available to the molecules in

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.460
the system.
Let's use an analogy to understand the term

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.680
"microstate".

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.069
Let's say that you have two dice. What are
all of the possible sums for a pair of dice?

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:55.069
Pause the video here and take a moment to
jot them down.

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:02.080
Okay, you should have a list that looks something
like this. We would call these sums possible

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.199
macrostates of our system -- the macrostate
doesn't tell us what each individual die reads

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:13.569
when we roll them, just the total, or "macroscopic
view" if you will.

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.300
What are all of the possible dice combinations
that will produce each of those sums? For

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.240
example, we can produce the sum of three by
rolling a one on the first die and a two on

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.900
the 2nd die. Or, we can roll a 2 on the first
die and a one on the 2nd die. So there are

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.559
two combinations that will produce the sum
of 3.

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:37.219
The dice combinations that produce the remaining
sums are shown here.

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:43.759
We would call each of these combinations "microstates"
that correspond to each macrostate. The microstate

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.669
gives us information about the individual
conditions of each die.

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.669
We see that the most likely macrostate, a
sum of 7, has the greatest number of possible

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:53.139
microstates.

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.849
Do you think that the entropy change for the
system (the cold bar) was positive, negative,

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:58.969
or equal to zero?

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:05.189
Please pause the video here and discuss your
reasoning with a classmate.

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:12.189
Let's start with the system first. The transfer
of energy to the cold bar will allow the molecules

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:50.339
in the cold bar to access new energy levels
that they could not reach before, increasing

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:40.310
the number of possible microstates for that
system. So we would suspect that the entropy

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.180
change for the system is positive.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.620
But what about the surroundings?

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:52.140
The total entropy of a system and its surroundings
has to increase if the process is spontaneous.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.200
Let's use a very simplified diagram to think
about the heat diffusion demo. We have two

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:04.140
bars made of the same material. One bar is
hot and one is cold. We'll look at 4 atoms

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:10.490
making up each bar. The hot bar has more energy
than the cold bar -- its atoms are moving

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.640
more than the atoms in the cold bar, which
seem barely to move.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.890
Now, before we put the cold bar in contact
with the hot bar, let's think about each bar

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:25.100
separately. In our simplified drawing of the
cold bar, let's say that three of the atoms

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.520
have no energy and one atom has one quantum
of energy and is at a slightly higher energy

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.930
level, symbolized by the set of curved lines
representing its motion. How many different

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.660
microstates can this system exhibit?
If we think about the different ways we can

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:45.890
distribute the quantum of energy amongst the
4 atoms, we see that there are 4 possible

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:51.010
microstates.
If we do the same for our hot bar, where we

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:56.560
have 5 quanta of energy that can be distributed
in a variety of ways amongst the 4 atoms,

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.360
we use some math to see that there are 56
possible microstates.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.570
When we brought the two bars in contact in
our demonstration, we saw that they reached

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.650
thermal equilibrium.
Here, in our simplified example, we will bring

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:17.780
the cold bar (defined as our system) and the
hot bar (defined as our surroundings) together

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:23.460
and divide the 6 quanta of energy equally
between the two. The first law of thermodynamics

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.520
tells us that the total of 6 quanta will be
conserved.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:34.520
Now, how many microstates are now possible
in each bar?

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.880
As you might have expected, the number of
possible microstates in what was originally

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.930
our hot bar decreased, and the number of possible
microstates in what was originally our cold

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.400
bar increased.
Let's see what this means for our total entropy

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:55.400
change. We will use a relationship for entropy
that was derived by Ludwig Boltzmann. It states

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.810
that entropy is equal to a constant, called
the Boltzmann constant, times the natural

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.720
log of the number of microstates.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:09.040
When calculating entropy change, whether it
be for the system or surroundings, delta S

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:15.080
would be equal to Boltzmann's constant times
the natural log of the ratio of the final

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.630
number of microstates to the initial number
of microstates.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.550
The entropy change in our cold bar was positive
while the entropy change in our hot bar was

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:30.970
negative. But remember, it's the total entropy
change that matters. We see that our total

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:36.080
entropy change for this process is positive.
The spontaneous transfer of heat from our

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:42.690
hot bar to our cold bar is consistent with
the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:47.240
If you did a similar calculation for the reverse
process, that of heat transferring from the

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.130
cold bar to the hot bar, the total entropy
change would be negative indicating that it

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:57.110
is not spontaneous.
As we hinted earlier and as you may have guessed

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:02.240
by our very simplified scenario, calculating
the number of microstates in a real system

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.940
can be very challenging. Generally speaking,
you will be calculating entropy in terms of

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:14.740
measurable macroscopic quantities such as
heat capacity or enthalpy of phase change.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.940
However, having a qualitative understanding
of the physical meaning of entropy will help

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.930
you properly interpret the entropy changes
caused by various processes.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:31.760
To Review, for a process to proceed spontaneously,
the total entropy change for a system and

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.070
its surroundings must be positive. Entropy
measures the number of possible ways energy

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:43.920
can be distributed in a system of molecules.
A microstate is an instantaneous catalog that

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.870
describes the energy of each molecule in a
system. Because molecules are constantly interacting

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:56.870
and exchanging energy, this description constantly
needs to be revised. A given system has a

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:03.060
large number of possible microstates. As we
saw with the Boltzmann equation, entropy is

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:10.060
proportional to the number of microstates.
