00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.559
Here are two solutions, A and B, to which
I've added universal indicator. Here's the

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.400
color key. As you can see, both of these solutions
are around pH 6, very slightly acidic.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.160
Now I'm going to add concentrated sodium hydroxide,
a strong base, to each solution.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.880
It only took one drop of strong base to dramatically
raise the pH of solution A. The pH of the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.269
other solution hasn't changed.
Let's reset. Here are the same two starting

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.870
solutions, A and B, with the same indicator.
But this time, I'm going to add concentrated

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.239
hydrochloric acid, a strong acid, to each
solution.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.350
It only took one drop of strong acid to dramatically
lower the pH of solution A. The pH of the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.799
other solution hasn't changed.
OK, let's look at our pairs of solutions.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:03.269
When we added a strong acid or base to solution
A, its pH changed dramatically after only

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:10.269
one drop! When we added one drop of acid or
base to solution B, its pH stayed the same.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.000
Let's add more acid and more base to solution
B and see what happens.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.230
It takes much more acid or base to change
the pH of this solution by the same amount!

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.780
How is this solution able to resist changes
to its pH when strong acids and bases are

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.310
added? How could we make and use such a solution?
In this video, you'll find out.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.270
This video is part of the Structure-Function-Properties
video series. The structure, function, and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.370
properties of a system are related and depend
on the processes that define or create the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.560
system.

Hi, my name is George Zaidan and I am [attribution]
Before watching this video, you should know

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.140
what an acid is, what a base is, be familiar
with the concept of chemical equilibria, understand

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.140
what distinguishes strong acids or bases from
weak ones, and be able to define pH, Ka and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.880
pKa.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.810
After watching this video, you will be able
to:

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.549
Describe how the structure, or composition,
of a buffer functions to resist changes in

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.530
pH
Explain how the choices made in buffer design

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.269
impact the properties of a buffer.

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.310
In chemistry, solutions that resist changes
to their pH when acids or bases are added

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.159
are called "buffers." Solution B in our demo
was a buffer solution. Let's develop a molecular-level

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.260
model of solution B to try and figure out
how buffers work. First, let's review our

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.609
experimental data and list the observations
our model must satisfy:

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:55.540
The starting pH was around 6
When we added one drop of strong base (enough

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.219
to change the pH of our control solution),
the pH of our buffer solution did not change

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:07.139
When we added one drop of strong acid (enough
to change the pH of our control solution),

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:14.139
the pH of our buffer solution did not change
Eventually, after addition of much more strong

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.939
acid or strong base, the pH of our buffer
solution did change

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.919
Based on observations 1, 2, and 4, you might
think that our buffer solution is simply an

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:31.579
acid in solution. But it's not. Relying on
observation 3, explain why a solution comprised

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:38.150
solely of an acid in water could not effectively
resist changes to its pH when more acid is

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.150
added. Pause the video.
Your initial reaction to this question is

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.779
probably that the pH of such a solution would
always decrease when more acid is added, and

00:03:54.779 --> 00:04:01.629
therefore observation 3 could not be satisfied.
This is correct, except for two cases: first,

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:07.260
the added acid could be exactly the same strength
and concentration as the acid already present.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.499
In that case, the pH wouldn't change at all,
and we might think we were dealing with a

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:16.949
buffer solution. Second, the added acid could
be much weaker or much less concentrated than

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:23.540
the acid already present. Think about it like
this: a 1 liter of a 1 molar solution of hydrochloric

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.540
acid can hold its pH if a few milliliters
of 0.1 molar acid or base is added. In that

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.410
case, the pH might only change a little, and
we might also think we were dealing with a

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.350
buffered solution. But in both of these cases,
even though it seems as though the solution

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.280
is buffered, that "buffer-like" response depends
on the relative strengths and concentrations

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.770
of each acid, not on any intrinsic property
of the solution.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.020
So if our buffer isn't just an acid, what
is it? Let's review the observations. Observations

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.750
2 and 3, taken together, suggest that there
are both acidic and basic species present

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.290
in our solution, since additional acid or
base must be neutralized to keep pH relatively

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.790
stable. Given observation 1, we can also hypothesize
that there would be more acid than base, since

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.320
the pH of the solution is slightly acidic.
To better understand what might be happening

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.890
at the molecular level, let's use Legos to
model a solution that meets these criteria,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.880
and see if that model correctly predicts all
4 observations. We'll start with pure water.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.900
We could model water molecules using Legos
but that would quickly get overwhelming, so

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.700
we'll use this blue posterboard instead. Now
let's add, say 60 molecules of acid and 40

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.700
molecules of base. In real solutions, there
are on the order of 1022 or more molecules

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.530
dissolved. That would be a lot of Legos, so
we're choosing smaller numbers for convenience.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.440
Now, should the acid and base be strong or
weak? Let's start simple and make them both

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.440
strong. So our acid could be HCl and our base
NaOH. Here's 60 HCl molecules. This piece

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.940
represents the H+ ion; and this piece represents
the Cl- ion. And here's 40 NaOH molecules.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.860
This piece represents the Na+ ion and this
piece the OH- ion. Remember that strong acids

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.270
and bases dissociate completely in water,
so I'm going to take apart all the pieces

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.240
here.
And this is our initial model! It contains

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.580
both acidic and basic species, and it contains
more acid than base. But this solution will

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.580
not resist changes in pH. Pause the video
and explain.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:55.530
The OH- ions would just react with the H+
ions to form neutral water. Since there is

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.140
an excess of H+ ions, we would be left with
a hydrochloric acid solution after the reaction.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.490
And we've already shown that a solution of
a strong acid is not a buffer. So let's go

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.590
back to our criteria. Remember that to satisfy
these criteria we had the option of selecting

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.860
either weak or strong acids or bases, and
last time we selected the strong/strong case.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:25.860
So this time let's choose a mixture of weak
and strong; say, a weak acid and strong base.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:33.330
As before, we'll start with the acid. Here
are 100 molecules of a generic weak acid,

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.130
HA. Remember, weak acids don't dissociate
completely when dissolved in water. The extent

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:44.000
to which a weak acid or base dissociates is
related to the equilibrium constant, Ka for

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.830
an acid or Kb for a base. These equilibrium
constants depend on the chemical structure

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:55.060
of the acid or base. Pause the video here
and write the equilibrium expression for a

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:02.060
weak acid.
The equilibrium expression would be this.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.200
We always use concentrations in our equilibrium
expression, even though in our model we're

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.920
using number of molecules; but the principle
is the same.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:20.160
When we dissolve 100 molecules of weak acid
in water, some of them will dissociate, forming

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:27.160
H+ and A- ions. Some of those H+ and A- ions
will react with each other to reform HA. But

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.380
at any given point after the system has reached
equilibrium, there will be a fixed number

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:40.380
of HA, H+, and A- ions. Let's say that at
equilibrium, there will be 96 HA molecules,

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:48.690
4 H+ ions and 4 A- ions. The molecule formed
when HA is deprotonated, A-, is called the

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.770
conjugate base.
So now we have a model of our weak acid. We

00:08:54.770 --> 00:09:01.770
still have to add our strong base. Let's add
40 molecules of sodium hydroxide. First, the

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:10.210
NaOH would completely dissociate in water.
Now what? 4 OH- ions react with H+ to form

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:21.190
water. But things don't end there. The remaining
36 OH- ions react with 36 molecules of HA

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:30.430
via a typical weak acid-strong base reaction,
forming 36 molecules of A-, the conjugate

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:37.010
base. And we're still not through. Remember
that the dissociation of our weak acid HA

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:42.840
was at equilibrium, and we've disturbed the
equilibrium by adding NaOH. To reestablish

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:49.440
equilibrium, our weak acid HA must re-dissociate.
But it will do so to a lesser extent than

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.340
if it was in pure water, since there are already
a substantial number of molecules of conjugate

00:09:54.340 --> 00:10:01.290
base present in solution. Instead of 4 molecules
dissociating, perhaps 1 will dissociate; the

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:06.990
exact number could be calculated from the
equilibrium constant of the acid. So now in

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:13.990
solution we have 59 HA molecules, 1 H+ ion,
and 41 A- ions. This model satisfies the criteria

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:21.440
from before, but does it explain our four
observations from the initial experiment?

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:28.440
Pause the video and discuss with a friend.
First, is it acidic? Yes, because it has that

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:40.790
one free H+ in solution. Second, how is it
affected by addition of acid? Let's add HCl.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:49.310
The H+ ions react with the A- conjugate base,
forming HA. The pH doesn't change, since all

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:58.290
the added H+ ions are tied up here. So far,
so good. Third, how is it affected by addition

00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:08.029
of base? Let's add NaOH. The OH- ions react
with HA, forming water and A-. The overall

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:16.990
H+ concentration doesn't change, so the pH
stays the same. Note that in both of these

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:22.290
cases, equilibrium would be re-established
after addition of acid or base by a slight

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:29.150
adjustment in the dissociation or reformation
of HA. So the number of H+ ions does change

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:34.130
upon addition of acid or base, but it doesn't
change very much, certainly much less than

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:40.190
if this was pure water. Finally, can we exceed
the buffering capacity by adding enough acid

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:46.760
or base? Definitely: if we add more than 59
molecules of strong base or more than 41 molecules

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.420
of strong acid, we will use up all the HA
or A-, and then our solution will no longer

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.810
be a buffer.
And there we have it! We've constructed a

00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.860
plausible model of our buffer solution: a
solution of a weak acid and its conjugate

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.720
base. You can go through an analogous modeling
process for a weak base and its conjugate

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.690
acid. That will form a buffer, too. The key
to the buffering capability of any buffer

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:17.440
is that there is a substantial amount of both
acid and base present at equilibrium. In a

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.670
buffer made with a weak acid and its conjugate
base, the acid acts as a reserve of extra

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:27.920
H+ ions that can react with added base, and
the conjugate base acts as a sink, a place

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.630
for the extra H+ ions from the added acid
to go. In a buffer made with a weak base and

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:39.550
its conjugate acid, the base acts as the H+
ion sink and the conjugate acid acts as the

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:45.920
H+ ion reserve.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.880
Why would you want to make a buffer solution?
Well, let's say you're modeling a reaction

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:56.240
that occurs in human blood. Blood is a buffered
solution with a pH of about 7.4, so you'd

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.390
want to make sure that your experimental system
is also buffered at this same pH. Or suppose

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:07.260
you study Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium
which colonizes the human stomach. Your experimental

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.830
system would need to be buffered at around
pH 2. And no matter what your target pH, you'd

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:17.940
want your system to have a high buffer capacity:
in other words, you want it to be as resistant

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:23.339
to pH changes as possible. In designing a
buffer solution, you have a lot of choices

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:28.010
to make. Pause the video and suggest a few
factors you should consider when designing

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:35.010
a buffer solution.
First, you have to choose your specific acid/conjugate

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:45.020
base or base/conjugate acid pair. Then, you
have to decide how much of the weak acid or

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:50.000
base you want to use. Finally, you have to
decide how much of the conjugate species you

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.440
want to have at equilibrium. Each of these
decisions affects the pH and buffer capacity

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.990
of your final buffer solution. Let's look
at each in turn.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.959
We know that a buffer solution has to have
either a weak acid or weak base; but of course

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:09.800
"weak" encompasses a range of strengths. For
example, acetic acid is much stronger than

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:16.680
boric acid, even though both of them are considered
"weak" compared to a strong acid like HCl.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.600
The strength of the weak acid used will influence
the final pH of the buffer: as you might guess,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.130
the stronger the weak acid, the lower the
pH of the final buffer.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.709
But we also need sufficient conjugate base
to make the solution function as a buffer.

00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:34.709
And so you might also correctly guess that
the more of the conjugate base we add, the

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:41.680
higher the pH of the final buffer.
But again, that's not all. Remember the physical

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.250
significance of our weak acid and its conjugate
base: the acid is a reserve of extra H+ ions

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.810
that could react with added base, and the
conjugate base is a sink, a place for extra

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:58.810
H+ ions from added acid to go. Would a system
with an acid to conjugate base ratio of say,

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:06.190
20:1 be an effective buffer? Pause the video.
Since the acid reserve is 20 times larger

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.720
than the conjugate base sink, this buffer
would be very good at resisting pH if base

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.250
were added, but not very good if acid were
added. So, it would be a good buffer in only

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:29.470
one direction. Intuitively, you might expect
that a buffer with an acid:conjugate base

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:34.850
ratio of 1:1 provides the widest range over
which the pH is considered buffered, and you'd

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:41.209
be right. Many real-life buffers don't necessarily
have a 1:1 ratio, because of other design

00:15:41.209 --> 00:15:47.170
considerations (for example, target pH).
And of course, it's not just the ratio between

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:52.200
the acid and its conjugate base that influences
buffer capacity. Can you imagine a situation

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:57.640
in which the acid and conjugate base are present
in a 1:1 ratio, but the buffer is still not

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:04.640
an effective one? Pause the video.
Suppose we have a buffer system in which the

00:16:09.339 --> 00:16:14.850
concentrations of weak acid and conjugate
base are very low, in the micromolar range.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:20.080
Even though the acid to conjugate base ratio
is 1:1, their absolute amounts are so small

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.250
that the system would get overwhelmed by the
addition of even dilute acids or bases.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.529
So designing a buffer system requires a delicate
balance to make sure that the pH is where

00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:36.589
you want it to be, the ratio between the acid
and conjugate base is close to 1:1, and that

00:16:36.589 --> 00:16:43.589
there is enough of each species to provide
adequate buffering capacity.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:51.019
In this video, we created a conceptual model
of a buffer. We saw that to effectively resist

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:55.980
changes in pH, a buffer must contain a weak
acid and its conjugate base or a weak base

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:00.310
and its conjugate acid. We also discussed
some of the choices that need to be made when

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:05.470
designing a buffer and how those choices may
impact the properties of the buffer.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.280
We hope that by better understanding the function
of various buffer components, this video will

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.199
give you some context for many of the calculations
you'll need to carry out when dealing with

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:18.880
buffer solutions.
