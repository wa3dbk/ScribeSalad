00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.750
What do the growth of a plant and the rusting
of a truck have in common? Both processes

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.209
involve mass transfer. In this video, you'll
learn how to apply the concept of a control

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.070
volume and the law of conservation of mass
to real-world scenarios.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.630
This video is part of the Conservation video
series.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.949
In order to analyze or modify a system, it
is important to understand how the laws of

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.539
conservation place constraints on that system.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.180
Hi. My name is Mark Bathe and I am a professor
in the Department of Biological Engineering

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.180
at MIT.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.300
By watching this video, you will be able to
apply the law of conservation of mass to real-world

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.420
scenarios.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.990
Before watching this video, however; you should
have had experience with basic reaction stoichiometry.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.280
In the 18th century, Antoine Lavoisier, a
French scientist, showed that there is no

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.650
overall change in mass when a reaction takes
place in a sealed container.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.580
This observation is called the law of mass
conservation.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.580
What would Lavoisier say about a plant's growth...
...or a car rusting?

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.600
Can conservation of mass be applied to these
scenarios?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.420
Of course it can.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.850
By using a conceptual tool called a "control
volume," we can more easily apply the law

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.590
of mass conservation to these scenarios.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.429
What is a control volume? A control volume
is a fictitious boundary that separates a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:40.429
system of interest from its surroundings.
A control volume is NOT a tangible, solid

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:47.429
boundary. Nor does the control volume have
to be a specific shape or size. A control

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:54.329
volume can transmit energy or mass. A control
volume should be seen merely as a tool, and

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.679
defining a control volume is a matter of convenience.
Depending on the question being investigated

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.270
some control volumes may be more convenient
than others.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.880
Before we go back to the growing plant or
the rusting car example, let's go through

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.709
a more visual example to demonstrate the idea
of a control volume.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.709
Here we have a sink filling with water.
What if we wanted to know how much water is

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.260
accumulating in the basin? What control volume
might we choose to help us answer this question?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.090
Well, what if we were to define the faucet
as our control volume? We could look at the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.610
flow into and out of the control volume. Would
this give us enough information to figure

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.230
out how much water is accumulating in our
basin? No.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.489
What if we defined the whole bathroom as our
control volume? We could look at the flow

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.019
going through all of the plumbing in the bathroom.
Would this give us enough information to figure

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.430
out how much water is accumulating in our
basin?

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.400
Yes, but we'd also have a lot of information
to deal with. This probably wouldn't be the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.980
most efficient way to solve the problem.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.969
What if instead we defined the basin itself
as the control volume? Ah-ha. We could look

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.709
at the flow going into and out of the control
volume and figure out how much water is actually

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.150
accumulating in our basin. We have enough
information to figure out what we want to

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.890
know, but not so much information that it
is cumbersome to deal with.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.610
Now, we will see how we can use the concept
of a control volume and general chemistry

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.790
knowledge to better understand the application
of the conservation of mass to the growing

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.930
plant and rusting car scenarios.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.659
Back to the growing plant. Let's say that
over some period of time, the plant grows

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:44.420
and gains a mass of 25grams. Although the
plant isn't living in a sealed container,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.469
we can still apply the law of mass conservation
to the growing plant by specifying a control

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:55.989
volume and accounting for the mass entering
and exiting that control volume.

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.930
Most plants make their food using photosynthesis.
The overall reaction for photosynthesis is

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.930
carbon dioxide plus water plus light energy
yields glucose plus oxygen. We'll assume that

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.590
the plant's mass comes from glucose and it's
downstream products.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.630
Now please take a minute to think about what
control volume we might specify to apply the

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.630
law of mass conservation to the plant's growth.
[short pause]

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.440
If we think of the plant as our control volume,
we can apply the law of conservation of mass

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.490
to perform a mass balance on the system.
Any mass that is accumulated in our system

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.720
must equal any mass that entered the system
minus any mass that left the system. This

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.710
is the law of mass conservation.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.449
What mass is entering the control volume?
Carbon dioxide and water.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.060
What mass is exiting the system? Oxygen.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.229
Drawing a diagram like this helps us keep
track of the information that we know and

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.009
the information that we don't know.

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:19.009
Note that we ignored the light energy because
we are performing a mass balance. We can substitute

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:26.169
25 grams in for the accumulation term in the
mass balance equation. Now please pause the

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.770
video here and see if you can figure out how
much carbon dioxide and water entered the

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.340
system and how much oxygen exited the system.
Please continue playing the video to see the

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:44.160
worked solutions.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.160
Using basic stoichiometry, we can see that
37 grams of carbon dioxide entered the system...

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.060
15 grams of water also entered the system...

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:18.410
And 27 grams of oxygen exited the system.

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:38.259
We can compare these results to our mass balance
and see that our inputs minus our output equals

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:44.259
the mass gained by the plant.
So, the law of mass conservation not only

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:51.259
holds, but it gives us important insight into
the process of a growing plant. Fantastic!

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:58.129
Now, let's turn to our next example, that
of a rusting car.

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:03.080
The car has rusted, but the rust has fallen
off of the car, resulting in a decrease in

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.580
the mass of the car.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:11.220
Measurements show that the car has lost mass,
but has mass really not been conserved?

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:18.220
Let's think about this scenario a little more
carefully. What is happening when a car rusts?

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.710
Can we write an equation to explain what is
happening chemically?

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:30.710
Rusting happens by iron oxidation. This reaction
can be written as 3O2 + 4Fe -&gt; 2Fe2O3. Measurements

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:43.310
show that the car lost 10g of mass.
Now please take a minute to think about what

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:50.310
control volume we might specify to apply the
law of mass conservation to the rusting car.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.449
[short pause]

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:59.669
If we define the car as our system or control
volume, a concept that we introduced earlier,

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:05.129
we can perform a mass balance on the car.
Remember, any mass that is accumulated in

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:12.129
our system should equal any mass that entered
the system minus any mass that left the system.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:20.330
Our system, the car, lost 10g of mass. This
is a negative accumulation.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:28.039
During the rusting process, did any mass enter
our system? Yes, the mass due to the oxygen

00:08:28.039 --> 00:08:32.680
that reacted with the iron on the car's body.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.010
In our scenario, where a car has rusted and
the rust fell off of the car, has any mass

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:44.010
left our system? Yes. The mass of the rust,
or iron oxide.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.370
Now please pause the video here and see if
you can figure out how much oxygen entered

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:54.490
the system and how much iron oxide exited
the system. Please continue playing the video

00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:01.490
to see the worked solutions.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:08.730
Using basic stoichiometry, we can see that
4.3 grams of oxygen entered the system...

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:19.640
and 14.3 grams of iron oxide exited the system.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:33.100
We can compare this to our mass balance to
see that our mass in minus our mass out equals

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.360
the negative accumulation of mass of our car.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.350
Again, the law of conservation of mass has
served as a useful tool to learn something

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.630
important about our system.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:50.630
This video illustrated how the law of conservation
of mass can be applied to real-world scenarios.

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:55.730
Although real-world scenarios might seem overwhelming
at first, we can use a problem-solving tool

00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:02.050
called a control volume to help narrow our
focus. The law of conservation of mass allows

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:08.540
us to perform a mass balance on the control
volume. In other words, any mass that has

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:14.620
accumulated in our system must equal any mass
that entered the system minus any mass that

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.260
exited the system.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.389
This simple idea will provide a basis for
understanding systems throughout your time

00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.839
at SUTD and beyond.

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:26.839
FAANTASTIC! (will have to "cut and paste"
this audio from earlier)
