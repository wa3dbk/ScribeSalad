00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.490
In December 1998, the Mars climate orbiter
was launched in hopes of providing detailed

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.330
information about the atmosphere of Mars.
The launch went well. However the two teams

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.240
that collaborated on the project worked in
different units--one used the metric system,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.300
and the other the English system, and the
two systems of units were never properly reconciled.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.269
So while the orbiter was intended to fall
into orbit around Mars, instead it crash landed

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.570
on the surface. So units are pretty important.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.440
This video is part of the Problem Solving
video series. Problem-solving skills, in combination

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.800
with an understanding of the natural and human-made
world, are critical to the design and optimization

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.010
of systems and processes.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.300
Hi my name is Ken Kamrin, and I am a mechanical
engineering professor at MIT. Today I want

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.039
to talk to you about using unit analysis in
problem solving. This might seem simple, but

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.239
it is a critical tool for validating your
calculations. So pay attention.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.020
To understand this example, you should be
familiar with the definition of work.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.150
After watching this video, you should be able
to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.920
utilize and apply the key properties of unit
analysis:

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.470
when two quantities are multiplied, their
units also multiply.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.640
all terms added, subtracted or equated must
have the same units.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.420
You should also be able to explain how derivatives
and integrals affect units.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.990
Before we start the main example, let's discuss
how integration and differentiation affect

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.990
units. The first question is: what are the
units of dx? You should think of dx as a very

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.259
small change in x or a "little bit of x",
Recall that a little bit of ice cream, is

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:52.259
still ice cream. Even if it is a very very
small amount. So the units of dx are precisely

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.520
the units of x. Let's do an example. Let's
consider the position function x(t) with units

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.780
of meters, where t is time, with units of
seconds. Then velocity is the time derivative

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.489
of position v = dx/dt, and has units of meters
per second. Let's look at how the notation

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.980
is consistent with our physical interpretation:
dx has units of meters, and it is divided

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.980
by dt, which has units of seconds. So dx over
dt should have units of meters over seconds.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.560
Now let's look at acceleration, which has
units of meters per second squared. We know

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.560
that acceleration is the time derivative

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.290
of velocity, which is the second derivative
of position with respect to time. Let's see

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.280
how this plays out with notation... We can
also determine how integration affects units.

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.489
Let's use the example of the integral of velocity
v with respect to time t. We know physically

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.799
that this is position, which has units of
meters. Unit analysis also makes this clear

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:01.799
because v has units of m/s, and dt has units
of s, so when we multiply, the seconds cancel,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.909
and we end up with units of seconds It might
be interesting to point out that the integral

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:14.629
symbol doesn't affect units at all. Just like
the differential did not have units, it is

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:21.160
just a symbol that represents the limit of
sums. Since every term in the sum has units

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.460
of v times units of t, the sums, hence the
integral sign doesn't affect units at all.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.460
What we've seen: given a function f(y), differentiating
with respect to y divides the units of f by

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.310
the units of y. Differentiating twice divides
the units of f by the units of y squared.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.470
Similarly, integrating with respect to y multiplies
the units off by the units of y

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.659
In this example, we'll see how unit analysis
can help us check our calculation of the work

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:04.660
done by an applied force. A machine in a factory
is programmed to apply a force to a 3.0kg

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.970
object to move it back and forth in the horizontal
direction. The position of the object as a

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.970
function of time is given by the equation
x equals 3.0t minus 4.0 t squared plus 1.0

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.680
t cubed, where x is measured in units of meters,
and t in seconds. Find the work done on the

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.680
object by the force from t=0 to t=2. Note
that work is done when a force is applied

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.419
over a distance on an object. Let x0 be the
position of the object at time t = 0. Let

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:49.419
x2 be the position at time t = 2. Then the
amount of work done on the object is computed

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.990
by the equation W = integral x2 F · dx. Let's
start by figuring out the units of work. We

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.710
do this by analyzing our equation, which tell
us that the units of work are the units of

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:13.710
force times the units of dx. If we forget
what the units of force are, we can use unit

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:21.639
analysis to figure it out. We know that F
= ma, and acceleration is in units of meters

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.110
per second squared, and mass has units of
kilograms, So the unit of force, also known

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.740
as the Newton, is equivalently written as
kilogram-meters per second squared. So the

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.830
unit of force, also known as the Newton, is
equivalently written as kilogram-meters per

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.830
second squared. Recall that the units of dx
are the units of x, which is meters. Thus

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:49.930
the unit of work is a Newton-meter. So now
we know what units our answer needs to be

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.669
in. So let's start solving our problem. In
order to solve our problem, we need to know

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:02.669
the force acting on our object. We are given
the mass of the object, the position function

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:09.780
for the object, and F=ma. Because we can determine
acceleration as the second derivative of position

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.780
with respect to time, we can use our given
information to determine the force. Let's

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.060
go ahead and solve this problem, perhaps incorrectly.
See if you can catch my mistake. Alright,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.050
so here we have position as a function of
time. So let's differentiate to get the velocity.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:33.530
Where I've left off the decimal points. And
we'll go ahead and differential the velocity

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:40.530
to get the acceleration. And finally to get
the force, we go ahead with F=ma. So there

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:51.430
is my m. And according to this, our expression
for a is -8 + 6t. So I look at this and I

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:59.940
think to myself, uhoh, this can't be right,
because this doesn't have units of force.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.870
We know that force should have units of Newtons,
but it doesn't look like this has the correct

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:10.620
units. So this entices us to go back into
our problem to figure out what went wrong.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.190
Looking back up at the first equation for
position, I see immediately that something

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:22.190
has gone wrong, because position is in units
of meters, and each of these terms don't have

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.250
units of meters. In fact they don't even agree
with each other.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:31.800
This tells me there had to be units for each
of these constants that somehow got swept

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:38.799
under the rug. So let's be rigorous, and put
those units back in. Here we need units of

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:46.219
meters per second to cancel with the seconds
from time, and leave us with units of meters.

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:54.959
Note that this means something physical, it
is the initial velocity. Let's go back into

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:04.570
this term here, and see that I have a t squared,
and I need something with units of meters

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:09.490
per seconds squared if I am going to get from
this term something with units of meters.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:16.000
And lastly, we have this term over here that
has a t cubed. And likewise the missing unit

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
must have units of meters per second cubed,
which physically is the unit of jerk, or the

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.730
rate of change of acceleration.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.920
Now every term has units of meters, and so
this equation makes sense. You may want to

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.060
pause the video here and find the units for
the constants in the formulas for velocity

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:39.610
and acceleration. Show that these units agree
with the units you find by differentiating

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:46.610
x(t) Now that you have checked the units of
acceleration, let's put it back in the force

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:55.990
formula, and see that everything works out
ok. So we got F=ma. M as before equals 3 kilograms.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.310
And the acceleration written with correct
units is negative 8 point 0 meters per second

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:07.310
squared plus 6 point 0 t meters per second
cubed. To see that this has the correct units,

00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:15.019
lets expand this formula. -24 kg m per s squared
yep, that's a Newton. + 18t kg m per s cubed.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Just to check, note that while this doesn't
have units of N, time has units of seconds,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:36.440
so
this term is entirely in units of newtons
as well. Now that we've verified the of Force

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:50.930
is in units of Newtons. we can compute the
work integral. That means we want to evaluate

00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:03.279
the integral: x0 to x2 of F dx. We have an
expression for F, so let's go ahead and put

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:09.010
that in. I'm going to go ahead and leave off
the units for now. We leave it as an exercise

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:16.010
for later that you will do that. What do we
get? Integral x0tox2 minus 24 plus 18t dx.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:22.050
So we look at this and we realize that we
actually have a slight problem. Because the

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:27.760
force is written in terms of time, and we
are integrating with respect to x. Fortunately

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:34.760
this is easy to resolve. Just remember that
a small change in x, dx is equivalently velocity

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:43.380
times a small change in time. This is easy
to see if you express velocity as dx dt, because

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:49.200
you multiply by dt, and it is clear that this
gives you a small change in x. So in your

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.389
calculus class this little maneuver is called
a change of variable. So let's go ahead and

00:11:54.389 --> 00:12:00.880
do that. This means our integral can be written
as an integral over time, from time 0 to time

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:07.880
t=2 of force times velocity times dt. We write
F as ma, and we recall that acceleration is

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:18.730
the time derivative of velocity. Now we see
how to integrate this, and we find that the

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:26.120
integral is m times velocity squared divided
by 2 evaluated at the two time end points.

00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:32.980
Plugging in our formula for the velocity,
and evaluating, we get that the answer is

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:39.329
negative 12. I intentionally left off the
units while doing this computation. Now I

00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:44.680
leave it as an exercise for you to use unit
analysis to check that this integral does

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:51.680
in fact give you 12 Newton-meters or 12 Joules,
the units for work. In the example, we saw

00:12:58.899 --> 00:13:04.290
that when you are adding numbers with units,
it is important for those numbers to have

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:10.389
the same units if you want your quantity to
have physical meaning. We also learned that

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:17.389
the differential quantity dx has the same
units as x. We also saw that it is helpful

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.920
to use unit analysis to check your work at
points during and after the computation. You

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:27.149
can see now that unit analysis can be a useful
part of your problem solving strategy. It

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:33.459
is important to understand the properties
of units, and how they are affected by mathematical

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:40.459
operations. Checking units at the end of a
computation useful to see if solution is reasonable.

00:13:40.769 --> 00:13:46.720
Sometimes, unit analysis can suggest a formula
for an unknown quantity in terms of given

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:53.720
information. But physical knowledge is necessary
to validate solution completely.
