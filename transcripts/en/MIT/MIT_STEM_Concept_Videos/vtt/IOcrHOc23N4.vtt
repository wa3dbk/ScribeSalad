00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.980
Here you see footage of hurricanes that formed
in the Atlantic Ocean during 2009. Do you

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.860
see that every single hurricane rotates counterclockwise?
All hurricanes formed in the Northern hemisphere

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.830
rotate counterclockwise.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.320
In this video, we'll provide you with the
tools to explain why hurricanes rotate the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.060
way that they do.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.759
This video is part of the Representations
video series. Information can be represented

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:34.440
in words, through mathematical symbols, graphically,
or in 3-D models. Representations are used

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.590
to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding
of objects, systems, and processes.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.640
Hi, my name is Sanjay Sarma, and I am a professor
of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. Today we

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.610
are going to demystify the origins of the
forces that appear to act on objects in rotating

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.040
frames.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.120
Before watching this video, you should be
familiar with how to define basis vectors;

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.720
inertial and non-inertial reference frames;
and the representation of rotation rates as

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.610
a vector cross products.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.780
After watching this video, you will be able
to explain why centrifugal and Coriolis forces

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.539
arise in rotating frames of reference, and
apply your understanding of the Coriolis force

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:26.539
to determine the direction of rotation of
hurricanes.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.720
A frame of reference is a choice of coordinate
frame, a set of orthonormal basis vectors.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.940
The frame is allowed to undergo rigid body
motions.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.350
Rigid body motions include translation, rotation,
or a combination of translation and rotation.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.590
As a frame of reference undergoes a rigid
body motion, the 3 basis vectors retain their

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.509
unit length and remain mutually orthogonal.

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.090
In this video, we are going to focus on rotating
frames of reference. In particular, we want

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.240
to think about frames that are rotating with
constant angular velocity and that aren't

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.180
translating.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.590
Rotating frames of reference are non-inertial,
thus we detect fictitious forces in them.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.470
We are going to explain how these so called
fictitious forces arise.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.170
This is a turntable. We say that we are in
the turntable frame of reference because the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.610
camera is mounted to the turntable. From this
frame of reference, it appears that the turntable

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.300
is stationary as the world spins around us,
despite the fact that our experience tells

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.150
us it is the turntable that is spinning.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.840
Here you see an orange disk attached to the
turntable by a string. If we rotate the turntable

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.760
quickly enough to overcome the friction between
the disk and the turntable, you notice that

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.020
the string becomes taut.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.910
Newton's second law implies that there must
be a force equal and opposite to this tension

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.819
force for the disk to remain stationary!

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.520
This apparent force is what we call a fictitious
force. Let's rotate the turntable with two

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.840
disks—one is attached to the table by a
string, while the other is unattached. The

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.780
fictitious force causes the unattached disk
to fly off of the Turntable.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.780
Is there really a force? If so, where does
it come from? Pause the video and discuss.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.540
In addition to the Turntable frame, there
is another frame of reference that will be

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.420
useful in our analysis.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.230
This is the ground frame, G, which is any
coordinate frame that appears to be stationary

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.129
while standing on the ground.

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:45.099
The Turntable frame, T, refers to any coordinate
frame that appears stationary while standing

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.280
on the Turntable.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.000
From the ground frame, the T frame is rotating
counterclockwise with constant angular velocity,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.090
or almost constant angular velocity.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.209
It is important to be explicit about the particular
frame of reference used to describe a velocity

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.700
or acceleration vector.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.550
The velocity of the stationary vector is zero
in the G frame, but the velocity of the rotating

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.159
vector is zero in the T frame.

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:17.159
We will denote the frame of such a vector
by using a left superscript G or T to designate

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:22.810
if we are considering the vector as an object
in the G frame or the T frame.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.840
In the T frame, the position of the disk is
fixed, so its velocity and acceleration are

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.370
both zero.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.370
Pause the video here to determine the velocity
of the disk as seen from the ground frame.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.590
According to the G frame, the T frame is rotating
with some angular velocity, represented by

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.060
the vector omega. Omega points along the axis
of rotation with magnitude equal to the angular

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.940
velocity. The velocity of the disk according
to the G frame is entirely due to the rotation

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.120
of the T frame, and thus can be represented
by omega cross r.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.770
Recall that in general, any object that is
moving on the turntable will have a velocity

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.150
that can be defined in the T-frame. The velocity
in the G-frame can be found as the sum of

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.270
the velocity in the T-frame and the velocity
that arises due to the rotation of the T-frame

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.150
with respect to the G-frame.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.900
We can think of this as a rule for taking
the time derivative of the position vector

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.280
r in both the G-frame and the T-frame.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.259
We can generalize this as a formula for how
to take the time derivative in the G frame

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:45.680
of any vector, x, in terms of its T-frame
derivative. This formula holds when the T

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.960
frame is rotating, but not translating with
respect to the G frame.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.370
Use this formula to take the time derivative
of velocity. Try to find the general formula

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.729
for the acceleration in the ground frame in
terms of the acceleration in the turntable

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:08.729
frame and various other terms. Pause the video
while you carry out the computation.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.440
Looking at this formula, the first term is
the object's acceleration as observed in the

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.300
T frame. The remaining terms can be thought
of as giving rise to the fictitious forces,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.500
which cause the acceleration observed in the
T frame. The second term is the due to the

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.680
angular acceleration of the T frame with respect
to the G frame. This third term is the Coriolis

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.360
acceleration—note that it depends on the
velocity vector of the object in the T frame.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.990
And this last term is the centripetal acceleration—observe
that it depends on how far the object is from

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.919
the axis of rotation.

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:08.330
Given this information, pause the video and
determine the acceleration of the orange disk

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:15.330
in the ground frame?

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:22.650
The velocity and acceleration of the disk
are zero in the T frame of reference.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.560
We did our best to rotate the turntable in
this video with constant angular velocity.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.330
So we will assume that the angular acceleration
is negligible.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.460
Thus the acceleration in the G-frame is given
completely by the centripetal acceleration

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.889
term.

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:45.009
This vector points in the negative r direction
with a magnitude given by the distance from

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:50.020
the axis multiplied by the angular velocity
squared.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.479
In the G frame, which is inertial, we do not
observe effects of the so-called "fictitious

00:07:55.479 --> 00:08:02.130
forces". Remember, the disk wants to move
in a straight line. It doesn't want to turn.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.940
The string imparts a tension force upon the
orange disk, which provides the centripetal

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.910
acceleration needed for the disk to rotate
with the Turntable.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:17.650
But in the non-inertial T frame, we may think
we observe a "fictitious force". The only

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.889
thing that is fictitious is your perception
that the disk is not accelerating. It is a

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:27.860
"physical illusion" created by the fact that
from the turntable frame of reference, you

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:34.860
don't observe the centripetal acceleration
of the turntable.

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:41.929
In this video clip, we are rolling tennis
balls through a plastic tube. In the T frame,

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.819
we observe that the ball moves along a curved
path. The curved motion observed in a rotating

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:51.769
frame of reference is called the "Coriolis
Effect."

00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:58.769
Pause the video and explain what you think
is causing this curved motion.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.949
To better understand what is happening, let's
look at the same motion from the inertial

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:09.860
ground frame.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.029
But first, what do you think the motion of
the ball will be when observed from the Ground

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:21.029
frame? Pause the video and make a prediction.

00:09:24.989 --> 00:09:30.110
That's right. The path is a rather straight
line along the initial trajectory!

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:36.790
It is the motion of the turntable that is
curved as the turntable rotates counterclockwise.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.699
But from the turntable frame, points on the
turntable appear stationary, because you are

00:09:41.699 --> 00:09:47.819
rotating with the frame. So you perceive that
the ball is curving to the right, even though

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:51.050
it is you that is moving in a circular path.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:56.230
You might try to explain the curvature using
fictitious forces. But we know that these

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:02.790
forces are really just accelerations of the
turntable frame that we do not perceive.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.790
Let's use what we know about the G frame to
understand what these accelerations are in

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.559
the T frame.

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:15.309
Using the general formula for acceleration
in a rotating frame that we found earlier,

00:10:15.309 --> 00:10:22.309
pause here and determine the acceleration
in the T frame.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:30.199
Because the velocity is essentially constant
in the G frame, the G frame acceleration is

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:31.799
zero.

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:37.110
We can rearrange the remaining nonzero terms
to find an expression for the acceleration

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:44.029
of the ball that we observe in the T frame.
We find it is equal and opposite the sum of

00:10:44.029 --> 00:10:48.739
the Coriolis acceleration and the Centripetal
acceleration.

00:10:48.739 --> 00:10:53.720
This term is the negative of the Centripetal
acceleration, which we saw in the previous

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:59.209
example. This acceleration is always pointing
outwards from the center of rotation.

00:10:59.209 --> 00:11:06.059
This second term is the negative Coriolis
acceleration. This acceleration is perpendicular

00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:12.220
to the velocity of the ball in the T frame,
creating the curvature of the ball's path.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:17.360
We've said the accelerations are created by
the rotation of the turntable. How does this

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.489
happen?

00:11:18.489 --> 00:11:24.149
For an object to rotate with the turntable,
a centripetal acceleration is required. Without

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:29.339
it, an object appears to move outwards from
the center of rotation.

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:34.149
Even more is happening though. Because of
the rigid body rotation, the velocity of a

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:38.689
point near the outside edge of the turntable
is greater than the velocity of point near

00:11:38.689 --> 00:11:40.889
the center of rotation.

00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:46.290
Moving objects accelerate due to this velocity
differential. The acceleration is perpendicular

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:51.449
to the velocity of the object. But you don't
realize this acceleration exists from the

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:54.819
turntable frame, because you don't perceive
your own rotation.

00:11:54.819 --> 00:11:55.309
The acceleration created by this velocity
differential between points on the turntable

00:11:55.309 --> 00:11:55.809
is responsible for the Coriolis effect, curving
the paths of moving objects.

00:11:55.809 --> 00:12:00.049
You can feel these accelerations yourself
if you walk around on a carousel. Or you can

00:12:00.049 --> 00:12:06.720
try waving your arms or legs on some other
rotating theme park ride.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:13.720
Remember, the Earth is a rotating reference
frame. Even though we are used to considering

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:20.819
the Earth as a fixed frame, some phenomena,
such as hurricanes, are created by the rotation

00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:26.239
of the Earth. We are going to use what we
learned earlier to understand why hurricanes

00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:28.459
rotate the way they do.

00:12:28.459 --> 00:12:33.739
We can model regions of the Earth quite easily.
For points that are in the Northern or Southern

00:12:33.739 --> 00:12:38.509
hemisphere, but sufficiently far from the
equator, we can model the hemisphere by projecting

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:40.970
it onto a disk.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.929
From this perspective, the northern hemisphere
is a counterclockwise rotating disk, and the

00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:49.589
southern hemisphere is a clockwise rotating
disk.

00:12:49.589 --> 00:12:54.799
Near the equator, we can't model the Earth
as a disk. Instead, a better model would be

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:58.359
the outside surface of a rotating cylinder.

00:12:58.359 --> 00:13:03.429
Our understanding of the Coriolis Effect from
the turntable will directly apply to this

00:13:03.429 --> 00:13:05.399
model of the hemispheres.

00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:10.549
Now let's start by thinking about hurricanes.
Hurricanes are formed when there are small

00:13:10.549 --> 00:13:17.549
regions of very low air pressure. The existence
of this low-pressure region causes air from

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.980
all directions to move towards the low-pressure
zone.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:27.109
With this information and what you know about
the Coriolis effect, explain why hurricanes

00:13:27.109 --> 00:13:34.109
in the northern hemisphere rotate counterclockwise.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:43.519
As air moves towards the low-pressure zone,
the air moving from the south veers to the

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:50.169
right due to the Coriolis effect. Similarly,
air moving from the north veers to the left

00:13:50.169 --> 00:13:56.259
of the low-pressure zone. At the same time,
air is constantly pulled in towards the low-pressure

00:13:56.259 --> 00:14:03.259
zone. The combination of these processes creates
a region of counterclockwise rotating air.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:10.910
This is why hurricanes in the Northern hemisphere
rotate counterclockwise.

00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:17.699
In this video, we saw that in rotating frames,
an apparent force pulling away from the axis

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:23.439
of rotation is really the objects tendency
to move in a straight line.

00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:28.730
In a rotating frame of reference, objects
require a centripetal acceleration to remain

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.739
stationary in that frame.

00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:37.339
Moving objects in rotating frames move in
curved paths due to the Coriolis acceleration,

00:14:37.339 --> 00:14:43.449
created by the fact that the velocity of points
in the frame are greater further from the

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:44.819
axis of rotation.

00:14:44.819 --> 00:14:50.989
On Earth, we can observe the Coriolis Effect
in the counterclockwise rotation of hurricanes

00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:53.399
in the northern hemispheres.

00:14:53.399 --> 00:15:00.399
This leaves 2 questions for you. What direction
do hurricanes rotate in the southern hemisphere?

00:15:00.529 --> 00:15:06.609
And why can't hurricanes form at the equator?
