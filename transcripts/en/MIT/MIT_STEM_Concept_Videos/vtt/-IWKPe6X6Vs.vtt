00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:18.010
After flipping a coin 100 times, you tally
up 42 heads and 58 tails. You expected a 50/50

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.430
distribution. Does this mean the coin is unfair?

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.810
This video is part of the Probability and
Statistics video series. Many events and phenomena

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.110
are probabilistic. Engineers, designers, and
architects often use probability distributions

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.780
to predict system behavior.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.120
Hi, my name is Lourdes Aleman, and I am a
research scientist in the HHMI Education Group

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.740
in the biology department at MIT. I also work
in the MIT Office of Educational Innovation

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.879
and Technology. I helped develop the Star
Genetics software featured in this video.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.500
Before watching this video, you should know
what a probability distribution is and be

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:22.000
familiar with basic genetics vocabulary including
genotype, phenotype, homozygous, and heterozygous.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.770
You should also know how to use Punnett squares
to predict the expected results of Mendelian

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.340
crosses.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.600
After watching this video, you will be able
to apply Chi square hypothesis testing to

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.600
experimental data obtained from genetic experiments.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.110
Going back to question of whether or not our
coin is fair, it turns out there is a statistical

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:02.590
tool that can help us. Statistical tests can
be used to determine if sample data can be

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.950
assumed to come from a population that has
a certain distribution.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:17.350
Today, we will use a statistical test called
the Chi Square Test for Goodness of Fit.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:28.370
The Chi Square test is used to analyze categorical
data. In other words, the test compares a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.370
sample of data collected about an event to
expected values.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:47.000
In our coin-flipping example, our categories
are heads and tails. An event is one coin flip.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.960
Our sample is 100 events.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.819
We expect
that the coin should have a 50/50 chance of

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:05.479
being heads or tails in any given event. The
question we are trying to answer is – does

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.480
our sample come from the 50/50 population
distribution we expect?

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:22.160
What we have just done is state our null hypothesis
about the coin flipping experiment. The Chi

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.100
square statistic tests this null hypothesis.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.840
We also need to state an alternative hypothesis.
The alternative hypothesis is simply that

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.840
the data do not come from the specified 50/50
population distribution.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.620
Before we can test our hypothesis, we need
to calculate a Chi square statistic.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:00.380
This statistic measures the discrepancy between
observed counts and expected counts.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:09.780
Each term in our summation finds the deviation,
or error, between observed and expected values

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:20.269
for each category. This deviation is squared
to obtain positive values. Otherwise, everything

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:28.269
would sum to zero because both our observed
and expected outcomes sum to the same value.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.720
Each term in the summation is divided by the
expected value of the outcome as a way of

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.729
normalizing each difference.

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:49.229
The Chi square statistic lives in a distribution.
This is the Chi square distribution for any

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:58.840
sample that has two categories of data, or,
in other words, one degree of freedom.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:07.220
If the outcome of an event can only fall into
one of two categories, we only need to know

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:14.499
how many events fell into one category in
order to determine how many fell into the

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:17.139
other category.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.480
The Chi square distribution is actually a
set of distributions, each for a different

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.909
number of degrees of freedom.

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:39.249
If we look at these distributions, the x-axis
is chi-squared values and the y-axis is relative

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:49.169
frequency. You might also notice that these
distributions are positively skewed. This

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.430
makes sense for a couple of reasons:

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:00.589
The Chi squared statistic is always positive.
Larger and larger Chi squared values indicate

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:08.319
larger discrepancies between observed and
expected values. While possible, these large

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:17.939
discrepancies are less probable if the null
hypothesis is true. If we calculate the Chi

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:26.400
square test statistic for the coin flipping
experiment, we get 2.56.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:34.240
How do we interpret this number? First, we
need to look at the appropriate Chi-squared distribution.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:43.460
In the coin flipping experiment, there are
two possible outcomes: heads or tails.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.940
If we know how many heads were flipped, we can
calculate the number of tails flipped.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.479
So, we only have one degree of freedom.

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:02.480
Let’s refer to the Chi square distributions
for one degree of freedom.

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:12.379
We can compare our test statistic to the distribution
to see if we have support for our null hypothesis

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:16.789
or if we need to reject it.

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:23.789
What will our criterion for support or rejection
of our null hypothesis be?

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:33.219
While this is a fairly arbitrary choice, in many fields, a
result is said to not differ significantly

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:40.050
from expectations if it has a 1 in 20 chance
of happening.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:46.308
In other words, if the difference between
the observed result and the expected result

00:07:46.308 --> 00:07:56.129
is small enough, we would expect to see it
1 in 20 times, which is a probability of 0.05.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.200
This probability is called the level of significance.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:08.919
If a Chi square value has a probability of
occurring that is greater than our level of

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:18.479
significance, it lends support to our null
hypothesis. If a Chi square value has a probability

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:25.490
of occurring that is less than our level of
significance, we should reject the null hypothesis.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:35.120
Using the Chi square distribution for 1 degree
of freedom, a chi square value of 2.56 has

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:42.130
a greater than the 5% probability of occurring
that we had set as our minimum.

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:49.190
This means that we fail to reject our null
hypothesis. In other words, what we observe

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:56.000
is close enough to what we expect that we
have confidence that our coin is fair.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:06.660
Now, suppose you are planning an experiment
where you will cross mutant flies that are

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:14.680
heterozygous for a wingless phenotype to each
other. The wingless phenotype is dominant

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:24.730
relative to the wild-type winged phenotype.
Let’s use the notation Gg for the genotype

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.839
of the parent mutant flies.

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:34.839
In this case, the wild type, winged flies,
are homozygous recessive.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:41.980
What percentage of flies resulting from a
cross of two heterozygous wingless mutants

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:50.779
would you expect to be wild type versus mutant?
Pause the video here and use a Punnett square

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:53.599
to justify your answer.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:08.620
Performing this cross using a Punnett square,
you would expect a 3:1 ratio of mutant to

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.850
wild-type flies.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:20.560
You perform the cross with the parental mutant
flies. The cross produces 50 progeny. 32 are

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.170
mutant and 18 are wild type.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:34.890
So, only 64% of our flies are mutant, even
though you expected 75% of them to be mutant.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:42.449
Although it is not what you expected, it doesn’t
seem that far off either.

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:49.170
You decide to continue mating your parental
mutant flies until you have 1000 progeny.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:55.399
Surely, with this large a sample size, the
ratio of mutant to wild type flies will be

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:57.879
closer to what you expect.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:08.260
Voila. Oh, wait a minute. Even with a 1000
progeny, our experiments still produce 68%

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:12.600
mutant and 32% wildtype flies.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:18.310
Now you are really starting to wonder if you
can call this result “close enough” to

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:29.850
the expected outcome. We can use the Chi-square
test to evaluate the hypothesis that the observed

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:36.850
ratio of 68:32 is the same as the expected
ratio of 3:1.

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:43.410
Pause the video here, calculate the Chi square
test statistic, and determine the degrees

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.410
of freedom in your data.

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:58.769
You should have obtained 29.2 for your Chi
square value.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:06.160
Because there are only two phenotypic outcomes
for your cross, there is only one degree of

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:13.170
freedom. Any fly that isn’t a mutant is
wild type and vice versa.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:22.319
The Chi square distribution can also be presented
in tabular form. If you look at this table,

00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:31.529
our experiment with one degree of freedom
and a Chi square value of 29.2 corresponds

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:42.660
to a probability that is much smaller than
0.05. Do you have support for the null hypothesis

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:49.660
or should you reject it? Pause the video here
and take a moment to think about it.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:03.720
Because the ratio of progeny that you obtained
in your experiment has a probability of happening

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:10.730
that is less than our level of significance,
you should reject our null hypothesis.

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:17.800
This indicates that our discrepant results
are due to something more than just random

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:25.940
chance. A multitude of other factors could
be contributing to our results. For example,

00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:32.610
there may be interactions with other genes
that you are not aware of. Or, environmental

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:40.860
factors could be playing a role. All we know
is that our null hypothesis of a 3:1 ratio

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:47.110
of mutant to wildtype flies is incorrect.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:53.680
As a next step, you decide to go back and
review your notes to see if you can formulate

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.519
another plausible hypothesis.

00:13:57.519 --> 00:14:05.759
Reviewing your Punnett square, you expected
to obtain this genotypic ratio in the F1 progeny.

00:14:05.769 --> 00:14:15.669
If you were to select a GG mutant from the
F1 progeny and cross it with a gg wild-type

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:21.649
fly, you would expect that all of the progeny
would be mutants.

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:29.269
After attempting this cross with a variety
of flies from the F1 progeny that have a mutant

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:36.249
phenotype, it becomes clear that you cannot
find a mutant fly that when crossed with a

00:14:36.249 --> 00:14:46.009
wild-type fly, produces all mutant progeny.
Somehow, you keep selecting heterozygous mutants.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:55.840
You begin to suspect that the F1 population
does not contain the expected number of GG

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.459
flies!

00:14:57.459 --> 00:15:03.800
Checking your lab notebook, you see a note
about an observation that you barely paid

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:10.499
attention to at the time. When you mated the
two parental mutant flies, there were a number

00:15:10.499 --> 00:15:18.479
of dead embryos in your vial. A new hypothesis
is forming in your mind.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.389
Can you come up with a hypothesis that may
explain the observations you have made through

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:33.469
these experiments? Pause the video here. Discuss
and justify your hypothesis with a classmate.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:47.120
While there are many possible hypotheses,
one possible hypothesis is that the dead embryos

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:56.820
in your vial were the missing GG mutants.
It may be that the wingless trait when homozygous,

00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:58.759
results in lethality.

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:10.039
This would result in a phenotypic ratio of
2:1 mutant to wild-type flies in the F1 progeny.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:21.800
Again, you can use the Chi square test for
goodness of fit to test your new null hypothesis.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:31.309
Going back to your data of 1000 progeny, use
the test to evaluate the null hypothesis.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.560
Pause the video.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:47.980
You should have obtained a Chi square value
of 0.36. For one degree of freedom, you fail

00:16:48.249 --> 00:16:52.220
to reject your null hypothesis.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:58.129
While you have support for your null hypothesis,
more experiments are needed to confirm the

00:16:58.129 --> 00:17:06.989
idea that the GG genotype is lethal as you
suspect. The results from our Chi squared

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:12.650
test have led us to a reasonable next experiment
to perform.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:24.160
In this video, you saw how the Chi-square
statistic can help us determine if our experimental

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:33.390
genetic data came from the expected population
distribution. Comparing observed values to

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:42.320
expected values helped us determine if deviations
in our data could be explained by random chance

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.470
or if our hypothesis needed revision.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:54.090
The Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit is
just one statistical test of many that allows

00:17:54.090 --> 00:18:00.860
us to determine how confident we are that
a sample of data comes from a population with

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:08.420
a certain distribution. It is important to
understand what these tests mean and how to

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:16.060
interpret their results, so that you know
their limitations and can make informed decisions.
