00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:17.390
We're quite lucky today to have Bob Sieck
talk to us about launch operations.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.329
Bob joined NASA early in his career after
a spell with the Air Force.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.619
This was in the early '60s.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.550
And he worked on prelaunch checkout and servicing
of Gemini and Apollo.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.160
Then went into the Shuttle Program.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.260
He worked on ground operations for the Approach
and Landing Tests.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.230
We will hear more about that testing when
Gordon Fullerton comes here at the beginning

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.899
of December.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:54.480
And then he worked as Launch Director for
a lot of the early Shuttle missions, including

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.890
my first flight.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.870
And then went to be the Shuttle Operations
Director at Kennedy Space Center.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.890
But then after the Challenger accident he
came back and worked on another, I don't know,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.160
40 or so launches.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.730
I think my last launch was in '96.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.400
You had already graduated, right?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.400
Yeah.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.620
But Bob was the Launch Director of the first
four of my flights.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:31.189
He is the head of the whole team of really
thousands of people who are responsible for

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.110
getting the Shuttle ready to fly and for certifying
that, in fact, it is ready to fly.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:46.280
It is a very complicated, critical and from
the safety point of view absolutely one of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.909
the most important things we do, is to figure
out when this incredibly complex vehicle is

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.610
really ready to go.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:04.140
Bob is going to talk to us both about some
of the technical aspects of the launch operations.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.350
But also I hope, from a systems engineering
point of view, we will have a chance towards

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.330
the end to talk about some of the planning
that was going on while the Shuttle was being

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.400
designed and some of the compromises which
had to be made, some of which we've already

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.630
addressed, between the efficiency of turning
around and maintaining a vehicle like the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.520
Shuttle vis-à-vis the actually initial upfront
cost of it.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.610
With that as an introduction, Bob, I will
turn it over to you.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.030
Thanks, Jeff.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.030
And good morning.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.640
As Jeff indicated, I got into the business
of launching people and payloads into space

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.660
a long time ago.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.690
I was privileged to be part of all of the
human space flight programs, so I did a lot

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.690
of that.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.260
What I didn't do, I saw most of.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.010
And I have an opinion on all of it, so please
ask questions.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:12.350
If I don't have the answer, I am sure to have
an opinion.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.900
I am going to spend a little bit of time,
we talk about launch operations, but that's

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.700
the final three to four days of a campaign
that begins three to four months before you

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.300
actually start the countdown clocks and put
the astronauts in the vehicle and go fly.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.580
So I am going to spend some time on the background
of preparing the Shuttle, the ground systems,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:46.560
the flight systems prior to the launch count
process particularly to talk about the engineering

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.420
involvement and the responsibilities in those
processes.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.440
But, in order to talk about launching, I have
to talk some about the operations of putting

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.200
the final pieces together and doing the tests
and inspections prior to launch.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.170
And then I want to get into the real meat
of it which is the human factors, the role

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.890
of the engineer, the role of the managers
in the process of testing, inspecting, checking

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.900
the flight systems, the ground systems and
certifying that it is OK to put the crew in

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.150
and go fly.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.390
And that's where we're going to spend most
of our time, but I've got to go through some

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.190
background first.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.230
I don't know how many of you have been to
the Kennedy Space Center.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.700
Anybody been down there?

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.610
OK, so you've seen it.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:50.480
It is a city where we've launched everything
since the beginning programs, Mercury, Gemini,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.480
Apollo.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.800
The most prominent fixture is this Vehicle
Assembly Building which was used for the Apollo

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.960
Program to put together the 300 foot tall
Saturn-Apollo rocket.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.570
Shuttle is about half that size but we use
this building to do the assembly.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.330
And I will talk a little bit about that later.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.330
But it is a city.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.240
We have our own power systems.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.240
We have facilities to check out the orbiter
to process the solid rocket motors.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.540
We have administrative homes for the people.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:27.010
And, of course, we have the highly visible
launch pads that are out on the ocean.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.350
And we also have a runway.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.910
When the weather cooperates and we can bring
the shuttles back to Florida, we can take

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.770
care of the landing and recovery there.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.810
The process.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.900
We'll talk a little bit about the process.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:52.090
When an orbiter returns from its previous
mission, it goes through essentially a disassembly,

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.110
inspection and then build it back up and test
it to make sure that it is still within the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:05.240
certification base that the engineers set
up for it that you've already heard from previous

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.450
to this lecture.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.889
You would like to think that if the Orbiter
flies and the rest of the element is a successful

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:21.950
mission you can just do it like an airplane,
take down the down cargo, whatever, get it

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.760
configured for the next payload that is going
to go up, clean the windshield, so to speak,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.900
and the crew cabin and go fly it again.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.060
But the rules don't allow you to do that.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:39.900
The rules that the other engineers who have
talked to you have set up are such that you

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.860
have to assume that in some way, even though
during the mission everything seemed to work

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:52.870
OK, that that hardware was compromised through
the process of reentering, landing, refurbishing

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.760
those systems that have to be refurbished.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.770
Something may have been invalidated.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.851
So you have to test all that stuff that worked
just fine in the previous mission, plus all

00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:10.169
of the systems that were not used in the previous
mission, particularly the backup system, the

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:16.800
things that you would have to rely on in the
event that the primary system doesn't cooperate

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.060
during the next mission.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:25.260
And, because of the way the Orbiter was built
with its miles of wiring and thousands of

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:32.050
components that are active components, you
have to disassemble a lot of that stuff in

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.169
order to meet the requirements that the program
is levied on.

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:42.270
After the Orbiter lands and you get it safe
and the crew is out and you take out the payload,

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:49.230
we spend a minimum of two to three months,
roughly a quarter of a million labor hours

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:57.800
of touch labor on the Orbiter to do this disassembly,
test, inspection, refurbishment process before

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:04.580
we move it from the hanger, take it to that
Vehicle Assembly Building, integrate it with

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.610
the tank and the solid rocket boosters and
take it on out to the launch pad to go fly

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.820
again.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.120
And that's where the lion's share of the work
is.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:21.070
The work on the tank and the payloads and
the solid rocket boosters is all peripheral

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.990
to the processing of the Orbiter.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.990
Yes, sir.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:32.150
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Do you find a lot of failures
when you go through?

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.839
We find very few.

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:38.250
And you could do the tradeoff of, well, is
this effort worth it?

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:44.639
But, on the other hand, the few that you find,
you're glad that you found them because if

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:50.309
not you may not have discovered them until
you got out to the launch pad and serviced

00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:51.670
your hazardous systems.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.550
Or, worse yet, you find out when you get in
the mission.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:09:02.209
And then the impact of that could be not only
a safety impact but could be a higher consequence

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:07.839
than spending the month to two months in an
orbiter processing facility doing that work.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:08.839
Yes?

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.170
But is there a learning curve?

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.509
I mean after each mission do you know which
system you have to look at specifically?

00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:24.389
We look at it and say this system is performing
just fine so we don't have to do this intense

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:28.449
invasive inspection and test every flight.

00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:33.649
Maybe we can just do it once a calendar year
or every two to three missions, whatever the

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:41.660
designer thinks is the criteria for checking
on the health of this system.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.089
And we've done that over the years.

00:09:43.089 --> 00:09:47.920
And after we've had a couple of years of missions
where everything is working just fine, we

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.709
start relaxing these requirements.

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:58.110
And then something like Challenger happens
or something like Columbia happens and the

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:03.680
pendulum of conservatism swings the other
direction.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:12.110
And we do more tests and more inspections
to verify the hardware because people want

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:17.040
to be able to say, and we want to be able
to say, well, we've done everything possible

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.860
to make sure that that's a 100% functional,
operating, safe orbiter.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:30.990
And so getting this process down to where
it meets the original advertising brochure

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:37.610
which was we're going to fly these things
every two to three weeks, you start in that

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.610
direction.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:43.019
And then events occur either during the mission
or you have the really bad incidents like

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:44.259
Challenger and Columbia.

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:47.869
And the conservatism swings the other way
and you end up doing more work.

00:10:47.869 --> 00:10:56.990
And, in addition to that, engineers, because
we are what we are, I was one, we have all

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.850
this hardware available, we like to modify
it.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.010
We change it.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:08.149
We upgrade it because there is new technology
available in computers or in composite materials.

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:13.100
So, when the orbiter gets to this processing
facility, regardless of how well the mission

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:19.059
flew, the designers, with their good intensions,
say we want this orbiter to last another five

00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:25.190
years or ten years so we want you to do this
upgrade to the avionics system or we want

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.910
to change out all of the actuators that hold
the payload in the payload bay and this and

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.910
that.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.910
So you modify.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.079
And that adds more time.

00:11:33.079 --> 00:11:42.230
It makes more complexity to the process which
invites more tests and inspections.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:52.699
You're constantly in a mode where unfortunately,
if the mission flies perfectly, by the time

00:11:52.699 --> 00:12:06.230
you plan your campaign through the processing
facility -- 

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:14.050
You plan your campaign with schedules to last
two months maybe, roughly a third of the work

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:20.579
you do is work that you hadn't planned when
you initially brought that orbiter into the

00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:21.930
orbiter processing facility.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.000
It's nonstandard work.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.329
It is stuff that you uncover in the process
of doing your test or inspection or its new

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:32.550
requirements or new changes that come from
the designers that have to be implemented.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:37.959
And, from an efficiency standpoint, if you're
in the manufacturing or production business,

00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:39.970
that is not efficient.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:45.850
If a third of your work that you laid out
for the next two months, at the end of that

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.360
two month period, a third of it was stuff
that you had not planned on doing which means

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.800
you don't have the parts ready, you don't
have the engineering, you don't have the instructions.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800
Yes?

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.889
Do you build in time to cover that now?

00:13:01.889 --> 00:13:03.850
Contingency time, yes.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:09.360
Let me go back to that.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:16.839
We set up our team and operations to run five
days a week, two shifts a day leaving the

00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:21.050
weekends free to catch up for this nonstandard
stuff.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:27.980
We essentially end up running a six day work
week if we're in a standard template of flying

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.509
three missions a year, which we're not now
because we're still recovering from the Columbia

00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:33.509
accident.

00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:41.860
We end up working six days a week and roughly
every three or four days we will work a continuous

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.019
around the clock 24 hour operation.

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:56.589
We try to maintain that original schedule
but we only make it roughly 50% of the time

00:13:56.589 --> 00:14:02.100
due to this, again, nonstandard work, the
extra stuff that works its way in.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.779
And that's why we have a big team.

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:09.670
Our team is made up of the United Space Alliance
as a contractor.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.980
They do the hands-on work.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.179
They have the technicians.

00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:15.699
They have the engineers that staff the consoles.

00:14:15.699 --> 00:14:21.829
And they are roughly a 6,000 population at
Kennedy Space Center.

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:24.589
They take care of the orbiter, the tank, the
boosters.

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:30.300
They are responsible for maintaining all of
our equipment that hooks into the shuttle

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.749
that is required, the process of servicing
it.

00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:40.529
And they have ties to the contractors, the
original equipment manufacturers that built

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:41.879
the hardware.

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:47.239
Technically, they can gain access to all the
original manufacturing records for the parts

00:14:47.239 --> 00:14:49.790
that are in the shuttle.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:15:03.440
NASA's responsibility -- 
NASA owns the requirements for the Shuttle.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:09.560
We delegated all the operational work to the
contractors, but it's a national resource.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.079
Taxpayers paid for it.

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:13.360
The government has a responsibility.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.639
They cannot divest themselves from that.

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:25.149
NASA owns the requirements for saying what
you test, what you inspect and what the specifications

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:27.390
are for acceptable performance of that.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:31.259
That is controlled by NASA.

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:36.579
The management of the contractor at Kennedy
is done by NASA engineers in an organization

00:15:36.579 --> 00:15:41.850
that has roughly 500 people out of the 2000
population at Kennedy Space Center of civil

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:42.850
service people.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.569
500 are directly associated with the Shuttle.

00:15:46.569 --> 00:15:48.269
The rest do payload work.

00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:54.230
The Space Station, of course, is a big work
item now at the Kennedy Space Center.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.779
And they are responsible for the requirements.

00:15:55.779 --> 00:16:01.769
If somebody wants to change the requirement,
a NASA person has to approve that change.

00:16:01.769 --> 00:16:04.559
And we do insight and everything the contractor
does.

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:15.829
We have at each one of the milestones, when
we leave the processing facility, when we

00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:19.730
leave the Vehicle Assembly Building and when
we get ready to launch, there is a review

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:26.189
conducted by NASA to review the work that
was done by the contractor during the preceding

00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:28.279
weeks or months.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:35.430
And NASA approves moving the vehicle onto
the next stage of its assembly prior to launch.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:44.509
And the launch director specifically is responsible
not only for those last few days of the campaign,

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:51.339
so to speak, leading up to launch, but also
insuring the government contractor team has

00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:54.970
all the tools available to them to be successful.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.360
Is the work being scheduled in an orderly
fashion?

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:06.130
Is the ever-tightening budget constraining
their ability to get their work done?

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.339
Is there too much scheduled pressure to meet
a milestone?

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.380
That is the launch director's job.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:16.929
The launch director doesn't just come in the
last three days of the campaign with a tie

00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:20.110
and a suit and orchestrate the countdown.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:26.459
They have a responsibility from the beginning
to the end of the campaign.

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:29.220
Engineering.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:35.590
I have already addressed this, but the NASA
engineers manage the requirements, the changes

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:36.720
to the requirements.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:42.779
They are the ones in addition to the contractor,
this is a check and balance, that look at

00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:47.820
all the data, the engineering results of the
tests and the inspections.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.630
And they approve that they met the requirements.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.130
Also, they participate in critical operations.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:59.980
A critical operation is a test on a specific
system.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.639
Servicing of the vehicle for launch count
or any of the non-standard work that comes

00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:07.500
up during the process.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.380
They audit what the contractor does.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:14.779
And, of course, because we're the customer
and they are the contractor, we have a lot

00:18:14.779 --> 00:18:20.310
of criteria to grade them on for their award
fee performance.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.419
The operations people manage the scheduling.

00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:29.000
As I indicated, we like to work five days
a week, two shifts a day.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.660
We really end up working six days a week and
sometimes around the clock.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.300
The scheduling activity is dynamic.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.140
And NASA approves all the scheduling.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.850
We have to approve all the overtime.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:49.139
We have the authority to say stop or go not
only in launch count but anywhere in the campaign

00:18:49.139 --> 00:18:54.799
of processing the hardware, as well as the
big picture schedule, you know, how many times

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:59.179
a year you're going to fly and which orbiter
is assigned to which payload in those missions.

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:04.880
That is still a NASA responsibility.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.600
Orbiter processing facility, like I mentioned
before, it is like a hanger for an airplane.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:17.659
A big part of the work effort used to be the
tile.

00:19:17.659 --> 00:19:21.639
I think you already had a presentation on
tile.

00:19:21.639 --> 00:19:27.850
There are 25,000 to 30,000 of these little
bricks glued to the vehicle.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:35.110
We classically damage about a hundred of them
on each mission due to ice and things coming

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:40.600
off the tank that have to be replaced, but
we also pull another hundred or so off just

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.950
to inspect the integrity of the glue that
is holding the tile to the structure of the

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:46.950
vehicle.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:53.200
Because a lot of those little bricks have
been glued on there for 25 years and have

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.179
flown 25 to 30 missions.

00:19:57.179 --> 00:20:04.409
Although we have offline test programs that
try to duplicate the environment that the

00:20:04.409 --> 00:20:10.440
tile sees either from a calendar standpoint
or the thermal cycles of the mission, you

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.830
would like to go to the real hardware and
see what is happening.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:20.020
We do that invasive type of work of actually
destroying tile, pulling it off the vehicle

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:27.429
just to make sure that the aging process is
not causing any degradation of the system.

00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:34.660
We pull the engines out and do the maintenance
on the engines offline because the aft fuselage

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.899
of the orbiter is a terrible place to work.

00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:43.210
Any of the hardware we can get out of there
and do it on the bench, it is much better

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:48.419
to do that than to try to do it in the vehicle
with people crawling all over wire bundles

00:20:48.419 --> 00:20:49.850
and structure and that sort of thing.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:56.090
They are concerned about the collateral damage
to do the other work in that compartment of

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.300
the vehicle where the engines are.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:03.341
Of course, you've got to take the accommodations
from the previous mission out of the payload

00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:07.010
bay and put in the new stuff for the next
mission.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.030
I already mentioned modifications.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:16.600
Unfortunately, we change more stuff than we
probably should but in order to keep up with

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:24.380
the aging of the vehicle and the new technology
that goes with the territory of flying a system

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:29.080
that was designed over 30 years ago.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:34.289
And we prepared for the next milestone which
was the vehicle assembly building operations.

00:21:34.289 --> 00:21:39.820
This is where we put the big pieces together.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.070
The solid rocket boosters are stacked.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.440
There are four segments in each booster.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:52.200
That is a very critical process but only takes
less than a month to do.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:58.490
The external tank comes in essentially ready
to fly from Mississippi.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:05.580
Except, as you know now, because of the Columbia
accident, we are still looking at the ramifications

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:13.000
of these lines and other fittings on the tank.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.940
The acreage foam on the tank, just to digress
a little bit, is sprayed on.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.299
And that stuff is tough.

00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:25.139
Early in the program we had problems with
some of that coming off, but we solved that

00:22:25.139 --> 00:22:26.139
years ago.

00:22:26.139 --> 00:22:32.690
What we haven't solved is where you have to
do a manual application of foam over a fitting

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:37.110
that is there because that is where the crane
is attached to it or because there is a line

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.730
there that has to be installed at the Kennedy
Space Center.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.049
You cannot do it back at the factory.

00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:47.980
Putting that thermal protection system foam
on there is a labor-intensive process.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.710
It is a critical technique process.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:56.669
And, obviously, there are still flaws in the
process that the engineers haven't sorted

00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:57.669
out yet.

00:22:57.669 --> 00:23:02.270
And that is why that stuff keeps coming off
the tank in those places.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:09.350
But the solid rocket motors are attached to
this mobile launch platform with four bolts

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.500
the diameter of my wrist.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.889
The structure engineers really figured this
out good.

00:23:14.889 --> 00:23:19.980
There are four on each one of those that are
attached to the launch platform.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:25.960
The tank is attached to the boosters with
four attach points, and those are bolts, again,

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.600
that are the diameter of my wrist.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:35.259
And then the orbiter is hung on the tank in
three places with the same sized bolts.

00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:42.230
You've got six million pounds of weight that
is attached to the mobile launch platform

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:48.190
that is held up by these four bolts, well,
eight total on the solid rocket motors.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:53.580
And they work out the dynamics of when the
engines start because the vehicles sways like

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:58.700
this because the center of gravity is not
right over where those eight bolts are attached.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.880
And that system works fine.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.470
It always amazed me that you could hang that
much weight on those few bolts that are only

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:09.580
the diameter of this, but it works.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:19.600
The orbiter is brought over after its campaign,
it's hung on the tank and we test all those

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.900
connections between the solid rocket booster,
the platform, the tank and the orbiter.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.380
And that only takes about a week to do that.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.720
And, if that looks good, we have a review
of all of that work.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:37.429
And if the review says we didn't leave anything
undone, that we shouldn't take out the launch

00:24:37.429 --> 00:24:40.750
pad then we go out to the launch pad.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.110
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Sure.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:52.799
Say a little bit about this difference from
just bringing your car into have a 50,000

00:24:52.799 --> 00:25:00.039
mile checkup, that is the clean room aspects,
the following of procedures, of having a checker.

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:01.039
Sure.

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:05.610
Well, a 50,000 mile checkup on a car is usually
an external inspection.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:10.750
You change the oil and the filter and you
check all the belts and the radiator hoses

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.399
and you change all the fluids.

00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:16.870
Well, you do that with the orbiter also.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:23.370
But, in the case of the orbiter, you want
to know whether you are this far away from

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:30.019
having to do a valve job or the rings in the
engine have now got so many thousand miles

00:25:30.019 --> 00:25:32.100
on them.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.960
We have the equivalent.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.290
You take the heads off the engine and you
give it a valve job.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:45.830
And you take the pistons out of the block
and you check for scoring in the block.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.669
You take the transmission out and you pull
the gears out and make sure that the synchronizers

00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:52.690
are still OK.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:53.860
And you go through the rear-end.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.379
And you take all the avionics out.

00:25:57.379 --> 00:26:02.129
Or, you take your carry-on test equipment
in and you hook it up to these connectors

00:26:02.129 --> 00:26:06.419
on the airflow meter and the computer in your
vehicle and you run all those diagnostics

00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:10.110
to make sure all that stuff, even though it
worked fine after you turned that ignition

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:15.970
key off the last time, that all the redundancies
and all the capability is still within that

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.190
hardware and all the margins are still there.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:24.360
And then you button it back up and you make
sure you button it back up properly, all of

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.960
which is pre-established quite rigid flowcharts,
checklists.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.320
A checker checking the checker.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.279
Oh, yes, and you have inspectors where there
are critical things.

00:26:36.279 --> 00:26:41.000
If you're torquing the connecting rods onto
the crankshaft, it says that you've got to

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.779
do those bolts at 50 something foot pounds.

00:26:43.779 --> 00:26:45.140
And the technician will do that.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:49.860
And there will be an inspector there verifying
that he set the torque wrench at 50 foot pounds

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.620
and it really clicked there, and they stamp
the procedure that it was done that way.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.279
I wanted to just add to that, I mean, even
more emphasis.

00:26:58.279 --> 00:27:04.840
You don't do anything to the vehicle or to
the payload unless you have a written procedure.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:13.269
What is absolutely not allowed is oh, there
is a little problem, something didn't work

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:14.940
the way it was supposed to in the test.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:15.940
Let's just fiddle around.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.590
Let's throw a few switches and see what happens.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:23.940
Well, I mean, that is normally the way you
work at things if you're in a laboratory or

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.480
working on your car.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.330
But the thing is you need absolute traceability.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:37.940
Because if something later on turns up out
of spec or there is an anomaly during flight,

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:42.909
you need to be able to recreate everything
that was done to the orbiter.

00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:48.090
That is why we keep such good records on parts.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:54.900
Well, you can tell you that story about the
tires that you just mentioned.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.820
People keep track of where all the parts of
the orbiter came from, the lot numbers.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:07.249
And so, if any problem turns up, you can actually
then trace on the orbiter and see if it affects

00:28:07.249 --> 00:28:08.879
there.

00:28:08.879 --> 00:28:18.110
All the work is done for approved work authorization
documents, every step, every touch labor item

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.480
that is done on the vehicle.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.899
And if you deviate from that procedure, which
is approved by engineering, you have to get

00:28:24.899 --> 00:28:29.590
engineering approval to deviate from it.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:35.200
The assembly process, the standard work process
of putting the vehicle together after a mission,

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:41.559
there is over two million verifiable work
items for the standard flow.

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:48.200
And that doesn't include modifications or
the nonstandard work that comes up, the proverbial

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:54.620
glitch that occurs when you're checking out
your computer system or when you pressurize

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:59.309
this fluid system and the leak rate is higher
than the specification allows.

00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:04.139
Well, engineering comes in and says OK, here
is the trouble procedure.

00:29:04.139 --> 00:29:10.570
Here is what you're going to pursue, but you
don't do any of that until the engineers write

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.690
the procedure and give it to the technicians
or the console operators that say OK, here

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:17.889
is what you're going to do to try to find
out the source of this leak.

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:22.929
As Jeff indicated, you don't just start throwing
switches and turning valves and say well,

00:29:22.929 --> 00:29:24.820
let's see if we can find out what's going
on here.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.799
It is all pre-approved.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:32.679
And the reason for that is when you have these
reviews that culminate into final review before

00:29:32.679 --> 00:29:38.779
you get ready to fly, you want to be able
to say that this vehicle is assembled per

00:29:38.779 --> 00:29:44.210
print, that the designer's requirements, the
people that you've already heard from that

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:48.539
certified that this system will work just
fine in flight if it looks like this when

00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:53.110
we launch it, you're trying to prove that
this is what it looks like when you launch

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:58.419
it and it is within the certification base
and it is per the engineering drawings that

00:29:58.419 --> 00:30:00.280
we were given and it met all these requirements.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:06.330
Otherwise, you are guessing that it is OK
to go fly the machine.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:11.659
And you cannot do that in this business.

00:30:11.659 --> 00:30:13.950
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Yes.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:22.909
Does that seem to create any sort of tension
on the engineers feeling like their hands

00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:23.909
are tied to go out and do stuff?

00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:28.840
Well, no, because they are the ones that ultimately
say what goes in those two million steps.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:35.980
And if they want to add more tests or checks
or inspections it is within their purview

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.610
to propose that.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:42.409
The program, there is a group of senior engineers
that are on these what we call control boards

00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:47.059
that approve the requirements that are implemented
at the Kennedy Space Center.

00:30:47.059 --> 00:30:51.919
And they can say yeah, that's a good idea
or, no, we don't want to change this, go back

00:30:51.919 --> 00:30:58.139
and give us some more rationale for what you
think is a good idea to do to this system.

00:30:58.139 --> 00:31:06.129
In that respect, it is probably somewhat frustrating
for the engineers because they cannot do anything

00:31:06.129 --> 00:31:10.570
different from last time unless they can justify
the rationale for it.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:18.840
But that's the way it ought to be.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.330
The launch pad.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:29.549
The facilities at the launch pad are pretty
simple.

00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:35.529
These are the same launch pads we flew from
in Apollo.

00:31:35.529 --> 00:31:40.559
We've got storage facilities for the liquid
hydrogen, liquid oxygen.

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:46.679
We try to spend a minimum amount of time at
the launch pad because Florida is a nice place

00:31:46.679 --> 00:31:54.039
to be on spring break but it's a bad place
to have exotic hardware sitting outdoors with

00:31:54.039 --> 00:31:59.049
all that salt, humidity and all the other
elements that mother nature throws at you

00:31:59.049 --> 00:32:00.049
like lightening.

00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:07.190
And, I think you can see down here, we have
a good lightening protection system.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:13.780
There is a single mast with two wires that
go out about a half a mile from the launch

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.780
pad.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.150
It makes a good Faraday shield.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:21.090
And over the years we've been whacked a lot
of times with lightening.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.169
In fact, it's a good attraction for lightening.

00:32:23.169 --> 00:32:28.360
And we have never gotten energy inside of
that Faraday shield to damage any hardware.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.360
However, when we get lightening down there,
we tell the workers to stand down and, of

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.669
course, seek safe haven.

00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:35.880
But we have instrumented it.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:42.259
And it has taken some big hits, but we haven't
gotten anything major inside that would cause

00:32:42.259 --> 00:32:44.169
us a problem from electric.

00:32:44.169 --> 00:32:45.169
Yes?

00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:50.250
After you take the Shuttle out onto the launch
pad, is it very expensive to roll it back

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.279
when you find a problem and then bring it
back out again?

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:54.279
Yes, it is.

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:59.700
And that's why we have these reviews before
we commit it to go to the launch pad to make

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:05.860
sure that we're not taking any unknowns or
any work out to the launch pad that should

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.879
rightfully be done either in the Vehicle Assembly
Building or further back in the Orbiter Processing

00:33:10.879 --> 00:33:11.879
Facility.

00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:16.820
It is a lengthy process because it takes about
a week to hook everything up at the pad and

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:22.799
check it before you go into the process of
servicing the propellants and doing the hazardous

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:28.869
work which has to all be undone if you roll
back to the Vehicle Assembly Building.

00:33:28.869 --> 00:33:34.039
You've got to make sure you're really ready
to go before you head on out there.

00:33:34.039 --> 00:33:35.039
Yes?

00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:38.250
Approximately how many times has that happened?

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.309
Going back?

00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:52.619
Well, we probably have done it for technical
reasons maybe 20% of the time.

00:33:52.619 --> 00:33:56.539
For weather reasons like we're worried about
a hurricane or something like that the same,

00:33:56.539 --> 00:34:01.530
about 20% of the time.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.850
One out of every five times we've gone to
the launch pad, we've had to come back for

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:11.720
either a weather problem or a technical problem
that either occurred at the launch pad or

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:18.750
it's something that happened with a different
vehicle in the fleet that may still be in

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:23.281
the Orbiter Processing Facility or a components
that is similar to one that is on the Shuttle

00:34:23.281 --> 00:34:28.290
that is at the pad that they were doing testing
in the laboratory or doing what we call fleet

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:30.240
leader testing at one of the NASA facilities.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:37.910
And they said, you know, there is an inherent
flaw in this auxiliary power unit and we have

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:43.710
to change the ones that are in the orbiter
because they were manufactured at the same

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:47.950
time or they have the same component on them
and you cannot do that work out at the launch

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:49.910
pad so you've got to roll it back.

00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:55.690
So the hardware at the pad may be just fine
from the standpoint that you followed your

00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:00.830
processes and they checked out great in the
previous part of the campaign.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:05.440
But an offline issue can cause you to say
no, we've got to roll back and go change out

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:12.620
this hardware or fix it or further test it
before we can commit it to go fly.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.090
We have a big water tower out there also which
I will talk about later.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.330
That is our sound suppression system.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:25.620
But basically a month is the maximum time
you like to spend out there.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:31.830
We used to put a lot of payloads in the Orbiter
Processing Facility when we were flying laboratories

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:32.830
and that sort of thing.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:39.640
Space Station hardware, we install all that
out at the launch pad now.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:44.790
And we test all the connections at the new
facility.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.390
And we have a simulated launch count with
the astronauts.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:51.810
And this is a tradition that goes back to
the Mercury program.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.360
They bring the astronauts down to the Cape.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:01.150
They go through a day, two days of training,
emergency egress, familiarization with the

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.610
hardware, And then we have a simulated launch
count without the propellants and all the

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:12.360
hazardous stuff just to, if nothing else,
remind the launch team that this is more than

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.360
just a machine.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.770
We are going to fly people in this thing.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.540
And this occurs roughly two weeks before launch.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:23.070
And it is a good readiness test for the whole
team.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.130
It's serious.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:26.890
We're a couple weeks before flight.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:27.890
The crew is in town.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:31.530
This vehicle is going to look the best it
ever has.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:36.860
And we do a simulated launch countdown to
within a couple seconds of liftoff.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:43.990
And then we do a simulated abort with the
safeing of the vehicle and the crew gets out.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:46.450
And I will just add something.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:51.730
That is always something the crew looked forward
to, first of all, because you actually get

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:56.720
to get in the vehicle which, despite the fact
that we have pretty good simulators in Houston,

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:03.420
there is nothing like actually crawling inside
the shuttle that you're going to fly in.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:07.060
And there is a lot of safety training that
you do down at the Cape which is really kind

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.020
of fun.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:14.470
You don't have any pictures of the launch
escape, the pad slide wire basket?

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:15.920
No, I don't think so.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.100
There is a requirement that you need to be
able to get off the pad quickly if there is

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.090
a launch emergency.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:27.250
And, of course, on the real launch day, unlike
the simulated countdown where the pad is crawling

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:33.780
with people, on launch day there are very
few people, even when you're getting into

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.360
the vehicle because it is fueled.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.750
And then everybody else leaves.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:44.631
So they have this big slide wire where if
you have to get out of the orbiter in a hurray

00:37:44.631 --> 00:37:49.870
you go out and you jump in the bag, hit a
little guillotine and it cuts you loose and

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:51.060
you slide all the way down.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:57.210
Actually, in the early days, the astronauts
kept saying we need to try this out.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:01.420
And they said no, you cannot do it because
it hasn't been man rated.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.720
We said wait a minute.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:09.220
Well, it's rated for emergency use only so
you cannot try it out.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:17.790
And then after Challenger they insisted that
somebody actually ride down in it.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:18.790
Not every crew.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:21.070
Just one person tried it out.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:27.140
But the other thing that you do, once you
get down to the bottom there is an underground

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.780
bunker that you run into.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:34.540
And either you stay there and wait for help
or they have these armored personnel carriers

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.250
sitting around there with little tanks which
you get in.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.330
And you've got to be able to drive your tank.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.700
They have a breakout section of the fence
so you drive the tank through the fence out

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.460
to a helicopter pickup point.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.810
So we all have to go out and learn how to
drive the tank.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:53.940
And we drive over the sand dunes and everything.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:59.160
And then also they have a big pool which they
light on fire.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:05.560
And they give you a big fireman's hose and
they show you how to make your way through

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:10.310
a fire by squirting a water path in front
of you.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:15.930
All the little things you dream of as a kid,
to be a fireman, drive a tank.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.690
So it's good fun.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:22.260
But it is part of the extensive safety procedures
that they have.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:26.190
And all these things periodically they have
to exercise.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:30.190
They do go through, every once in a while,
a disaster drill down at the Cape where they

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:36.340
simulate an emergency where they have to pick
up the crew either outside the launch pad

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.290
or either out in the ocean.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:46.380
And you've got to keep people at full operational
readiness.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.410
That's one of the aspects of training.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.640
We train for the anomalies, the nonstandard
things.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:58.380
The standard work, they do so much of that
anyway you don't have to train for that.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.990
You don't have to train to put a payload in
the payload bay.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.060
You don't have to train to power up your system
and run your system checkout because that

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.560
is a repetitive thing.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:14.350
But the nonstandard stuff, when things go
wrong, that's where the emphasis of the training

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.350
is.

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:16.920
And, like Jeff said, it's a lot of fun.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.150
It's fun for the launch team, too.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:26.890
We have a control center at the Cape, and
it is called the Launch Control Center.

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:29.180
You would think this is where you launch it
from.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.180
Well, you do that.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:35.390
But all of the other work that is done in
the preceding three months is controlled from

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:41.750
the Launch Control Center by test conductors
and engineers who wrote the procedures and

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.760
the software that implement all the requirements.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.030
And they control the activity on the orbiter
or the tank or the boosters when it is still

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:53.800
back in the offline facilities or the Vehicle
Assembly Building or out to the launch pad.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.030
They do it from the Launch Control Center.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:58.680
We automate what we can from there.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:03.420
But for the manual activity -- And a lot of
it is manual because regrettably you cannot

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.210
do all this refurbishment on the shuttle with
automated systems.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.720
It wasn't built that way.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:17.200
It is all managed from out Launch Control
Center with old computers but with a great

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:29.390
team 

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.320
of people.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:36.120
The software we use in the computers, I am
not going to go into a lot of detail because

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.570
it is really old stuff, but it works.

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:46.900
It is like the software program that the FAA
uses to track airplanes.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.980
It is hacker-proof.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:54.430
There are no external interfaces outside of
the Launch Control Center firewall.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.640
It works just fine.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:01.620
And that is where we do the management of
our day-to-day operations from our Launch

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:02.620
Control Room.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.240
And we call it the LPS Launch Processing System
software.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.910
We've tried to change it a couple of times
over the years.

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:10.350
Buy new hardware.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:18.490
We have supplemented it with laptops so that
we can do more human engineering displays,

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:24.410
but the computers are the same ones that we
bought back in the late '70s.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:28.320
But then so are the computers that are on
the orbiter that fly the machine.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.310
So it works.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:37.880
This is a bit repetitive, but I want to go
through it again to make sure to emphasize

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.170
what the role of the engineering is.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:45.820
The designers that you've heard from, they
certified their design.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:54.260
And they did extensive testing, just like
Detroit does on a car on the door latch.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:00.530
And they've tested that door latch and said,
well, this thing out to be good for 250,000

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:06.140
miles or 20 years or so many gazillion opening
and closings of the door before it wears out

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.150
and you've got to replace it.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:08.370
Well, they did all that.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:13.590
And to make sure that that hardware is still
within the certification base, they developed

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.370
requirements, sent them down to the Cape.

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:23.150
We put them in the procedures, either manual
procedures or software to implement those

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:24.310
requirements.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:30.870
And the team, United Space Alliance the contractor
and the NASA engineers will certify at each

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:35.050
of the milestone reviews and the process of
moving the hardware out to the pad they've

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.210
met those requirements.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:43.440
And they did that either by participating
in the activity or by reviewing the test data.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:51.940
And that allows us to sign a certificate of
flight readiness a few days before launch

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.450
that all the requirements have been met.

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:59.330
When we get into launch count, we take in
a subset of those requirements that when everything

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:05.150
is powered up and ready to go fly all of these
systems that are active ought to look like

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.990
this.

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:11.080
The voltages should be between this upper
limit and this lower limit.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.400
The pressure should be between here and here.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.190
These indicators should show that they are
open and these indicators should say that

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:21.390
this latch is closed or the valve is closed
or whatever.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:24.750
And we put that in what is called launch commit
criteria.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:31.840
And that is the acceptable limit for the performance
of that hardware when you're at that point

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:37.840
which is nine minutes before launch when everybody
commits that they are ready to go fly.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:44.610
And all those requirements, again, are implemented
by procedures in software.

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:50.970
And the three days of launch count have roughly,
these are numbers, but about 500 requirements.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:55.520
There are thousands of measurements associated
with those requirements.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:01.140
And most of the looking at those measurements
is done by computers, obviously.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:07.850
But you have the engineer involved because
if it is not within limits you turn to the

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.300
engineer for what is wrong.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.610
Is there any chance to go fix this or do we
have to change hardware?

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.750
Do we have to do trouble shooting?

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.800
So it's not a hands-off operation, obviously.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:29.010
The 
structure of the launch team, the launch director

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:35.630
is shown in the middle, but that doesn't mean
he or she is the only one with a go or a no-go

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:37.220
button.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:44.180
The people the implement the requirements,
there are roughly 150 of them in our Control

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:50.420
Center, and they are the ones that provide
the go, no-go for all the subsystems both

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.550
flight and ground that everything is operating
within the limits.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:46:02.150
They report that to a team of test conductors,
NASA and contractor, and that's reported to

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:03.560
the launch director.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.220
We are not along, obviously.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:14.270
We have an engineering support area, which
are all the hidden senior engineers that you

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:15.390
don't see on television.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:19.330
And there is a room full of about 150 to 200
of those.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:25.480
And they are looking at the performance of
these systems as they are activated in launch

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480
count.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.670
And they've got all the trend data, the previous
history of it.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:34.750
And they're looking at things like, well,
all right, everything is in limits, but is

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.810
it within family?

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:41.970
The last time the system performed the voltage
with this or the pressure was this.

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:43.390
Well, it's still in limits.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:47.380
But it's not the same as it was before so
we go look at it.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.400
Well, that's for this group of engineers over
here.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.680
These guys and gals are running through their
procedures.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:59.560
And, if everything was within limits, we just
turn to the next page and go onto the next

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.000
one.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.100
And they also have the emergency procedures.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:09.380
If something bad happens these are the people
that will implement the emergency procedures.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.700
This offline support, they're out there.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:16.410
They're the senior people, they've been there
before, they've been out there who knows how

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:26.210
many years and they're asking questions like
that didn't look right or we missed that step,

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.050
go back and check it again.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:29.820
That's what they are for.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:35.590
The mission management team over here, these
are the people that do the certificate of

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:36.590
flight readiness.

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:41.730
These are the folks that stand up in the readiness
reviews and say I gave the Cape folks a good

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.180
set of requirements.

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.110
There is nothing that happened with the hardware
that they're responsible for.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:50.360
And all those offline facilities are on previous
missions.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.140
That shouldn't have any cloud over this mission.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.960
They are responsible for certifying that.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.600
And they do that through a structure of the
mission management team.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:07.010
You've got, of course, the flight director
with flight rules and the flight team that

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:09.420
they look at during the launch count process.

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:17.220
And you will hear more about that from Wayne
Hale.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:23.810
And they, obviously, have a go, no-go input
to the launch director in the decision process

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:25.670
also.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:28.670
We have an integration activity.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:34.470
They system engineers are each responsible
for, you know, they have boundary conditions

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:35.940
on what they are responsible for.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.150
It is these pieces of hardware.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.150
It is this wiring.

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.250
It is these actuators or latches or whatever.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.580
But a lot of that stuff fits together.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:47.260
Integration is a technical term for making
sure that this person talks to this person

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.100
and that they are hooked in with this one.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:56.990
That activity is done by a console in the
Control Room, again, with senior engineers

00:48:56.990 --> 00:49:02.470
who actually manage all the automated software
that runs the last couple hours of launch

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:04.960
count that really launches the vehicle.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.990
And they are tied in with that.

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.890
You also have the more subjective stuff.

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:13.680
We launch on a public range.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:20.690
Public safety is obviously an issue, so the
range has to make sure that it is safe to

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:25.030
fly from a public standpoint, there are no
boats in the launch danger area, no airplanes

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:30.930
and that the weather meets the criteria of
being able to track the vehicle should it

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:31.930
go off course.

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:38.070
And, of course, the payload has to certify,
particularly if there is an active payload,

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:42.320
that all of their launch commit criteria is
met.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:47.910
And last, but certainly not least, you have
safety oversight of all of that activity.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:52.650
And what I don't show on there, of course,
is the flight crew, but they are obviously

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:56.990
in communication with all of these people.

00:49:56.990 --> 00:50:00.780
So that is the network.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:05.420
But everybody out here has no-go authority.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:13.220
Anybody can come on the Net or press their
switch and say I've got a problem, we're not

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.600
going anywhere.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:19.450
And it is the launch director and the launch
team's responsibility to make sure that problem

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:26.800
is addressed, hold at the convenient, graceful
to stop all the activity hold point until

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.900
the issue is resolved.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:33.770
The real job, and I'll get into this later,
of the launch director is to say no when everybody

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:41.750
else wants to go because, as you get further
into the launch count, the "launch fever"

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:43.410
process sets in.

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:52.240
It is a natural thing, it seems to be.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.240
People want to go.

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.480
I want to ask you about that a little bit,
I know we'll get into it later on, but flight

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:03.100
rules and the launch decision, there are flight
rules that say you must scrub if these conditions

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:04.330
are not met.

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:05.330
Right.

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:08.680
And, yet, there is a tendency to allow judgment
to come in.

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:19.980
Let's take an example of a limit on crosswind
at you landing to the return to launch site.

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:25.690
You see it go above limits, but the rules
strictly says no, you cannot go.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:26.930
Talk about that a little bit.

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:32.570
That is what we use the mission management
team for.

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:34.220
And you bring up the weather example.

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:38.500
Most of this stuff is pretty straightforward.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:43.450
It is either the voltage pressure temperature
is in limits or out of limits.

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:47.510
A person can question that and say I don't
like the trend, and you've got to stop and

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:53.900
clear the air if they say I want more discussion
on this, I want more data review and that

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.900
sort of thing.

00:51:54.900 --> 00:52:03.050
If it is a discussion like that involves activity
outside of the Control Room beyond the purview

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:07.040
of the console operators that are running
through the procedure, we rely on the mission

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:13.240
management team to manage that activity so
the console operators can concentrate on their

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:17.410
launch commit criteria and their procedures
and their software.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:22.520
Something like crosswind limits, if there
is a debate with the flight director and the

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:28.920
weather people, we hold the clock and say
mission management team, that is yours.

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:34.870
You manage it, and whatever you have to do
to resolve the decision, we'll scrub if need-be,

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:41.590
we'll hold if need-be, or if the community
can get comfortable that these crosswinds

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:46.440
that are peaking occasionally out of spec,
that it's OK to go fly anyway, then we will

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.550
wait to hear from the flight director that
that's OK.

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:55.220
We don't insulate the Control Room from that,
but we don't want to burden the control center

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.520
with work and what is an offline issue.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:02.140
And it is up to the mission management team
to disposition that.

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:07.200
And you bring up weather because weather is
one of the few things that there is really

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.290
a lot of judgment still involved.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:13.250
Is the weather good enough to go fly?

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:18.390
And it is probably the only thing that is
in that category because everybody has an

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:19.430
opinion on the weather.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:20.860
And Florida weather is dynamic.

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.880
And usually, unless it is wintertime, there
are clouds.

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.390
And there is always a tendency, if you've
held for weather or the weather is marginal,

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:34.530
to hold longer to see if the weather gets
better.

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:40.350
And the real issue for the launch director
is to try to convince people, if the weather

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.770
is good enough, that this is good enough.

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:46.220
And, yeah, you could wait longer for it to
get better but it's good enough.

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.990
We're running out of window time.

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:53.910
All the time we sit here on the ground with
all these systems humming along, the probability

00:53:53.910 --> 00:54:00.540
of some glitch or something coming up to scrub
you is increased.

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:06.500
And just as a personal note, when I was I
the Air Force, I was a weather forecaster

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.600
for Missile Operations.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:15.520
And I felt that that was a waste of an engineer's
time because I was a graduate engineer with

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.310
my diploma sticking out of my pocket.

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:21.180
I wanted to go launch missiles and rockets,
and the Air Force said Lieutenant Sieck is

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:25.220
going to be a weather forecaster supporting
Missile Operations.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:32.930
I endured that for a couple of years and put
all of that experience in my hip pocket.

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:36.940
And I didn't need it until I got into this
launch director job.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:44.860
And I spent many hours talking to the weather
people who provide the forecast for the launch

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:52.520
going over all of the data and the technical
aspects of the weather situation to see if

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:57.370
there it was prudent to sit here any longer
and wait for the weather to improve or whether

00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:02.440
it was better to scrub, get these guys out
of their uncomfortable suits and send them

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:06.410
back to crew quarters and recycle for the
next day.

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:14.060
And they won't necessarily scrub, but you
have to disposition their concern.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:17.950
And you will hold until their concern is taken
care of.

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:18.950
Yes?

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:28.380
This is unrelated, but you know how the Russians,
in going out to the launch pad, use a rail

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.050
track and they have the rocket flat?

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.270
Can you do that with the shuttle?

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:40.360
Instead of stacking it like this and then
rolling it out, would it be better, easier?

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:46.400
Well, the problem with that are the solid
rocket boosters.

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:54.130
They weight approximately, when assembled,
a little less than three million pounds a

00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:55.130
piece.

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:58.740
And the joints that caused the Challenger
accident are critical.

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:04.930
And I don't know if they went through the
technical aspects of the design, but these

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.650
things are 14 feet in diameter.

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:13.280
Each segment weighs 300,000 pounds and they
have these two cleavaces that come together

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.230
with O rings in there.

00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:21.040
And what caused the Challenger accident was
there was rotation in these joints to the

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.770
point where the O rings, because of cold weather,
weren't making a good seal and caused a gas

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:26.770
path.

00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:30.250
And 1200 degree temperature.

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:35.090
Exhaust plume just cut through the metal once
it found a path.

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:37.310
So you want to maintain the integrity of these
joints.

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:41.250
If you stacked them horizontally, and that
could be done, and then you lift this thing

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:47.000
vertically, the joints aren't certified to
maintain their integrity doing that.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.720
Plus, you'd need some kind of huge crane to
pull this 3 million pounds from horizontal

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:52.720
to vertical.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:57:00.450
I think it's something that could have been
done, had it been built into the design at

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:01.450
the beginning.

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:04.400
And the Russians have a tradition of doing
this.

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.760
And so that is the way they design their rockets.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.300
For whatever reason, we never started that
way.

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.880
From the very beginning, our rockets got stacked
vertically.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:23.240
And that's the way all of the American rockets
have been designed.

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.920
Yes?

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:32.750
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] The launch director, whether
it is flight worthy, actually, that mission

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:38.920
management team is responsible for the flight
worthiness because they encompass not only

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:44.430
watching what you did in launch count, but
the certification of all this hardware before

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:46.890
it even got to the launch pad.

00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:52.880
And, ultimately, the launch director is responsible
for conducting an orderly launch and making

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:57.580
sure that this mission management team doesn't
have any issues, that that engineering team

00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:03.090
doesn't have any issues, that the console
operators have really completed their procedures.

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:04.780
That is their responsibility.

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:10.590
And, if there is any fuzz on that, so to speak,
even though console operators say they're

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:14.680
go, and the mission management team says they're
go and flight says they're go, if there is

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:20.230
any concern about that, it's the launch director's
job to say no, we're not going to go fly today.

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:25.910
We are going to give you another day or two
days to do more homework, look at more data,

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:27.060
have more discussions.

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:31.680
We're going to scrub today, even though everybody
may say we're go.

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.220
And that has happened before.

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:41.980
And I always wondered, after not too many
times, when I've said no, when everybody wants

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:46.500
to go, whether I'll get the phone call saying
well, I'm glad you made it safe today, Sieck,

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.060
but you don't have this job tomorrow.

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:50.830
Well, I never got that call.

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:53.180
Never did.

00:58:53.180 --> 00:59:00.290
The process, not to bore you with it, but
since it is an operation, normally we try

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:02.910
to launch in the middle of a week, Wednesday
or Thursday.

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:07.630
We usually take the weekend off before that
to clean up everything and give the launch

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:11.140
team a rest, so we power up everything.

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:13.390
And that's the way we start the process.

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:17.990
And that's a couple of shifts worth of work
to bring up the ground systems, the flight

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:24.290
systems, make sure that all the avionics hardware
really comes to life.

00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:28.680
And we put in a no work hold at the end of
that to take care of any problems.

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:35.980
If that all goes well then we get into the
more critical activity that has time constraints

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:37.780
associated with it.

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:39.200
We load the fuel cell.

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:44.370
That is the power plants and the orbiter reactants,
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, because

00:59:44.370 --> 00:59:45.440
they have limited life.

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.610
Even if you don't have the fuel cells activated
that stuff boils off and you lose it and that

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:52.970
could count against your mission capability.

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:56.160
And that is a hazardous operation also.

00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.420
And then we put in another no work hold at
the end of that.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:10.610
And then we have a period of time where we
bring up the final systems, put in the time

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:16.280
critical storage, particularly when we're
flying laboratories and you put in plants

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:22.730
or critters or whatever it may be either in
the crew module or the payload bay.

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:29.800
And the last 12 hours down here is when you
really have got to make sure this is a real

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.130
decision point right here.

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:38.220
Are we going to load the external tank, put
a cycle on the tank?

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:43.910
And we know that putting liquid hydrogen and
liquid oxygen, and there is roughly half a

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:50.710
million gallons in a tank, puts stresses into
the hardware.

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:54.460
You really don't want to do that unless you're
pretty sure you're going to launch that day

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.010
or that night.

01:00:56.010 --> 01:01:00.650
We have a meeting before that to make sure
the weather looks pretty good and that the

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:05.150
mission management team is not working any
offline issues.

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:07.090
And that has happened before.

01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:11.090
A war story for you.

01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:17.590
In the early '80s, in one of our missions,
we assembled the mission management team to

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:20.860
decide whether or not we ought to go load
the external tank and go fly.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.860
Everything looked pretty good.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.490
And the orbiter project manager said well,
I need to make you aware of this.

01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:31.750
I just got a telegram from the manufacturers
of the tires.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:39.310
And the manufacturer said they were inspecting
a lot, a lot of the tires of which we have

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:45.380
two of them from the same lot on the Orbiter,
and they found some blems on these tires.

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:51.530
And they don't know whether it's a manufacturing
flaw or an aging defect.

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:55.560
And we don't know whether it affects the integrity
of the tires.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.780
But since we knew you were launching tomorrow,
we thought we would share this with you.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:04.650
Warm regards, BF Goodrich, I think it was
at the time.

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:09.190
Well, the mission management team threw on
that on the table and said hey, we've got

01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:10.400
to go work this.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.310
These people, we don't know, they haven't
said they're not certifying the tires.

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:17.080
They just said they've got a problem.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.070
Well, that's fine.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:25.370
The mission management team, go work that
and let's talk about whether or not it's prudent,

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:32.320
under these circumstances, to go load the
tank with some probability that we get all

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.640
the way down to T minus nine minutes and you
folks are going to say hey, we need to look

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.210
at more test data on these tires or have more
discussions with BF Goodrich on whether or

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:41.473
not we go fly today.

01:02:41.473 --> 01:02:45.410
Well, you don't want to load the tank and
go through all that if that's what you think

01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:50.150
the situation is going to be eight hours away
from that.

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:54.930
And you've put a cycle on the tank, you've
used up a lot of cryos that you cannot save

01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:56.010
because of the heat leak.

01:02:56.010 --> 01:03:01.220
Plus, your launch team has put a cycle on,
depending on the time of day, they've been

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.730
up all day, all night or whatever.

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:08.040
Those are the kinds of issues that you need
to make sure get worked.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:12.540
And the mission management team has to handle
that, but the launch director has to decide

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:16.330
just go work that for another day or two.

01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:19.430
We're not going to load the tank.

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:25.150
Or, what's the promise of this coming to fruition,
the possibility so that it makes sense to

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:27.050
go try to fly?

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:29.900
What did you do with the tires?

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:35.150
In that case, we went ahead and tanked.

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:39.990
The subsystem manager for that, which you
may have already heard from, went back to

01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:45.350
a lot of the test data that they had run on
the tires, that they had been fairly recent.

01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:48.380
Langley, I think, was involved in it.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:53.330
And they said we don't have to worry about
those blems being a problem for the tires

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:56.320
that are on the Orbiter which, by the way,
you don't have any access to at the launch

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.320
pad.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.030
If we were going to change the tires, you
would have to roll back to the Orbiter Processing

01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:01.900
Facility.

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:08.069
And that would be a couple of month's worth
of impact to that flight.

01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:13.960
We ended up not doing anything with the tires,
but it had the mission management team really

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.090
busy for about eight hours.

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:21.670
And this process takes about three days.

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:26.660
And we have refined those procedures, as you
might expect over the years, to make this

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:30.900
as an efficient and repetitive a process as
we can.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:39.670
In addition to minimizing the hazards to the
people and the equipment.

01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:48.730
Before we got to terminal count, usually we
take like a two minute break.

01:04:48.730 --> 01:05:01.520
This is a good time to do that.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:14.780
Terminal count phase.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:19.590
After the tank is loaded, half a million gallons
of liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and there

01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:24.400
are no leaks, and we have leak detectors all
over the vehicle, and we've scrubbed a lot

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:33.320
of launches because of leaks, we give the
crew a go to come on out.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.841
And a crew of seven or eight people, it takes
an hour and a half to get them all in and

01:05:38.841 --> 01:05:42.380
get them connected, check their communications
and that sort of thing.

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:48.070
Roughly three hours before launch we bring
them out, we get them all connected, we close

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:52.770
the hatch and we verify the integrity of the
crew module.

01:05:52.770 --> 01:06:00.410
And clockwise we're down to T minus 20 minutes,
but if it's a rendezvous window, and most

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:01.410
of them are now.

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:08.050
The launch window is only five to ten minutes
long so we have to be in phase with the same

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:13.220
plane that the Space Station is in and we've
got to get in phase with being able to catch

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:18.100
the Space Station or have it catch us.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.560
The launch window, we don't have enough energy
in the Shuttle to steer to any orbit we'd

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.580
like to.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:28.210
The launch window is only about ten minutes
long, so we put in a long hold at T minus

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:32.110
nine minutes for those kinds of missions.

01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:37.850
It is the equivalent of the two minute timeout
in a professional football game.

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:45.520
Everybody has a chance to review their information,
discuss their strategies, if it's a long launch

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:52.010
window, if it was just a lab mission then
we only wait for ten minutes at this T minus

01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:53.010
nine mark.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:58.040
But, if it's a short window, we set up the
clock such that we hold there for almost an

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.330
hour.

01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:04.451
And then, as you saw on that previous chart,
we do a poll of all those people and make

01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:10.050
sure that they are all still go and they're
not working any problems or issues.

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:17.070
And then we start this automated software
program that looks at, in addition to the

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:21.280
systems engineers and their consoles looking
at all their information, we have an automated

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:25.360
program called the Ground Launch Sequencer
that looks at all the measurements, all the

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.880
parameters to make sure that they are within
limits.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:33.370
And it issues all the commands to the vehicle
and the ground support equipment.

01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:38.300
And we did that so we could manage the repeatability
of that process.

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:48.520
And you had to take the human factor button
pressing out of the process as much as possible.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.720
And there is not a lot of work that goes on
in there.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.230
And there is very little manual work.

01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:54.640
You get five minutes.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.980
The orbiter access arm, their ability o get
out of the vehicle in a big hurry is retracted.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:04.030
It takes two to three minutes to pull that
back, but we can get it back up to the vehicle

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:10.750
in less than 30 seconds which is about the
amount of time it takes them to unstrap and

01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:15.950
get out of there anyway if there's a fire
or something bad like that, that they have

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:18.170
to do an emergency egress.

01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:23.840
They start the propulsion units on the Orbiter
that pressurize the hydraulic system.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:29.660
Just like on an airplane, there is an automated
test of all the aero surfaces like they do

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:30.660
on the end of a runway.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:36.330
But this is done by the computer and it wiggles
the elevons and the rudder and the main engines

01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:38.980
to make sure all of that works.

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:46.799
And we also start the conditioning of the
propellant at the engine interface.

01:08:46.799 --> 01:08:49.770
And they already had the discussion about
the main engines.

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:54.441
You have to make sure that the quality of
the fluid in the external tank and the quality

01:08:54.441 --> 01:09:01.339
of it that's right there at the injector of
the engine is within the temperature and density

01:09:01.339 --> 01:09:03.779
parameters that the engine was certified at.

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:06.839
Because we have to drain the propellant out
of the fill lines.

01:09:06.839 --> 01:09:13.000
And, once we've started doing that, that propellant
starts heating up right there on those valves

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.250
that are going to go into the injector and
start the main engines on the Orbiter.

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:19.360
That limits our ability to stop and hold after
that.

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.940
We are good for four to five minutes after
that starts.

01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:28.900
And that process starts at T minus five minutes.

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:34.960
After that point in time, we are either going
to launch or scrub in the next ten minutes.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.980
And then we pressurize the oxygen tank and
we pressurize the hydrogen tank, but anywhere

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:43.750
in this period of time we can stop.

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:49.730
If an engineer or the automated sequencer
says something is out of limits, we will stop

01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:54.580
at those milestones and disposition that problem
if we can.

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:59.540
But, per our rules, we won't waive any requirements
at that point.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:05.440
Even though an engineer may have a perfectly
good explanation as to why this temperature,

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:11.261
pressure or whatever, our limit is not being
met, if the launch commit criteria, the launch

01:10:11.261 --> 01:10:16.060
rules says no, it has to be like this, then
we're not going to go launch that day.

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.520
We won't.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:24.380
After 31 seconds, the solid rocket boosters
come to life.

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:29.380
The propellant doesn't ignite, but their hydraulic
system is powered up.

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:33.110
Their avionics systems are powered up.

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:37.560
Their engine nozzles are checked again in
an automatic sequence.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:43.610
And at 10 seconds, if everything looks good
and all these measurements that our Ground

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:50.540
Launch Sequencer has been looking at, we send
up the computer data bus a go to the onboard

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.940
computers that said all of our stuff has been
satisfied.

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.460
Now, we're still looking at a few things.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:11:00.000
We're looking at those bolts that are holding
the solid rocket motors to the launch pad.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.780
And the ability to blow the nuts that are
holding them, should that system fail, we

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.210
would send the cutoff to the onboard computers.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:13.400
Regardless of where the engines were in their
startup sequence, the three main engines,

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.400
everything will stop.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.420
And hopefully it will gracefully come to a
stop and we will safe all the systems and

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:21.420
go from there.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:27.070
But that is the final handshake that is preplanned
between flight and ground is that ten seconds

01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:29.920
when we send a command up to the computer
saying we are all go.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.070
We can still shut you off, and we can shut
you off manually, too.

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:40.440
If a console operator sees something happening
that they think could compromise the safety

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.340
of the launch, they can call for a cutoff.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.190
And we have a switch that says cutoff.

01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:51.460
It sends a command to the onboard computers,
and it will stop everything within 10 to 20

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:52.460
milliseconds.

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:59.920
But you don't like to put humans in a position
to have to make that call.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:09.670
And that's why all of the critical stuff is
done by the computers.

01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:11.940
And I mentioned the Ground Launch Sequencer.

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:16.420
That's a console and operators in the back
of the Control Room.

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:20.880
And they are the ones, by the way, that determine
nobody presses a button for launch.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:28.790
A woman in the back of the Control Room types
the liftoff time into the computer when the

01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:31.830
launch director tells her, hey, look, it looks
like we're going to come out of our T minus

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:33.780
nine minute hold at this point in time.

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:34.960
So here is the liftoff time.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.960
Put that in the computer.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.230
And after that it's a hands-off operation.

01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:47.830
Can I ask, are these commands being physically
sent, I mean they're hard line cable?

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:51.460
It's what we call a launch data vest.

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:56.890
It's a cable that is connected from the computers
in the Control Room through the liftoff umbilical

01:12:56.890 --> 01:13:01.860
into the Orbiter computers.

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.790
It's a data train.

01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:07.170
And when is that connection broken?

01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:08.170
At liftoff.

01:13:08.170 --> 01:13:14.360
The onboard computers will check the health
of the main engines, and if the three main

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.050
engines are within all of their operating
parameters, the turbines and the pumps and

01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:29.240
the temperatures then it sends a command to
those eight bolts that hold the solid rocket

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:35.280
boosters to the mobile launch platform and
the bolts that hold the external tank vent

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.470
arm to the tank.

01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:42.050
And the two Orbiter umbilicals that says fire
the nuts, we're going to go.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:45.400
And that is orchestrated by the onboard computers.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:50.150
And when that happens you're flying, you're
going.

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:57.820
The command to ignite the igniters on the
solid rocket motors is sent at that time also

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:02.110
by the onboard computers within a couple of
milliseconds.

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:03.510
So all that happens at once.

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:08.440
And it's an onboard automated thing.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:20.380
I talked about the human factor that repeatability
is important.

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:27.270
And I mentioned I gave the engineers, you
know, I always threw rocks at them because

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:28.520
they always want to change things.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.890
It is the launch director's responsibility
to manage.

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:39.790
They're the owner, so to speak, of the launch
count procedures, the 5,000 pages of documentation

01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:46.810
and the 500 or so software programs that are
executed in the launch count process.

01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:49.710
And we discouraged changes to that for obvious
reasons.

01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:53.360
Unless there is a modification to the flight
hardware or the ground hardware or we found

01:14:53.360 --> 01:15:00.170
something in our previous launch attempt that
said we need to fix this or there's an opportunity

01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:05.670
to increase the margins, we don't change it.

01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:10.270
We try to maintain the procedure and the hardware
the way it always has been.

01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:11.960
And it essentially is.

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:17.630
We do training, obviously, but we train for
the nonstandard work.

01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:25.210
Just like in the flight team, we have a simulation
supervisor that throws diabolical failures

01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:32.020
out there and we have computer programs and
into the control center we bring the launch

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.670
team, power up the consoles.

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:39.040
And their displays look like the shuttle is
at the pad and it is getting ready to launch

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:47.060
and we throw failures at them to test their
reaction and to find bugs in our safing procedures.

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:50.690
And we've done that over the years.

01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:58.130
I think the next generation of vehicles will
probably have more automation.

01:15:58.130 --> 01:16:04.050
And that will probably be a better thing but
you will never take the console operator out

01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:09.150
of the Control Center either, the Launch Control
Center or the Flight Control Center.

01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:19.060
You need the person there to disposition the
problems, but predictability is what we're

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.830
always after.

01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:27.900
And stable procedures, be they flight or ground,
give predictable results.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:30.810
And that is why we automate.

01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:38.140
And we control change, too.

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.850
Responsibility.

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:45.020
I talked about the engineers.

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:48.710
I didn't mention, I don't think, technicians
and inspectors.

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:58.260
But when a technician stamps a procedure that
I torque that bolt and the inspector stamps

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:02.310
that same procedure and said I saw him torque
that bolt, that is their warranty that that

01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:05.480
event really happened.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.230
And that paper trail and that warranty is
very important.

01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:15.540
When an engineer signs a procedure that tested
the Flight Control System that said I reviewed

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:20.690
all the data, didn't see any glitches, everything
met specifications, that signature is his

01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:26.960
or her warranty that the procedure ran correctly
and that they understood the requirements

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.650
that were implemented by that procedure.

01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:31.540
And the requirements were met.

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:34.000
And that is important.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:44.090
Our whole concept of launch readiness is based
on people being responsible for their system,

01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:50.480
be it the designer that signs it that says
there is nothing going on offline, there are

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.480
no faxes out there that say there is a cloud
over the tires.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:00.670
Or, my last test of the main engines at Stennis,
there was nothing there that says these three

01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:04.960
engines that are on this orbiter shouldn't
work just fine.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:07.180
And they do that in a flight readiness process.

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:10.150
That is their warranty and responsibility.

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:12.950
And we hammer this home.

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:20.330
And it probably comes from, I had this quote
in my office for years and I am going to bore

01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:26.430
you with it, and maybe some of you can guess
where this came from.

01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:27.700
Responsibility is a unique concept.

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:32.440
It can only reside in here in a single individual.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:37.790
You may share it with others, but your portion
is not diminished.

01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:41.710
You may delegate it but it is still with you.

01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:47.630
You may disclaim it but you cannot divest
yourself of it.

01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:54.750
Even if you do not recognize it or admit its
presence, you cannot escape it.

01:18:54.750 --> 01:19:00.920
If responsibility is rightfully yours, no
evasion or ignorance or passing the blame

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:04.220
can shift the burden to someone else.

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.500
And this is what we push home.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:16.380
And, by the way, this quote was Admiral Rickover
who was testifying before Congress after the

01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:20.130
first nuclear submarine accident.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:23.300
And he was saying I am responsible.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:28.860
It is my program, it is my submarine, I am
responsible.

01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:36.150
Even though somebody else was commanding it,
it doesn't matter, I am responsible.

01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:43.090
And we impress that on the managers, the engineers,
the technicians, the inspectors, you know,

01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:44.090
you're important.

01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:45.750
And the work you do is important.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:50.630
And when you sign or stamp that procedure
or give a go on the Net that is your warranty

01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:57.520
that everything is working and you understand
the requirements.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:04.420
Very important in the business that we're
in.

01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:05.420
Decision making.

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:13.030
On the chart.

01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:19.250
This structure has been in place since the
Mercury program.

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:24.000
There is nothing new here.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:31.130
And the only issue comes in when there is
a gray area.

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:37.640
Who makes the call and how much judgment is
involved in the call?

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:42.340
And I gave you the example of weather.

01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:43.350
Everybody has an opinion on it.

01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:44.980
It can be judgmental.

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:52.650
Well, the weather decision is if it is launch
weather related it is the launch director's

01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:54.910
responsibility to determine if it's good enough.

01:20:54.910 --> 01:21:04.770
If the flight director has an issue with the
return to launch site winds, that ultimately

01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:07.920
is his or her decision.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:14.400
The people may get involved in it and they
may have offline discussions with the flight

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:21.860
director, but it is still ultimately his decision.

01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:25.420
And that is the way it has to be because they
are responsible.

01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:34.390
This mission management team is not responsible
for the go, no-go decision on weather on launch

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.390
day.

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:36.910
It's the flight director for the flight stuff.

01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:40.460
It is the launch director for the launch-related
stuff.

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:43.290
And it is set up that way so there is no fuzz
on it.

01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:49.770
Other people can have an opinion, other people
can have input, but unless this person up

01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:56.710
here says launch director we're no go, it
is the launch director's decision in that

01:21:56.710 --> 01:22:01.160
case.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.610
Communication.

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:08.800
Real important.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:13.650
And I will give you an example of that.

01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:16.080
Apollo 13.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:24.310
Most of you probably don't remember Apollo
13, but Apollo 13 was like Challenger and

01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:28.630
the Columbia except we didn't lose the flight
crew.

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:31.060
But it was just as disastrous an event.

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:37.420
And by all rights the crew shouldn't have
made it safety back to earth, but thanks to

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:45.030
the heroics of the flight crew and the flight
team and the timing of when that event occurred

01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:46.640
they were able to get back home.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:55.330
But that was all caused by activity that was
done on the ground well before the launch.

01:22:55.330 --> 01:22:59.620
And, specifically since I was involved in
that, I remember this like it was yesterday.

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:02.420
Of course, part of that is an old age thing.

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:06.330
Stuff that happened 40 years ago comes in
loud and clear.

01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:12.280
Stuff that happened four days ago, I have
a hard time remembering.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:20.239
But we had a tank in the spacecraft that we
ran our simulated launch count.

01:23:20.239 --> 01:23:23.610
And back then we put propellants in the vehicle,
all the hazardous stuff and detanks.

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:26.610
And we couldn't detank the liquid oxygen out
of this tank.

01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:31.070
They had the fuel cells on the spacecraft.

01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:32.750
And just a little more history.

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:38.670
The tank had been dropped when it was installed
back in California, but engineers and managers

01:23:38.670 --> 01:23:42.520
did some tests and some rationale on saying
well, it's still OK to install it.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.520
We got it down the Cape.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.360
We put the liquid oxygen in it and all the
rest of the system.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.330
We couldn't get it out of this tank.

01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:54.440
And after reviewing it they found, well, the
stand pipe in there that is used to drain

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:58.390
it on the ground was probably bent or damaged
and that's why we cannot get it out.

01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:04.520
So the managers and engineers got together
for a few days and said turn the heaters on

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:08.850
in the tank and vent the liquid oxygen off.

01:24:08.850 --> 01:24:14.110
Heat it up and it will boil off as oxygen
gas through another loop that takes it through

01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:16.970
the fuel cells and out vent on the vehicle.

01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:19.310
Use the heaters to go do that.

01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:25.940
So they developed the procedure and we went
on station at night a week after we had the

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:30.210
anomaly and turned everything on and turned
on the heaters.

01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:32.380
And it is fine.

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:35.260
You can see the liquid is turning to gas and
it is coming out.

01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:41.790
And the console operator in our Control Room
said hey, Sieck, I cannot monitor the temperature

01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:42.810
in this tank anymore.

01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:44.750
Well, why is that?

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:49.980
Well, the range on the temperature is from
ambient down to minus 300 degrees because

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:52.560
it's measured in liquid oxygen.

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.810
And it is upper limits.

01:24:53.810 --> 01:25:01.230
It started heating up, and now I cannot tell
you whether it is 50 degrees or 350 degrees.

01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:02.540
I said OK, stop.

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:07.440
So we stopped the test and got all these managers
involved, including the people that built

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.750
the tank and say hey, we've lost visibility.

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:15.360
We're putting energy into this tank that has
liquid oxygen in it.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.170
We cannot monitor the temperature anymore.

01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:19.400
The pressure seems to be fine.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.000
They said don't worry about it.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.790
There is a thermostat in there that is heat
sensitive, and it will open up the power to

01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:29.250
the heaters if it gets to some limit in there.

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.400
Just keep your eye on the pressure.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.820
Make sure the pressure doesn't get too high.

01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:36.510
Well, of course the pressure isn't going to
get too high because the vent is open.

01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:37.640
So we said fine.

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:45.390
We turned the ground power supplies on and
let the thing cook for 10 to 12 hours.

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:51.120
And what we didn't know was that the thermostat
wasn't certified to the voltage we were using

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:56.100
from our ground power supplies because we
didn't tell them, although our requirements

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:59.739
allowed it, that we cranked the power supplies
up to 50 volts.

01:25:59.739 --> 01:26:00.770
And why did we do that?

01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:06.670
Well, the more energy you put into the tank
the higher the heaters get and the quicker

01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:08.210
the liquid oxygen boils off.

01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:10.800
You know, high school physics.

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.460
But we didn't tell them that.

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:17.380
And the people that built the tank and built
that thermostat had only certified it to the

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:20.870
voltage of fuel cell supply which is half
that value.

01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:25.780
So the thermostat welded together, the points
did, and we had continuous power going on

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.860
in there for eight to ten hours.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:31.100
It got to 800, 900 degrees in the tank.

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.580
We burned all the insulation off the wires
to the fans and the heaters.

01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:41.460
And, from that point on, we were just waiting
for something to happen to make those wires

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.000
come together.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.060
And if you didn't turn the power on you're
going to get a spark in an oxygen tank.

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:49.210
Not a good thing.

01:26:49.210 --> 01:26:57.610
Well, that is what happened a day into the
mission when they were heading to the moon.

01:26:57.610 --> 01:27:01.530
And they turned the heaters and the fans on
to stir the cryogenics because they were worried

01:27:01.530 --> 01:27:05.130
about stratification and zero gravity.

01:27:05.130 --> 01:27:09.160
And they got the spark and it blew up the
service module.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:16.630
The point is that communication, we wrote
down in our procedures what we did, but we

01:27:16.630 --> 01:27:20.010
didn't communicate that on a real-time basis.

01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:26.090
And, although we reviewed the procedures afterward,
as the rest of the team did, the designer

01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:33.160
who was 1500 miles away who had approved what
we did over an intercom system didn't review

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.180
our paperwork.

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:40.210
You hit that thing with 50 volts, it's only
certified for 25 volts, even though our requirements

01:27:40.210 --> 01:27:41.790
allowed us to use 50 volts.

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:49.150
It is a case where requirements didn't preclude
us from launching hardware then in hindsight

01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:50.150
was flawed.

01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:54.380
But, on the other hand, communication, we
didn't tell them in real-time.

01:27:54.380 --> 01:28:01.530
And, as a result, Apollo 13 happened.

01:28:01.530 --> 01:28:04.970
So I learned that lesson early on.

01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:11.030
I mean even if you're boring them with what
appears to be minutia, you're going to tell

01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:15.150
them everything and document everything.

01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:20.510
And, thankfully, they went through our procedures
and said well, there it is.

01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:22.260
And I thought we'd get fired.

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:28.090
And actually we got patted on the back for
documenting what we had done so it made it

01:28:28.090 --> 01:28:31.160
easier to zero in on the root cause of the
problem.

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:39.090
And, as a result, we fixed that and we were
able to fly again in a few months as opposed

01:28:39.090 --> 01:28:45.570
to having to go through a Challenger or Columbia
type of activity.

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:49.040
Very important.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:52.290
Launch fever.

01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:53.810
The human factor.

01:28:53.810 --> 01:29:03.040
It is hard to describe what the environment
is in the spacecraft a few minutes before

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.070
launch or in the Control Room.

01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:07.430
But there is a lot of tension and there is
a lot of energy.

01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:13.192
And everybody in there, for the most part,
has been awake for the last 10 to 12 hours.

01:29:13.192 --> 01:29:20.830
And they came to work that day or that night
with all hopes of safely launching the Space

01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:21.830
Shuttle.

01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:27.450
And they really don't want anything to go
wrong with their system or somebody else's

01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:28.450
system.

01:29:28.450 --> 01:29:29.760
I mean that's the mood.

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:34.361
Because, if something goes wrong, you're going
to come back tomorrow or the next day or the

01:29:34.361 --> 01:29:35.590
next week.

01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:41.090
So they really want to hear this everybody,
you know, when they do the polls they go,

01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:43.190
go, go, go.

01:29:43.190 --> 01:29:48.989
And the hardest thing is saying no when everything
sounds like it's go.

01:29:48.989 --> 01:29:57.230
And there are a lot of times when we've had
problems with ground support equipment.

01:29:57.230 --> 01:29:58.230
It is old.

01:29:58.230 --> 01:30:00.280
I wish we had all new stuff for Shuttle.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:03.110
A lot of this stuff is the same we used on
Apollo.

01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:09.450
And, in spite of our efforts to maintain it,
it is all out in the corrosive atmosphere

01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:10.940
at the launch pad.

01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:17.120
And that stuff constantly gave us problems.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.910
And we would lose some of our redundant systems
and some of our primary systems.

01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:27.280
And more than once in launch count, when we'd
have a problem out there, the team would come

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:32.210
to the launch director through that organization
chart you saw and say we've got an idea.

01:30:32.210 --> 01:30:39.220
We think if we patch around this and then
hook this up to this and we throw these switches

01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:46.770
and we get this result that it will be OK
and we can go fly without this power supply

01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:51.470
being active or this purge system operating
normally and all these other things that we've

01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:52.470
got out there.

01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:58.510
And what you have to do as launch director
is say well, just sit back and analyze whether

01:30:58.510 --> 01:31:06.410
or not -- I mean you rely on your engineers
to use their Yankee ingenuity to fix a problem,

01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:12.900
but you have to assess whether or not they're
literally shot-gunning it and coming up with

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:20.050
the proverbial quick fix because they want
to go home in an hour or so and celebrate

01:31:20.050 --> 01:31:21.090
a good launch.

01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:25.300
Just like these guys want to get out of those
uncomfortable suits they have been sitting

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:29.250
in for the last couple hours and either get
out of the spacecraft or get up there in zero

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:30.250
G.

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:35.530
As a launch director, you have to assess well,
OK, but is this really the right thing to

01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:38.290
do or are they working this too hard?

01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:42.520
If you gave them another 24 hours to look
at the data and think about their approach

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:48.500
to a fix would the answer be any different?

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.390
And there have been a few times when they
said well, that sounds pretty good right now

01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:56.930
but I am going to give you another 24 hours
to think about it so we're going to scrub

01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:57.930
for the day.

01:31:57.930 --> 01:32:00.510
And you can hear the big groan in the Control
Room.

01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:05.390
And you can just see it going through their
heads, well, this guy has lost confidence

01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:06.650
in us.

01:32:06.650 --> 01:32:10.810
I mean we all came to work, we get paid to
solve problems and get things done, and he

01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:16.500
is telling us that ain't a good answer, that
ain't a good fix.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:23.620
So you have to balance that when you're in
charge, but the real job of the launch director

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:27.330
is to say no when everybody else wants to
go.

01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:29.580
That is really what you are there for.

01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:32.960
Because these guys get tunnel vision.

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:34.210
They want to go fly.

01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:40.860
The console operators, things are on automatic
in that last nine minutes, and they just hope

01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:43.880
they don't get that little red or yellow light
on their screen that says hey, you better

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.970
go look at this, it isn't working right.

01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:51.690
The last people you want to ask is it OK to
launch is the crew.

01:32:51.690 --> 01:32:54.140
They'll say yes, no matter what is happening.

01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:58.690
And we do ask them, by the way, but it is
a formality because we know what the answer

01:32:58.690 --> 01:32:59.690
is.

01:32:59.690 --> 01:33:01.660
Unless he's got a fire extinguisher up there
putting out something in the spacecraft, he

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:07.450
is going to say we're go.

01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:13.130
And that is also why we put in a rule that
says after five minutes, for these critical

01:33:13.130 --> 01:33:18.520
launch commit criteria items, the 500 that
you absolutely have to look at and certify,

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:22.540
you don't proposition us with a change to
that after five minutes because we're not

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:23.540
going to entertain it.

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:26.710
If they're out of limits we're not going today
or tonight.

01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:31.739
It is going to be at least 24 hours.

01:33:31.739 --> 01:33:32.910
A long time.

01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:38.450
But the team that does it, I mean they are
good, they are professionals.

01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:43.420
And we talk a lot about the Apollo program
and how great things were back then, but I

01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:48.220
just gave you the example of Apollo 13.

01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:55.670
The Shuttle team versus the Apollo team has
a much higher degree of difficulty situation

01:33:55.670 --> 01:33:56.670
to deal with.

01:33:56.670 --> 01:34:03.230
There are fewer people on Shuttle, yet it's
a more complex vehicle than the whole Apollo

01:34:03.230 --> 01:34:04.230
system.

01:34:04.230 --> 01:34:11.450
The Saturn 5 rocket and the spacecraft were
simple compared to the Shuttle system.

01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:18.660
And we had 25,000 people at the Cape in the
Apollo program flying two to three times a

01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:20.450
year.

01:34:20.450 --> 01:34:28.430
And in the Shuttle program back in the early
'90s we flew seven times a year with 6,000

01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:33.390
people with a vehicle that is more complex,
older.

01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:38.090
In the Apollo program our ground equipment
was new and all the flight hardware was new.

01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:39.090
It wasn't reused.

01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:43.860
It was fresh out of the box factory pristine
stuff.

01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:49.380
And requirements were easy, you know, it had
to act and look brand-new or you replaced

01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:50.880
it.

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.800
The Shuttle, because it is 20, 30 years old,
depending on which orbiter and the ground

01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:03.340
equipment which is 30 to 40 years old, there
are requirements that allow fair wear and

01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:04.989
tear.

01:35:04.989 --> 01:35:09.650
The engineers are constantly pushed with is
this good enough?

01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:15.080
These wire bundles are frayed and there are
dings in this line and that weld is looking

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:17.310
like it has corrosion on it, is it good enough?

01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:21.000
Well, they are constantly propositioning where
back in the Apollo program you didn't have

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.510
to mess with that gray area stuff.

01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:28.650
It either looked or acted brand-new or you
replaced it.

01:35:28.650 --> 01:35:32.810
And replacing it was easy because money was
unlimited.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:39.930
As a journeyman engineer on Apollo I was told
whatever you need you can have.

01:35:39.930 --> 01:35:45.580
System engineers seek more test equipment,
you need more technicians to be trained on

01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:48.460
this over here, whatever you need just ask
for it.

01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:49.460
Money is not an object.

01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:55.020
As a manager on the Shuttle program when I
finally got promoted out of the job I liked

01:35:55.020 --> 01:36:00.160
to launch director, I had to tell the journeymen
engineers this is all the money you get for

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.920
next year.

01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:06.180
And be real efficient with this and frugal
because next year you're probably going to

01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:08.760
get less.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:15.800
And your strategy and approach to issues is
much different if you have those two different

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:18.110
environments to deal with.

01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:23.969
And finally the other thing that Shuttle deals
with today versus Apollo is the acceptance

01:36:23.969 --> 01:36:24.969
of risk.

01:36:24.969 --> 01:36:27.219
I mean I already mentioned Apollo 13.

01:36:27.219 --> 01:36:32.020
Back then if you made a mistake you were patted
on the back and told hey, nice try.

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:38.140
Now, is there anything that can be done to
better enhance your probability of success?

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:44.469
Whereas, in the Shuttle program, risk aversion
in this country, I don't want to get started

01:36:44.469 --> 01:36:47.040
on that tangent, is becoming more and more
a lifestyle.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:53.920
We don't want to do things we might lose or
we might not win or we may not be successful.

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.610
And risk, you know, there is less tolerance
to it.

01:36:56.610 --> 01:37:02.760
And, when you have a problem like Columbia
or Challenger, you get half a dozen boarding

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:07.719
parties coming into NASA saying here is what
you need to do differently or this is wrong

01:37:07.719 --> 01:37:11.590
with your agency and this and this and you
need to go fix that.

01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:19.700
And, again, back in Apollo, it was what do
you need to be successful?

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:20.700
Much different.

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:23.210
And it makes it difficult to operate.

01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:30.290
Bob, could you comment upon risk aversion
and the launch director and whether there

01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:36.340
were more aggressive and more conservative
people who have had your job?

01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:45.720
Well, I would say, before I was launch director,
there was one.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:49.540
And he was more aggressive than I was.

01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:52.040
He was the console MANOPS person.

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:57.740
And he would push, and he would push until
you would say uncle, I surrender or whatever,

01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:01.760
and then he would make a judgment call.

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:07.370
I was more conservative than that.

01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:12.950
I trained the one immediately after me.

01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:19.200
And he was pretty much the same but he got
the highly visible job, management say that

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:25.489
this guy was good, we'll take him away from
here and go put him over here managing this

01:38:25.489 --> 01:38:27.940
large organization and worrying about budgets
and contracts.

01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:30.880
That is the same thing that happened to me.

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:40.130
And that's unfortunate, but NASA's strongest
suit is not succession planning, unfortunately.

01:38:40.130 --> 01:38:41.130
It just isn't.

01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:42.130
Yes?

01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:49.100
Are you saying the Shuttle program is too
risk averse?

01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.780
Because you also said that, for example, it
is your job as launch director to be conservative

01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:57.050
and to say no when everyone else is saying
yes.

01:38:57.050 --> 01:39:00.360
No, I wouldn't say that the Shuttle program
is risk adverse.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:04.400
I would say our society is risk adverse.

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:13.690
And you see some of that permeating into the
Shuttle program, but not to the point where

01:39:13.690 --> 01:39:16.070
I would say it is detrimental.

01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:25.070
I mean asking questions, digging in to understand
what your risks are is an important thing

01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:26.070
to do.

01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:27.660
And early in the Shuttle program we didn't
do that.

01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:31.239
We had a lot of confidence in hardware after
the first few missions.

01:39:31.239 --> 01:39:32.500
It's just like a new car.

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:37.650
You put 5000 miles on it, you get the bugs
out of it and you fully expect it to last

01:39:37.650 --> 01:39:40.530
another so many hundred thousand miles.

01:39:40.530 --> 01:39:43.750
Well, that was the same expectation in the
Shuttle program.

01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:50.460
You fly a few flights and you learn that the
tiles really stayed glued to the Orbiter and

01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:55.970
the thermal control system really responds
as it should on orbit and managing the temperature

01:39:55.970 --> 01:39:57.650
and the coolant leaks and that sort of thing.

01:39:57.650 --> 01:40:03.020
And you build up confidence and you say it
should work now.

01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:06.930
We got the bugs out of it and we can go fly
this thing as often as those guys at the Cape

01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:09.820
can turn it around.

01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:15.130
But what they didn't consider and what all
these engineers, with all due respect that

01:40:15.130 --> 01:40:20.930
you heard from that certify their systems,
they didn't totally capture the environment

01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:26.910
that the Shuttle sees over the long period
of time in their initial certification.

01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:28.250
They didn't capture it.

01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:33.780
And that environment includes not only what
happens in space or the calendar exposure

01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:38.050
to just time on some of these systems that
have soft goods in them, for instance, O rings

01:40:38.050 --> 01:40:43.160
and that sort of thing, but it is the environment
of the Cape with people constantly removing

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:47.780
hardware, disconnecting things, moving wire
bundles out of the way to get access to this

01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:53.640
or that other component to implement the requirements
that were levied on the Cape to do the tests

01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:55.090
and inspections.

01:40:55.090 --> 01:41:00.150
And they are very invasive, and collateral
damage is a way of life when you're crawling

01:41:00.150 --> 01:41:04.410
around in the Orbiter.

01:41:04.410 --> 01:41:11.140
To put in policy that tries to compensate
for the fact that the certification didn't

01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:18.460
capture that environment that this hardware
has seen for the last 20 to 30 years, to reduce

01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:24.470
the unknowns involved in that, that is the
right thing to do.

01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:30.580
You're trying to reduce the risk of reflying
a very complex vehicle.

01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:35.280
So that is fine, but you take that to a limit.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:41.239
I mean you can talk yourself into never flying
which would be pretty easy to go do.

01:41:41.239 --> 01:41:49.660
And then this recovery after the Columbia
accident, that was starting to happen.

01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:59.050
The managers, because they had this investigation
board report that says NASA, you've become

01:41:59.050 --> 01:42:00.050
complacent and overconfident.

01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:05.210
And, by the way, in my opinion that is somewhat
of a bum rap to say that NASA in general,

01:42:05.210 --> 01:42:08.489
and particularly the Shuttle program, had
fallen into that mode.

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:13.320
But, to have the pendulum swing the other
way to understand what your risks are and

01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:19.920
then you can have knowledge on whether you
decide to accept it or not, that is a good

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:20.920
thing.

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:25.820
What didn't happen after Columbia, but we
did do after Challenger, is after we understood

01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:29.710
the root cause of the accident and some of
the other factors like communication that

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:36.270
we're part of that, reviewed all the systems
and all the requirements, the managers said

01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:38.890
look, we're willing to accept some risk.

01:42:38.890 --> 01:42:45.130
You people who are responsible for these systems
and these processes at the Cape, you need

01:42:45.130 --> 01:42:48.550
to quantify that for us and bring it to us.

01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:53.440
And we will either say OK, we won't accept
that, you go back and change your system or

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:57.550
change your limits or do more tests or whatever,
or we will accept it.

01:42:57.550 --> 01:43:01.770
We will say we'll accept that risk, management
will accept some risk.

01:43:01.770 --> 01:43:09.680
That happened after Challenger, and we were
able to fly again roughly two years later

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:13.070
after we recertified the design to the solid
rocket motors.

01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:16.880
That didn't happen after Columbia.

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:23.570
And you can speculate whether or not we could
have flown six months ago or a year ago or

01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:26.739
we should have waited longer to fly because
we still had a piece of foam come off the

01:43:26.739 --> 01:43:28.530
tank.

01:43:28.530 --> 01:43:29.739
You could debate that.

01:43:29.739 --> 01:43:37.300
But management never acknowledged that they
were willing to accept some risk after Columbia.

01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:43.820
They did say tell us what the risk is but
we really want you to crank it down to zero.

01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:48.739
We don't want to take any risk, unlike Challenger.

01:43:48.739 --> 01:43:53.410
Now, is that bad?

01:43:53.410 --> 01:44:01.800
See, what really happened with Columbia was
the mission management team's discipline had

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:02.800
eroded.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:03.930
There were communication issues.

01:44:03.930 --> 01:44:13.250
And, if you're a student of that investigation,
they didn't grade out very well.

01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:19.780
But the investigation said there is complacency
and overconfidence in the system.

01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:26.090
Well, having been part of the system prior
to my retirement five years ago, you never

01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:31.590
found any complacency or overconfidence with
the engineers, technicians, inspectors or

01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:32.730
the managers that I knew.

01:44:32.730 --> 01:44:38.820
Now, they weren't as smart as they thought
they were or, in some cases, as smart as they

01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:40.740
needed to be.

01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:44.520
But that is not the same as complacency or
overconfidence.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:50.200
Because the latter to me implies an attitude
problem that I've got it, I know it all, I

01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:52.850
am smart as I need to be.

01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:57.420
And, for the most part, you know, there were
some people I didn't like because I thought

01:44:57.420 --> 01:45:02.520
he or she was arrogant or something like that,
but I never sensed an attitude problem with

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:03.590
the Shuttle team.

01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:10.090
From the technicians, many of which I knew
and grew up with, to the top managers in the

01:45:10.090 --> 01:45:13.050
Shuttle program, I never sensed that.

01:45:13.050 --> 01:45:17.640
But were we not as smart as we thought we
were or as smart as we needed to be?

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:24.600
Were there signs that there was something
going on here that you ought to go fix?

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.510
Yes.

01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:35.760
But, again, they didn't just blow off, so
to speak, these problems we were having with

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:42.760
foam on the tank and these other systems which,
to me, would have been complacency or overconfidence.

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:45.340
Anything else?

01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:50.740
We're just about out of time.

01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:55.520
I've got two announcements.

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.630
I've been working with the Stellar people.

01:45:57.630 --> 01:46:03.410
As you know, some of the pdf files that I've
tried to load didn't load.

01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:08.640
They cannot really figure out why, but I have
sent them the files, they've loaded most of

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:11.930
them on so hopefully almost everything is
there.

01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:18.430
We're continuing to work at it, but hopefully
all the things that you need access to you

01:46:18.430 --> 01:46:20.910
can find.

01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:26.210
I said there were two things, but that's the
only one I remember.

01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:30.410
Well, let me close with one note then.

01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:32.550
I am glad you're here.

01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:40.610
Thanks for your choice to pursue an engineering
career.

01:46:40.610 --> 01:46:46.730
Doing things that are hard, I have found that
in my travels that unfortunately there are

01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:53.140
fewer people deciding to pursue the tough
curriculums and the occupations that require

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:58.570
a lot of work and have some risk associated
with them.

01:46:58.570 --> 01:47:07.330
But it is encouraging to see people in graduate
school that want to do what I did.

01:47:07.330 --> 01:47:10.580
I am not sure how much engineering I did in
my 40 year career.

01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:17.850
I did a lot of managing and a lot of other
assignments, but I am sure you can accomplish

01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:18.850
a lot.

01:47:18.850 --> 01:47:26.850
I had a grandmother who was born at the end
of the 19th century.

01:47:26.850 --> 01:47:36.930
And, when she was your age, there weren't
any computers, airplanes, cars, TV and that

01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:37.930
sort of thing.

01:47:37.930 --> 01:47:44.960
Yet, in her lifetime, she got to see her favorite
grandson, Bobby, help put a man on the moon.

01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:52.650
And I don't know what can be done in your
lifetime, but you can make great things happen

01:47:52.650 --> 01:47:54.489
with the career you have chosen.

01:47:54.489 --> 01:47:57.250
So thanks for choosing, really.

01:47:57.250 --> 01:48:00.050
Bob, thanks very much.

01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:01.450
A pleasure.

01:48:01.450 --> 01:48:02.140
