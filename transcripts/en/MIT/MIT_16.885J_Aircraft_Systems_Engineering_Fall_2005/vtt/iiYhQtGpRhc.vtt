00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.599
HOFFMAN: Welcome everyone to 16.885.

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.099
And I guess this is ESD.35 as well.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.099
I think.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.210
I cannot keep track of the number.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.699
Formally the title is Aircraft Systems Engineering.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.939
I never thought I would actually be teaching
a course with aircraft in the title of it

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.550
since I am not an airplane person, I am a
space person.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:39.729
But, as you all know, we have decided to devote
the course this year to a study of the Space

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.699
Shuttle.

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.080
Very briefly, what the course has been historically,
it was taught for quite a few years by Professors

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.479
Murman and Hansman in the Aero-Astro Department.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:01.299
It is a course in systems engineering devoted
to aircraft systems.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:09.390
And what they typically would do would be
to have a series of lectures about principles

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.950
of systems engineering, and also about various
systems - general systems in aviation.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.840
And then, as a class assignment, the students
would work in teams and choose an aircraft

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.120
and do a systems analysis study of that aircraft.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.820
Well, a couple of years ago we were just sort
of sitting down and chatting.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.460
And someone brought up the idea that well,
you know, the Space Shuttle kind of is like

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.460
an airplane.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:54.390
Maybe it would be interesting to devote the
course one year to a special study of the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.950
Space Shuttle.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.380
And that was actually the origin of what we
are doing this year.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.630
Following that, Professor Aaron Cohen, who
is sitting over here, and I will introduce

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:15.030
him in more detail in a minute, visited MIT,
I think it was early last year, and gave a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.519
few lectures on systems engineering and the
development of the Space Shuttle.

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.020
And we started talking about putting together
a course on the shuttle.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.060
And we were very fortunate now that this fall
Professor Cohen is here as a visiting professor.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.810
And he will be here at MIT roughly about half
the time.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.050
And he and I have put this course together.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:49.099
And the way we are going to organize it is
that we're going to emphasize two main areas.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:57.230
First of all, to get to an understanding of
the Space Shuttle as a flying machine, as

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:06.919
a spacecraft, and also to study systems engineering
as an engineering discipline.

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.989
We have put together a list of speakers, and
I am going to pass out here copies of the

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.059
syllabus.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.239
If you will pass these around.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:26.849
I have also established a stellar class website
and, once you are all enrolled in the course,

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.349
you will all have access to the website.

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:38.739
If any of you are here as listeners or for
some other reason don't get formally registered

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:45.079
to get course access, contact me independently
and we can set you up for a special access

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.040
so that you can look on the website.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.379
If you look through here you will see that
most of the class periods are devoted to guest

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.090
lecturers.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.949
And, thanks in large part to Professor Cohen,
we have actually been able to invite people

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:10.880
who played pivotal roles in the very early
stages of the design of the Space Shuttle.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.230
And also people who played pivotal roles in
the testing and eventual operation of the

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.230
shuttle.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:24.139
So we have people who are active in the design
and also some people who were critical in

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.060
Mission Control and in the test flights of
the shuttle.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.190
It is, I think, a really unique collection
of speakers.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.650
And because I don't think there has ever been
a time where this sort of a collection of

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.720
people has actually come together to share
their experiences on the shuttle.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.710
And because we thought that it would have
historical significance, and people would

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.080
be interested in being able to look at that
in the future, we are having the lecture series

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.960
taped for eventual inclusion on MIT's OpenCourseWare.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.220
So that is why you see the television camera
in the back.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.050
No need for all of you to dress up for it,
but just so that you know.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.370
The way we plan to run the course is as follows.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:24.050
The lectures will run roughly about an hour,
we will take a little break at the end of

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:31.419
an hour, and then there will be an opportunity
basically for close interaction between you

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.689
in the class and the lecturer.

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.820
It is kind of free form because we have lots
of different lectures.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:45.810
Of course, there will be some variability
in the way lecturers go about presenting the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.879
material.

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:55.720
Professor Cohen and I will attempt to make
sure that, in each case, we do emphasize some

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.759
of the basic systems engineering aspects of
the presentation.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:06.849
We want you to understand the principles of
how some of the different subsystems were

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:16.939
designed, basically how they were influenced
by external requirements to make sure that

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:24.849
we understand what the requirements were,
how the systems were constructed and tested,

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.689
and how they were operated.

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:34.979
What we will be asking from you in terms of
your deliverables, first of all, we would

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.180
like you to take notes on the lectures.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.580
We will post the lecture notes on the website.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.259
If you look through the schedule that I have
given you here, you will see that I list the

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:59.460
deliverables, and I am going to have to adjust
the timing on that.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.749
Two times in the course we will ask to see
the lecture journals.

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:13.220
What we are looking for is to make sure that
we are presenting and that you are getting

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.020
out of this the basic systems engineering
principles for each of the subsystems that

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.020
are presented.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.919
And we will talk a little bit about journal
notes in the future.

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:33.689
The main deliverable from you will be a little
bit different from in the normal Aircraft

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:39.389
Systems Engineering course where groups of
students basically chose and airplane and

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:42.270
then looked at the design of that particular
airplane.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.580
We are only dealing with one vehicle, the
shuttle, so what we will be asking you to

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.499
do is choose one of the subsystems on the
shuttle.

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:57.569
And, as you look through the notes, you see
we will have information presented on a lot

00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:00.759
of the different subsystems.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:10.219
I have a lot of material available, and I
will go over that a little bit later, both

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:16.169
in digital form and in books which we will
have on reserve at the library which go into

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:18.621
great detail on all the different subsystems.

00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:25.180
So we have lots of information, as well as
experts that you can talk with.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:32.830
We will ask you to form up into teams, roughly
four people on a team, more or less.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.080
Choose a subsystem.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:43.080
And then, basically, write a paper on how
you would design that subsystem, if you were

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.440
doing it today, using 21st century technology.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.540
It gives you an opportunity to understand
the subsystem, as it was designed for the

00:08:52.540 --> 00:09:01.250
shuttle, and then to take a look at current
technology in that subsystem.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:09.230
I know there are some people here from Engineering
Systems, as well as from Aero-Astro.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.670
People may have some other ideas.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:19.190
If you have some ideas about writing about
systems from a systems engineering and integration

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:25.840
point of view or any other particular personal
ideas of what you would like to do as a project

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:32.101
which is slightly different from specifically
working with a subsystem, come see me and

00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:33.690
we will talk about it.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:39.770
The main thing is to make sure that you have
a chance to explore some aspect of the systems

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.030
engineering of the shuttle in greater depth.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.500
That is all I am going to say right now.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.500
Go to the website.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:56.900
I will be posting more information because
I want to give as much time as possible to

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.180
our two speakers.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.200
I, by the way, will be posting bios of all
the speakers on the website so you will be

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:12.650
able to look ahead of time and get an idea
of who it is who will be speaking to us and

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.961
what their roles were in the development or
testing or operation of the shuttle.

00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:28.810
So I would like to present now Professor Aaron
Cohen who was born in Texas and has had a

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:33.140
very distinguished career at NASA.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:42.810
Just very briefly, he was the project manager,
I guess first in Apollo, he was the Command

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.400
and Service Module Project Manager.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:53.480
And then he was the Project Manager for the
Space Shuttle and eventually became the Center

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.600
Director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:03.850
When he retired in the early `90s he took
a teaching position at Texas A&amp;M in the Mechanical

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.470
Engineering Department where he is now Professor
Emeritus.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:12.330
And we are extremely fortunate to have him
here co-teaching the course with me.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.060
So, Aaron, I will turn it over.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.371
COHEN: Thank you very much.

00:11:18.371 --> 00:11:20.820
And it is a pleasure to be here with you.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.654
I have a few things I would like to talk to
you about very briefly and then I will turn

00:11:24.654 --> 00:11:27.210
it over to our guest speaker today.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.810
I would like to let you know what you can
expect for the next several lectures.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:38.390
I am going to provide you with the overall
shuttle, how the shuttle works, the requirements

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:43.590
of the shuttle, the design and the development
of the subsystems to a certain extent to give

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.430
you an overall view of the shuttle so you
will have a background of information when

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:57.100
you later start to hear the detailed lectures
of the subsystems in some degree.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.000
As you listen to these various technical lectures,
you should be prepared to figure out what

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.850
system you are really interested in and what
system you would like to move forward with

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.350
in your future talks.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.350
And so you will see that.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.200
So that is what I will do in the next two
lectures, Tuesday and Thursday.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:20.740
In trying to figure out how we start the course,
I went back in my memory to figure out a man

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.520
who was there at the very beginning in Washington.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.520
And this man, Mr.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:30.790
Dale Myers, who is going to talk today, is
what you might say is a true aerospace engineer.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:37.690
He had a very distinguished career in both
industry and government, in aircraft and space.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.330
Dale, or Mr.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:47.070
Myers, who was Deputy Administrator at NASA
from October 1986 to 1989, and that was when

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.500
President Regan called Dale Myers back to
be Deputy Administrator after the Challenger

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.370
accident.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.370
Mr.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.840
Myers was Corporate Vice President of Rockwell
International, President of the North American

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.880
Aircraft Group, where he was responsible for
the B1 and various military and commercial

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.880
aircraft.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:17.730
In 1970 he has been an Associate with Rockwell
International and Vice President and Manager

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.720
for the Apollo Command and Service Module.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.810
So he was Apollo and Shuttle.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.200
The key thing that Mr.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:32.430
Myers is going to talk to you about today,
he was the NASA Associate Administrator for

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:39.050
Manned Space Flight in 1970 when the Space
Shuttle began.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.050
And Mr.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:45.740
Myers is going to talk to you about the beginning
of the Space Shuttle and how the external

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:53.460
environment helped create or generate requirements
that really forced, you might say, the configuration

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.460
of the shuttle.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.140
And I think it is very important for you to
understand that, because many times, when

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.480
you get out and start to work, go to work,
the requirements become generated by external

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.630
environments.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:10.270
So, without further ado, let me turn the speaker
over to Dale Myers to give you his lecture.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:37.130
MYERS: Well, thanks for the opportunity to
talk to you guys about a very interesting

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:42.530
historical element.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:46.010
I was asked to talk about the origin of the
shuttle.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.920
And I was there in 1970.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:15:23.120
And I think once we get this thing working
where I can run the slides -- The joy of electronics.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:36.030
When I first went to work for North American
Aviation we used Marchant Calculators where

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:42.260
you put in your numbers and pull a lever and
actually move it to the next position.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.830
And we did a lot of dynamic analysis.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:54.181
And it took weeks to do a total dynamic flight
analysis of an aircraft with a Marchant calculator.

00:15:54.181 --> 00:15:59.010
Now we have the wonders of the computer.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:15.630
The first airplane I worked on was a P51 Mustang,
a fighter in World War II, and that had some

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.060
interesting system engineering issues in it,
too.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:28.350
They used the inlet, it had a liquid cooled
engine, and we had a radiator that was in

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.820
a duct.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:39.050
And the air came through the radiator, cooled
the liquid and heated up the air that was

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:45.280
then properly adjusted with a flap at the
back of the radiator that gave it thrust out

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.280
of the heat that was involved coming through
the radiator.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:59.240
That is the reason why the Mustang is about
15 miles an hour faster than the German's

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:07.600
ME 109.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:23.810
That is one of the prettiest pictures I have
ever seen of the shuttle.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:31.450
That is a picture of the additional photography
that they brought into the system after the

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.740
Columbia accident, and this was used on this
last flight.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:40.610
The first time I had ever seen the rearview
of all the connections for the transfer of

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:50.100
fuel from the tank into the shuttle, the connections
to the tank, the forward bipod where the foam

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:58.320
was that came off on the Columbia accident,
just a terrific picture of all the tiles up

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.920
under the wing that Aaron was so involved
with.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:09.680
But what I want to talk about, oh, here is
another one that is really a first for me.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:22.630
This is the mach 1 shock on the shuttle about
20,000 feet altitude, mach 1.1.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:29.910
That big envelope of condensation, not as
pretty as it looks on an F-18 or some really

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:37.630
slick airplane, but it is there.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.351
I am going to talk about what happened leading
up to the shuttle.

00:18:41.351 --> 00:18:46.210
And it is interesting because it involves
the specific interests and personalities of

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.520
the people who were involved.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:19:01.340
Jim Webb was the administrator of NASA from
1961 to 1968, and he was a terrific interactor

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.180
with the rest of the administration and with
the President directly.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:14.270
And did a great job of administrating NASA
through the Apollo program up through 1968.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:18.930
It turned out in 1968 things were kind of
going sour for President Johnson.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:31.320
Webb's big tie was with President Johnson,
and he ended up leaving in 1968 after he suggested

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.540
to President Johnson that he might want to
leave some time soon.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.320
I think he was thinking he was going to stay
through the Lunar landing, but Johnson said

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:46.560
why don't you leave now? And I don't really
understand the interaction that was involved

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.560
there, but Webb did not want to make future
plans.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.000
He really never paid much attention to the
work that was being done inside the system

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.990
on new ideas, new things beyond Apollo.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:02.400
Of course, the Apollo was an immense program,
400,000 people.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:09.780
Well, 300,000 on the Apollo, another 100,000
on other activities in NASA like the aeronautics

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.270
program and the science programs.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:17.550
But Webb didn't want to talk about things
that were going to happen beyond that time

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.550
period.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.020
In the meantime, in the back rooms a lot of
people were doing a lot of thinking about

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:28.870
where does NASA go after the Apollo program?
Apollo at that time, that Webb was there,

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:34.260
had planned to go through Apollo 20, I think.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.550
And so it was going to go on until 1973 or
so.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:43.930
And so I think Webb took the attitude that
we don't need to think about the future yet.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:51.920
Well, when he left in 1968, they brought in
a fellow named Tom Paine who had been at General

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:59.840
Electric Company doing advanced planning for
General Electric, a very bright, very aggressively

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.230
forward-thinking guy.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:05.630
A guy that I always felt never saw a future
plan he didn't like.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:12.312
And NASA was doing a fantastic amount of future
planning at that time because in the 1968

00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:22.530
time period, we had just done the Apollo 7,
gotten it back into flight again.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:29.230
At the end of '68 we did the Apollo 8 which
went around the moon, and NASA could do no

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.230
wrong at that time.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.940
They were just on a step.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:42.690
And with Tom coming in, in early '69, all
the work that was being done by NASA at that

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:52.100
time, the idea was that the NASA programs
were going to continue to grow and that you

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.520
could really begin to do some expansive thinking
about going out into space.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:07.110
There had been work going on since 1964 on
lifting bodies and on different configurations

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:13.580
that people imagined could be used for traveling
in space and returning to the ground in a

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:19.809
more sophisticated manner than coming down
on parachutes in the water.

00:22:19.809 --> 00:22:25.000
Water landings were extremely expensive, having
the whole Navy out there to support them,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.610
and so people were beginning to think about
land landing.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:39.010
And by 1969, enough pressure came on the administration
that Nixon appointed his Vice President, Spiro

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:46.110
Agnew, to run a program reviewing the future
of NASA.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.050
And he got a really good group of people together.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:55.720
He got Bob Seamans, I am sure you all know.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:03.530
Tom Paine, the Administrator of NASA, Lee
DuBridge had been head of Caltech and was

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:07.100
the Science Advisor to the President.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:15.350
They had a guy that was the head of the Atomic
Energy Commission and the Head of the Bureau

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.350
of the Budget.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:21.690
They did about a six month study supported
by NASA.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:32.760
And NASA's dreams were that there should be
a space transportation system that would include

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.690
the moon and finally Mars.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:42.370
And it started with a 30 foot diameter, 12
man space station, two of them in earth orbit,

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:47.860
possibly reaching 100 people in earth orbit.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.560
Another space station the same size around
the moon with 12 men.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:59.190
A lunar base.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:08.730
A nuclear stage to transfer resources from
earth orbit space stations to the lunar orbit

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:13.460
space station.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:19.230
A two-stage fully recoverable shuttle with
100 to 150 flights a year because of this

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.200
massive program that was being developed.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.950
A SkyLab with five visits by the Command Module.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.050
This, by the way, was a second SkyLab.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:34.679
SkyLab was in our program, and a second SkyLab
was under construction at that time in this

00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:35.679
time period.

00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:41.610
And, of course, to do all this, we would continue
the Saturn 1b and the Saturn V production.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:47.270
Those were the big rockets involved in the
Apollo program.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:54.210
And space tug to go to higher than low earth
orbit - to geosynchronous.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.880
And, as I mentioned, the nuclear stage.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.480
And a mars program by 1983.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:07.059
That was all presented to this group, and
they ended up setting up three different programs.

00:25:07.059 --> 00:25:11.850
One was this massive all-inclusive program.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:23.340
A second one was a program where the Space
Shuttle would be built and the plans to go

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.390
to Mars.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:30.059
I never found the report so I don't know exactly
how to describe that.

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:36.600
But, to go to mars, the NASA program said
you have to have a space station to first

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:42.790
develop medical information about man's long
duration in space, in other words, how long

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:52.340
a guy could last in space to go out to mars,
and it became a fuel transfer operation, where

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:58.910
low earth orbit rendezvous and docking and
transfer of fuel would be made for a device

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.770
to go onto mars.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:12.380
So, that second case, the one of build the
shuttle and go to mars was the one that Agnew

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.320
and Paine recommended.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.690
Paine, in his mind, said there has got to
be a space station with that.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:27.200
And so he left in place the studies that NASA
had out with industry on building a space

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.980
station.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:35.950
And NASA then started a program on a fully
recoverable two-stage shuttle.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.800
There have been a lot of studies on how to
do that, and we are going to get into some

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:49.730
of the system dynamics that we were involved
in that program as we go along here.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:51.590
Meanwhile, the budget crashed.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:57.020
NASA had a budget of about $6 billion in 1968.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:02.080
And, by 1970, it was down to about $3.7 billion.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:07.540
Actually, at the same time, the Manned Space
Flight budget had gone from about $3 billion

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.200
down to $1.7 billion.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.380
So it got hit even harder than the rest of
NASA during this time period.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:20.240
And the reasons, well, we were in the middle
of the Vietnam War, the budget deficit was

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:26.560
going up dramatically, President Johnson who
started The Great Society program for the

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.809
poor in the country, and that was a big load
on the budget.

00:27:30.809 --> 00:27:37.410
And Nixon just wasn't a big supporter of the
space program, and so the budget was going

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:44.390
down.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:48.830
The question was is there going to be a human
space flight program at all? And that was

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:57.540
a really big question because in a time period
about a year after this period, one of the

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.750
senators put a bill before the senate to cancel
the shuttle.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:06.600
The Shuttle Phase B program was underway by
that time.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.270
We did studies.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.840
Phase A, a small amount of money to industry.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:16.360
Phase B was enough to get a definition to
where you could decide that you were ready

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.080
to go into detailed design.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:26.130
And Phase CD was actually the design and development
and testing.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.850
So we were into Phase B on the shuttle at
that time.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:38.900
He brought forward to the senate let's cancel
the shuttle, and the vote was 50/50.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.510
So the Vice President had to go in and vote
to keep the Shuttle program going.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.670
That is how close to cancellation it was.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:53.820
Now, a really important guy in all this was
a guy named George Miller.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.120
He had been head of the Manned Space Flight
program.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:04.760
He had been the stimulus within NASA for this
broad systems study of going out to lunar

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.380
bases and then to Mars.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:13.070
And he left in late 1969.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.080
He had done his job.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:22.080
He got man to the moon and home safely, and
he saw this cut in budgets going on.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:27.120
I don't know whether that really influenced
him to leave, but I think his general pattern

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:33.170
had been that whatever he wanted to do, he
wanted to complete it successfully and then

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:34.170
he would move on.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:40.970
And he did that with the Apollo program so
he moved on.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:49.910
George was a guy that really supported this
tremendous set of future dreams for NASA.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.370
Tom Paine left in late 1970.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.870
And the reason he left was he kept pushing
for a space station.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:06.990
And the people in the administration had kind
of seen the studies that had been done by

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:15.530
this Space Task Group, where Agnew had said
let's do the Shuttle and then let's go to

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.530
Mars.

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:21.410
Paine, knowing in his few that you had to
have a space station to be able to go to Mars,

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:29.351
kept pushing the 12 man space station that
would require a Saturn V for a launch so it

00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:30.770
was a big expense.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:36.220
And it was a program that really called for
NASA's budget to go up instead of down.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:43.190
He accepted the idea that it had been pushed
down to the $3.7 billion level, but he expected

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.860
it to be $6 billion or $8 billion by 1974.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:53.309
And nobody in the administration was buying
that so he left in 1970.

00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:55.580
And I think he was sort of asked to leave.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:00.540
I don't know that for a fact, but all the
evidence would seem to be that he wasn't really

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.190
making it with the administration.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:09.840
And I think this, by the way, turns out to
be kind of an important part here because

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:17.530
when Tom Paine left there was kind of a bad
taste in the administration about NASA being

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:24.140
too aggressive and wanting more and more big
programs.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.610
Paine left in 1970.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:30.929
George Low became the acting administrator,
and he became a very important part of the

00:31:30.929 --> 00:31:33.429
shuttle system background.

00:31:33.429 --> 00:31:37.500
His background, by the way, started way early
in NASA.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:44.549
And he had been the program manager for the
Command and Service Module for a period of

00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:47.340
time before he went up to NASA headquarters.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:51.970
And I guess, Aaron, you became the program
manager after George left.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:32:00.711
And 
so I came in, in January of 1970.

00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:05.140
I had been in charge of the Command and Service
Module at Rockwell.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.680
And George Low asked me to come back.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:15.070
And I had worked so closely with George that
I felt kind of a commitment to help in that

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.070
area.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:27.929
So I went back in 1970, Jim Fletcher came
in, in April of 1971, and we saw where we

00:32:27.929 --> 00:32:32.940
stood as far as the budget was concerned.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:42.690
So 1970, with this new cast of characters,
we kind of accepted the idea that we were

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:46.980
in trouble to the place where we could lose
Manned Space Flight completely.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:57.860
And our real strategy had to be to get something
that would be important to the future of NASA

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.929
with respect to the programs.

00:32:59.929 --> 00:33:07.090
And our view was the most important part of
the game was to build a shuttle that would

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:11.030
reduce the cost of getting into orbit.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:16.480
And that was the whole idea of the shuttle.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.780
There was a general consensus that if you
had a shuttle that would be recoverable and

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:26.850
reusable it would reduce the cost of the operations.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:32.210
As they used to say in those days, I think
I have it on another chart, you wouldn't think

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:37.530
of flying from San Diego to Boston on an airplane
and then throwing away the airplane.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:44.820
Which was, of course, what we were doing with
the Ballistic systems.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:50.380
But we thought if we could get a low-cost
transportation system to a low earth orbit

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:56.730
the rest of the systems would then follow
naturally.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.650
But, because of the budget picture and because
of where we stood with the shuttle in Phase

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:07.559
B recognizing it was going to be an expensive
program, things started to fall out of the

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:08.559
program.

00:34:08.559 --> 00:34:10.679
They cancelled the Apollo 18 and 19.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.329
I guess 20 had already been cancelled.

00:34:12.329 --> 00:34:20.039
And they cancelled Saturn 1b and the Saturn
V which were our big heavy lift capabilities.

00:34:20.039 --> 00:34:23.869
Cancelled the second SkyLab that was already
essentially complete.

00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:28.929
That is the one that is in the Smithsonian
Museum in Washington.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:31.359
Cancelled the Command and Service Modules.

00:34:31.359 --> 00:34:33.970
Cancelled the 30 foot diameter space stations.

00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:41.389
And that was a big hit against the group because
we were in phase B there getting ready to

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:45.529
go into detailed design on a 30 foot diameter
space station.

00:34:45.529 --> 00:34:49.870
We didn't start the space tug, we didn't start
the nuclear stage and we cancelled the Mars

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:50.870
program.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:55.159
No, excuse me, we deferred the Mars program.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:35:02.049
Industry went down from 400,000 people working
for all the NASA programs down to about 150,000.

00:35:02.049 --> 00:35:07.359
I have seen numbers lower than that.

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:14.839
Now, concept for the shuttle, reusability
equals low-cost.

00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:16.849
That was fundamental.

00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:18.989
Everybody believed that.

00:35:18.989 --> 00:35:25.279
We had studies done by all sorts of outside
groups.

00:35:25.279 --> 00:35:33.279
IDA, the Aerospace Corporation and others
did studies that essentially agreed with us

00:35:33.279 --> 00:35:38.589
that there would be a terrific reduction in
the cost of getting stuff into orbit if we

00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:42.289
would build a recoverable vehicle.

00:35:42.289 --> 00:35:50.519
Now, it was clear that since the R&amp;D already
T&amp;E costs are higher, but you need a whole

00:35:50.519 --> 00:35:51.519
bunch of flights.

00:35:51.519 --> 00:36:00.619
If you had a few flights, the extra R&amp;D on
the shuttle wouldn't pay off because you could

00:36:00.619 --> 00:36:05.930
build cheap Ballistic launch vehicles that
would pay off before the shuttle.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:11.249
So you need a lot of flights for a recoverable
vehicle to be economical.

00:36:11.249 --> 00:36:16.759
The lower the R&amp;D the less flights needed
to be better than the Ballistic launch vehicles.

00:36:16.759 --> 00:36:23.329
And, if you got a lot of flights because the
flight costs are so low, then a two-stage

00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:27.140
fully recoverable system would be the right
way to go.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.660
That was our concepts of what we were dealing
with on the shuttle.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:36.119
There has been a lot of technology.

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:41.960
I don't know how many of you know that the
early lifting-body was done by a guy named

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.109
Burnelli.

00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:45.690
Not Bernoulli but Burnelli.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:57.070
Burnelli was in Long Island and he built the
first lifting-body.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:06.829
That is an airfoil section and that is a broad
piece of fuselage wide enough that the two

00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:09.660
engines could be involved in it.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.890
Big windows for transport.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:18.349
It was really quite an interesting beginning
of a cargo airplane in 1921.

00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:26.220
He built one of them and that was the end
of that, but there were a lot of other things

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.440
going on.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:35.731
After Sputnik, the United States just kind
of went wild with ideas for a while and then

00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:46.130
settled down on having NASA put in place,
deciding that the military dinosaurs and mold

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:49.579
programs wouldn't be done, that NASA would
take over that kind of activity.

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:53.509
But we got some really interesting stuff going.

00:37:53.509 --> 00:37:58.670
HL-10 lifting-body.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:02.390
X-24A lifting-body.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:10.900
X-15, although that was not considered a space
device, by the time they put external tanks

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:17.720
on it, it got up to mach 6 and 300,000 feet.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:24.789
Really some terrific performance out of that
airplane.

00:38:24.789 --> 00:38:29.559
And then I added the Navaho, which I worked
on for many years, because it had a parallel

00:38:29.559 --> 00:38:32.069
tank separation at mach 3.

00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:34.950
The booster was under the vehicle.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:40.529
The vehicle was a ramjet vehicle and it separated
at mach 3 at about 40,000 feet.

00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:48.400
It was a high dynamic pressure separation,
but it showed us that parallel separation

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.400
would work.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:39:01.440
And that gets into this picture later.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:13.859
Next step was in that '69 to '71 time period
this guy named Max Faget who is really important,

00:39:13.859 --> 00:39:22.940
almost a genius in my mind in design that
did the original Mercury and Gemini capsules,

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:29.869
physically designed the shape of the Apollo
Command Module and then came up with this

00:39:29.869 --> 00:39:35.979
first sort of practical view of a two-stage
fully recoverable system.

00:39:35.979 --> 00:39:38.599
It had straight wings like an X-15.

00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:44.579
In fact, if you looked at the plan form, it
looked quite a lot like an X-15.

00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:46.519
But it had two of them.

00:39:46.519 --> 00:39:48.329
It had pilots in each of the two stages.

00:39:48.329 --> 00:39:52.029
It had internal fuel.

00:39:52.029 --> 00:39:59.630
It had metal shingles, what I used to call
unobtanium, but it was like molybdenum and

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:09.380
Rene 41 and some really interesting materials
which were really difficult to handle.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:13.079
Stress, corrosion problems and all kinds of
things that were tough to handle.

00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:18.289
That is why I talked about unobtanium or some
ablative.

00:40:18.289 --> 00:40:22.930
And Max expected to have to use ablative on
the leading edge of the wings.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:28.000
And it had varying payloads.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.589
The highest one I saw in any of the history
was 20,000 pounds.

00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:36.799
But 14,000, 20,000, that kind of thing.

00:40:36.799 --> 00:40:43.950
A payload bay of about 12x40 and 400 miles
max crossrange.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:47.170
This gets important in requirements.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.630
And, at that time, because we were going to
have all these space stations and go to the

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:56.049
moon and all that sort of stuff, we were going
to have 100 to 150 flights a year.

00:40:56.049 --> 00:41:04.329
And, if you have a lot of flights, it overcomes
the base cost of the RDT&amp;E.

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:13.460
And he was getting down into the $5 million
a flight in his estimates.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:21.499
But, meanwhile, because we had lost the space
station, we had lost the lunar base, all this

00:41:21.499 --> 00:41:26.150
grand plan had disappeared, we needed more
payloads.

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:32.499
We needed to get up to the 40 to 50 payloads
a year to be able to make the shuttle look

00:41:32.499 --> 00:41:44.579
economic at the levels of cost-effectiveness
that the Office of Management and Budget was

00:41:44.579 --> 00:41:46.519
demanding of us.

00:41:46.519 --> 00:41:54.940
After this vote in the senate, George Low
decided that we had to be responsive to the

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.430
OMB so we had to get some more flights.

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:03.700
And this is where our requirements began to
come into the picture.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:09.200
We spent about a year working with the military
where they finally agreed they would put all

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:18.299
their payloads, and I mean all their payloads
on the shuttle if we could meet the cost estimates

00:42:18.299 --> 00:42:19.299
that we had.

00:42:19.299 --> 00:42:25.269
The commercial people were eager to get on
the shuttle if our costs would be this low

00:42:25.269 --> 00:42:32.339
because they were beginning to see launch
costs equal to or more than the cost of the

00:42:32.339 --> 00:42:34.329
satellites that we were putting up.

00:42:34.329 --> 00:42:38.979
And the science people bought into the idea
of space servicing.

00:42:38.979 --> 00:42:47.900
This really got important because they agreed
to design the Hubble Space Telescope so that

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.280
it could be serviced in space.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:56.469
And that turned out to be, of course, the
key to the Hubble because of the mistake that

00:42:56.469 --> 00:42:58.849
was made in the mirror.

00:42:58.849 --> 00:43:05.609
The re-servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope,
is what - by bringing another optics in front

00:43:05.609 --> 00:43:12.569
of this distorted mirror - brought the Hubble
back to the fantastic performance that it

00:43:12.569 --> 00:43:14.150
has today.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:20.989
MAN: In your opinion, was the science community
really anxious to have this servicing or was

00:43:20.989 --> 00:43:26.039
it something that was really forced upon them
to increase the constituency? MYERS: I think

00:43:26.039 --> 00:43:28.640
originally they thought they were being forced.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:34.779
But, as they thought it through, they could
see that they could later change sensors and

00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:36.239
add additional stuff.

00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:45.710
At least I know that the head of the science
group, I cannot think of his name now, enthusiastically

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:50.989
supported that and got the system out there
to support that idea.

00:43:50.989 --> 00:43:56.719
And they worked very closely with us on how
to design it so that you could get access

00:43:56.719 --> 00:43:58.789
to the thing in space.

00:43:58.789 --> 00:44:03.729
With all the difficulty we had with gloves
and so on, they worked to help us understand

00:44:03.729 --> 00:44:05.970
how to remove and replace systems.

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:14.489
MAN: Was there at that time, if you recall,
an opposition from the space science community

00:44:14.489 --> 00:44:22.150
to the size of the NASA budget that was being
spent on the shuttle in the Manned program?

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:24.349
MYERS: Oh, absolutely.

00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:26.549
Yeah, there was.

00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:32.619
But, on the other hand, some of the committees
like the town committee supported the shuttle

00:44:32.619 --> 00:44:36.359
because they could see other science opportunities
that were involved.

00:44:36.359 --> 00:44:40.869
So they didn't gang on us.

00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:50.880
They were shooting arrows at us here and there.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:56.269
And let me go on with the requirements.

00:44:56.269 --> 00:45:05.259
Because of the military requirements, we had
to change our specifications.

00:45:05.259 --> 00:45:09.849
And this became another one of the elements
that drove the final design.

00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:16.790
The military wanted a 60 foot long payload
bay.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:21.410
It had been 40 in the designs that we had
been doing so far.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:30.339
They wanted 40,000 pounds Polar, and that
made our due east payload up to about 65,000.

00:45:30.339 --> 00:45:34.920
That was a big change from 20,000 to 65,000.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.650
And they needed 1,500 crossrange.

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:44.109
They wanted to be able to go around the earth,
while the earth turned, and land at the same

00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:45.819
spot.

00:45:45.819 --> 00:45:48.260
So they had to have 1,500 miles of crossrange.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.910
Now, you can do it a lot of different ways.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:58.810
You could carry turbojets when you came back
in and fly it back the 1,500 miles, or you

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:04.819
could do it without turbojets which means
you have to have aerodynamic crossrange while

00:46:04.819 --> 00:46:10.160
you are coming in.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.519
Payload bay increased to 15x60.

00:46:13.519 --> 00:46:19.289
15 was an increase by NASA because they saw
that they didn't have a Saturn V anymore to

00:46:19.289 --> 00:46:25.239
do space station, so the best they could do
was increase the diameter of the shuttle to

00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:32.339
where they have a 15 foot diameter to where
they could carry the sections of the space

00:46:32.339 --> 00:46:35.140
station that we now have in the program.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:42.489
We thought anything less than that was just
too cramped for the guys.

00:46:42.489 --> 00:46:48.130
We decided that we would find a non-ablative
reusable thermal protection system.

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:55.799
Technology had moved far enough by that time
that we were beginning to see these ceramic

00:46:55.799 --> 00:47:00.670
tiles develop to the place where they looked
feasible.

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:06.930
They had been able to find a hardening for
the surface that made them less penetratable

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.880
than they had been.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:15.940
And carbon-carbon came in that we could use
for the leading edge, for 3,000 degree leading-edge

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.230
temperatures.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:24.450
We followed the tradition that said if it
is fully recoverable it is going to be cheaper

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:28.650
so let's go for a two-stage fully recoverable
system.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:33.489
And, of course, all the other things that
we were developing at that time to reduce

00:47:33.489 --> 00:47:40.469
the cost of operations with automatic checkout
and so on.

00:47:40.469 --> 00:47:42.390
Well, that's a bad picture.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:50.940
I am not an expert at this stuff so I wasn't
able to get that slide down far enough to

00:47:50.940 --> 00:48:00.609
show where the Saturn V was, but Saturn V
is only about 50% longer than that upper stage

00:48:00.609 --> 00:48:01.859
there.

00:48:01.859 --> 00:48:03.890
So this thing had gotten big.

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:08.329
And the booster was larger than a 747.

00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:13.170
It had to operate up to about mach 6.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:23.660
The orbiter was about the size of an MD-80,
MD-90, twin engine small transport.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.690
And so they were big.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:34.170
And these things had 12 big high-pressure
engines in them.

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:39.989
And we in management, and I think the guys
in design, were getting pretty worried about

00:48:39.989 --> 00:48:47.009
whether an airplane that large at that mach
number was going to be a practical thing in

00:48:47.009 --> 00:48:48.151
terms of a system.

00:48:48.151 --> 00:48:50.599
And that's not a system engineering approach.

00:48:50.599 --> 00:48:54.219
That's sort of a gut feeling that you get
after being in the airplane business for a

00:48:54.219 --> 00:48:59.190
lot of years and watching the development
problems that were involved on the X-15, for

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.190
example.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:03.440
How long it took the X-15 to get to where
it could go to mach 6.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.789
But that was the direction we were going in.

00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:15.979
By the way, one of the companies had the wings
on the orbiter turned up.

00:49:15.979 --> 00:49:21.930
I don't know why, but they had them turned
up.

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:26.559
And by the way, the reason you see two different
configurations here is in our phase B studies

00:49:26.559 --> 00:49:33.099
to the industry we said design us one that
only has 400 miles crossrange and design us

00:49:33.099 --> 00:49:36.150
one that has 1,500 miles crossrange.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:38.221
The upper ones have 1,500 miles crossrange.

00:49:38.221 --> 00:49:42.999
And the delta wing will do that, the straight
wings won't.

00:49:42.999 --> 00:49:48.809
So, as we developed these requirements, it
became clear that we were not going to go

00:49:48.809 --> 00:49:50.339
with a straight wing system.

00:49:50.339 --> 00:50:01.599
These phase B studies that we had showed that
we were going to have a development cost of

00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:07.130
some place between $12 billion and $15 billion
for R&amp;D.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:15.779
And about that time Nixon had a meeting with
Fletcher and said you can build any kind of

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:19.209
shuttle you want, as long as it only costs
$5 billion.

00:50:19.209 --> 00:50:23.799
Well, that was a big shock to the system.

00:50:23.799 --> 00:50:27.489
And, having heard that, OMB said make it cost-effective.

00:50:27.489 --> 00:50:37.390
And that was a real tremendous driver in the
system because we had never been asked to

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:38.390
do that before.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:45.769
And we had a whole new set of requirements
to try to deal with.

00:50:45.769 --> 00:50:50.829
So we had had this phase B program, it was
almost complete, we had all these big, beautiful

00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:59.400
configuration studies and we had to look again.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.890
So we went out and said let's get imaginative,
guys.

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:05.160
Let's see if there is any way that we can
reduce the cost.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.599
There had been enough going on where one of
the companies had been looking at the possibility

00:51:10.599 --> 00:51:19.190
of putting external tanks like drop tanks
on the top of the wing on each side, two of

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:22.009
them, one on each side of the orbiter.

00:51:22.009 --> 00:51:25.519
And it made the orbiter itself, of course,
much smaller.

00:51:25.519 --> 00:51:30.559
Remember, we were carrying hydrogen and oxygen,
and we were doing it inside the vehicles.

00:51:30.559 --> 00:51:34.569
It is in those studies you saw in phase B.

00:51:34.569 --> 00:51:39.150
And so it grew the outside dimensions tremendously.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:44.940
And by going externally with the fuels, it
really shrank down the system to where the

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.910
diameter of a payload compartment was essentially
the diameter of the orbiter.

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:56.160
And so people began to look at other ways
to do it.

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.109
We had guys coming in talking about single-staged
orbit.

00:51:59.109 --> 00:52:06.900
And that was one that I rejected without study
because I knew that the mass fractions required

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:13.059
for that were just out of the world of reality.

00:52:13.059 --> 00:52:19.140
There was a thing called a "trinese" where
the theory was you had three vehicles.

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.530
They were deltas and fit together in a nice
little teepee.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:27.609
And two of them would be used for boosters
going up and the third one would go on into

00:52:27.609 --> 00:52:28.729
orbit.

00:52:28.729 --> 00:52:30.299
And that was kind of a dumb idea.

00:52:30.299 --> 00:52:34.969
Because it turns out boosters and orbiters
have entirely different requirements.

00:52:34.969 --> 00:52:39.330
And so they might look the same on paper but
they would not be the same when you build

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:41.979
them.

00:52:41.979 --> 00:52:49.701
Lockheed came in with an X-24b which had tanks
mounted up forward of the delta wing.

00:52:49.701 --> 00:52:58.630
And the idea would be that they would peel
off after fuel was fed to the main engines

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:01.829
in the orbiter itself.

00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:05.709
And then we began to see these external orbiter
tank studies.

00:53:05.709 --> 00:53:14.839
And when the tanks began to look good externally
then the question is do you boost from under

00:53:14.839 --> 00:53:28.309
the tank or do you boost with two boosters
parallel to the tank itself? When the tanks

00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:35.239
went external, it finally ended up obvious
that it would want one tank instead of two.

00:53:35.239 --> 00:53:40.249
So the one tank went underneath the orbiter.

00:53:40.249 --> 00:53:44.819
Then the question is do you boost through
the tank or do you boost in parallel to the

00:53:44.819 --> 00:53:57.839
tank with two attached boosters? 

00:53:57.839 --> 00:53:59.509
So we had all these different studies.

00:53:59.509 --> 00:54:09.400
And what was happening in the administration
was they were kind of locked up with reducing

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:15.229
Manned Space Flight budget down to like $1.5
to $1.7 billion.

00:54:15.229 --> 00:54:21.059
And we needed to do this cost-effectiveness
study for OMB.

00:54:21.059 --> 00:54:29.309
We hired an outfit called Mathematica which
had a senior well-known economist named Morgenstern

00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:39.019
and a bright young guy named Klaus Heiss who
did a study for us on the cost-effectiveness

00:54:39.019 --> 00:54:41.690
of the shuttle.

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:49.029
And, to make a very long story short, the
results were that the present configuration

00:54:49.029 --> 00:54:53.059
that we have for the shuttle today is the
one that looked the best.

00:54:53.059 --> 00:55:00.630
Present configuration being an orbiter with
a tank under it with the hydrogen and oxygen

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:08.519
in that tank fed separately into the orbiter
and to the main engines which were so expensive

00:55:08.519 --> 00:55:11.289
that we wanted to recover them.

00:55:11.289 --> 00:55:22.369
And boosters being solid rockets attached
to the tank so that the total vehicle was

00:55:22.369 --> 00:55:23.369
a little shorter.

00:55:23.369 --> 00:55:28.979
Oh, an important point.

00:55:28.979 --> 00:55:32.739
At that time the solids were recoverable.

00:55:32.739 --> 00:55:41.119
Their wall thickness was enough that you could
use the solid rockets, drop them off by parachute

00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:46.190
into the ocean, pick them up, bring them back,
clean them out and use them again.

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:51.380
And that was going to be a cost saving in
the program.

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:55.849
And, by doing all this, we had liftoff thrust
augmentation of the engines in the orbiter.

00:55:55.849 --> 00:56:04.400
These engines, by the way, were 12,000 pounds
per square inch internal pressure engines

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.789
stage combustion.

00:56:05.789 --> 00:56:08.599
The most advanced technology you could imagine.

00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:13.519
And they were started a year before the shuttle
was started to give them more time to develop.

00:56:13.519 --> 00:56:19.690
They almost became the long pole of the tent,
but I think maybe when it finally boiled down

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:23.809
the thermal protection was the longest pole.

00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:25.339
He was down there trying to fix them.

00:56:25.339 --> 00:56:29.609
I think he was almost down there gluing them
on.

00:56:29.609 --> 00:56:33.099
Down at the Cape when we were getting ready
to launch, we were still having trouble getting

00:56:33.099 --> 00:56:39.069
the thermal protection system working right.

00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:43.540
Well, the result of all this, and there were
a lot of other things that happened at the

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:52.119
time, in 1971, I don't remember when, the
Supersonic Transport was cancelled.

00:56:52.119 --> 00:56:55.450
And that was a big technology blow to this
country.

00:56:55.450 --> 00:57:02.579
In other words, there was a major program
that would have absorbed a lot of the high-tech

00:57:02.579 --> 00:57:07.829
engineers that were involved in the Apollo
program.

00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:11.940
And, I think, some of the administration thought
the Supersonic Transport is a better place

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:15.699
to have our technology capability than would
be a shuttle.

00:57:15.699 --> 00:57:20.109
But Supersonic Transport was cancelled by
Boeing.

00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:26.420
And I think that probably helped the atmosphere
that was involved.

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:30.930
But the other thing that happened is that
Congress and the administration finally got

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:35.049
the idea that we really weren't going to build
a space station immediately.

00:57:35.049 --> 00:57:38.150
That we were just interested in getting the
shuttle started.

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:45.779
And so we didn't have this massive budget
increase that Tom Paine kept wanting.

00:57:45.779 --> 00:57:51.869
And Fletcher kept working on trying to get
budgets spread so that it wouldn't be a major

00:57:51.869 --> 00:57:54.549
peak in budgets close in.

00:57:54.549 --> 00:58:01.699
And he did that by starting the main engine
early, starting the tanks late, starting with

00:58:01.699 --> 00:58:07.219
solids late and putting an obvious emphasis
on the orbiter itself.

00:58:07.219 --> 00:58:12.900
So that spread the budget out and helped a
lot in giving the administration the feeling

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:17.430
that we weren't going to kill them with budget
requirements.

00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:21.719
So Nixon started the program January of 1972.

00:58:21.719 --> 00:58:25.749
George Low and Jim Fletcher went over and
had about a 40 minute talk with President

00:58:25.749 --> 00:58:31.019
Nixon, and he announced the same day we were
going to start building the shuttle.

00:58:31.019 --> 00:58:39.150
It was going to be a reusable orbiter, the
engines in the orbiter, reusable solid cases,

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:47.079
an extendable fuel tank, 40 to 50 flights
a year, $10 million to $15 million a flight.

00:58:47.079 --> 00:58:53.660
Our internal calculations were more like $10
million but we wanted to have some pad in

00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:54.660
it.

00:58:54.660 --> 00:59:04.579
And $5.2 billion, plus a 20% reserve for the
administrator for what we call unk-unks, unknown

00:59:04.579 --> 00:59:09.289
unknowns, things you get into trouble during
a development program where you need some

00:59:09.289 --> 00:59:13.589
more money to do some more testing.

00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:17.809
And Nixon agreed to that.

00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:21.839
The Bureau of the Budget was in the meeting
with him.

00:59:21.839 --> 00:59:27.890
And, as soon as Nixon left office, the Office
of Management Budget forgot the 20%.

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:32.670
So then it was now $5.2 billion of 1970 dollars.

00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:39.739
To make it worse, the NASA Comptroller pressed,
I'm sure by OMB, didn't agree that we would

00:59:39.739 --> 00:59:42.239
use 1970 as the base.

00:59:42.239 --> 00:59:45.809
He took the $5.2 billion in 1972.

00:59:45.809 --> 00:59:48.249
We lost two years of inflation.

00:59:48.249 --> 00:59:53.359
Well, it may not sound like a lot to you but,
boy, it sounded like a lot to the guys working

00:59:53.359 --> 00:59:58.170
on the program because it was clear that we
were going to have a tough time meeting that

00:59:58.170 --> 01:00:02.829
budget.

01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:12.039
Here I am explaining to the press, I think
it was about two days after Nixon's announcement,

01:00:12.039 --> 01:00:19.630
one of the studies was to use the first stage
of the Saturn V, the S1C.

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:24.819
This one apparently, I think this is the winged
version, because all the engines at their

01:00:24.819 --> 01:00:28.029
back center gradually all the way back here
some place.

01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:35.570
And we were using, in this design, using the
first stage of Saturn V boosting directly

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:40.359
into the tank which was attached to the orbiter.

01:00:40.359 --> 01:00:44.749
This one was parallel.

01:00:44.749 --> 01:00:46.209
I guess that was liquids.

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:47.539
They look like they have bigger diameter.

01:00:47.539 --> 01:00:58.920
And I didn't talk about that, but a lot of
people were pushing a pressure-fed liquid

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:04.059
engine so that you'd be sure you had the capability
to cut them off.

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:08.449
And the idea was that because they were pressure-fed
that the thickness of the walls was enough

01:01:08.449 --> 01:01:12.839
that they, too, could be recovered in the
ocean and brought back.

01:01:12.839 --> 01:01:20.170
And the final decision by the people that
were in the propulsion business in NASA was

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:24.719
that the technology looked tough.

01:01:24.719 --> 01:01:26.319
It was new.

01:01:26.319 --> 01:01:29.549
We didn't have a background of pressure-fed
boosters.

01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:37.849
And the solids, as we will get to later, looked
like they were a better deal.

01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:42.209
So the design issues, as I saw them as the
head of Manned Space Flight, were that the

01:01:42.209 --> 01:01:45.289
delta wing was required for crossrange.

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:50.789
External tanks were much lighter, the system
got to be about half the weight because of

01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:56.119
all the reduction in external configuration
when you took all the fuel out and put it

01:01:56.119 --> 01:01:59.579
separately in the tank.

01:01:59.579 --> 01:02:04.499
Thermal insulation, we bought off on the ceramic
tile, the carbon-carbon and fiber blankets,

01:02:04.499 --> 01:02:10.680
the same as we have today, solid or liquid
boosters.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.339
The solids looked more reliable at that time.

01:02:13.339 --> 01:02:21.969
There had been a history of solids on many
of the large military boosters, and they looked

01:02:21.969 --> 01:02:23.769
better.

01:02:23.769 --> 01:02:30.360
And, at that time, I thought we were going
to have a way to terminate the thrust of the

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.450
solids.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:39.170
Engine location and type started on the ground
for safer, better performance and the stage

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:42.829
combustion for better performance.

01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:45.880
We had, under our study, retractable turbojets.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:50.559
Once you got into the atmosphere, you would
pop these turbojets out and flew home.

01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:52.529
And we decided we couldn't handle it.

01:02:52.529 --> 01:02:58.690
Thank God we had had all this lifting body
experience where the guys that landed these

01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:00.839
very low elevatory devices.

01:03:00.839 --> 01:03:08.329
Actually, the orbiter had a little better
elevatory than some of the HL-10s and X-24s,

01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:11.289
so we dropped the turbojets out of the system.

01:03:11.289 --> 01:03:17.650
Series versus parallel boosters, series was
heavier and had less performance with a lot

01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:19.391
more bending loads in the system.

01:03:19.391 --> 01:03:23.529
When we go up, we go max Q.

01:03:23.529 --> 01:03:26.201
And with crosswinds we get big loads on that
wing.

01:03:26.201 --> 01:03:33.719
And so this turned out to be a heavier way
to do it.

01:03:33.719 --> 01:03:40.410
Well, a little more on solids versus liquids.

01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:47.700
I always like to tell this story about solids
could be shipped by rail.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.471
I can say it another way.

01:03:49.471 --> 01:03:56.579
The diameter of the solids was set by rail
shipment.

01:03:56.579 --> 01:04:05.479
And there is a story which I am sure some
of you have heard that the rails of the American

01:04:05.479 --> 01:04:11.249
rails were set first by the British who brought
the British rail system to the United States.

01:04:11.249 --> 01:04:16.479
The British rail system was set by the width
of the wheels on the carts that they used

01:04:16.479 --> 01:04:17.479
to have.

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:26.499
And the cart's width was set by the Roman
chariots that used to be on the roads because

01:04:26.499 --> 01:04:31.239
they made grooves in the tiles.

01:04:31.239 --> 01:04:36.869
So that set the diameter of the shuttle.

01:04:36.869 --> 01:04:46.200
And the Roman chariot's wheel width was set
by two horses in front of them.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:55.170
So there are some who say that the diameter
of the shuttle rocket engines was designed

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:57.279
by two horses' asses.

01:04:57.279 --> 01:05:01.069
Those were the guys that wanted to use liquid.

01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:07.430
They can be shipped by rail.

01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:09.799
They had a better reliability record at the
time.

01:05:09.799 --> 01:05:12.140
Solids could be recovered.

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.480
Industry studied pressure fed to recover them,
too, but we didn't buy that.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.949
The designers thought they could turn off
the solids but later found out they couldn't

01:05:20.949 --> 01:05:26.960
turn them off uniformly and that the thrust
variance that would be involved between the

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:32.829
two would be totally beyond the capability
of the vehicle to sustain it.

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:36.539
So we dropped it.

01:05:36.539 --> 01:05:38.349
Thermal insulation, we talked about it.

01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:44.790
They were all new developments that had been
experimentally tested, they looked like they

01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:47.109
were going to work, but we had a lot of work
to do.

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:52.609
And the ceramic tiles really turned out to
be one of the toughest new technologies that

01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:54.480
we got into.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.890
High-pressure stage combustion engine, we
knew that was a big new development.

01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:02.489
And so, as I said, that was started early.

01:06:02.489 --> 01:06:08.599
And design crew escape, well, the idea was
we were going to be able to terminate the

01:06:08.599 --> 01:06:10.709
thrust on the rocket engines.

01:06:10.709 --> 01:06:21.189
And we looked at these rockets to pull away
the cabin, we looked at all that stuff, and

01:06:21.189 --> 01:06:25.069
none of them had a broad application.

01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:28.189
You had the question of safety.

01:06:28.189 --> 01:06:31.839
If you took it off at the launch site, if
you took the whole front end off the vehicle

01:06:31.839 --> 01:06:39.189
at the launch site, it had big questions of
the reliability of the system.

01:06:39.189 --> 01:06:45.589
We went through a lot of studies to try to
find a way to capture the crew in case of

01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:53.380
a problem and never found a system that fit
into the program.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:57.660
So we ended up with crew escape only with
a complete structure.

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.920
And that, of course, was the problem in Challenger.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:09.069
We ended up wrecking the structure to where
we did not have a recovery capability, but

01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:17.279
we put in a system where if the vehicle were
complete and structurally sound and was gliding

01:07:17.279 --> 01:07:18.769
the guys could get out.

01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:22.670
But that was the only escape system that we
had.

01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:31.299
I wanted to touch operation costs a little
bit.

01:07:31.299 --> 01:07:36.299
We had built enormous confidence from the
Apollo program.

01:07:36.299 --> 01:07:46.420
In spite of the Apollo 13 problem, the rest
of the vehicles had worked beautifully.

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:52.829
I used to say that every flight always had
man in the loop some place during the flight

01:07:52.829 --> 01:07:55.369
that was important to the success of the program.

01:07:55.369 --> 01:07:57.959
Many times it was a minor thing.

01:07:57.959 --> 01:08:05.519
Like when Apollo 12 got struck by lightning
when it was launched, the guys were able to

01:08:05.519 --> 01:08:10.220
reconfigure switches to get the power back
on, get everything back to normal and had

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:16.310
a nice flight to the moon and hit a few golf
balls.

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:23.309
Every flight had man involved, but every flight
was a tremendous success, except Apollo 13.

01:08:23.309 --> 01:08:29.001
And, at the time, we were dealing here in
the 1970 time period.

01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:36.630
Well, April of 1970 was when we launched Apollo
13.

01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:40.290
Anyway, we had tremendous confidence.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:45.239
And we thought we had tremendous support from
the industry and we thought we had tremendous

01:08:45.239 --> 01:08:55.719
support from the public, but we still were
concerned about the operational costs so we

01:08:55.719 --> 01:09:01.400
hired American Airlines, for one, to work
with us on what the costs would be and how

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:10.719
would you design the system to give you the
least operational costs? The military, because

01:09:10.719 --> 01:09:16.319
they were committing to put their payloads
on the shuttle, had studies done by the Aerospace

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.840
Corporation about the operation costs.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:28.799
There was a study done by IDA, Institute of
Defense Analysis.

01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:32.969
All three of them agreed that we were going
to have tremendous reductions in the cost

01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:33.969
of operations.

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:39.299
They didn't quite come down to the same levels
that NASA had estimated but they were close.

01:09:39.299 --> 01:09:42.900
It was kind of interesting that we all thought
it could be done.

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:48.199
We all thought there could be be enormous
reductions in the cost of operations with

01:09:48.199 --> 01:09:51.099
the shuttle.

01:09:51.099 --> 01:10:00.969
We thought we had enough space-based hardware
that we could do quick turnarounds and handle

01:10:00.969 --> 01:10:04.130
it more like an airplane.

01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:13.780
But NASA and these groups didn't really properly
account for the costs associated with post-flight

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:20.050
maintenance, the rocket engine.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:25.130
When IDA and Aerospace did the studies, we
told them the rocket engine was going to be

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:27.199
reusable for at least 20 flights.

01:10:27.199 --> 01:10:29.570
Well, it turned out it wasn't.

01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:36.170
And it was such an enormous new development
that in the early flights of the shuttle it

01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:41.380
took a lot of time and a lot of effort to
replace engines and refurbish engines.

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:50.690
Assuring the safety of flight in a hostile
environment, and space is hostile, and we

01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:58.980
are dealing here with what amounts to a short
amount of R&amp;D development testing when you

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.730
get into these flights.

01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:02.650
Difficult cutting-edge technologies.

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:11.219
The engine in the thermal program, the tiles
worked but they often got chips outs of the

01:11:11.219 --> 01:11:13.840
tiles so we had to replace tiles between flights.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:20.500
And this is fail operation, fail operation,
fail safe.

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.630
The airplanes have fail operation, fail safe.

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:29.020
They took the attitude that if you had three
computers that was plenty, and if one went

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.020
bad during a checkout you launched anyway.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:39.110
You don't know that but that is what is happening
to you on commercial airplanes today.

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:40.110
We went one more.

01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:42.380
We went fail operation, fail operation, fail
safe.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:47.730
We have four computers in the shuttle, but
we cannot fly without all four in perfect

01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:48.780
condition.

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:52.739
So those things add cost when you do that.

01:11:52.739 --> 01:11:58.570
And then cost tradeoffs between R&amp;D and operations,
people have argued with me many times that

01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:02.829
our decision to put the tank externally was
a bad deal.

01:12:02.829 --> 01:12:07.409
It turns out that it was certainly a bad deal
on Columbia.

01:12:07.409 --> 01:12:14.830
The foam on that tank came off and hit the
carbon-carbon leading-edge of the wing and

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:22.170
broke a hole in it and caused thermal excesses
in the re-entry.

01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:28.690
So you could argue, yeah, we should have had
a two-stage fully recoverable system.

01:12:28.690 --> 01:12:39.960
But 
those were the cost tradeoffs that were involved

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:47.719
in getting a system that would be accepted
and bought off on by the administration.

01:12:47.719 --> 01:12:52.679
I want to talk a little bit about operation
costs.

01:12:52.679 --> 01:12:55.770
That has been the big miss that we made in
this program.

01:12:55.770 --> 01:13:00.150
As I said, cost of operations never got down
to what it should have been.

01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:02.250
Well, it never got down there for a couple
of reasons.

01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:10.420
We were never able to get up to a flight rate
that would favor a reusable vehicle.

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:21.710
I think we got up to 26 flights in one year,
but most of them were down around eight or

01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:22.710
ten.

01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:29.840
And so we weren't up far enough to offset
the cost of the research and development costs

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.809
to get the operational costs down low.

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.739
But I have an interesting little summary.

01:13:34.739 --> 01:13:40.409
It is not an exact thing at all but it gives
you a little feeling for what I have seen

01:13:40.409 --> 01:13:41.409
out in this program.

01:13:41.409 --> 01:13:47.489
In 1970, the $10 million flight price was
based on the same accounting system that we

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:49.199
used for the Apollo.

01:13:49.199 --> 01:13:53.639
Now, when you go down to Cape Canaveral we
had a lot of other things going on besides

01:13:53.639 --> 01:13:54.699
Apollo.

01:13:54.699 --> 01:14:04.469
And so we had the common support activities
like the medical department and the mail system

01:14:04.469 --> 01:14:12.260
and all that sort of stuff as a common separate
accounting.

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:17.360
And all the costs for the Apollo were those
that we called hands-on, things associated

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:22.929
with buying parts, bringing in spares, putting
on spares, checking out the vehicle and launching

01:14:22.929 --> 01:14:23.929
it.

01:14:23.929 --> 01:14:29.110
So we had two different pieces of money involved
in the Apollo program, and one of them never

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:31.710
even was charged to the Apollo program.

01:14:31.710 --> 01:14:36.760
So we used that same system, it seemed logical
to go ahead with the same accounting system

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.750
for the shuttle as we did for the Apollo.

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:45.980
Well, it turned out that these separate items
were a pretty big chunk of money.

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:49.970
And I have assumed that it was about $400
million a year.

01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:54.300
I am not sure that is right, but I wanted
to do it just to give you an idea of what

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.530
happens with inflation.

01:14:56.530 --> 01:15:04.070
Remember we said we would do this job using
1970 dollars and we said that the costs would

01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:11.090
be $10 million of 1970 dollars? With $400
million in overhead and inflation, according

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:16.960
to the Consumer's Price Index, which I looked
up on Google, by the way, they have a nice

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:26.500
little calculator for inflation, 40 flights
a year, no overhead, in other words, like

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:35.830
Apollo, a $10 million price in 1970 would
be $23 million by first flight and would be

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:41.119
$50 million now.

01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:48.131
Same 40 flights but including overhead would
make the flight cost $20 million in 1970,

01:15:48.131 --> 01:15:56.190
$45 million in 1981 and $101 million per flight
for 40 flights in 2005.

01:15:56.190 --> 01:16:04.910
A huge increased price because of the inflation
that occurred in the 1980 to 1982 time period.

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:12.889
Eight flights per year, including overhead,
runs it up to $60 million in 1970 dollars.

01:16:12.889 --> 01:16:16.699
And eight flights per year is sort of what
we have been running here recently.

01:16:16.699 --> 01:16:29.520
$135 million at time of first flight and $302
million a flight in 2005.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.920
Now, the cost per flight on the shuttle, I
don't know.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:37.800
I know that it is up in that $400 million
or $500 million price.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.070
I use this only to give you kind of a rough
feeling that, although we missed operational

01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:52.210
costs badly, we didn't really just be totally
out of the ballpark on them.

01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:54.110
Shuttle performance is great.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:58.140
The shuttle has done everything it was designed
to do, and probably a few more things we didn't

01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.520
think of at the time.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:06.380
It has put military devices in orbit, commercial
devices in orbit, scientific payloads all

01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:15.989
to LEO with solids we brought along, and it
has taken stuff to GEO, geosynchronous orbits.

01:17:15.989 --> 01:17:18.449
It has retrieved and replaced satellites.

01:17:18.449 --> 01:17:21.800
It has retrieved satellites and brought them
down to the ground and repaired them and brought

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.300
them back into orbit.

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:29.071
It has repaired satellites in orbit and it
has launched elements to the space station.

01:17:29.071 --> 01:17:37.320
In the 1980s, the shuttle had only 4% of all
the launches in the country but carried 41%

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.929
of the mass launched.

01:17:39.929 --> 01:17:47.230
Shuttle R&amp;D was well within what Nixon and
Fletcher agreed to, $5.2 billion plus 20%

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:52.030
in 1970 dollars.

01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:54.340
And I mean quite a lot of it.

01:17:54.340 --> 01:18:00.929
Probably the 20%, only about 5% to 10% of
that was actually used.

01:18:00.929 --> 01:18:07.400
In that sense, they overran what the OMB said
we were to develop it for where they didn't

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.440
give us the 20% reserve.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.960
We overran it by 5% or 10%.

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:16.639
Missed two key design issues.

01:18:16.639 --> 01:18:20.030
Call them system engineering issues.

01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:23.480
Cold O rings in the Challenger.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:30.159
We had O rings in that vehicle which when
they were cold they lost their flexibility.

01:18:30.159 --> 01:18:35.110
And when they were cold in a design that was
opened a little bit when the pressure came

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:39.179
on internally, that was a disaster waiting
to happen.

01:18:39.179 --> 01:18:45.320
So that was a bad design of the way the O
rings were designed into the vehicle.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:50.590
The second one is the foam shedding.

01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:58.989
We knew that we were going to have ice and/or
foam on that tank, and we really pressed the

01:18:58.989 --> 01:19:03.050
industry to make sure that that foam was going
to stay on.

01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:08.150
We had foam enough that we didn't get a lot
of icing, but we had foam that had to stay

01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:09.150
on.

01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:15.349
Because we know that as it shed, we didn't
think so much of the carbon-carbon as the

01:19:15.349 --> 01:19:19.690
tiles, these brittle tiles that we had on
the bottom of the shuttle.

01:19:19.690 --> 01:19:26.510
So foam shedding was known to be a problem
all the way through this arm of the development

01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:29.600
but just has not been able to solved.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:36.119
And after the Columbia accident, the Martin
company, I assume, worked for two years trying

01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:38.219
to make that foam stick better.

01:19:38.219 --> 01:19:41.429
And it did stick better but pieces still came
off.

01:19:41.429 --> 01:19:47.330
So the fleet has been grounded and they got
to get that fixed.

01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:51.389
And, of course, we missed the operational
cost.

01:19:51.389 --> 01:19:58.410
Two-stage reusable vehicle would have missed
worse, I am sure of that, because of the size

01:19:58.410 --> 01:20:05.760
of that first-stage booster and the mach numbers
it had to go to.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.780
I guess I have concluded that spacecraft are
not like airplanes.

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.090
Every flight is a structural dive demonstration.

01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:19.300
You know, you develop an airplane and you
fly it many times before you fly it to the

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.789
corner of a VG diagram.

01:20:21.789 --> 01:20:25.900
And I can only think of one exception.

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:32.980
A guy named Weese Welch, one of the greatest
test pilots North America every had flew the

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:38.760
first flight of the F-86 which is the fancy
new jet that we brought in just before the

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.460
Korean War.

01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:47.329
And, on his first flight, it flew so well
that he took it into a little dive and the

01:20:47.329 --> 01:20:49.590
mach meter went up to one.

01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:57.340
And, actually, the ground data showed that
he probably went to 1.04.

01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:59.230
Some say they heard a sonic boom.

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:01.440
I am not sure of that.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:10.590
But that was about a month before the X1 went
supersonic.

01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:15.070
In those days, test pilots were kind of innovative
and they did things that they were told not

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.070
to do.

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:17.079
And he did it.

01:21:17.079 --> 01:21:20.179
But every flight is a structural dive demonstration.

01:21:20.179 --> 01:21:23.360
We go right up to max Q every time we fly.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:28.320
We go through wind shears and take it up to
high Gs.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:33.460
We go to high Gs on the way up, we go to high
Gs on the way down, we go max thermal every

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.550
flight.

01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:42.530
So we are dealing with a tough set of activities
when we do this.

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:47.429
No reusable space system ever gets the millions
of hours of stressed operation that airplanes

01:21:47.429 --> 01:21:48.429
get.

01:21:48.429 --> 01:21:52.949
Once an airplane gets through development,
it starts getting millions of hours of test

01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:57.270
data or information where if you have a problem
you fix it.

01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:59.570
And you just don't get that in these systems.

01:21:59.570 --> 01:22:08.420
The space system has decades of evolutionary
model development.

01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:15.710
In other words, the airplane business has
been so dramatically economical that you could

01:22:15.710 --> 01:22:19.360
build new airplanes every ten years or so.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:25.000
And each new airplane took advantage of all
the things known from the past airplane and

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.449
designed into it.

01:22:27.449 --> 01:22:33.889
As I said, every reusable system is exposed
to enormous environmental variations every

01:22:33.889 --> 01:22:34.889
time.

01:22:34.889 --> 01:22:40.210
Thermal, vibration, pressure, mach number,
all these things happen every time.

01:22:40.210 --> 01:22:47.929
And so I look at the shuttle as being an amazing
piece of machinery which is done extremely

01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:52.150
well in what I consider a continuing R&amp;D environment.

01:22:52.150 --> 01:23:01.570
We just don't have yet an operational system.

01:23:01.570 --> 01:23:05.369
So my view of the next program, keep it simple.

01:23:05.369 --> 01:23:13.080
It has sort of been a prime view that I have
had of design every since I have been in the

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.820
airplane business.

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:17.920
Don't stretch the technology.

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:24.510
Use really good margins of safety because
we are dealing here with, as I said, maximum

01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:25.949
conditions on every flight.

01:23:25.949 --> 01:23:29.690
You better play it safe.

01:23:29.690 --> 01:23:30.869
Keep it small.

01:23:30.869 --> 01:23:33.599
Carry as few passengers as possible.

01:23:33.599 --> 01:23:36.219
Carry people or cargo but not both.

01:23:36.219 --> 01:23:38.679
Keep the requirements to a minimum.

01:23:38.679 --> 01:23:42.730
Use as many past components and systems as
have been proven to be reliable.

01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:49.420
Design for operations, very important.

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.760
Easy access.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.670
One man can replace a black box.

01:23:52.670 --> 01:24:02.429
You don't have to run a big pickup machine
to take something out of it.

01:24:02.429 --> 01:24:07.469
And keep the design reserved while you are
designing it so that when operational issues

01:24:07.469 --> 01:24:15.409
come up you can design for the operational
issue and keep reducing the cost of operations.

01:24:15.409 --> 01:24:16.550
I don't know what all that means.

01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:22.429
I think it means that if we had it to do over
again it would have been great to be able

01:24:22.429 --> 01:24:30.420
to contain the requirements within NASA, probably
build a much smaller system that you could

01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:39.000
get many more test flights at lower cost,
but we didn't have that opportunity, as you

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.349
now know.

01:24:41.349 --> 01:24:49.739
So we have the shuttle disappearing into the
distance.

01:24:49.739 --> 01:24:54.670
Decision has been made that the shuttle be
phased out in 2010.

01:24:54.670 --> 01:25:02.039
And it is going to be a tough issue because
now the shuttle is down in between flights

01:25:02.039 --> 01:25:04.300
because we lost foam on the last flight.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:09.940
They grounded the fleet until we can figure
out what to do about that foam problem.

01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:19.320
And then Hurricane Katrina knocked off the
top of the VAB, which isn't a big deal, but

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:25.070
it really messed up some of the tank facilities
and tank access.

01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:30.179
And people's lives have been affected with
losses of homes.

01:25:30.179 --> 01:25:35.550
So there is a whole bunch of new issues involved
in the shuttle that I read in the paper this

01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:41.139
morning which may mean another delay in the
next launch of the shuttle.

01:25:41.139 --> 01:25:46.489
And that means a compression of the time between
now and 2010 when they are trying to use the

01:25:46.489 --> 01:25:52.110
shuttle to meet the commitments that we have
with the Europeans and the Japanese about

01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:57.670
putting pieces of the space station up into
space.

01:25:57.670 --> 01:25:59.639
An interesting new problem for the shuttle.

01:25:59.639 --> 01:26:11.329
OK? [APPLAUSE] HOFFMAN: Let's take a 
one-minute stretch break.

01:26:11.329 --> 01:26:21.630
Stand up if you'd like, turn around in a few
circles, and then we will have a half an hour

01:26:21.630 --> 01:26:26.380
for some questions, answers and general comments.

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:32.670
The external environment, the background,
what went into the design of the shuttle.

01:26:32.670 --> 01:26:40.340
And I think what Dale alluded to at the end
is very much to the point, and we will be

01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:46.539
talking about this with the people when they
talk about the individual systems.

01:26:46.539 --> 01:26:50.270
In terms of the actual performance, which
we have gotten out of the shuttle, despite

01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:57.579
the fact that we have had two catastrophic
accidents which, by the way, involved not

01:26:57.579 --> 01:27:02.849
only the design of the shuttle but the way
we operated the shuttle.

01:27:02.849 --> 01:27:09.150
And that is an important thing that we will
spend time talking about.

01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:16.010
Had we not made the decision to launch Challenger
on that cold day, who knows what would have

01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:22.139
happened? And, similarly, we accepted the
fact that foam was continually falling off

01:27:22.139 --> 01:27:32.929
of the tank, even though that was incompatible
with the design specifications on the thermal

01:27:32.929 --> 01:27:34.140
insulation for the shuttle.

01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:40.489
So we had basically two parts of the shuttle
system and we had design incompatibilities,

01:27:40.489 --> 01:27:45.500
but we chose to keep on flying.

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:51.159
But, as a whole, the shuttle has been remarkably
successful from a technical point of view

01:27:51.159 --> 01:28:01.179
in terms of what we have been able to do in
near earth space, has been I think, compared

01:28:01.179 --> 01:28:13.179
to what you could do working out of an Apollo
capsule, was absolutely phenomenal.

01:28:13.179 --> 01:28:19.630
And, in fact, I think in terms of near earth
operations, the shuttle will be sorely missed

01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:25.530
when we retire it and there will be a lot
of capabilities that we will be giving up.

01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:32.350
But, on the other hand, where we really got
it wrong, by orders of magnitude, was in the

01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:35.630
cost and reusability of the shuttle.

01:28:35.630 --> 01:28:41.070
Now, perhaps that goes back to the requirements
because, again, we were trying to do an awful

01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:47.000
lot of things for the very first time and,
yet, we were being told by the Office of Management

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.800
and Budget that you said it had to be cost-effective.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:56.730
I mean, in a sense, NASA was being asked to
operate the shuttle almost as a commercial

01:28:56.730 --> 01:28:58.820
enterprise and to make money on it.

01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:05.510
This is like you build a test vehicle for
the first time and you are being asked, at

01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:09.829
the same time, to operate it at a profit.

01:29:09.829 --> 01:29:17.199
And, as you know, one of the systems engineering
principles is you have this triangle.

01:29:17.199 --> 01:29:28.440
I am sure you have all seen this.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:36.289
Performance, cost, schedule, you have all
seen the triangle, right? And you cannot specify

01:29:36.289 --> 01:29:37.349
all three.

01:29:37.349 --> 01:29:41.820
They are not all independent parameters.

01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:50.869
If you specify the performance and then you're
limiting the cost, you cannot control the

01:29:50.869 --> 01:29:53.090
schedule.

01:29:53.090 --> 01:30:01.010
Anyway, all three of those we, in a sense,
got specified when we accepted the requirements

01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:03.750
to build the shuttle.

01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:05.590
And something has to give.

01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:08.929
And, in the end, it was the schedule and the
cost.

01:30:08.929 --> 01:30:15.050
And we will have more to say about this in
the next couple of lectures, but now let's

01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:22.950
take advantage of the last 20 minutes and
give you a chance to ask some questions about

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:27.539
the content of the lecture.

01:30:27.539 --> 01:30:29.650
And Dale can try to answer them.

01:30:29.650 --> 01:30:36.050
I will say, by the way, in terms of the schedule
of the class, when this was given as an aircraft

01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:44.079
systems course, there were two lectures of
an hour and a half and then there was a laboratory

01:30:44.079 --> 01:30:45.570
period scheduled on Wednesdays.

01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:52.559
And the idea, I think, was that by scheduling
a lab everybody would have one period of time

01:30:52.559 --> 01:30:58.949
at the same time so that it would make it
easier for you to work as teams on your project.

01:30:58.949 --> 01:31:07.271
Because we have so many people coming from
out of town, I thought that it would be better

01:31:07.271 --> 01:31:14.140
to make sure that they have full time to interact
with you.

01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:20.409
And so we didn't schedule a laboratory period
for this course.

01:31:20.409 --> 01:31:23.079
Instead, we have two two-hour lectures.

01:31:23.079 --> 01:31:29.070
And I am assuming that all of you, once you
form teams, will be able to work out some

01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:31.349
times when you can get together.

01:31:31.349 --> 01:31:36.699
The only other thing I will mention, if you
look ahead for Tuesday, September the 20th,

01:31:36.699 --> 01:31:46.400
that is the first deliverable regarding your
term project.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:52.900
And all we want you to do there is just to
think about what subsystem you might be interested

01:31:52.900 --> 01:32:00.100
in studying and write a paragraph about what
you think you might want to do with it.

01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.800
And what we will do is we will be taking a
spiral approach to this project.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:11.230
So, if you look ahead, you will see there
are various times when we ask for preliminary

01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:12.469
results.

01:32:12.469 --> 01:32:20.030
And then we will work with you, give you guidance
in how to deepen that so that then you can

01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:21.030
go back.

01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:26.000
And the next time you hand something in it
will be at a deeper level until the end when

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.429
you're finished with the project.

01:32:27.429 --> 01:32:31.210
OK, let's move into the question and answer
period.

01:32:31.210 --> 01:32:33.679
And there has been a lot of material presented.

01:32:33.679 --> 01:32:38.300
And this is your chance to ask the guy who
was here when it all happened.

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:40.510
Dale, why don't you take center stage now?
MAN: Thanks so much for coming.

01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:43.020
I was kind of intrigued by your talking about
the different phases of development.

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.710
You called it phase A, phase B and C/D.

01:32:45.710 --> 01:33:01.810
And I was kind of wondering when, in those
phases, you kind of developed the high-level

01:33:01.810 --> 01:33:03.410
requirements, when you developed kind of low-level
requirements, how much industry was involved

01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:06.320
in different levels? What percent was industry
engineers and what percent was NASA engineers

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:09.220
in those studies? And I was just wondering
if you could expand on that.

01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:10.220
MYERS: Yeah.

01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:11.220
Good question.

01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:18.780
The theory is that you do phase A as conceptual
activity and, when you have gotten your requirements

01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:22.300
nailed down, you then do a phase B.

01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:27.770
And that's what we thought we had done.

01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:40.700
It turned out that 
military requirements came in after phase

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:47.780
B had been started, so we actually had to
change the contracts with the industry to

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:50.230
take into consideration those military requirements.

01:33:50.230 --> 01:33:52.570
And they were a big change to the requirements.

01:33:52.570 --> 01:33:58.781
So, in that sense, we had some inefficiency
in phase B.

01:33:58.781 --> 01:34:07.810
And it was after we began to get the results
of phase B that we realized we didn't have

01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:11.699
a system that was going to meet the requirements.

01:34:11.699 --> 01:34:18.230
So, instead of canceling phase B, we finished
the phase B because we needed that basic understanding

01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:23.630
of all of the systems and all of the elements
that made up the system.

01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:30.309
We finished phase B but we started some additional
phase As, conceptual activities to try to

01:34:30.309 --> 01:34:32.110
find a solution.

01:34:32.110 --> 01:34:41.059
And I don't remember how we worked from the
recognition of the new configuration back

01:34:41.059 --> 01:34:42.539
into the phase B guys.

01:34:42.539 --> 01:34:49.059
Oh, we had a phase B extension to bring that
new configuration.

01:34:49.059 --> 01:34:53.489
NASA's decision that we would go to an external
tank.

01:34:53.489 --> 01:35:00.370
We modified the phase B studies again with
an extension that allowed the industry then

01:35:00.370 --> 01:35:03.170
to catch up with what was going on.

01:35:03.170 --> 01:35:08.760
And, by the time we finished that phase B
extension, we all the requirements in place,

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:17.570
we had all of the design understood well enough
to start phase C/D.

01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:23.869
I think it is pretty amazing that a device
that was going to do what we wanted to do

01:35:23.869 --> 01:35:29.110
with the shuttle, go into orbit, come back
in and land, the configuration really stayed

01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:30.320
the same from that point on.

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:38.269
It is just amazing that we did that well,
I think, in definition so that when we really

01:35:38.269 --> 01:35:44.329
started the C and D phase, which is the detailed
design, things stayed in place.

01:35:44.329 --> 01:35:48.989
And that meant all the aerodynamic work that
had been done which was, by the way, the most

01:35:48.989 --> 01:35:55.280
aerodynamic work, most wind tunnel testing
ever done on a new system, I think, logically

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:59.190
because we were working through the mach number
range.

01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:06.840
And all of the other elemental testing that
had gone on all allowed us to keep the configuration

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:09.849
identical from that point.

01:36:09.849 --> 01:36:18.679
MAN: I know there has been a lot of talk,
but it seems obvious now in hindsight that

01:36:18.679 --> 01:36:27.880
the capsule, or the orbiter or what have you
should be on the top of the launcher to clear

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:32.469
it from the debris from the fuel tank or what
else.

01:36:32.469 --> 01:36:37.739
What I'm wondering is at the time in the early
stages, was there ever any talk about safety

01:36:37.739 --> 01:36:45.260
issues in putting the orbiter so low on the
hull on the side? MYERS: Yeah, there was a

01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:50.260
lot of talk with Martin about foam shedding
at that time.

01:36:50.260 --> 01:37:02.170
And, during the initial decision process for
putting it on the side, we had done studies

01:37:02.170 --> 01:37:04.969
of stacking it in series.

01:37:04.969 --> 01:37:11.380
And it was a weight problem.

01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:17.190
It was literally an issue of the structural
weight of the orbiter mounted vertically because

01:37:17.190 --> 01:37:22.119
of the terrific loads that you get separately
on that system.

01:37:22.119 --> 01:37:33.769
And so we recognized that the side mounted
tank was going to be a much more economical

01:37:33.769 --> 01:37:34.869
system.

01:37:34.869 --> 01:37:38.579
So we had to worry about ice and foam.

01:37:38.579 --> 01:37:42.110
And so we had a lot of discussion with Martin
Company at that time.

01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:44.630
I think we did a lot of work down at Marshall,
too.

01:37:44.630 --> 01:37:46.219
COHEN: That's a very good question.

01:37:46.219 --> 01:37:52.210
In fact, I will try to develop some of that
thought process as we go along.

01:37:52.210 --> 01:37:56.800
The key point to make is the following.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:04.480
Should we have challenged the requirements?
Making the orbiter so big with the payload

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:08.539
base so big, it was very difficult to put
that on top.

01:38:08.539 --> 01:38:10.850
If you made it smaller you could.

01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:13.980
The real question, I think, and I was going
to ask Dale this question which is a follow-up

01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:22.840
to yours, should NASA, once OMB and the White
House gave a cost constraint and once we had

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:26.679
the change in the Air Force requirements,
should NASA had said no, we don't want to

01:38:26.679 --> 01:38:34.489
do it? And that is really a very fundamental
issue in terms of understanding your requirements,

01:38:34.489 --> 01:38:39.180
because the requirements drove the 14-day
turnaround time, the fact that you wanted

01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:44.270
large payloads, you wanted to get to the payloads,
put the orbiter where it was.

01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:49.880
The fact that you needed a high-performance
engine and a lot of payload in orbit said

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:54.460
that you needed a liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen
engine to get the highest specific impulse

01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:56.480
to get the engine at highest performance.

01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:01.389
All that added together, the thermal protection
system was basically a glass house which was

01:39:01.389 --> 01:39:05.130
incompatible with material coming off the
tank.

01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:11.460
So there was some, you might say, incompatibilities
and requirements.

01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:14.230
And the question is should we have challenged
those requirements more strongly? That's really

01:39:14.230 --> 01:39:15.230
the fundamental question.

01:39:15.230 --> 01:39:16.230
I don't think we should of.

01:39:16.230 --> 01:39:19.539
But let me ask Dale because it would say what
you would have done with the orbiter.

01:39:19.539 --> 01:39:21.170
MYERS: I did.

01:39:21.170 --> 01:39:26.280
I challenged the requirements inside NASA.

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:31.730
I never challenged it with the military, but
I challenged it inside NASA with George Low

01:39:31.730 --> 01:39:33.320
and with Jim Fletcher.

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:40.860
And their conclusion was that we would not
have a Manned Space Flight program if we challenged

01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.980
the military requirements.

01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:46.210
And then the rest of it followed.

01:39:46.210 --> 01:39:48.280
HOFFMAN: But your question is a very, very
pertinent question.

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.280
MYERS: Yeah, it sure is.

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:51.150
HOFFMAN: It is a very key question in today's
environment.

01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:53.526
Of course, you are infinitely smarter after
it happens, but your point is very well taken.

01:39:53.526 --> 01:39:54.526
MAN: Do we have better systems engineering
tools now than we did in the `70s? And so,

01:39:54.526 --> 01:40:09.720
if you used today's tools to design the shuttle
then it would be better? MYERS: I think.

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:10.720
Well, of course.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:16.199
MAN: Would you have avoided cost overrun and
so on? MYERS: System engineering is better,

01:40:16.199 --> 01:40:17.550
yes.

01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:23.889
Cost estimation, I'm not so sure.

01:40:23.889 --> 01:40:29.230
We had the best guys in the country doing
cost estimations on the shuttle, but we missed

01:40:29.230 --> 01:40:35.300
it probably as much as anything else by just
not having those people understand the complexities

01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:37.710
of operating in space.

01:40:37.710 --> 01:40:43.940
And I think a lot more is known generally
now about the cost of operating in space.

01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:52.909
I think that the next try at a reduction in
cost for getting into space will be a much

01:40:52.909 --> 01:40:59.920
more significant activity, but I consider
cost estimation a part of system engineering.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:08.829
A lot of it is much better, some of it is
not, I think.

01:41:08.829 --> 01:41:11.930
COHEN: Well, just to follow-up a little bit.

01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:17.329
When we designed the orbiter, we didn't have
CAD/CAM systems.

01:41:17.329 --> 01:41:21.639
If you look in the aft end of the orbiter,
it is sort of like the hardest thing you have

01:41:21.639 --> 01:41:24.170
ever seen because we didn't have a computer-aided
design.

01:41:24.170 --> 01:41:28.739
If we had had that, we probably would have
done a much easier job in the aft end of the

01:41:28.739 --> 01:41:32.340
orbiter and in the mid fuselage and in the
cockpit.

01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:33.429
That is systems engineering.

01:41:33.429 --> 01:41:39.599
You today have much more valuable tools than
we had during the Apollo program and during

01:41:39.599 --> 01:41:43.699
the Shuttle program, but there still is a
lot of education you need in systems engineering.

01:41:43.699 --> 01:41:46.340
And I think Dr.

01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:51.659
Hoffman explained the famous triangle, cost,
schedule and performance.

01:41:51.659 --> 01:41:56.599
And that is a continued work in systems engineering.

01:41:56.599 --> 01:42:05.920
MYERS: And I always think of systems engineering
as the people who work across the system with

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:11.070
everybody in a real communication system.

01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:16.790
And it is that kind of communication that
does good system engineering.

01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:17.790
Tools are not.

01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:20.270
OK? Anything else? MAN: Could you talk a little
bit about the Astronaut Office and what they

01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:24.630
thought during these conversations? Were they
in favor of the recoverable fully piloted

01:42:24.630 --> 01:42:36.619
booster and what were their input on the risk
conversations? MYERS: Yeah.

01:42:36.619 --> 01:42:41.329
They were aware of it.

01:42:41.329 --> 01:42:47.190
We kept in touch all the way through the development
program, including the decisions not to have

01:42:47.190 --> 01:42:50.849
a launch abort system.

01:42:50.849 --> 01:42:56.690
And they all recognized there was risk in
the program, no question about it.

01:42:56.690 --> 01:42:57.690
Aaron, you were there.

01:42:57.690 --> 01:42:59.300
What about it? HOFFMAN: Well, you said it
right.

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.300
I think that's right.

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:05.119
They were part of the design and development
team and the requirements team, so they were

01:43:05.119 --> 01:43:06.179
very much in favor of it.

01:43:06.179 --> 01:43:09.800
Of course the big issue, which we will talk
more about, is escape systems.

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:11.349
And we will go into that a little bit.

01:43:11.349 --> 01:43:15.550
Why don't we have an escape system? And I'm
sure when Chris Kraft comes you can ask him

01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:16.550
a lot of questions about that.

01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:20.829
I'm sure he will have a lot to say about it,
but a lot of us will talk about that.

01:43:20.829 --> 01:43:27.730
I think the astronauts were very much a part
of the design, the development, the requirements

01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:28.730
in this phase of the program.

01:43:28.730 --> 01:43:32.320
So they were very much a part of it.

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:36.739
MYERS: They weren't too much in favor of an
automatic landing system.

01:43:36.739 --> 01:43:41.090
HOFFMAN: That's right.

01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:49.800
MAN: That was my next question.

01:43:49.800 --> 01:44:06.809
MAN: [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] When does it
appear clearly that the Space Shuttle was

01:44:06.809 --> 01:44:15.480
not a low-cost access to space, or was it
already too late to change the program or

01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:28.750
requirements? MYERS: I think the problem was
that we never got up to flight rate.

01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:33.670
There were payloads waiting for us but we
never got to flight rate.

01:44:33.670 --> 01:44:39.489
And, if we had gotten to a higher flight rate,
operational costs would have been lower.

01:44:39.489 --> 01:44:44.580
Not enough lower because, no matter what we
would do, we never would have met our original

01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:46.789
estimates on operational costs.

01:44:46.789 --> 01:44:58.360
But, as you saw by that inflation story that
I had, costs today would be enormously higher

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:04.679
than that $10 million estimate that we had
in 1970 just because of inflation.

01:45:04.679 --> 01:45:10.019
But we never got flight rate so we didn't
ever get to the lower cost.

01:45:10.019 --> 01:45:17.280
And, in the early days, I wasn't there, but
it appears to me there was a lot of pressure

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:23.920
to get that flight rate up so that the cost
per flight would come down.

01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:31.800
And that pressure got to be instilled into
the people at NASA and the industry to where

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:37.719
the decision made on that cold day in January,
or whatever it was, on the Challenger.

01:45:37.719 --> 01:45:44.369
Even though there was evidence that those
O links had leaked in previous flights, the

01:45:44.369 --> 01:45:46.179
decision was made to launch.

01:45:46.179 --> 01:45:55.320
Now, that is a management policy issue associated
with trying to reduce the cost of flight.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:59.039
And so that was a bad decision.

01:45:59.039 --> 01:46:07.989
Anything else? HOFFMAN: I will say one other
thing on cost per flight.

01:46:07.989 --> 01:46:15.400
You have to realize when you're dealing with
a reusable system it is hard to specify exactly

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:18.989
what you even mean by the cost of the flight.

01:46:18.989 --> 01:46:24.829
You can take the total amount of money you
spend on the shuttle program every year and

01:46:24.829 --> 01:46:26.429
divide that by the number of flights.

01:46:26.429 --> 01:46:29.941
Well, this year we only had one flight which
came to a pretty high cost.

01:46:29.941 --> 01:46:31.590
And last year the cost was infinite.

01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:40.139
On the other hand, you can look at what is
the cost of flying six flights a year versus

01:46:40.139 --> 01:46:43.099
what is the cost of flying seven flights a
year.

01:46:43.099 --> 01:46:48.980
And that is what you would call in economics
the incremental cost of a flight.

01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:53.750
Also, you have to realize that in the cost
of the flight there are an awful lot of things

01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:54.920
that are wrapped up.

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:56.440
Not just the cost of the shuttle itself but
all of the mission operations, the flight

01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:02.010
planning that has to be carried out.

01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:09.429
There was one flight, a space lab flight I
think back in the `80s where they launched

01:47:09.429 --> 01:47:13.869
the space lab mission, it was supposed to
be a two-week mission, but they had fuel cell

01:47:13.869 --> 01:47:17.849
problem so they had to come back after four
days.

01:47:17.849 --> 01:47:24.840
And, in order to give the scientists the opportunity
to get their flight data, they rescheduled

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.719
the flight for a few months later.

01:47:27.719 --> 01:47:34.579
So they had the same crew, they had the same
flight plan so they didn't have all of the

01:47:34.579 --> 01:47:41.550
expenses, the paperwork expenses, the training,
all of the re-planning and the experiments

01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:43.110
were the same.

01:47:43.110 --> 01:47:46.519
It was the least expensive flight that we
possibly could have run.

01:47:46.519 --> 01:47:57.420
And, at the time, the estimates were that
that actually cost NASA probably about $120

01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:58.840
million.

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:07.160
That was kind of the barebones estimate of
the incremental cost of a shuttle flight.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:13.639
And then it can go from there all the way
up to billions of dollars if you just take

01:48:13.639 --> 01:48:16.150
one flight a year like we have this year.

01:48:16.150 --> 01:48:21.429
COHEN: Well, the other thought, too, I remember
going up to see Dale Myers when he was Associate

01:48:21.429 --> 01:48:24.650
Administrator for Manned Space Flight and
I was the Orbiter Project Manager.

01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:26.369
As he pointed out, we had four computers.

01:48:26.369 --> 01:48:32.030
The original thought is if one computer went
out on the ground we would lift off with three

01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:33.059
computers.

01:48:33.059 --> 01:48:34.489
And that's what we talked about.

01:48:34.489 --> 01:48:36.190
Well, of course, that never happened.

01:48:36.190 --> 01:48:38.440
I mean, not only that, we have five computers
now.

01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.739
We actually have a fifth computer which is
a backup computer.

01:48:42.739 --> 01:48:50.320
So things change, environments change, and
we were going to do very routine payloads.

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:53.989
We were going to take it up, launch a payload
and come back down, just very routine payloads.

01:48:53.989 --> 01:48:56.590
Almost every payload today is different.

01:48:56.590 --> 01:49:02.099
And it does take that large amount of infrastructure
to get that.

01:49:02.099 --> 01:49:08.980
MYERS: One of the cost elements in our cost-effectiveness
study was a reduction in the cost of scientific

01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:14.679
payloads because we were going to have sort
of a boilerplate bus.

01:49:14.679 --> 01:49:22.769
A heavy, rugged bus that had power and communications.

01:49:22.769 --> 01:49:29.880
And the scientists would bring their experiments
to this bus, put it on this standard vehicle,

01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.699
take it into orbit, launch or keep it, depending
on what the experiment was, then bring it

01:49:34.699 --> 01:49:35.699
back.

01:49:35.699 --> 01:49:40.550
And we were going to have this standard bus
that was going to be one of the big improvements

01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:42.889
in cost of the science payloads.

01:49:42.889 --> 01:49:48.519
So we showed a reduction in the cost of scientific
activity in our cost-effectiveness studies.

01:49:48.519 --> 01:49:49.519
That never happened.

01:49:49.519 --> 01:49:53.770
The science guys never could accept the idea
of an independent bus.

01:49:53.770 --> 01:50:01.160
HOFFMAN: We could go on talking for a long
time, but it is the end of the class.

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:03.489
Let's thank Dale Myers again.

01:50:03.489 --> 01:50:05.360
[APPLAUSE] MYERS: Thank you.

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:06.760
I enjoyed it.

01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:11.219
HOFFMAN: So send me your bios and have a good
weekend and see you next Tuesday.
