00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.500
Let's get started.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.930
Again, just putting things in perspective,
Professor Cohen talked about how in a big

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.110
engineering design project you work through
the various stages.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.290
And the first stage is phase A where you come
up with the basic concepts.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:36.570
And I think the level of detail of the system
and subsystem lectures that he is giving,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.420
last lecture and today, we could sort of look
at as being on kind of the phase A level to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.960
show the basic feasibility and the overall
structure.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:56.620
Those of you from aero-astro have certainly
been familiar with our approach to systems

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.930
engineering which we call CDIO.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:11.000
Someone from aero-astro can tell me the C
is conceive, design, implement, which actually

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.390
means manufacture and test, and operate.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.380
So we're kind of dealing in these first few
lectures.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.960
And this could be looked at as phase A and
then the detailed design, that's your phase

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.670
B.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.290
That ends with the critical design review
after which, in principle, you're supposed

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.570
to be ready to cut hardware.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.329
And then you get into the phase CD where you
actually build and test.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.149
And then, of course, we operate.

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.640
My sort of background, the way I got into
engineering, and I probably should have mentioned

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.039
this at the beginning as sort of truth in
advertising is I was never trained as an engineer,

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.039
unlike Professor Cohen.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.940
I was actually trained as an astrophysicist.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.039
But, when I went to NASA, I spent so much
time working with all the technical systems

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.979
and interacting with the engineers and the
people who use them that I learned certainly

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.750
a lot about the way these systems are designed
and particularly operated.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.860
So my approach to a lot of these engineering
situations is very much from an operator's

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.860
point of view.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.240
And I will try to emphasize that as we go
along.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.980
Very important, right from the beginning of
the design, I think that you think about how

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.570
you're going to operate the system.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.670
We have had too many examples that I've come
across and many people who have to actually

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.270
operate systems where you build something
without really thinking of how the system

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.870
is going to be maintained and taken care of.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.550
One of the things that we have been doing
for the last few years is to take a group

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.430
of undergraduates down to the Kennedy Space
Center every January, an interim activities

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.590
period, and have them spend a couple of weeks
with the engineers and technicians who have

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.950
to maintain and operate the shuttle system.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.190
And they hear lots of stories from the engineers
and particularly from the technicians who

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.960
say, boy, I would like to have a chance to
talk to the person who designed this little

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960
system.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.700
And I have to get my hand all the way around.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.430
And it takes five hours to turn the bolt or
something more fundamental.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.630
And we will probably discuss this when we
talk about the main engines.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.870
The fact that originally the main engines
were supposed to be reusable without being

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.620
taken out of the shuttle so that you could
cycle them many times.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.690
Well, it turns out that in order to get sufficient
confidence that the engines are ready to fly,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.430
we really do have to take them out after every
flight.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.410
And they are extensively borescoped when you
look inside.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.970
But some of the engineers in the main engine
shop pointed out that, for instance, if certain

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.550
diagnostic test equipment had been built into
the engine so that you could have taken data

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.500
as the engines were shutting down over and
above the data that we actually get, possibly

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.130
we would have been able to reduce considerably
the maintenance on those engines.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.610
Again, the shuttle was the first time we had
really tried to design reusability into a

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.990
space vehicle and engines.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.289
And we've learned an awful lot.

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:40.349
So I think it's very important when we discuss
the systems in the course of the term that

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:45.280
we don't just look at the detailed design
but we also consider the operations.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.360
That's very important.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:58.460
In that spirit, Professor Cohen is going to
continue his introduction to the shuttle systems.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.610
And, Aaron, I will turn it over to you.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.610
OK.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.610
Thank you.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.569
As Professor Hoffman said, I'm really giving
you what I would call a technical management

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:17.840
overview because, when we talk about structures,
on the 22nd Mr.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.770
Moser is going to come and talk about structures
and he's really going to go into the details,

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.219
how the loads were calculated, how the stressors
were calculated, how NASTRAN was used, how

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.780
we came up with the basic structure.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.360
But I'm just going to really give you sort
of an overview on it.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.920
And I think it's interesting to note that
the structures may be a very good system to

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.219
look at for your project because it weighs
a lot.

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:55.039
We certainly didn't have all the tools for
calculations that you have today to make it

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:56.699
a more efficient structure.

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.650
The materials are a lot different.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.110
But basically this structure, if you start
at the front of it, the crew cabin, which

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.590
I showed you a little bit about being made,
a welded configuration, and the forward fuselage

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.570
are basically an aluminum skin-stringer structure,
very basic aluminum.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:22.800
If you go back down to the mid-fuselage, which
is the large part there, it's, again, a skinned

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.800
structure.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.330
Interestingly enough, the forward fuselage
and the crew cabin where made by Rockwell

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.529
International in Downey.

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:35.680
The mid-fuselage was made by General Dynamics
in San Diego.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.460
So we had various people putting the structure
parts together.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.560
The wings were made by Grumman.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.370
So we had this vehicle being built all over
the country coming to Palmdale, California

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.090
for assembly.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.629
And the aft thrust structure was built by
Rockwell.

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:56.500
The vertical tail, I believe, was built by
Fairchild on Long Island.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.020
Some of these places don't exist anymore.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.199
But then you go back to the vertical tail.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:08.320
Again, it is machined skins with honeycomb.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.529
The aft fuselage, as you can see, is very
complicated.

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:18.169
It has all the plumbing, all the wiring, all
the auxiliary power unit, so it is a maze

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:19.319
of plumbing and wiring.

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.759
You could get lost in there and they'd never
find you again.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.139
But it is a maze of wiring and plumbing.

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:27.740
And it's made basically of aluminum.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:37.770
But a lot of the support structure are boron/aluminum
thrust structure panels with graphite epoxy

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.439
skin panels.

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:47.590
And then the payload bay doors, which was
our innovative material going into large composites,

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:53.910
we use graphite epoxy, that was the first
time that really a large composite structure

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.180
was used in a vehicle.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:01.139
Now it's used quite commonly in the Air Force
and a lot of places, but graphite epoxy were

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:03.159
the panels we used.

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:04.159
And that saved a lot of weight.

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:10.660
One of the problems we had, though, was when
we built these panels we found we got moisture

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.660
trapped in it.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:18.500
And, of course, the moisture, when you heat
it up coming back it would pop the panels

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.500
off.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.430
So, on the pad, we had to go in and drill
little holes in these panels to be sure we

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.720
could get the moisture to escape.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.779
So those are things you learn when you do
new technologies.

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:32.180
But, as I said, Mr.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.520
Moser is going to go through a very detailed
explanation of this.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.070
This may be something you want to consider
because there could be a real innovative way

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:47.840
of reducing the weight and making the vehicle
more robust, so I suggest you think about

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.980
that for the structure.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.150
Now I'm going to talk a little bit about guidance,
navigation and control.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.410
And some people asked me yesterday where they
could find some information on it.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:05.211
Actually, in those orange or yellow books,
I've forgotten what color they are, that we

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:12.640
showed you that are on-hold in the library,
have a very detailed analysis and discussion

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.620
of how the guidance, navigation and control
system was formulated.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.810
And it is probably as good as you're going
to find.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.660
It was very early in the program.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:25.950
It's a little bit different than it is today,
but it's a very good description of the redundant

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.700
computer set, the fail-operational, fail-safe
system.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.880
So I think you could really get a lot out
of going through that book.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:40.260
I should just say it turns out that we have
two sets of those books in the library and

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.590
they are on reserve so you can only use them
for two hours at a time.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.880
There really should not be any problem with
everybody in the class having access to those

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.090
books when you need to go and look at them.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:57.020
That will probably be the best source, except
when Phil Hattis from the Draper Labs comes

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.890
and talks about the guidance system.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.900
I will talk a little bit more about that.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:09.020
This chart or this schematic or whatever you
want to call it was originated by the Johnson

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.380
Space Center and Rockwell International.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:17.810
It took us many hours but it basically is
the architecture, I am going to go through

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.700
it in some detail, for the guidance, navigation
and control system.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.420
Now, this was the original one.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.200
It is a little bit different today, and I
will explain the differences that we have,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:35.700
but this was basically the guidance, navigation
and control system main architecture.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.990
And you can see on the left side, and the
left side is what I would call sensors.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.830
First of all, in a very simplistic term, some
of your experts in guidance, navigation and

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:52.090
control, but guidance, navigation and control,
navigation is actually determining where you

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.770
are, guidance is getting to where you want
to go and control is controlling the vehicle

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.720
and its stability and its characteristics
around the center of gravity.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.490
So that's basically control.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.420
This is for the total guidance, navigation
and control system.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:14.750
Interestingly enough, the contractor for this
was IBM Federal Systems Division.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.780
We used their computer and they did the software.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:26.310
Much of the hardware was designed and built
by other contractors, and Rockwell International

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.310
basically did the integration.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:34.890
And they did the integration on a system called
the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:40.220
It was basically a vehicle that was in the
laboratory that had all the electronics, the

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.440
cockpit and everything in it.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.900
It simulated the actuators.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.510
The hydraulic system was simulated and the
engines were simulated, but basically all

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.890
the hardware and software was in the Shuttle
Avionics Integration Laboratory.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.480
I imagine you spent some time.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.080
We actually had two.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.060
We had one in Houston and there was one out
at Rockwell.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:03.300
And, when Professor Cohen says that it was
a vehicle, you have to appreciate that it

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.780
was actually laid out just like the shuttle
so that they had the controllers, which were

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:16.660
in the aft end, like in the engine compartment,
were a hundred feet away from the crew cabin

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:23.470
and the computers and all the lines, the data
and power lines were laid out as closely as

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:29.170
possible to physically duplicate the layout
in the shuttle because there was concern about

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.060
the timing of signals going back and forth.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:38.030
And they wanted to run the simulation as accurately
as possible.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:44.170
And then, of course, you have to have a set
of simulation computers to try to determine

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:49.600
the environment that the shuttle would be
flying in so that it could make the inputs

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.540
to the rate gyros and the other parts of the
measurement units to try to duplicate the

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.020
flight regime.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:05.310
And here is an explanation of the alphabet
soup of all the systems, subsystems, components.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.440
On this side you see really the sensors.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:18.320
That's the information that you need to do
your navigation part of it.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.950
And then, of course, that information then
is sent to the computer through a multiplexer

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:30.370
demultiplexer, MDM, which basically is an
analog to digital converter, digital to analog

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.370
converter.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:38.640
The computer does its computations and then
sends it to the effectors which actually change,

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.120
whether it's the RCS, reaction control system,
whether it's the orbital maneuvering system,

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.671
whether it's the aerosurfaces, the SRB actuators,
the solid rocket booster actuators, the main

00:13:46.671 --> 00:13:48.300
propulsion system actuators.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.890
So you've got sensors, computation and effectors.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:59.320
Let me talk a little bit about one sensor
which probably many of you can relate to,

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.610
and that's the IMU or the inertial measurement
unit.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.730
And Draper Labs is famous for its inertial
measurement units.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:14.760
I worked with Draper Labs or MIT Instrumentation
Lab on Apollo, and we had the original initial

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.720
measurement developed by the MIT Instrumentation
Lab in that vehicle.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.230
The initial measurement unit has gyros on
it to determine angles and it has accelerometers

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.860
on it.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.420
And it is aligned with the star tracker.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.560
It's basically a stable platform.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.140
It's aligned with the star tracker to get
a reference system in inertial space.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.410
And when you make a maneuver you get acceleration
and you send it to the computer.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.110
And you integrate it once, you get velocity
and you integrate it twice and you get position.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:55.050
And it's also used during powered flight and
it's used during entry but that then goes

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.250
to the computer.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.170
So the inertial measurement unit is very critical.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:04.390
Just to give you an example, here you have
three of them and you have four computers.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.760
I'm going to talk about the computers in a
minute.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.160
You have three of them.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.530
You have to recognize when we went to the
moon on Apollo we had one IMU and one computer

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:18.540
in the Command and Service Module, and we
had one IMU and one computer in the Lunar

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.300
Module, except we did have a backup system
called a strap-down system.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:31.520
The primary system was built by Draper Labs,
MIT, and the backup system was TRW.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.570
So we had two different contractors.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:39.490
Then you have rate gyros and accelerometer
assemblies primarily for ascent, for the stability

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.880
of the bending of the vehicle.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.130
Here's the air data transducers that we talked
about yesterday for entry.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:52.110
Then you have the microwave landing system,
the tactical navigation, radar altimeter,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.550
rendezvous radar.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.760
These are all sensors you use during various
phases of a mission, which again go through

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:04.300
the MDMs or multiplexer demultiplexers to
the computers and then to the effectors which

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:11.430
change your position and velocity as need
be.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.760
Let me talk about the computers for a moment.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.900
You see four computers.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.670
That was the real test of this system.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.570
We had four computers that were synchronized.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:29.480
This vehicle, as we talked about yesterday,
for aerodynamicists we decided to make it

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.980
statically unstable.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.500
We saved a lot of weight.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.710
By that I mean a regular airplane, a normal
airplane that's stable.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.880
When you get a disturbance it will still come
back.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.730
Without any augmentation it will come back
to its original position.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.010
With this vehicle, if you get a disturbance
it will diverge.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.150
So you had to continually have augmentation.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:54.200
So you had to have a fail-operational, fail-safe
system.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.850
And that's why you have four computers.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:00.880
It's fail -operationa/ fail-safe You could
lose one computer and your fail-operational

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.880
will use another computer.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.430
That means you have two left.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.870
And you're fail-safe and you come home.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.340
So that's what it is.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.089
Now, the real concern about it is these computers
are synchronized.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:16.449
They essentially communicate with each other
440 times a second.

00:17:16.449 --> 00:17:21.870
Now, I'm recalling a lot of this from memory,
but 440 times a second.

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:27.250
And they actually vote on each other to simplistic
form terminology.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:32.049
And if one computer is out, it votes it out
and another computer takes over.

00:17:32.049 --> 00:17:33.600
Basically that's it.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:41.379
But the concern we had was that in doing this
we could have a generic failure and lose all

00:17:41.379 --> 00:17:46.850
computers or we could have what we call a
two on two split.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:51.470
And these would be sort of diabolical errors
which would cause the vehicle to fail.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:57.820
So we decided, after this was made, to put
in a backup flight system, a backup computer,

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.820
a fifth computer.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.090
Now, it turns out there was an argument there.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:07.090
Should we have the fifth computer a different
computer and different people or should we

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.429
have a same computer with different people?

00:18:10.429 --> 00:18:13.470
And we argued long and hard on how to do it.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.889
And we had a lot of experience with the Draper
Labs.

00:18:15.889 --> 00:18:18.330
The Draper Labs just did an outstanding job.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.950
The MIT Instrumentation Lab just did an outstanding
job on the Apollo vehicle, both on the Command

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.610
and Service module and Lunar module.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:30.659
We went to the MIT Instrumentation Lab, Draper
Labs, and asked them to actually take the

00:18:30.659 --> 00:18:34.830
same computer but put it outside the loop.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.419
It's not part of the redundant set.

00:18:37.419 --> 00:18:38.720
It's outside the loop.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.940
I didn't show the schematic right because
it gets all the same information that the

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:48.830
other computers get, but it then can take
over if the primary system fails.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:55.769
Now, Phil Hattis did this work for the Draper
Labs, for NASA in this backup system.

00:18:55.769 --> 00:18:57.970
He's going to give you a lecture.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.820
He's very good to lecture on this total system.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.200
He can tell you about the total system.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.870
We thought we'd put the backup flight system
in just for a short period of time to give

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:11.120
us confidence in the primary system, but it
turns out that we started putting things in

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.270
it that now we needed so we could not take
it out.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.390
So, it's really part of the major system.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:21.159
That is a very different part of the system
today.

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:26.420
I don't think we ever really had a diabolical
problem in flight.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.590
I think we did have one in the Shuttle Avionics
Integration Laboratory one time when we had

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.230
a two on two split.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:37.690
But when we did the approach and landing test
where we had the Orbiter on top of the 747

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.919
and we separated the Orbiter and landed, I
remember that first flight, I was sitting

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:47.870
in the Control Station at Edwards Air Force
Base, and at that time I smoked a pipe, and

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:52.890
when we separated a big X came across the
screen because we lost the first computer.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.049
I guess the shock actually broke a solder
joint in the computer.

00:19:57.049 --> 00:20:02.020
The power shock from separating actually broke
the first computer so we had to go to the

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.020
second computer.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.020
I bit my pipe in two.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:09.160
But it did prove that the redundant set did
work because it took over and landed.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:16.340
We had a very successful in-flight test, not
planned, but it turned out to be a very successful

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.580
in-flight test.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:26.730
Now, when you make the computations, you get
the information on position that the computer

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:38.529
computes, it sends it to 
the effectors.

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:43.179
The effectors, during the high part of entry,
may be to the reaction control system, the

00:20:43.179 --> 00:20:50.389
forward RCS system or to the aft, or it could
be to the OMS systems if you're trying to

00:20:50.389 --> 00:20:51.440
make a maneuver.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:57.559
Or, when you get down lower in the atmosphere,
it could be the aerosurface actuators.

00:20:57.559 --> 00:21:02.820
And then, during ascent, it's to the solid
rocket boosters or the main propulsion system.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.960
So, those are the effectors.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.799
The flight control system is a very interesting
system for entry because, as you can envision

00:21:11.799 --> 00:21:18.610
early in the entry you don't have any aerodynamics
so your aerosurfaces aren't of any value to

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.450
you, you use the reaction control system.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:25.200
But, as you get farther into the atmosphere,
the loads become so high that the reaction

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.279
control system becomes ineffective and then
you have to use the aerosurfaces.

00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:30.129
So it's a blended system.

00:21:30.129 --> 00:21:35.820
And the system has to know when to handle
the aerosurfaces versus the reaction control

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.820
system.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:43.080
And, of course, then you also have displays
to the crew and actually information that

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.850
the crew could use to make certain decisions.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:50.279
So that basically is the guidance, navigation
and control system.

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:55.619
There is one additional change, that I don't
have on this chart, which they have incorporated

00:21:55.619 --> 00:21:58.510
the global positioning system in the shuttle.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.860
The GPS is now part of the system.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:07.119
It took a long time to do it because I remember
it wasn't done when I left.

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:10.779
And were you still there when it was implemented?

00:22:10.779 --> 00:22:13.480
Yeah, they did put it in.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.840
And GPS you can essentially get position.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:27.660
If you could get attitude then theoretically
you could eliminate the inertial measurement.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.360
And I don't think they do it that way.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:37.160
But theoretically, the GPS, for you looking
at the guidance system change, this again

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.639
becomes a very interesting system to look
at.

00:22:41.639 --> 00:22:42.860
Would you do it different today?

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:52.570
For example, the computer that was used, I
cannot remember all the characteristics of

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.899
it, but it's basically the IBM 4 Pi computer,
which is a very old computer.

00:22:55.899 --> 00:22:59.629
It was probably made before many of you were
using computers.

00:22:59.629 --> 00:23:00.679
Or, weren't born.

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:06.770
[OVERLAPPING VOICES] which I think was a design
from the early `70s.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.799
Yeah, it is the early `70s.

00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:14.690
This would be a very neat system to take a
look at for your system.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.299
Not only that, you could probably get a lot
of support from Draper Labs and that type

00:23:17.299 --> 00:23:18.299
of thing.

00:23:18.299 --> 00:23:19.539
So it would really be a good system to take
a look at.

00:23:19.539 --> 00:23:21.860
And I'm sure you could make a lot of improvements.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:28.899
Those improvements could theoretically be
used on the new CEV, the crew exploration

00:23:28.899 --> 00:23:29.899
vehicle.

00:23:29.899 --> 00:23:36.179
I think it would land a lot of merit of you
very smart people to take a look at the guidance,

00:23:36.179 --> 00:23:37.269
navigation and control system.

00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:38.269
Yes, sir.

00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:43.470
In the air data transducers, were there more
than just torpedo tubes and static cords?

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:44.879
That's all there was, I believe.

00:23:44.879 --> 00:23:46.440
I think that was.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.440
We had a lot of problems with those.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.200
I think it's just very old technology.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.320
Yes.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:24:04.769
I was going to ask, how you got position information
before GPS.

00:24:04.769 --> 00:24:05.769
Position?

00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:08.309
Well, I don't know exactly.

00:24:08.309 --> 00:24:12.009
But it's got 13 satellites going around.

00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:15.149
Well, there were two ways.

00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:20.590
I mean the desire for GPS, of course, was
to give the shuttle autonomous navigation

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.049
capability.

00:24:22.049 --> 00:24:28.549
The shuttle with the star trackers and the
IMUs, it has the autonomous ability to determine

00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:32.989
its attitude, but it doesn't know where it
is because the inertial measurement units

00:24:32.989 --> 00:24:34.799
drift over time.

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:38.980
And so you need to be able to update the state
vectors.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.600
Originally, the only way you could do it was
radar tracking from the ground.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.989
You would track it.

00:24:44.989 --> 00:24:46.140
You would get a state vector.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.450
You would uplink the state vector and then
the shuttle would know where it was.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:53.950
And then periodically you would have to update
it because of IMU drift.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:25:03.039
Once we got the tracking and data relay satellite
system installed, you do get navigational

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:09.419
information by the Doppler navigation and
from the signals coming back and forth through

00:25:09.419 --> 00:25:12.549
TDRSS, but it was generally calculated on
the ground.

00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:21.070
So it was not really until the advent of GPS
that we got autonomous capability.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:26.929
You need it for things like if you're going
to deploy a satellite, for instance, you need

00:25:26.929 --> 00:25:31.369
to know your position pretty accurately.

00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:36.580
Because the satellite is going to take that
position and has to do its burn accordingly.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:44.600
And, obviously, for your reentry burn or for
rendezvous it's critical that you know your

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.600
position.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.169
When you're doing a rendezvous, the shuttle
does have a rendezvous radar.

00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:52.779
I don't know if we'll deal with that in detail.

00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:57.830
Once you get close enough to the object that
you're rendezvousing with such that you can

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.559
get it either with your radar, or they actually
use the star trackers to optically track the

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:07.440
object, then you can start getting your relative
position with respect to the object, Even

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.179
though you may not know your absolute position.

00:26:10.179 --> 00:26:14.860
And so, from that point of view, the shuttle
gets a certain degree of autonomy.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:21.230
Maybe I'll just say one other thing about
the computers because people are amazed at

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.710
how primitive the shuttle computers are.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:29.049
But, like I say, the original idea and the
concepts that we talked about, this was going

00:26:29.049 --> 00:26:31.860
to be an airplane-like vehicle.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.749
And originally they wanted to use some off-the-shelf
hardware.

00:26:35.749 --> 00:26:41.179
And, of course, the AP-101s, as they finally
used them, were not off the shelf.

00:26:41.179 --> 00:26:48.499
But these original computers had 128k of memory.

00:26:48.499 --> 00:26:53.850
And the memory they used, I don't know if
any of you have read back in the history of

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:58.309
computing where they actually had the little
magnetic ring cores with the wires going through.

00:26:58.309 --> 00:27:00.489
I mean this was really old stuff.

00:27:00.489 --> 00:27:06.299
And they did finally replace that with a solid-state
memory with a whopping 256k.

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:13.649
And, again, probably none of you have dealt
with overlay technology but, back when I was

00:27:13.649 --> 00:27:19.790
a graduate student and we were using computers
to do complex astrophysical calculations,

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:25.660
sometimes you would have a program that was
too big for the computer memory so you would

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.450
have the whole program on a tape recorder
and you'd segment it into what they would

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.450
call overlays.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.940
And then you would load it one part at a time
and it would do its calculations.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.539
And then you would stop and load the next
batch of software.

00:27:38.539 --> 00:27:40.700
Well, that's the way we have to run a mission.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:47.149
The computers cannot hold enough software
to do ascent, orbit and entry.

00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:50.150
There are three segments of flight software.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.299
You start the mission with the ascent software
loaded.

00:27:53.299 --> 00:27:58.409
Then, when you get up into orbit, you do what
they call a major mode transition where you

00:27:58.409 --> 00:28:02.369
basically punch a button and everything goes
blank.

00:28:02.369 --> 00:28:06.700
And you sort of sit there saying I hope this
is going to load properly.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.380
And the tape recorder chugs away.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.779
And then it loads the orbit part.

00:28:13.779 --> 00:28:15.999
And the same thing when you're getting ready
for entry.

00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:21.019
Now, the backup system they decided that they
didn't want to take that risk.

00:28:21.019 --> 00:28:27.419
That if something went wrong in a major way
they wanted the whole flight software on the

00:28:27.419 --> 00:28:28.419
backup system.

00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:30.489
And that meant it had to be scrubbed.

00:28:30.489 --> 00:28:36.289
The backup system is capable of flying the
shuttle and getting it home safely, but there

00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:43.899
are a lot of capabilities which the main computer
system can do which the backup system cannot

00:28:43.899 --> 00:28:47.870
do just because they're limited to the amount
of software.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:55.590
The one other thing I'll say is putting together
this redundant set of four computers because,

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.690
as Professor Cohen said, the shuttle will
not fly without the computers.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.840
I mean it's absolutely flight critical.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:10.440
Hundreds of times a second, every computer
is looking at the data from all the other

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.440
computers.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.090
And they are all voting.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:19.830
And so you have this matrix, just to make
sure you understand the way the system works.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:26.659
If computer number one sees a problem with
computer number three, it's likely that computer

00:29:26.659 --> 00:29:33.059
three is also going to see a problem with
computer one because they're doing something

00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:34.059
different.

00:29:34.059 --> 00:29:38.750
But if computer number two sees a problem
with computer three and computer three sees

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:43.119
a problem with computer two and computer four
sees a problem with computer three, now you've

00:29:43.119 --> 00:29:44.889
got a three to one vote.

00:29:44.889 --> 00:29:53.539
And so computer three will recognize that
it is the problem and it will take itself

00:29:53.539 --> 00:29:54.850
out of the set.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.409
And that's what happened, well, in that case,
the computer actually shut down.

00:29:58.409 --> 00:30:00.210
I remember that big X.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.450
I bit my pipe in two.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:09.710
And, at the same time, all of this information
has to go back and forth to the backup computer.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:14.119
Because, if you're ever going to engage the
backup computer, it has to be ready to go

00:30:14.119 --> 00:30:17.139
at a split second's notice.

00:30:17.139 --> 00:30:26.749
And there are situations where you can get
a two on two split.

00:30:26.749 --> 00:30:32.940
When we run through the simulations to learn
how to work this, actually learning the ins

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:39.119
and outs of how to work the computer system
is probably one of the biggest trainings.

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:42.159
The astronauts become more knowledgeable than
the designers.

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:43.159
Yes?

00:30:43.159 --> 00:30:52.080
If there is this danger of a two to two vote,
was it ever thought about to have five computers

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.080
then?

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.450
Well, that's why we put the backup system
in.

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:55.989
Oh, the backup system.

00:30:55.989 --> 00:30:56.989
Yeah, the backup system.

00:30:56.989 --> 00:30:59.820
That was why we put the backup system in.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.649
It did a little bit more, too.

00:31:02.649 --> 00:31:04.120
It was programmed by different people.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.739
Even though it used the same computer, it
was actually programmed and formulated by

00:31:08.739 --> 00:31:09.740
different people.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:15.869
So, that was one way of saying take away any,
you might say, systematic errors that were

00:31:15.869 --> 00:31:16.869
in the redundant set.

00:31:16.869 --> 00:31:23.669
In other words, they kept the same software
requirements document but the actual coding

00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:26.960
was done by Draper rather than by IBM.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.570
That was the other problem.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:34.369
Suppose all four computers are doing the same
thing but there was an error in the code which

00:31:34.369 --> 00:31:41.039
never turned out so that something starts
to diverge, what's your protection against

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:42.039
that?

00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:44.919
There was a big argument in doing that.

00:31:44.919 --> 00:31:48.539
The real argument said should you really have
this or a different computer?

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:50.359
Should you really just say just do everything
differently?

00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:51.590
Just have a different computer?

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.590
A different everything?

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:56.710
And, of course, there are advantages to that
and there are disadvantages to that.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.070
So, we settled on this.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.070
I think there was another question.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.070
Was there a question back there?

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.070
Yes?

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.679
You said this was the first fly-by-wire system.

00:32:04.679 --> 00:32:13.850
I was wondering what competing ideas there
were besides having [four computer systems?].

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:21.331
Well, fly-by-wire means when you put an input
into the control system, whether you do it

00:32:21.331 --> 00:32:28.700
manually or whether the computer does it,
nevertheless, ultimately your command just

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.649
goes into the computer.

00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:37.659
You put the stick to the left saying I want
to do a left bank, all you're doing is telling

00:32:37.659 --> 00:32:39.740
the computer you want to do a left bank.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:46.220
And now the computer has to figure out what's
my navigation state, where am I if I'm coming

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:52.679
down through the atmosphere, what's my altitude,
what's the air pressure, what's my mach number?

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:56.809
And then it's programmed with aerodynamic
control laws.

00:32:56.809 --> 00:32:58.960
This is one of the big challenges.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:05.960
Because, as I mentioned the other day, you
hit the top of the atmosphere at mach 25,

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.769
you do your initial control with the RCS.

00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:19.239
As the dynamic pressure starts to increase,
first the ailerons, the roll becomes active

00:33:19.239 --> 00:33:25.549
at about, I think, ten pounds per square inch,
something like that.

00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:29.369
You blend the roll control into your aerosurfaces.

00:33:29.369 --> 00:33:34.869
At about 20, I think it's pounds per square
inch, you can do the pitch control.

00:33:34.869 --> 00:33:40.999
But because the shuttle is coming in at a
40 degree angle, the vertical stabilizer is

00:33:40.999 --> 00:33:44.049
pretty much shadowed.

00:33:44.049 --> 00:33:50.049
So for yaw control you actually have to keep
using the RCS all the way down to about mach

00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:55.481
one when the shuttle finally pitches down
and the vertical stabilizer now has some effectivity.

00:33:55.481 --> 00:34:06.160
The computer calculates all this information
and it comes to the effectors, and you do

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.461
the control laws on that.

00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:14.409
And the problem is that the flight control
laws, which the computer has to use in order

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:19.480
to control the air surfaces in the RCS, are
not constant on your way down.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:28.659
I mean the flight control laws at mach 15
are very different from at mach 5.

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:34.869
And there is part of the flight regime, for
instance, where if you want do a left bank,

00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:38.649
you actually have to start by commanding a
right yaw.

00:34:38.649 --> 00:34:46.020
And then the cross-coupling terms in the aerodynamics
actually causes you to go in the other direction.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.020
It gets very complex.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:53.640
And the flight control system is continually
changing as the entry progresses.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:35:03.339
And so the idea that maybe you should have
a direct backup link between the pilot's inputs

00:35:03.339 --> 00:35:10.400
and the aerocontrol surfaces, although it
might give you a warm, fuzzy feeling, you

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.859
could not fly the shuttle directly.

00:35:12.859 --> 00:35:19.551
Because to be able to take into account these
change in control laws on the way down, you

00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:20.551
just cannot do it.

00:35:20.551 --> 00:35:26.200
In fact, the shuttle is uniquely, I mean,
unless the shuttle knows where it is, if the

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:31.780
navigation state goes bad the shuttle cannot
fly.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:39.349
You could have the runway in sight, but if
the shuttle's inertial nav state is wrong

00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:41.180
you will lose control and you cannot land.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:45.130
So it's a very complex system from that point
of view.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:49.260
This is a very, very, if you can envision
the systems engineering that went into this

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:56.460
system, it takes aeordynamics, it takes flight
dynamics, it takes electrical signals, it

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.339
takes guidance laws, navigation laws, hardware,
software.

00:36:01.339 --> 00:36:07.690
This is probably the biggest integration job,
or systems engineering job.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:09.170
It requires everything.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.400
It also has to take into consideration aerodynamic
heating.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.369
I'm going to show you that in a minute, because
you've got to be sure that you don't fly outside

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:17.990
the regime that you were designed for aerodynamically.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.230
I think you had a question.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.460
Just real quick, how big are those IMUs?

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.960
Because nowadays you can get a solid-state
one not quite that big.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.210
Well, I don't recall.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.230
It's a box, sort of like a shoebox.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.640
The Apollo IMU was about this big.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.170
That was built for the Polaris vehicle.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.660
It was one IMU and it was a three gimble platform.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.500
And I remember it was a big issue.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:44.160
A three gimble platform has a singularity,
so you had to maneuver the Apollo vehicle

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.160
a certain way so you didn't get the singularity
in it.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.829
And one of our astronauts, Jim McDivitt, quite
a famous astronaut who was a good friend of

00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:54.619
mine, said he wanted a fourth gimble.

00:36:54.619 --> 00:36:58.610
And there was no way we could get an IMU in
that day in time with a fourth gimble.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:02.349
So, what I did was gave him a fourth gimble
to carry with him on his flight.

00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:05.440
A little gimble system so he had a fourth
gimble.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.520
We didn't have the gimble lock problem on
the shuttle because it was a four gimble platform.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.890
But I remember we went through that with MIT
Instrumentation many times because all you

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:19.369
could get at that time, because the IMUs were
so big, a fourth gimble was almost impossible.

00:37:19.369 --> 00:37:22.980
And McDivitt was a very good astronaut but
he wanted the four gimbles.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.700
In fact, he wound up being my boss.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:30.940
Before we go on, let me just mention one more
thing about the backup system.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:31.940
Sure.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:32.940
Go ahead.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.400
The backup system actually takes a lot of
care and maintenance and there's a lot of

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.640
money that goes into that.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.940
And this is not a dead issue because in the
design of the CEV, NASA is going to have to

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.600
make a decision.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:50.010
There were some guidelines which were produced
a couple of years ago out of the Johnson Space

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:55.190
Center with a lot of astronaut office input
about what are the requirements in the future

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.589
for human space vehicles?

00:37:58.589 --> 00:38:03.550
And they put in that you should have a backup
computer system because basically that's the

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:04.800
way we did the shuttle.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.750
And, actually, that was an afterthought.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.930
And yet now it's being listed as a requirement.

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:18.650
And this is now being questioned for the CEV
because it's a huge financial impact.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.930
And so we're going to have to deal with these
problems all over again.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:26.000
It's an interesting thing to think about if
some of you want to delve a little bit more

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
deeply.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.780
I think this could lead to a very interesting
activity for you.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.780
Yes, sir.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.710
Do backup computers have their own sensor
or are they reading the same sensors?

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:36.710
The same sensors.

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:41.540
I just didn't show this very accurately because
I looked at the chart, when I had it, I said

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.920
my God this is the wrong chart.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.900
But this was the original chart before the
backup system so I quickly penciled in the

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.370
backup system so I would remember to talk
about it.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.609
But, no, it has the same sensors.

00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:50.869
It has all the same information.

00:38:50.869 --> 00:38:52.460
But, again, most of those sensors are redundant.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.380
Yeah, they're redundant sensors.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.610
Not all of them but most of them.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.490
Any one of the four computers can read any
of these sensors.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:01.750
It's not like sensor one is dedicated [to
this computer?].

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.060
The sensor input is put on a data bus, and
they have multiple data buses.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:10.000
Like four data buses in each of the computers
can read all four data buses.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.270
I mean there's just a tremendous amount of
redundancy built in.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.270
Yes, go ahead.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:18.450
Did they ever use the star tracker to update
your gyros?

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:19.450
The platform?

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:20.920
Yeah, they do that.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:26.520
There is also a procedure if you totally lose
attitude.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:31.640
Then you have to go right back and manually
take a star site and orient.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:37.120
And that we've only had to do in a simulator.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.950
To look at the failure history of this would
be very interesting.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.740
In my tenure, I know we lost one inertial
measurement unit.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.680
We lost that one computer during the approach
and landing test.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:53.720
I don't know what other failures we actually
had in this system.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:57.520
The MDMs, this box was made by Sperry at the
time in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:04.549
And I've visited that many times because that
is probably the most complicated electronics

00:40:04.549 --> 00:40:06.710
box of this whole system other than the computer.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:07.710
It's very, very complicated.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:08.710
Yes, sir.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:19.970
Computers have developed a lot faster so why
do you still think that it will be a major

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:20.970
expense now?

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.910
I don't think it will be a major expense now.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:29.130
As I recall, and you're absolutely right,
NASA does not put a lot of money into development

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.180
of this technology because other people have
done it.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.309
It's so much more sophisticated than we have
now.

00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:37.390
We don't need it.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:43.849
It turns out, though, at one point in time
structures was the most expensive component

00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:45.680
of a space craft.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.950
Then, of course, there was propulsion.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.940
And then there became avionics and software.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.779
And avionics and software for the shuttle
is very, very expensive.

00:40:52.779 --> 00:40:54.539
It's probably one of the most expensive things.

00:40:54.539 --> 00:41:01.740
I think today, in today's environment, with
the technology we have in both software and

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.690
hardware, I think it won't be that expensive
anymore.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.650
So, I think you're right.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:13.230
That's why I'm saying in redoing it, you could
use new technology and really show how much

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.630
less it's going to weigh because the IMUs
are probably going to be smaller.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.710
You could reduce the weight, you could reduce
the electric power and you could reduce the

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:23.040
cost.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.859
But you're going to have another detailed
briefing on this.

00:41:24.859 --> 00:41:31.329
And Phil Hattis, I know him very well, I think
he will do an outstanding job in explaining

00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:32.420
it to you.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:36.240
Let me just show you very briefly, we talked
a little bit about this yesterday, but here

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:41.980
are some of the profiles that the guidance
system has to be able to do.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:45.529
It certainly has to take care of launch.

00:41:45.529 --> 00:41:50.619
The abort modes, which are interesting, there
is an abort mode that is a return to launch

00:41:50.619 --> 00:41:52.010
site.

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.510
And I guess you would use return to launch
site primarily for a main engine failure,

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.510
I guess.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:00.690
If the main engine fails during ascent, you
can go to a return to launch site.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:04.030
Or, a total loss of cabin pressurization,
something like that.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.390
And I guess that's never been tried.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.080
And I guess that's probably one of the most
difficult maneuvers, most biggest fears the

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.990
astronauts have if they ever have to come
back to return to launch site.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:15.460
But, of course, the guidance system has got
to be capable to take care of that.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:23.200
Then you have 
abort once around.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.510
Again, when you have main engine cutoff, you
have separation and you abort to once around.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:32.069
Again, I guess that's primarily a main engine
problem.

00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:35.970
And then you have, of course, an abort to
orbit.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.030
And those are the three abort regimes you
have.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.030
Yes, sir.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.030
Transatlantic landing?

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.030
Transatlantic.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.030
Yes, you have transatlantic abort.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.030
That's right.

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.030
You do have transatlantic abort.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.049
Yes, thank you.

00:42:45.049 --> 00:42:51.420
That actually drives the launch window, because
[if they don't have clear weather overseas

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.099
they don't launch?]

00:42:53.099 --> 00:42:54.099
.

00:42:54.099 --> 00:42:55.099
That's right.

00:42:55.099 --> 00:43:00.940
So, the guidance system has to take care of
all those abort modes.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.940
Again, I'm sure Phil will go through this
with you.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:14.310
But first stage guidance really consists of
attitude and throttle schedules as a function

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.340
of relative velocity.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:19.099
It's not completely open-loop, it's almost
an open-looped system, but you do control

00:43:19.099 --> 00:43:24.650
the thrust vectors of the engine and the solid
rocket booster actuators.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:33.410
And the key thing, though, where systems engineering
comes into play, it has to get maximum performance.

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:40.529
But the angle tack history has got to be shaped
to control aerodynamic loads.

00:43:40.529 --> 00:43:45.490
Because some of the highest loads you have,
and you will find out when Moser talks about

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.550
it, some of the highest loads you have on
the structure is during ascent.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.210
Control of maximum dynamic pressure.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:55.630
And you have to provide the flight angle at
SRB staging to allow recovery of the spent

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:56.630
boosters.

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.940
These are some of the constraints that you
have.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:02.320
And, again, this comes out to be a real systems
engineering problem.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:13.790
And for entry, entry really becomes a task
in itself because one of the basic problems

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:16.650
you have to control is thermal control.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:23.849
The thermal protection system, I should have
pointed out on that structural slide that

00:44:23.849 --> 00:44:29.560
the back face temperature of the tiles have
to be at 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:34.020
While the surface temperature may be 15 to
2000 degrees Fahrenheit the back face has

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:40.660
to be at 350 degrees Fahrenheit because that's
the limit of aluminum, so you've got to control

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.450
the guidance.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:46.750
The thermal control for guidance is to keep
the vehicle within the temperature constraints

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:47.799
in the peak heating region.

00:44:47.799 --> 00:44:52.930
So, that's all got to be married together
so that the tile system you design keeps the

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:59.040
back face temperature to within 350 degrees
on the aluminum structure.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.339
Then you go into equilibrium glide.

00:45:02.339 --> 00:45:05.510
Constant bank angle, we were talking about,
is modulated for drag control.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:09.230
And then the transition guides the vehicle
from the high out braking to the lower angle

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:10.900
of attack.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.820
And then you basically land.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:19.410
All this has to be tied together for your
guidance, navigation and control system.

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:24.980
I have one more system that I'd like to talk
about briefly.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.210
Now, you're going to have another very detailed
briefing on this.

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:31.599
This is the hydraulic system.

00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:40.220
This ties in together with the other systems
we talked about, the flight control system,

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:44.520
the guidance system, the Department of Flight
Control, because the hydraulic system is three

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.520
systems.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.450
It's a 3000 pound per square inch system.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.430
And what does it do?

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:58.140
It basically is used during ascent and entry
for it to control the thrust vector control

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:06.279
of the engines, for the body flap, for the
elevons, for the rudder speed brake, the actuators

00:46:06.279 --> 00:46:15.980
for the main engine, the doors for the external
tank separation, main landing gear, nose wheel

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.470
steering and braking.

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.079
So, that's what the hydraulic system does.

00:46:21.079 --> 00:46:26.020
If you lose your hydraulic system you had
a bad day.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.839
And there are three systems.

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:32.720
I do believe there is one place where there's
a single point failure in the hydraulic system.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.240
It's pretty hard to eliminate all single point
phase.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.240
I believe that.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.560
When Henry Pohl talks, he's going to be doing
a very detailed discussion on the hydraulic

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.870
system, you might ask him that.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:47.420
I don't recall, but he'll tell you whether
there is a single point failure in the hydraulic

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.420
system.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:53.049
And this is a schematic of the hydraulic system.

00:46:53.049 --> 00:46:57.690
I am not going to go through the details of
it because I'm not sure I could explain it.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:02.270
But basically this is the hydraulic system
that shows how system one, system two and

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:07.970
system three is tied into the right outboard
elevon, the right inboard elevon and so forth

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:09.060
and so on.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.200
The main engines.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.589
The external tank.

00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:20.670
And we've never had a loss in the hydraulic
system.

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:25.349
We did test the hydraulic system in what we
call the flight control hydraulics laboratory

00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:32.480
at Downey where we had actually all the hydraulic
systems tied together with the computer system.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:37.510
And actually flew the vehicle, what we called
this iron bird, with a hydraulic system.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:39.510
And we did have a failure there one time.

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:44.309
Early in the program, we had a single point
failure and lost all the hydraulic fluid.

00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:48.380
We had to go back and make a major change
to the actuator system, to the hydraulic system.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.380
Yes, sir.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.210
I'm just wondering how the hydraulic system
on the shuttle compares to the hydraulic system

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:54.970
on an aircraft?

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:56.670
An airplane.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:57.670
Yeah.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:02.210
I'm really not sure I can explain it.

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:03.880
I think there's not much difference.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.519
Let me tell you the only difference.

00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:13.940
I think airplanes have three hydraulic systems.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.369
The shuttle started out with four hydraulic
systems.

00:48:16.369 --> 00:48:20.520
We actually started out with four, but it
was so heavy and so complicated we decided

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.820
to go to three.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.930
And I think the airplanes have three hydraulic
systems, if I'm not mistaken.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:27.930
Does anybody know?

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:30.510
I at least know quite a few that have three.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.369
I don't know if all airplanes have three.

00:48:32.369 --> 00:48:39.200
The big difference in it is that the hydraulic
system in the shuttle is powered by what we

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.829
call an auxiliary power unit.

00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:44.430
And that's what pressurizes the system.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:50.619
And I think on an airplane it's powered by
the engine itself.

00:48:50.619 --> 00:48:55.460
But this system is pressurized by what we
call an auxiliary power unit.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:59.420
An auxiliary power unit is a box about this
big.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.920
It generates 135 horsepower.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:08.410
And it's got a ten inch turbine wheel that
goes about 10,000 to 20,000 RPM.

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:11.010
And actually it's fueled by hydrazine.

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:19.720
And it essentially pressurizes the system
to get you up to 3000 PSI.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:27.310
Again, if this auxiliary power unit doesn't
work, we have three of them, it's a bad day.

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:30.349
And I think we did have some problems with
one of the auxiliary power units at one time

00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:32.140
during ascent.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:37.339
But that's the major difference, I think,
because I think we tried to copy pretty much

00:49:37.339 --> 00:49:40.990
aircraft designs using the same type of hydraulic
fluid and everything else.

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:46.410
So I think we copied their standard in using
this, as I recall, except we're pressurized

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:48.470
by the auxiliary power unit.

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:53.779
Again, not to belabor the point, you're going
to have a very detailed briefing or lecture

00:49:53.779 --> 00:49:57.990
on the hydraulic system, the auxiliary power
unit and the reaction control system, the

00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:59.200
OMS system by Henry Pohl.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.460
So, you will have more details on this.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:05.780
Again, the hydraulic system might be another
interesting thing to take a look at.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:09.200
I hope what I'm trying to get across to you
is how these systems all fit together.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.410
You cannot do the guidance, navigation and
control without the hydraulic system.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:17.180
You have the aerodynamics and you have the
aerothermodynamics.

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.250
You've got the structures and everything that
has to fit together.

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:23.830
And you can imagine the systems engineering
problem associated with trying to put all

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:24.900
that together.

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:32.529
Just to remind you of a few other things that
you have to deal with.

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:38.779
When you're working with a space system that
also makes it a little bit different from

00:50:38.779 --> 00:50:39.779
designing for the ground.

00:50:39.779 --> 00:50:48.609
For instance, you have a fuel tank with the
hydrazine inert.

00:50:48.609 --> 00:50:53.359
This is a generic problem with any liquid
tank.

00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:59.890
Once you're in weightlessness, how do you
get the liquid to flow out?

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:07.769
This is actually a fairly traditional old-fashioned
design where they have a diaphragm in the

00:51:07.769 --> 00:51:08.769
tank.

00:51:08.769 --> 00:51:13.069
And, on one side of the diaphragm, you pressurize
it with either helium or nitrogen.

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:16.650
And that pushes the material.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:20.180
It's basically sort of like squeezing it out
of a bag.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:24.359
The problem is that hydrazine is nasty stuff.

00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:31.660
And in the orbiter maneuvering and reaction
control systems they decided that, for reusability,

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.000
they didn't want to use diaphragms.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.349
And so we'll probably learn more about some
of the details.

00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:43.130
But there's a very elaborate screen mechanism
which uses surface tension to collect the

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:44.130
material.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:49.390
And just getting liquids out of a tank into
where you want to go is something you have

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:50.420
to worry about in space.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:55.430
The second problem is a thermal problem.

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:58.579
You're not flying through the atmosphere so
you don't have air cooling.

00:51:58.579 --> 00:52:01.050
As you see, you've got the gear box.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.780
You're generating a lot of heat.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:07.390
And, actually, in order to cool, they use
water spray boilers.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:13.579
And you essentially, we actually do this to
get rid of heat from the orbiter as well before

00:52:13.579 --> 00:52:17.260
we open the payload bay doors which have radiators.

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:21.690
While those are closed, it has to be done
with a water spray boiler.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:26.579
And so you get rid of all your heat by putting
it into a heat exchanger.

00:52:26.579 --> 00:52:28.430
And you basically shoot liquid water.

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:34.559
And, of course, in a vacuum the water flash
evaporates and that takes the heat away.

00:52:34.559 --> 00:52:40.599
And so, although in essence the control system
is similar to airplanes, even there, there

00:52:40.599 --> 00:52:47.800
are a lot of special design features that
have to be put in because this is a system

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.359
that has to work in space as well.

00:52:49.359 --> 00:52:50.670
That's a very good point.

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:52.950
The cooling is one of the biggest differences.

00:52:52.950 --> 00:53:01.280
And because this system is so complex and
heavy and needs a lot of maintenance and uses

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:09.329
hydrazine, which is very nasty stuff, there
have been, on various occasions, studies of

00:53:09.329 --> 00:53:12.900
could this system be replaced by an electromechanical
system?

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:21.430
And as motors become more powerful and battery
and fuel cell systems are more efficient,

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:27.150
I think just about two years ago we gave up
on the last effort, but it always turned out

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:29.980
to be too heavy.

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:36.059
To get an electromechanical system which had
enough muscle to move these air surfaces around,

00:53:36.059 --> 00:53:38.350
it is just beyond what we can do.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.329
But that might be another good system to take
a look at today.

00:53:40.329 --> 00:53:41.789
It might be another good system.

00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:43.789
The other thing.

00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:47.750
You see where it has a speed control and safety
for the APU controller?

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:54.240
The interesting thing about this turbine wheel,
I forget the exact RPM, but it's pretty high.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.920
I think it's at least 10,000 to 20,000 RPM.

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:04.500
If this shaft should break off, it's a very
hard to control it in the box.

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:09.680
I mean it will go right through the box it's
in and share the vehicle.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.770
We've tried everything we know.

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:13.530
We've put protection around it.

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:17.910
We've put a lot of margin into the turbine
wheel, into the shaft, but that's a very critical

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:18.910
thing.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:23.350
And, as Professor Hoffman mentioned, there
have been many exercises to replace the auxiliary

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:24.350
power unit.

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:27.859
And I think again this would be another good
challenge to take a look at seeing what you

00:54:27.859 --> 00:54:31.599
could do to come up with a different design
for the auxiliary power unit.

00:54:31.599 --> 00:54:33.510
But there will be other systems that you might
want to look at.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:38.900
But I thought I'd just give you a little discussion
of some that I personally think are very pertinent

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:39.980
to look at.

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:44.619
That's the thermal protection system, the
structures, the guidance, navigation and control,

00:54:44.619 --> 00:54:46.859
the hydraulic system, including the APU.

00:54:46.859 --> 00:54:48.220
And these, I think, would be a very good system.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:51.579
Now, you might pick others, but these might
be very good ones to look at.

00:54:51.579 --> 00:54:59.509
Let me wind up my discussion by talking to
you about what I think you ought to look for

00:54:59.509 --> 00:55:00.509
in the system.

00:55:00.509 --> 00:55:05.579
This is just a very simplistic chart, but
this is my way of thinking about what you

00:55:05.579 --> 00:55:09.519
do when you go about designing something.

00:55:09.519 --> 00:55:10.770
You need to look at the functions.

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:15.359
As we pointed out yesterday, the functions
are very important because, when we talked

00:55:15.359 --> 00:55:20.630
about a thermal protection system , we looked
at the functions of protecting the vehicle,

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:24.539
maintaining that back surface temperature
to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:55:24.539 --> 00:55:28.260
We worked that to finite detail.

00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:32.560
We knew exactly how thick the tiles had to
be, what the characteristics had to be, but

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.560
what did we?

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:39.349
We forgot, oddly enough, that it had to be
attached to the vehicle, which is sort of

00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:40.349
dumb.

00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:42.960
And you would think, my gosh, they ought to
be able to do that.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.150
But you're infinitely smarter after you find
out your problem.

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:50.750
One thing you ought to do is really understand
what functions have to be performed.

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:54.280
And you might say that becomes your functional
requirements.

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.190
The whole thing is understanding your requirements.

00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:01.069
Then you ought to understand what performance
is required.

00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:02.210
In other words, performance requirements.

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:07.430
You ought to have a first order of magnitude
calculation of what kind of performance requirements

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.430
you need.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:13.450
A lot of times this is going to have come
from assumptions, talking to people, getting

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:14.869
experts involved.

00:56:14.869 --> 00:56:17.280
But what kind of performance requirements?

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.519
It is going to have to be iterated, but what
kind of performance are you thinking about

00:56:20.519 --> 00:56:21.779
in this system?

00:56:21.779 --> 00:56:26.180
Whatever the system may be, hydraulic system,
thermal protection system, whatever.

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:32.130
Then we talk about the three-legged stool,
as Professor Hoffman said.

00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:36.750
We talk about schedule, cost and output weight
under performance.

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:42.000
Because, as I told you before, the first thing
you're going to wind up, in designing a system,

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.170
is that the weight is going to get too high.

00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:47.559
Then you're going to find out that performance
goes down.

00:56:47.559 --> 00:56:48.559
You have schedule slips.

00:56:48.559 --> 00:56:52.410
But the first thing that usually happens is
you wake up in the morning and you find out,

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:56.410
my gosh, my system weighs a lot more, my subsystem
weighs a lot more than they told me I could

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:57.410
have.

00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:59.869
So, you've got to understand your weight.

00:56:59.869 --> 00:57:03.410
And then you need to think about what is the
available technology?

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:05.180
What is the technology available?

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:11.339
As somebody pointed out, today the avionics
technology is probably pretty high up on the

00:57:11.339 --> 00:57:12.339
ladder.

00:57:12.339 --> 00:57:14.289
And you could probably pick something today
right off the shelf.

00:57:14.289 --> 00:57:18.670
Although, in my experience of the 30 years
I had in the space program, I never was able

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:21.250
to find something that was off the shelf.

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:24.720
Space programs just don't usually allow you
to take something off the shelf.

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.190
People told me to go do it.

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:29.920
And, once I went and did it, we changed everything.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:34.380
But today, in the technology we have in the
avionics, you may be able to get a lot off

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:35.380
the shelf.

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:37.720
So, what technology is available?

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:41.500
And then one of the key things, one of the
biggest things you have to know is what are

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.500
the interfaces?

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:48.420
If you could see the multitude of interfaces
that are required for the guidance, navigation

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:52.890
and control system, it takes into consideration
all the interfaces you could think about.

00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:56.920
And so you need to think about interfaces,
whether they be mechanical, whether they be

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.980
electrical, whether they be functional.

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.210
So, you need to think about what interfaces
you're talking about.

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:05.579
And, to me, those are some guidelines you
need to think about.

00:58:05.579 --> 00:58:11.330
Of course then we talk about cost and schedule.

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:17.509
Usually your cost is going to grow, unfortunately,
and usually your schedule is going to slip.

00:58:17.509 --> 00:58:21.430
And those are, what I would call, career limiting
problems.

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:27.010
That's the best way to get fired, to have
your costs go up and you schedule increase.

00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:34.150
So, these are some of my guidelines for things
you ought to look for when you try to design

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:35.150
your system.

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:40.789
I would be happy to answer any questions for
you that you may have.

00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:43.130
Yes, sir.

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:48.480
About taking technology off the shelf, I'm
wondering, and I don't think, from what I

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.200
know, it was really thought of much during
the shuttle, but the idea of maybe putting

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:57.210
something on the shelf, so to speak, the idea
of designing something, a subsystem or something

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:08.549
so it would have the flexibility to be used
in future systems.

00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:09.549
Do you see where I'm going?

00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:13.640
No, I don't think I quite follow what you're
saying.

00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:14.750
Try again.

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:17.160
Well, you said there wasn't really off the
shelf technology available then but maybe

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.160
there is now.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.390
The idea I'm thinking about is the idea of
designing something not so much just for the

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:26.640
shuttle in this phase, but so that it could
be used for other things.

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:31.000
Well, that's a very possible thing to do and
would be a very good thing to do.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.220
In my experience, and we tried something like
that, usually this tends to start growing

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.309
into it.

00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:39.349
You start saying, well, what is it really
going to cost you to do that?

00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:43.760
I know, when I was project manager, people
would come to me with something like that.

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:46.440
And I used to be a pretty mean guy.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.230
I'm not quite as mean as I used to be.

00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:54.029
But that's the first thing I'd ask them, what
about the cost, because that's what happens.

00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:57.890
When you start trying to make multiple uses
out of something, you usually drive the cost

00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:58.890
up.

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:56.230
And that's what you 
have 

01:00:56.230 --> 01:01:01.010
to be careful of.

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:04.150
Yes, sir.

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:17.829
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] Well, let me add to
that.

01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:26.089
I feel very strongly that had it not been
for the MIT Instrumentation Lab or the Draper

01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:29.270
Lab or the people they had there, the technology
they had there, we wouldn't have gone to the

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:31.190
moon when we said we were going to doing it.

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:36.779
I mean I worked very closely with them, and
I feel very strongly that Draper Labs, I keep

01:01:36.779 --> 01:01:40.920
getting them mixed up, at that time the MIT
Instrumentation Lab was really one of the

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.410
prime movers of the whole system.

01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:46.119
It was really fantastic.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:50.839
So the people working here, and you can take
advantage of that, would be very useful for

01:01:50.839 --> 01:01:53.000
you to do that.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.609
Any other questions?

01:01:54.609 --> 01:01:58.640
Well, I will be back on the 22nd.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.109
And I look forward to working with you some
more.

01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:03.109
One more question.

01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:04.109
Sorry.

01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:05.109
Yes.

01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:16.880
It has not as much to do with the subsystems
but to the overall concept of the shuttle.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:29.519
I was wondering why, if you know at all, the
military thought it was important to have

01:02:29.519 --> 01:02:30.519
the ability to capture a satellite and bring
it back?

01:02:30.519 --> 01:02:31.519
Was it because satellites were so expensive
at the time and maybe they aren't as much?

01:02:31.519 --> 01:02:32.519
Because I don't think we've really done that.

01:02:32.519 --> 01:02:33.519
Well, it really wasn't the military.

01:02:33.519 --> 01:02:34.519
Several satellites we did bring back.

01:02:34.519 --> 01:02:35.740
I cannot recall which ones.

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:36.900
Westar and Palapa.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.779
I have pictures of that a little later.

01:02:38.779 --> 01:02:40.700
And we retrieved those.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:48.490
And it turns out, interestingly enough, they
were insured by Lloyds of London.

01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:55.390
And that was the biggest salvage operation
Lloyds of London ever achieved when they returned

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:57.990
those satellites, bigger than anything in
the ocean they ever picked up.

01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:59.550
In fact, they rang the bell.

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:03.809
When they have a big recovery, a big thing
in Lloyds of London they ring a bell.

01:03:03.809 --> 01:03:07.970
And they came down to serve somebody, whoever
he was, I don't recall who he was, but he

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:10.109
was head of Lloyds of London.

01:03:10.109 --> 01:03:15.339
And we had a big reception at the Johnson
Space Center after we retrieved Westar and

01:03:15.339 --> 01:03:16.339
Palapa.

01:03:16.339 --> 01:03:20.920
I don't think the Air Force really had that
much demand at the time, or it went away,

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:27.099
whatever it was, for retrieving payloads,
but commercials did.

01:03:27.099 --> 01:03:32.559
What the military was interested in was the
possibility of refueling satellites in orbit.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:33.559
That's right.

01:03:33.559 --> 01:03:34.559
We did do that.

01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:39.609
Because when you have recognizant satellites,
very often you have to change their orbit

01:03:39.609 --> 01:03:42.460
to get them over to the right place at the
right time.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:49.140
And orbital maneuvering fuel is a limiting
commodity on satellites.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.539
And these are very expensive satellites to
build.

01:03:51.539 --> 01:03:59.249
So if you have the possibility of refueling
then, in principle, you could extend the life

01:03:59.249 --> 01:04:01.549
of these very high value assets.

01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:05.880
And we did do a demonstration.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.910
Of course, the fuel, in most cases, is hydrazine
which is very nasty stuff.

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:16.720
If you get it on your spacesuit you cannot
come inside until you bake it off.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.140
It's fairly dangerous.

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:28.569
And so we actually did do a demonstration
just in the shuttle's cargo bay, but we've

01:04:28.569 --> 01:04:36.170
never actually done a real refueling of a
satellite in orbit.

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:37.329
But they're still working on it.

01:04:37.329 --> 01:04:45.630
Now I think the military is still working
on possibly robotic refuelling technologies.

01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:56.380
For whatever the next version of the shuttle
or crew vehicle would be, is it necessary

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.990
or even a good idea to have this huge cargo
bay?

01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:59.380
Well, I think that's what they're eliminating.

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.740
I haven't been that close to it.

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.890
But the CEV is going to be really a passenger
carrier.

01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:08.700
And then any cargo will be on an unmanned
vehicle, I believe.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.279
So, that's what they're separating.

01:05:10.279 --> 01:05:11.279
Is that right?

01:05:11.279 --> 01:05:14.809
I mean I haven't really been that close to
it.

01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:21.069
This is one of the guidelines now for future
space vehicles, is to the maximum extent possible

01:05:21.069 --> 01:05:25.130
separate humans and cargo.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:33.230
If the original concept of the shuttle had
been realizable that the shuttle would be

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:39.800
capable of flying frequently enough that it
could basically satisfy all of our launch

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:45.869
needs then you can make the argument, well,
all right, we're doing this and people are

01:05:45.869 --> 01:05:49.470
in it to fly it and we'll just do it that
way.

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:57.780
But given the fact that we cannot fulfill
that goal then you have to ask why put humans

01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:05.019
at risk just to take a satellite up in the
cargo bay and launch it when we can launch

01:06:05.019 --> 01:06:06.950
satellites using unmanned vehicles?

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:15.999
And, in fact, that was the decision after
the Challenger accident, was any payloads

01:06:15.999 --> 01:06:22.329
that are carried into space on the shuttle
in general, I mean there were some exceptions

01:06:22.329 --> 01:06:28.480
for various reasons, but you ought to be using
the shuttle to do things where you need people

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.809
to do them.

01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:35.030
And some of those things, for instance, to
service in the Hubble or the assembly of the

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:41.039
space station, although even that could be
argued that, had we planned it differently,

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:45.200
we might have been able to do it without making
such extensive use of the shuttle.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.319
But there we do make full use of the big cargo
bay.

01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:54.660
But future human space vehicles, the CEV will
be basically a people carrier with a small

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.150
amount of cargo.

01:06:56.150 --> 01:07:02.440
And any time you want to launch large amounts
of cargo you will do it without people.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.279
Let's take a one or two-minute break.

01:07:05.279 --> 01:07:08.130
I'm going to get my computer set up.

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:17.609
Let me put this down here.

01:07:17.609 --> 01:07:28.690
I want to give you a short presentation just
to bring everybody up to a certain level of

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:34.119
familiarity with what the shuttle does and
what it looks like.

01:07:34.119 --> 01:07:41.500
And, again, I tend to look at this from an
operational point of view.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:45.480
This will be informal, you know, ask questions
as we go through.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:54.410
As we've said, the two critical phases of
shuttle operations and what makes this such

01:07:54.410 --> 01:08:01.200
a unique vehicle is it launches vertically
like a spaceship with a tremendous amount

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:05.000
of power.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.440
And it lands.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.240
You look at this, and you have to remind yourself
that it looks like an airplane landing and,

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.780
yet, a half an hour ago this was a spaceship
going in orbit around the earth.

01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:28.389
So it really has been a spectacular technological
achievement.

01:08:28.389 --> 01:08:33.819
Let's go through some of the maintenance operations,
what is actually done to the shuttle.

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:39.719
We've talked about it a little bit, but I
think if you actually see some of the images

01:08:39.719 --> 01:08:42.909
it will help to give some reality to some
of this.

01:08:42.909 --> 01:08:48.870
After the shuttle lands, here it's landing
on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center.

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:53.480
And, as we mentioned, all of this is a bird
sanctuary so sometimes you have to chase the

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.480
birds away.

01:08:54.480 --> 01:09:00.750
And there's a problem from time to time with
crosswinds.

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:06.259
There is only one runway so, if you get wind
blowing across the runway at more than 15

01:09:06.259 --> 01:09:08.509
knots, you cannot land.

01:09:08.509 --> 01:09:15.359
And so that's also a constraint sometimes
to launch because when you take off you always

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:20.640
have to be able to turn around and come back
and land here, just like you have to be able

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.589
to land over in Europe or Africa.

01:09:24.589 --> 01:09:29.069
And so there are a lot of launch constraints.

01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:39.190
What they do is, this was actually hooked
up back on the runway, but they hook up air

01:09:39.190 --> 01:09:41.279
conditioning units.

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:43.770
They have to purge.

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:45.489
There's an ammonia boiler.

01:09:45.489 --> 01:09:50.870
Remember we talked about getting rid of heat
as you're coming in using water spray boilers.

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:56.710
But, once you get below 100,000 feet, the
pressure is actually above the triple point

01:09:56.710 --> 01:09:59.570
of water and you cannot flash evaporate anymore.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:03.350
And so they switch from a water boiler to
an ammonia boiler.

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:07.390
And so, after the shuttle lands, there are
ammonia fumes all over the place.

01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:12.400
If you've looked at pictures of shuttle servicing
on the runway, sometimes if there isn't actually

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.949
wind blowing they bring around a big fan to
blow the ammonia way.

01:10:18.949 --> 01:10:21.619
And everybody has to stay upwind of the ammonia.

01:10:21.619 --> 01:10:25.989
And there is also the possibility, of course,
that there might be a hydrazine leak or who

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:26.989
knows.

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:28.840
Anyway, the orbiter has to be safe.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.110
And you have the people come out in what looks
like space suits.

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:36.810
Escape suits they call them.

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:40.760
Self-contained, I don't remember the acronym.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:49.360
But, in any case, we're bringing the orbiter
back to the hanger area where it will undergo

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.790
a lot more than 14 days of servicing.

01:10:51.790 --> 01:11:00.800
I remember, again, just to give you a sense
of the state of mind before we were actually

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.239
operating the shuttle, as a new astronaut
back in 1978.

01:11:05.239 --> 01:11:07.610
Remember the shuttle didn't fly until '81.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:10.360
We were getting a series of lectures on all
the shuttle systems.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:15.440
And I remember the lecture they gave us on
turnaround, which was supposed to take 14

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.610
days.

01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:19.670
And we got a briefing from the people who
were planning the turnaround.

01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:26.850
And I remember they told us we've studied
this really carefully, and we just don't think

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:30.389
it's going to be possible to turn the shuttle
around in 14 days.

01:11:30.389 --> 01:11:38.150
We've cut out every unnecessary step and we
think it's impossible to do it in less than

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:40.250
16 days.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:43.250
[LAUGHTER] And that's kind of the way people
were thinking.

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:50.520
We were talking about it's supposed to make
60 flights a year, and people were skeptical.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.380
There is no way they can make more than 40
flights a year.

01:11:55.380 --> 01:12:04.199
People just didn't have a concept of how complex
it was going to be to operate this vehicle

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:07.790
because it is such a complex vehicle.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.179
To operate it safety is difficult.

01:12:10.179 --> 01:12:12.660
Now sometimes it lands in California.

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:17.690
And, in that case, you put it on the 747.

01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:26.100
This is the same bipod fitting, just to essentially
duplicate the way that the orbiter is put

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:36.130
on the external tank, and the tail pod is,
of course, for aerodynamics.

01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:41.219
And that was also the configuration for the
approach and landing tests.

01:12:41.219 --> 01:12:46.889
And, actually, later, I think, in the middle
of October, Gordon Fullerton who was one of

01:12:46.889 --> 01:12:53.929
NASA's premier test pilots, he still flies,
I mean I'll have to find out from him how

01:12:53.929 --> 01:12:58.550
many different types of airplanes he's flow,
he's just an amazing guy, but he was actually

01:12:58.550 --> 01:13:03.690
in the shuttle during that first approach
and landing test.

01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:08.710
So he can tell us about what it was actually
like test flying the shuttle, as well as being

01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:11.540
on the third orbital flight test.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.540
Yes?

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:15.140
Were they carrying anything on the airplane?

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.940
You mean inside here?

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:17.940
Yeah.

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:22.630
No, this is not your opportunity for a transcontinental
vacation trip.

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:27.750
[LAUGHTER] I mean there are a few people who
ride along with it because you need the maintenance

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:28.750
people.

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:35.920
They also have an airplane flying about 50
miles in front of this checking for turbulence.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.830
And, in the early days, they had a chase airplane
as well.

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:49.389
I told people they were crazy trying to get
them to do this because I thought it was the

01:13:49.389 --> 01:13:50.389
dumbest thing I heard of.

01:13:50.389 --> 01:13:51.389
[LAUGHTER] OK.

01:13:51.389 --> 01:13:52.389
Now a look at some of the details.

01:13:52.389 --> 01:13:57.159
Remember we talked about how the engines are
taken out?

01:13:57.159 --> 01:14:00.489
You get a little bit of a view here inside
the engine compartment.

01:14:00.489 --> 01:14:05.489
I had the chance, on numerous occasions, to
actually go inside the engine compartment.

01:14:05.489 --> 01:14:06.650
I mean it's just amazing.

01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:08.980
You get these huge big pipes.

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:13.580
And it really helps when you're going to be
using a system like this.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.630
We spent a lot of time in the simulators.

01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:25.070
And you'll flip a switch, and that switch
controls what they call the main fuel shutoff

01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:26.960
valve.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.920
It's a big butterfly valve about 17 inches
in diameter inside this huge pipe.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.750
And you sit in the simulator and you flick
the switch and the talk back shows that the

01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:38.750
thing is closed.

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:44.210
And then you actually go in the compartment
and you look and there's this huge pipe and

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:45.250
this area.

01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:49.930
And you realize this huge thing that's moving
around.

01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:51.830
And it kind of gives a sense of realism.

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:57.389
And, in fact, that's one of the big safety
concerns.

01:14:57.389 --> 01:15:02.060
When the fuel is flowing, the butterfly valve
is in a vertical position so the fuel flips

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.060
by it.

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:04.780
Obviously, it's an unstable situation.

01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:11.110
If it goes out just a little bit then the
fuel flow can slam it closed and you've got

01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:12.639
an explosion on your hands.

01:15:12.639 --> 01:15:16.030
So that was a major consideration.

01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:17.800
This is the body flap.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:21.650
So, you can see all of the plumbing.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:29.420
And all these red things are removed before
flight, stickers.

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.590
It's a very, very complex process.

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:39.150
And they pull the engines out after every
flight now.

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:45.180
That's the thing, all of the platforms have
to be designed so that they fold up and they

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:47.990
fold down so that you can get access to all
the places.

01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:51.210
I mean it's a very complex system.

01:15:51.210 --> 01:15:56.990
And a lot of the equipment, the launch platforms
and everything, as we mentioned, were adapted

01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:58.980
from the Apollo program.

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:04.880
But the hangers, which we call the OPF, the
orbiter processing facility was built specifically

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.880
for the shuttle.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.610
The tiles we talked about.

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:19.210
I mean that's just a huge amount of work replacing,
maintaining and testing the tiles.

01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:23.670
This is inside the cargo bay.

01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:24.980
You've got the fuel cells.

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:30.020
You've got hydrogen and oxygen cryogenic tanks.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.880
Helium pressurization tanks.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.340
Nitrogen for your atmospheric system.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:40.460
This is the bulkhead in front of which on
one side you have the engine compartment.

01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:43.010
On the other side you have the crew compartment.

01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:49.610
And, like we mentioned, this has to be done
essentially in clean-room conditions and yet

01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:51.570
it's on the scale of a battleship.

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:56.330
So, it's a real challenge.

01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:59.880
This is the forward window.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:06.440
On maybe one in every five flights we'll get
a little ding on the windshield from a little

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.980
piece of usually orbital debris.

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:13.900
In fact, more often than not, it turns out
to be little paint chips.

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:19.889
Whenever they do that they remove the window,
they replace it and do a chemical analysis

01:17:19.889 --> 01:17:26.230
to see whether it was a micrometeorite or
a piece of space debris.

01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:29.890
The windows, actually there are three panes.

01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:34.300
There's a redundant pressure pane.

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:40.610
The two panes on the inside are capable of
holding pressure and the outer is a thermal

01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:45.650
pane.

01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:49.610
This is one of the orbital maneuvering system
pods.

01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:57.530
These are removable because, again, they contain
nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine.

01:17:57.530 --> 01:18:01.780
And we mentioned the fact that these are called
hypergolic fuels.

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:07.170
When you bring them together they ignite spontaneously,
as opposed to hydrogen and oxygen you need

01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:09.510
a spark igniter.

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:15.480
So, in that one sense, it's a nice system
because when you want to use them in your

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:20.110
reaction control and you only want a very
tiny tenth of a second pulse, you don't have

01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:23.489
to worry about an igniter which is a potential
failure point.

01:18:23.489 --> 01:18:28.690
You just squirt in the hydrazine and the nitrogen
tetroxide.

01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:30.010
But they're very nasty stuff.

01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:37.980
They are extremely toxic and, of course, highly
combustible and they are very corrosive.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:45.510
So, these pods are serviced in a place far
away from where the other activities take

01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:49.580
place for the orbiter so just in case there
is a leak or an explosion it's not going to

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:52.900
take down the rest of the critical facilities.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:58.560
This is the orbiter maneuvering engine, and
then they also have these smaller reaction

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.940
control engines.

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:04.900
And there are two aft pods.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:11.040
And all the fuel tanks with the hydrazine
and nitrogen tetroxide are in here.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:16.719
The aft system, the two pods, they actually
have inner connects so that you can actually

01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:19.340
cross-feed from one system to the other.

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:21.570
And all of that stuff has to be hooked up.

01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:24.500
The forward system is independent.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:28.070
You cannot cross-feed to that.

01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:29.420
The landing gears.

01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:33.510
We talked a little bit the other day about
the tires.

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:37.469
These things sit up in space for two weeks
at a time.

01:19:37.469 --> 01:19:39.560
You've got to worry about thermal control.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:47.460
I mean can you imagine if you had a slow leak
and you found out that your tire was flat

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:51.700
before you started your reentry?

01:19:51.700 --> 01:20:00.690
And then, of course, the problem of sealing
this against the hot gas.

01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:09.040
The tiles on the edge of the doors for the
landing gear, that's a very critical section.

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:19.490
Anyway, after typically about a three month
turnaround in the hanger they wheel the orbiter,

01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:26.670
actually, originally it was pulled over on
its own wheels, but that required that they

01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:32.469
then stow the wheels in this big vertical
assembly building.

01:20:32.469 --> 01:20:36.659
This is the vertical assembly building.

01:20:36.659 --> 01:20:38.920
Hopefully you've seen pictures of it.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:39.920
It's huge.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.580
It was actually built to assemble the Saturn
rockets.

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:53.239
It's much taller than we need for the orbiter
stack, but it has been adapted.

01:20:53.239 --> 01:21:05.270
So, what goes on here is it's wheeled into
the big vertical assembly building.

01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:08.250
There it is actually on the inside.

01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:12.770
You just don't get a sense of the size of
this building from any picture that can be

01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:13.770
taken.

01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:17.820
You have to be there and see it to really
appreciate it.

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:26.540
In the meantime, you remember the solid rocket
boosters are recovered after every flight.

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:32.080
And the Liberty Star and I think the Freedom
Star, that's the NASA Navy.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:38.560
These boats are positioned out offshore.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:45.130
And they actually have divers who go down
and put in plugs and floatation devices so

01:21:45.130 --> 01:21:48.720
that they actually float the boosters.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:54.750
And they drag them back where they're disassembled
and cleaned up.

01:21:54.750 --> 01:22:02.300
The actual segments, which contain the fuel,
are shipped back to Utah to Thiokol which

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:07.080
is now ATK for cleaning, refilling.

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:14.320
And the other parts, the nozzle and the top,
which contains the electronics and the parachutes,

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:17.820
those are serviced in Florida.

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:26.221
And then they're brought in segments into
the vehicle assembly building where they are

01:22:26.221 --> 01:22:27.221
stacked.

01:22:27.221 --> 01:22:31.110
And remember those are the segment sizes.

01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:33.080
Some of these are assembled in the factory.

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.119
Those are the so-called factory joints.

01:22:35.119 --> 01:22:39.000
And then were these come together that's the
so-called field joint, and that's the joint

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.330
that failed in the Challenger accident.

01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:49.050
This gives you a sense of the size of those
solid rocket motors in the way the solid fuel

01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:50.050
is put in.

01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:54.360
And they do all of these tests to look for
the roundness of the motor and the flatness

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.270
of the propellant.

01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:59.840
Yeah?

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.650
Is that the fuel itself?

01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:02.650
It is.

01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:07.420
Although, what confuses me about this is I'm
not sure which segment this is because most

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:14.820
of the fuel is actually put in with a star
pattern in it and they actually shape the

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:20.090
way it's loaded so that you shape the thrust
profile.

01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:28.320
And I've not been able to get a good explanation
of why that is not the case here.

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:35.030
In any case, this is now the process where
they lift one segment, they put it down on

01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:36.030
top of another.

01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:38.690
Of course, all of these are hazardous activities.

01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:44.210
And nobody is allowed, except for the critical
personnel, nobody's allowed in the VAB when

01:23:44.210 --> 01:23:48.449
they're doing this just in case there is a
problem.

01:23:48.449 --> 01:23:56.000
And then they actually put all of these bolts
in to join up the field joint.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:05.699
And now, of course, after Challenger we have
a new and improved O ring configuration.

01:24:05.699 --> 01:24:12.570
Now we have the two solid rocket boosters
sitting on the mobile launch platform.

01:24:12.570 --> 01:24:20.260
And, again, you can see you have to design
all of these platforms so you have access.

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:24.010
Now, the external tank we talked about.

01:24:24.010 --> 01:24:25.780
This is in [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:32.260
This has actually been damaged, not too heavily,
but it did suffer damage from Katrina.

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:34.750
This is the oxygen tank upfront.

01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:39.010
Notice how small this is compared to this
is the big hydrogen tank.

01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:44.751
And then this is actually the front side,
but this is then turned around and the two

01:24:44.751 --> 01:24:48.840
are joined together inside the outer shell.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:58.280
And, of course, the solids are joined to the
external tank, the orbiter is joined to the

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:04.199
external tank, so basically the external tank
needs a strong back mechanism inside it because

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:07.449
that's ultimately what's tying the whole stack
together.

01:25:07.449 --> 01:25:13.750
And the trust from the solids and the thrust
from the main engines, ultimately they're

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:15.750
linked together through the external tanks.

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:22.510
So the tanks themselves, the hydrogen and
oxygen tanks don't have a lot of beefy structure.

01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:27.260
But going through this is a very heavy structure.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.300
Yeah?

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:36.740
The hydrogen tank there is about the diameter
of the overall structure?

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:37.740
Yeah.

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:39.449
That gives another idea of the scale.

01:25:39.449 --> 01:25:46.310
This is cleaning and polishing inside the
big hydrogen tank.

01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:54.010
I mean, again, the scale of all of this, it's
important to get a sense of what's involved

01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:56.890
in taking care of these vehicles.

01:25:56.890 --> 01:26:03.660
Do you know if they actually had to go in
and scrub it by hand?

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:04.660
I guess.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.800
I mean the scrubbing is only part of it.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:12.940
The inspection is the really critical thing,
to see if there is anything that's not quite

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:13.940
right.

01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:23.639
One thing that's interesting, the use of liquid
oxygen, liquid hydrogen is wanted so much

01:26:23.639 --> 01:26:25.489
because of its higher performance.

01:26:25.489 --> 01:26:31.800
But, on the other hand, if you would do something
like liquid oxygen and kerosene you would

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:37.330
get a much smaller tank or some other propellant.

01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:40.300
And there is a tradeoff.

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:45.869
I think today people are realizing, especially
from the Russians, the Russians don't really

01:26:45.869 --> 01:26:46.869
use liquid hydrogen.

01:26:46.869 --> 01:26:49.060
You get a lower ISP but your tanks become
so much smaller to deal with.

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:52.469
And hydrogen is very hard to deal with.

01:26:52.469 --> 01:26:57.290
It's very hard to find the hydrogen level,
and hydrogen is very hard to deal with.

01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:59.570
My second flight, do you remember?

01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:04.530
That was the one with the hydrogen leaks,
remember that?

01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:06.869
We were supposed to launch in May of 1990.

01:27:06.869 --> 01:27:08.301
And we went down.

01:27:08.301 --> 01:27:14.489
And before they fill the system they do a
helium leak check.

01:27:14.489 --> 01:27:18.290
And, of course, helium, for those of you who
have worked with vacuum systems, helium will

01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:19.389
leak through anything.

01:27:19.389 --> 01:27:25.150
And, if the system is tight against helium,
they figure it is tight.

01:27:25.150 --> 01:27:28.239
The problem is that that's done at ambient
temperature.

01:27:28.239 --> 01:27:35.170
And, when you fill it with the cryogenic hydrogen,
everything contracts.

01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:43.680
And so things which were vacuum-tight at ambient
temperature are not always vacuum-tight.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:49.400
But the problem is you don't know that until
you fill it, which is only done a few hours

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.790
before a launch.

01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:53.230
So, we had gone down to the Cape.

01:27:53.230 --> 01:27:55.199
We were in medical quarantine.

01:27:55.199 --> 01:28:01.619
And we just got the message about six hours
before launch there's a hydrogen leak, launch

01:28:01.619 --> 01:28:03.619
is scrubbed.

01:28:03.619 --> 01:28:06.210
They did some checks.

01:28:06.210 --> 01:28:07.730
They drained the tank.

01:28:07.730 --> 01:28:10.800
They did another helium leak check.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.780
It was fine.

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:13.940
We had gone back to Houston.

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:15.239
We came back.

01:28:15.239 --> 01:28:17.139
The same thing happened.

01:28:17.139 --> 01:28:19.739
How long did it take?

01:28:19.739 --> 01:28:23.900
Well, in the end, we made six trips over the
course of six months.

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:25.820
And we didn't launch until December.

01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:31.070
And, actually, another one of the shuttles
also had a hydrogen leak.

01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:32.880
They actually alternated us.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.830
They pulled us off the launch pad.

01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:36.619
They put somebody else on.

01:28:36.619 --> 01:28:42.900
I mean what had happened was they had somewhat
changed the procedure of installing some O

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:48.570
rings in these big hydrogen lines, and it
required a process where the workers were

01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:51.780
actually working in an area where they couldn't
see.

01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:57.060
And the O rings were being installed slightly
wrong.

01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:01.739
But it was just terribly difficult to track
that down.

01:29:01.739 --> 01:29:06.210
So, yeah, there are a lot of problems using
cryogenic fuel.

01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:12.650
Now, the other thing is if you have a fully
staged vehicle with a separate first and second

01:29:12.650 --> 01:29:20.190
stage, one of the things that you learn in
rocket propulsion classes is that in the first

01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:24.260
stage the specific impulse is not nearly as
important.

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:26.849
What's really important is to get a lot of
thrust.

01:29:26.849 --> 01:29:32.340
In your upper stages having a high ISP becomes
much more important in terms of the payload

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:33.400
that you can carry.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:39.290
So, if you had a fully staged vehicle, and,
in fact, that's the way Saturn worked.

01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:44.140
The first stage of Saturn was kerosene and
liquid oxygen and the upper stages were cryogenic

01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:46.929
with hydrogen and oxygen just for that reason.

01:29:46.929 --> 01:29:48.560
OK, let's move on.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:55.800
Now we have the external tank, again, suspended
in the vertical assembly building.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:30:01.469
That's lifted up and joined between the two
SRBs.

01:30:01.469 --> 01:30:12.360
This is the feed line where the oxygen comes
down and this is where these two feeds lines,

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.599
this is the hydrogen.

01:30:13.599 --> 01:30:21.199
And then the orbiter has two corresponding
feed ports where the hydrogen and oxygen comes

01:30:21.199 --> 01:30:22.590
into the engine.

01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:27.800
And, actually, when you fill the tank on the
pad, you actually put the hydrogen and oxygen

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.170
into the orbiter.

01:30:29.170 --> 01:30:33.720
And it flows from the orbiter back then into
the external tank.

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:38.760
And it was on this oxygen fitting from the
foam that they put around this, was what fell

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:44.290
off in the recent Discovery flight where they
did get a big piece of foam.

01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:46.460
OK, so now we go back.

01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:50.200
Remember we brought the orbiter over into
the vertical assembly building?

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:55.599
Now, you put this strong back to hold the
orbiter.

01:30:55.599 --> 01:30:56.599
And this is really spectacular.

01:30:56.599 --> 01:31:02.200
I mean you lift the whole orbiter up off the
ground and tilt it up.

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:06.989
And you basically hang it and lower it.

01:31:06.989 --> 01:31:18.330
And these are big pieces of equipment and
yet you need millimeters of accuracy.

01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:25.230
So, very skilled crane operators, to say the
least.

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:33.400
Now we have the orbiter and the strong back
laid down in position and all of the mating

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.510
is done.

01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:37.239
And we're on the pad.

01:31:37.239 --> 01:31:43.520
Excuse me, we're on the mobile launch platform
and they put the crawler transporter underneath

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:50.719
it and then they roll it on these specially
prepared pads which have very, I don't know

01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:55.070
how deep it goes into the ground, but this
is heavy river gravel.

01:31:55.070 --> 01:32:01.080
Most of the boulders are about the size of
your fist, but after one or two trips of the

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.810
orbiter it's crushed down to the size of pea
gravel.

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:05.800
And then they have to replace it with new
stuff.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:10.310
And, of course, as you're going out to the
pad, when you're rolling up to the launch

01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:13.040
pad, you're actually going up at an angle.

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:19.199
And so this whole system, you can see the
crawlers down here, each one of these treads,

01:32:19.199 --> 01:32:21.750
each single piece of the tread weighs a ton.

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:27.040
Just to give you a sense, it goes about one
or two miles per hour top speed.

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:29.239
It takes hours to get out there.

01:32:29.239 --> 01:32:34.199
And it has to be capable of staying level
to within a few degrees, even as you're climbing

01:32:34.199 --> 01:32:38.150
the ramp up to the launch platform.

01:32:38.150 --> 01:32:42.091
What are those things supporting the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

01:32:42.091 --> 01:32:47.280
The whole stack is basically sitting on the
two SRBs.

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:50.730
The skirts of the SRBs is taking the weight.

01:32:50.730 --> 01:32:58.590
These are the fuel inputs which are connected
through the other side where the hydrogen

01:32:58.590 --> 01:33:00.880
and the oxygen run into the shuttle.

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:04.570
And, from there, the way I showed you before,
it goes into the external tank.

01:33:04.570 --> 01:33:06.890
Did they also keep it tilted back?

01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:10.070
Did it have the tendency to [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:14.500
Each of the SRBs has four bolts.

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:21.219
Actually, they give us, as a souvenir after
a flight, they give us the big nuts that are

01:33:21.219 --> 01:33:23.679
explosive bolts.

01:33:23.679 --> 01:33:27.219
There are eight, four on each of the SRBs.

01:33:27.219 --> 01:33:33.920
And, essentially, that's what gives it its
stability.

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.850
Again, this is a hill.

01:33:38.850 --> 01:33:43.340
It's a little hard to see the perspective,
but keeping the whole thing steady.

01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:49.610
And we talked about how you can see this track
here where the payload change-out room eventually

01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:55.400
could come around and cover the shuttle to
give it protection.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.969
This is actually going up the hill to get
up.

01:33:58.969 --> 01:34:01.820
And it's just a pretty picture that I like.

01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:03.460
And here we are.

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:10.710
This is nice because you have both shuttles
on the launch pad.

01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:14.170
This is a big water tower.

01:34:14.170 --> 01:34:23.949
In order to protect the launch pad against
flame damage, and also to protect the shuttle

01:34:23.949 --> 01:34:30.320
against acoustic effects, they actually get
a shockwave when you ignite the engines which

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:35.260
can bounce back and do some damage.

01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:44.080
Shortly, about 15 seconds before T zero, they
open up the valves.

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.250
And all that water flows with little jets.

01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:52.360
If you've seen pictures of a launch, sometimes
they show that as part of the launch sequence.

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:58.290
In fact, in another class, I will show you
some of the details of an actual launch picture.

01:34:58.290 --> 01:35:01.989
That's the water deluge, and that goes for
about 30 seconds.

01:35:01.989 --> 01:35:08.179
And that cushions the acoustic load reflected
back to the shuttle.

01:35:08.179 --> 01:35:11.320
OK, that's enough pictures on the pad.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:15.090
Oh, I know what I wanted to show.

01:35:15.090 --> 01:35:18.530
This is called the white room.

01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:19.960
And that's how the crew goes in.

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:22.590
You take an elevator up to here.

01:35:22.590 --> 01:35:26.040
And then that actually joins up with the hatch.

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:29.150
So the hatch is sitting open.

01:35:29.150 --> 01:35:34.530
And you put on your parachutes and the last
few pieces of equipment to get in.

01:35:34.530 --> 01:35:36.810
And this is a view inside the white room.

01:35:36.810 --> 01:35:42.030
This is, I guess, from our last flight in
1996.

01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:48.139
And, when you go out on launch day, the big
thing that you notice that's different is

01:35:48.139 --> 01:35:52.770
there are very few people on the pad, only
the essential personnel.

01:35:52.770 --> 01:35:57.599
And the whole stack is creaking because it's
now filled with the cryogens and everything

01:35:57.599 --> 01:36:03.369
is shrunk and it's sort of alive in a very
strange way.

01:36:03.369 --> 01:36:06.050
So, we talked about the mission profile.

01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:08.520
I won't deal with this.

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:17.360
And I do want to talk about some of the shuttle
aborts, but we will do that another time because

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.070
I want to get finished with the slides.

01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:26.190
I did want to show you, after Challenger they
introduced a bailout.

01:36:26.190 --> 01:36:34.579
We did mention that the basic survivability
for the crew requires an intact orbiter.

01:36:34.579 --> 01:36:40.020
It used to be that it needed an intact orbiter
landing on the ground or ditching in the ocean,

01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:45.420
which was kind of an unlikely survivability
because you're going to hit the ocean at 200

01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:47.440
knots and probably break up.

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:54.880
So now there are circumstances where you can
lose more than one engine during launch or

01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:01.000
you might have to do an emergency de-orbit
where you basically can be flying along at

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.760
40,000 feet stably but with no place to land.

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:13.150
And so that's really the only situation which
the bailout system protects you against, but

01:37:13.150 --> 01:37:16.610
there is a collapsible poll.

01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:21.420
The reason for that is because the aerodynamic
studies show that if you just jumped out of

01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:30.130
the open hatch with a parachute the airflow
would carry you back on top of the wing and

01:37:30.130 --> 01:37:34.219
you'd hit the OMS pod, and that would not
be a good deal.

01:37:34.219 --> 01:37:40.530
So, you actually hook yourself to this escape
poll.

01:37:40.530 --> 01:37:46.650
And that takes you down below the wing, and
then you can open the parachute.

01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:52.429
And we actually practiced this where you go
out into a swimming pool using the escape

01:37:52.429 --> 01:37:53.429
poll.

01:37:53.429 --> 01:38:00.510
These are some actual tests conducted by Army
parachutists in, I think, a 141 Transport.

01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:04.880
The system has been tested in flight, although
never with the shuttle.

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:13.810
And that's the test where they have a simulated
hatch and you basically jump out into the

01:38:13.810 --> 01:38:15.599
swimming pool.

01:38:15.599 --> 01:38:19.139
Once again, into the white room.

01:38:19.139 --> 01:38:21.550
You can see the hatch out here.

01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:25.139
And that's the last thing that they'll do,
is they close the hatch.

01:38:25.139 --> 01:38:30.969
Then they pressurize the shuttle by about
1.5 PSI just to make sure that it has pressure

01:38:30.969 --> 01:38:33.449
integrity before a launch.

01:38:33.449 --> 01:38:37.389
And then we launch.

01:38:37.389 --> 01:38:43.510
As you can see, you're burning hydrogen and
oxygen in the main engines.

01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:47.199
What's coming out there is just hot steam,
not very visible.

01:38:47.199 --> 01:38:52.949
Most of the smoke, the noise and everything
come from the solid rocket boosters.

01:38:52.949 --> 01:38:57.239
However, you do need these engines.

01:38:57.239 --> 01:39:04.940
In fact, people have calculated that if you
tried to take off without these main engines

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:09.670
pushing up on the shuttle that the attachment
between the shuttle and the external tank

01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:12.660
would probably fail.

01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:18.290
Each of the main engines is about, well, it's
a half a million pounds of thrust in vacuum.

01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:21.720
It's slightly under 400,000 pounds at sea
level.

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:26.550
You've got a little over a million pounds
coming from the main engines, but these are

01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:30.350
putting out almost three million pounds a
piece.

01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:34.869
So, most of your early thrusts in the first
two minutes are coming from the solid rocket

01:39:34.869 --> 01:39:36.280
boosters.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.440
And it's a pretty rough ride.

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:41.409
I mean there's a lot of vibration.

01:39:41.409 --> 01:39:49.179
When you go through mach 1, which is max Q,
maximum dynamic pressure, the vibrations are

01:39:49.179 --> 01:39:51.540
even more pronounced.

01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:54.960
The first time on my first flight, I really
thought the wings were going to come off,

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:56.179
there was so much vibration.

01:39:56.179 --> 01:39:58.889
But, of course, they don't.

01:39:58.889 --> 01:40:01.450
But I'd love to get a hold of it.

01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:08.390
I actually saw a high-speed, well, a slow
motion picture actually looking at the tail,

01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:09.530
as you go through max Q.

01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:12.659
And you can actually see the tail fluttering
back and forth like that.

01:40:12.659 --> 01:40:18.369
I mean the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle
during ascent are significant.

01:40:18.369 --> 01:40:26.510
And you do actually have to move your elevons
to what's called load relief in order to take

01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:29.980
the stress off that.

01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:33.139
I really like this.

01:40:33.139 --> 01:40:39.630
It gives a sense of the power that you're
sitting on top of to get up there.

01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:43.610
And that's just a nice picture of riding the
fire.

01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:48.190
OK, so you get up in orbit and you drop the
external tank.

01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:55.881
And, although now they're going out of their
way to take even better close-ups of the tank

01:40:55.881 --> 01:40:57.560
to look at the foam shedding.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:03.280
We've been doing that, in fact, throughout
the history.

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.880
Now they especially time the launch so that
you're guaranteed to drop the external tank

01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.370
with good lighting conditions.

01:41:09.370 --> 01:41:12.920
That didn't used to be a constraint to launch
but it is now.

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.429
You can also, by the way, see how the atmosphere
quickly fades out into space.

01:41:17.429 --> 01:41:23.250
And that's a telephoto so it actually makes
the atmosphere look even thicker than it really

01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:24.250
looks.

01:41:24.250 --> 01:41:28.920
OK, so there is the orbiter in space.

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:32.929
That was actually after it had delivered a
payload.

01:41:32.929 --> 01:41:39.500
This was taken from the space station.

01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:45.190
And just a quick reminder of all the different
things that we've used the orbiter for.

01:41:45.190 --> 01:41:48.150
Launching satellites, you've seen that picture.

01:41:48.150 --> 01:41:54.530
This is a payload assist module to take the
satellite from the shuttle orbit up to geosynchronous

01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:57.540
transfer orbit.

01:41:57.540 --> 01:42:03.730
We have used it extensively for satellite
repair in orbit.

01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:09.891
This is the Intelsat where it was put into
orbit by an expendable rocket, but into a

01:42:09.891 --> 01:42:13.929
bad orbit because of underperformance.

01:42:13.929 --> 01:42:17.750
And they managed to get it into a shuttle
compatible orbit.

01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:20.840
And I won't go through the whole history.

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:25.510
Why there happened to be three people out
there is a whole story in itself.

01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:27.369
This is one of the satellites.

01:42:27.369 --> 01:42:33.139
Again, the satellites were put into orbit
by the shuttle.

01:42:33.139 --> 01:42:38.110
And the shuttle deployment was fine, but the
payload assist module, which you saw before,

01:42:38.110 --> 01:42:39.579
did not perform properly.

01:42:39.579 --> 01:42:44.280
And so the two satellites were stranded in
a useless orbit.

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.580
We actually brought them back to the ground.

01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:52.030
They were refurbished and re-launched again
on expendable rockets.

01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:59.389
The shuttle has also been used as a space
station with the space lab on in the inside

01:42:59.389 --> 01:43:01.159
to carry out scientific experiments.

01:43:01.159 --> 01:43:05.900
This is a large pressurized module which is
put into the cargo bay.

01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:13.590
And the original idea, as Professor Cohen
mentioned, was you could just take your laboratory

01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:20.489
equipment off the shelf, plug it in here,
120 volts AC power, I guess, and it would

01:43:20.489 --> 01:43:22.250
be just like working on the ground.

01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:23.930
Well, it never was.

01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:31.920
But, having said that, I think the space lab
program, as a whole, was extremely successful.

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:36.040
And then it's been used to service the Mir
Space Station.

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:41.510
We certainly added several years of useful
life to the Mir Station because we could carry

01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:44.969
up a lot more equipment than the Russians
could themselves.

01:43:44.969 --> 01:43:52.090
And that also gave us an opportunity to get
some US astronauts on long duration space

01:43:52.090 --> 01:43:54.440
missions.

01:43:54.440 --> 01:44:00.060
And then, as you all know, we're using the
shuttle to construct the International Space

01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:02.050
Station.

01:44:02.050 --> 01:44:07.429
And hopefully we'll get more of it built before
too long.

01:44:07.429 --> 01:44:15.190
The shuttle is also an excellent platform
for performing EVAs, space walks.

01:44:15.190 --> 01:44:20.030
And that's a picture of when we went up and
repaired the Hubble Space Telescope.

01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:29.409
I cannot overestimate the capability that
the shuttle gives us as a work platform in

01:44:29.409 --> 01:44:30.940
orbit.

01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:36.300
We can do this sort of complex EVA activity
on the Space Station, but once we retire the

01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:40.340
shuttle we've essentially lost that capability.

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:46.369
To have the manipulator arm and to be able
to use people and the robotic arm to move

01:44:46.369 --> 01:44:51.510
equipment around, it's just a very powerful
work platform.

01:44:51.510 --> 01:45:01.350
That's one of my favorite pictures floating
up there.

01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:07.199
This is a pretty picture of firing the orbiter
maneuvering engines just to start your descent

01:45:07.199 --> 01:45:09.159
into the atmosphere.

01:45:09.159 --> 01:45:14.340
Despite the fact that you're going at 18,000
miles an hour, you only have to slow down

01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:21.440
by a few hundred feet per second in order
to lower your perigee down to essentially

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:25.829
the surface of the earth so that half an orbit
later you intersect with the atmosphere.

01:45:25.829 --> 01:45:33.430
And, of course, that produces the aerodynamic
heating which you can see on the outside.

01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:34.920
This is looking out to the front.

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:38.060
That's kind of a dull glow.

01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:44.070
It starts out as a deep red and then it gets
orange and yellow and finally white on the

01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:45.070
outside.

01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:47.849
The most spectacular thing, you know, you're
a meteor.

01:45:47.849 --> 01:45:53.329
This is a picture that was taken from Houston.

01:45:53.329 --> 01:45:58.810
This is at about 250,000 feet at about mach
12 on the way to a landing at the Kennedy

01:45:58.810 --> 01:45:59.810
Space Center.

01:45:59.810 --> 01:46:03.050
The shuttle is flying like this.

01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:07.719
If you look up at the overhead windows, you
can actually look back into the wake.

01:46:07.719 --> 01:46:12.010
And this is really spectacular because you
have these different colors, and it's sort

01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:13.210
of shimmering around.

01:46:13.210 --> 01:46:19.970
And every once in a while, when I would be
looking at this, you'd see a big bright light.

01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:23.070
And I would think boy, I hope that was nothing
important.

01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:27.480
[LAUGHTER] What people said it probably was
were little bits of gap filler.

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:31.210
You may have heard that on the last flight
they discovered that some gap fillers were

01:46:31.210 --> 01:46:32.210
protruding.

01:46:32.210 --> 01:46:37.110
And so Steve Robinson went around and actually
pulled some of them out.

01:46:37.110 --> 01:46:42.170
But they've probably been doing that the whole
time and just have come off.

01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:49.280
I mean this little point where you have the
convergence of the shockwaves, this is about

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:54.880
10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, that's the surface
temperature of the sun.

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.550
It's a spectacular visual view.

01:46:58.550 --> 01:47:08.980
And then, again, at this point we're just
going subsonic flying like a glider and ready

01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:09.980
for touchdown.

01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:19.540
So, I hope that gives you some sense visually
of what goes on in the course of a shuttle

01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:26.630
flight with an emphasis on the maintenance
operations.

01:47:26.630 --> 01:47:35.349
Without appreciating how complex it is to
operate this system, I think it's hard to

01:47:35.349 --> 01:47:41.780
really make the link between the original
concept and the difficulties we've had in

01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:47.989
getting the shuttle to perform in terms of
the turnaround maintainability.

01:47:47.989 --> 01:47:58.760
So, again, just wrapping up, that's kind of
my farewell picture, the shuttle was an amazingly

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:01.090
ambitious concept.

01:48:01.090 --> 01:48:08.340
And, I think, what has been astounding is
how well the shuttle has been able to perform

01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:13.270
and do all the things that it was designed
to do in terms of the satellite launching

01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:19.679
and being used as a science platform, performing
EVA, repairing satellites, building space

01:48:19.679 --> 01:48:20.679
stations.

01:48:20.679 --> 01:48:26.969
It has given us experience and capability
to learn how to do things in earth orbit which

01:48:26.969 --> 01:48:28.460
we never had before.

01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:34.040
And, as I say, we may well miss them once
we retire the shuttle.

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:40.480
But where we really did get it wrong, and
this will be one of the things that we'll

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:44.810
look at when we deal with the individual subsystems,
is in the operations.

01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:55.110
It turned out to be a lot more complex, expensive
and delicate to operate than had been anticipated.

01:48:55.110 --> 01:49:04.560
So hopefully there will come a time when we
set out to design another reusable vehicle,

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:07.110
possibly a reusable winged vehicle.

01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:11.679
And I think a lot of what we've learned from
the shuttle will be folded into that.

01:49:11.679 --> 01:49:17.530
It still is a question of how re-usable the
next crew exploration vehicle, the CEV will

01:49:17.530 --> 01:49:19.159
be.

01:49:19.159 --> 01:49:24.050
Re-usability has been put in as a requirement,
but that remains to be seen.

01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:29.000
And certainly the experience that we've gotten
from the shuttle is going to make people look

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:35.810
really, really closely at what assumptions
we're making about the reusability whenever

01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:37.690
we do this again.

01:49:37.690 --> 01:49:38.760
OK.

01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:47.540
Next Tuesday will be the last in kind of the
conceptual part of what we're doing.

01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:54.750
Professor John Logsdon from George Washington
University is a very well known space policy

01:49:54.750 --> 01:49:55.750
analyst.

01:49:55.750 --> 01:50:03.929
He did a seminal study on the Apollo program
and has also written a lot and done a lot

01:50:03.929 --> 01:50:07.230
of research on the origins of the shuttle.

01:50:07.230 --> 01:50:08.820
And so he'll talk to us then.

01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:10.040
Let's see.

01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:15.720
I had promised to post everybody's emails
on the Web, and I got diverted and didn't

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:16.720
get that done.

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:23.190
But I will do that before tomorrow, you know,
in terms of forming your teams.

01:50:23.190 --> 01:50:28.949
Put together an idea of what system you would
like to work at.

01:50:28.949 --> 01:50:34.790
If you're not able to form up as part of a
team between now and Tuesday, just give me

01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:36.889
what your own personal preference is.

01:50:36.889 --> 01:50:42.450
And then we can look and see if different
people are interested in the same system.

01:50:42.450 --> 01:50:45.840
We'll let you all know and help you form up
teams.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:54.889
I'll make sure your email is there in the
student view.

01:50:54.889 --> 01:51:04.409
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] If you've already
formed a group then just turn in something

01:51:04.409 --> 01:51:05.409
as a group.

01:51:05.409 --> 01:51:06.409
That's fine.

01:51:06.409 --> 01:51:13.100
If not, if you haven't hooked up with somebody,
just let us know what system you're interested

01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:17.620
in working at and any ideas you might have
of what you're going to look at.

01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:26.090
Really, this is just a very, very short write-up
essentially to get you started.

01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:30.269
And that way, if you have any questions, we
can talk about it next Tuesday.
