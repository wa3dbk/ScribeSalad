00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.481
We talked about and gone through the history
of the Shuttle a little bit.

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:12.920
We're going to go into it some more today.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.840
But, to refresh your memory, there really
were three subsystems on the shuttle that

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.060
were pressing the state of the art.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.400
One was the thermal protection system which
we talked about, Tom Moser talked about.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.689
The other was the avionic system with the
computers, the computer synchronized.

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.760
The four computers synchronized because, as
we explained, the Orbiter really needs a computer

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.410
to fly because it is a fly-by-wire system,
which is statically unstable.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.000
And the other system that was pressing the
state of the art was the Space Shuttle main

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
engine.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.210
It had a high pressure, high temperature and
high performance.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.579
And so, you're going to hear about that today.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.570
Now, the person that's going to talk to you
--

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.510
Many of you, I'm sure, heard the term rocket
scientist but you probably don't really know

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.510
what that means.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.530
Well, today you're going to meet one.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.700
You're going to meet a true rocket scientist.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.921
J.R. Thompson was responsible for the design,
development, test and operation of the space

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:16.500
shuttle main engine.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.320
During Apollo J.R. had a very similar function
in the design and working on the launch vehicle

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.920
for the Apollo vehicle.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.479
He became director of the Marshall Space Flight
Center.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.409
Then he was deputy administrator at NASA in
Washington.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.009
And now he's president of Orbital Sciences.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.060
You're in for a real treat.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.770
Thanks, Aaron.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:54.170
Aaron asked me to consider this talk, I don't
know, several months ago.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:03.340
And I was a little hesitant at first, but
then the more I thought about it, it's given

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:12.050
me a good opportunity to go back and kind
of recount some of the highlights and the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.870
low points in the program.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.680
It was some 30 years ago for me.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.120
So, there is some of this that's going to
be still a little fuzzy.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.060
But there is a lot of it that it's just like
it was yesterday.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.180
Actually, the Shuttle main engine has its
roots back in the technology programs that

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.900
were funded and came out of Apollo.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:53.800
As early as the mid-1960s, people at the Marshall
Space Flight Center in the same propulsion

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.830
group that I was in, although my attention
was focused on Apollo at that time, were heavily

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:09.030
involved with Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rocketdyne
and Aerojet in developing the high-pressure

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:17.860
turbomachinery that would one day be envisioned
to use in the Shuttle, if there ever were

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.860
a Shuttle.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.290
So, that's back when it started.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.909
And there was a good bit of effort put in
at that time.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:38.680
I think, as you probably know, Rocketdyne
of North America won the contract in July.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.200
Actually, July 13th of 1971.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.401
So, shortly after Apollo.

00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:51.720
Apollo was still winding down when the Shuttle
Program got its legs.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.700
And the Shuttle main engine was one of the
very early awards because, as Aaron indicated,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.080
it was early on envisioned that that would
be what we called back then the long tent

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.670
pole in the program.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:19.910
It came on the heels of a one-year Phase B
competition between Pratt, Rocketdyne and

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.910
Aerojet.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:34.889
During this Phase B, NASA funded some technology
demonstrations, requirements definition and

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.190
that kind of thing.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:46.711
Actually, Rocketdyne, at that time, did a
very bold demonstration of what they call

00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:47.711
power head.

00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:51.790
And I will show you what that encompassed
in just a minute.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.940
But it was a demonstration of the heart of
the engine.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.389
It only operated for a short period of time
but very high pressure.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.660
It was risky.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.440
They pulled it off.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:15.530
It was actually driven by a fellow called
Paul Castenholz who was a guy coming out of

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.150
Apollo that basically solved or lead the team
that solved the combustion instability on

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.900
the F1 engine.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:34.470
Paul was a very ambitious fellow, very aggressive
and very bold in trying to capture this award

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.600
for Rocketdyne.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.120
At that time, though, NASA envisioned what
they called a fly back booster.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:50.490
The Shuttle main engine was envisioned to
be a common engine for the fly back booster,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.020
as well as the Orbiter.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:01.660
In that early concept, there would be 12 SSMEs
on the backend of the fly back booster operating

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:08.509
at 550,000 pounds of vacuum thrust.

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:18.819
And on the Orbiter configuration it was three
engines operating at 632,000 pounds of thrust

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.479
in vacuum.

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:30.630
Because of the money that was forecasted at
that time and that had been appropriated to

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.930
date, NASA was always behind the power curve
in the early phases of the program.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.620
And they never got everything they wanted.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:47.970
And I'm sure that Dale Myers and others that
have preceded me have told you the ins and

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:55.830
outs of why then NASA scaled back from the
fly back booster to the solid rocket motors.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:11.819
And so, at that point, the Shuttle main engine
was refocused at 470,000 pounds of thrust.

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:16.000
And that was what's called the rated power
level.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.349
At that time, I think there was a full power
level and an emergency power level of 109%

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:29.050
of the rated thrust that was in the program,
but I'll show you a view graph in a minute

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:38.270
that has the specific parameters of the engine
as it finally settled out.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:44.169
After the award, Pratt &amp; Whitney protested.

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:51.879
It was a hard fought competition.

00:07:51.879 --> 00:08:01.509
NASA had specified that they wanted an engine
bell configuration, a nozzle bell as opposed

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:08.330
to Rocketdyne's aerodynamic spike that they
had promoted in the late `60s.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.610
I'm not sure if everybody here knows what
an aerospike is.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.599
You may say one or two things about it.

00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:19.740
Well, it's a truncated nozzle.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:37.020
Actually, it's packaged and derives the nozzle
from the expansion of the gases here where

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:43.769
the nozzle wall is formed by additional gases
that come out in the cooling system.

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:51.640
And it's a very high performing engine.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:09:00.140
Its 
packaging is certainly an advantage where

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.830
you don't need a big boat tail, say like you
would with the engine.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:12.930
You're saving about 10 or 12 feet there and
the weight that goes along with it.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:21.431
Pratt &amp; Whitney had been focusing on a bell
nozzle all the time.

00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:28.850
And frankly those of us that were kind of
on the periphery of this program and still

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:38.440
involved in the Apollo kind of figured that
Pratt had the advantage in this because Rocketdyne

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:44.640
was, of course, awarded the propulsion systems
for the Apollo Saturn Program.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.250
And it was kind of viewed as Pratt &amp; Whitney's
turn.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.580
It didn't turn out that way.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:10:05.560
I attribute a lot of that to the good proposal,
the boldness and the demonstration program

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:15.230
that Rocketdyne accomplished during the competitive
period.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.790
Anyway, Pratt &amp; Whitney protested.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.670
It took about nine months for the protest
to be settled.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:32.120
It was settled in favor of Rocketdyne.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:41.200
In the meantime, Rocketdyne was allowed to
continue to work with the contractors on the

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.920
vehicle side because they hadn't made the
selection at that time there.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.440
So they could continue to support their work.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.640
Anyway, in 1972, it was all settled.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:01.769
The contract was awarded cost plus.

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:09.579
And, as I recall, it was $200 million for
the development which was called Phase A,

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:15.410
and $200 million for the production which
was called Phase B.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:22.269
And the Phase B program included, I believe,
26 production engines.

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:30.839
I won't comment as to what the costs eventually
grew to, but very substantially beyond that.

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:43.709
Let me kind of highlight for you the characteristics
of the 

00:11:43.709 --> 00:11:44.709
engine.

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:47.220
I think I mentioned the thrust levels.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:52.920
The rated power level was 470,000 pounds.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:12:01.200
It had the capability, if an engine was out
early and you wanted to abort the orbit to

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:08.639
throttle the engine up to 109% of the rated
thrust that was called full power level.

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:14.110
Early on in the program, I think it was termed
emergency power level.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:24.300
But, at the rated conditions, it accommodated
or required a little over 3,000 pounds per

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.200
square inch chamber pressure in the combustion
chamber.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.500
The area ratio of the nozzle was 77:1.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.410
It had a very good specific impulse.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.040
About 453, 454.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:55.760
That compares to J2 in Apollo of about 442,
as I recall, somewhere in that range.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.589
Weight was about 7,000 pounds.

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:04.269
Life 7.5 hours and 55 missions.

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:07.620
That's quite misleading, though, let me tell
you.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.889
And I'll comment more on this as we go through.

00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:17.981
But it was a very tough development program.

00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:25.700
It took from '72, as I mentioned, through
first flight in 1981.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:35.570
I joined the program after Apollo and after
Skylab in May of 1974.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:46.200
And it was torture from there until the first
flight in April of '81.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:54.199
Early on it was envisioned that, as I mentioned,
the SSME would be used for both the fly back

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:58.329
booster and the Orbiter configuration.

00:13:58.329 --> 00:14:01.670
It would use basically the same power head.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:07.399
You would just change out the nozzles to give
you the two engine thrust levels.

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:10.630
And so it was rather simple in that concept.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.230
Of course, that's not the way it worked out.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:17.170
It went to one configuration to service the
Orbiter.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:30.820
And so everything was optimized and focused
on that.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:43.449
Now let me say a few words about the schematic
itself and what the engine looked like.

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:51.880
In conceptual terms, it had two low pressure
pumps which were required to give the proper

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:58.149
inlet pressures to both high pressure pumps
to avoid cavitation.

00:14:58.149 --> 00:15:00.720
It had the two high pressure pumps.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:08.760
It was all fed through a common power head
to a thrust chamber assembly and then into

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.360
the nozzle.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:26.000
Starting on the fuel side, the fuel pump increased
the pressure to about 300 pounds per square

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.769
inch.

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:34.800
And then that went into the high pressure
pump on the fuel side where the pressure was

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.380
boosted to a little over 6,000 pounds per
square inch.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:46.050
About 80% of the fuel all went to the two
pre-burners, the fuel and the oxidizer pre-burner

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:53.070
contrasted to about 12% of the oxidizer.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:16:03.710
That was to provide a very fuel rich power
system to drive the two turbines, the high

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.829
pressure fuel pump turbine and the LOX pump
turbine.

00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:27.959
The turbine temperatures were in the range
of 1750 degrees air ranking.

00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:40.570
Almost all of the housing structure on probably
80% of the engine was Inconel, very tough

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.490
steel.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.830
Able to take very high pressures.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:54.279
As I mentioned, the combustion pressure in
the chamber was about 3,000 pounds per square

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.279
inch.

00:16:55.279 --> 00:17:03.709
At the entry to the pre-burners, the pressure
could get up to 8,000 pounds per square inch.

00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:06.860
It was a very high pressure system up and
down.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.110
It was all in series.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:15.069
In other words, this was the way they achieved
the high efficiency.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:22.169
All of the propellant came through the low
pressure system, the high pressure system

00:17:22.169 --> 00:17:26.880
into the pre-burners, in through the cooling
circuits, all in the hot gas manifold, all

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.010
in the main chamber, all of it exited the
nozzle.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:39.059
None was dumped overboard to simplify the
flow pad.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:47.280
A good bit of the fuel at the exit of the
high pressure pump went directly to feed the

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.900
two pre-burners.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:57.880
A good bit of it, about 20% of it went to
cool the nozzle, then up through and cool

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.039
the --

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:12.450
Rather drove the turbine because, having cooled
the nozzle, it was converted to a warm gas

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:20.160
which then drove the low pressure turbine,
came back in and was captured and served to

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.531
cool the shell of the hot gas manifold.

00:18:23.531 --> 00:18:29.560
The same similar thing on the oxidizer side.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:36.169
By the way, I'll mention the speed of the
low pressure fuel pump was about 15,000 rpm

00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:40.950
and high pressure fuel pump about 35,000 rpm.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:47.580
The speed of the low pressure LOX pump was
5,000 rpm and of the high pressure oxidizer

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.220
pump about 30,000 rpm.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:58.620
The discharge of the low pressure LOX pump
was about 250 pounds per square inch entered

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:09.580
into the main LOX pump where the pressure
was elevated to 4500 pounds per square inch.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:19.289
Then it went some to the pre-burners and the
rest directly into the main combustion chamber.

00:19:19.289 --> 00:19:29.800
Some part of the lock flow then was further
boosted to about a little over 8,000 pounds

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.690
per square inch, which fed the oxidizer into
the two pre-burners.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:40.660
It was a very efficient cycle, very high pressured
cycle.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.940
A couple other features that you don't see
on this chart, there was a heat exchanger

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:54.590
wrapped around the high pressure oxidizer
turbo pump turbine which served to preheat

00:19:54.590 --> 00:20:04.160
gas to pressurize the oxidizer tank.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:13.220
I think those are the major points that I
would make on the cycle itself.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:18.840
Most of the problems, I'll just point out
here, had very few problems with the two low

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.600
pressure pumps.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:28.330
A lot of technology in the high pressure pumps,
both fuel and oxidizer.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:38.720
The main problem with the high pressure fuel
pump was sub-synchronous whirl, and I'll say

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.460
a little bit more about this in a moment.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:47.071
It was a very traumatic time in the early
period of developing the Shuttle main engine.

00:20:47.071 --> 00:20:49.880
It caused a lot of delays.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.600
A tough problem to solve.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.990
And I'll mention what caused it and how we
solved it.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:07.320
Then the high pressure oxidizer turbopump
bearing overloads, LOX fires, explosions.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:21.780
That was probably the single toughest component
to developing the program as I recall it.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:32.850
I think those are the major points that I'll
make there.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:43.870
Early on it was planned, because they had
such a head start 

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:56.409
in planning for the development of this program,
to be done in a very methodical way.

00:21:56.409 --> 00:22:03.070
And they had, when I say they I'm talking
about the people at Marshall with the people

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:12.850
at Rocketdyne, a very elaborate system of
design verification systems where you couldn't

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:20.750
progress to the next stage until you had passed
certain testing on a valve or on a low pressure

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:21.750
pump.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:30.929
And all this was envisioned to be done at
Santa Suzanna which is right out a short distance

00:22:30.929 --> 00:22:38.900
from Canova Park up in the mountain on some
test facilities that both NASA and Rocketdyne

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:48.200
owned up at that time and that they were carried
over and upgraded from the Apollo program

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.669
to be done on the component facilities up
there.

00:22:52.669 --> 00:23:03.409
But because of the high pressures involved
it became a very expensive undertaking, a

00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:17.100
lot of money, too much time, huge facilities,
valves that were probably as big as that side

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:24.549
wall over here, to be able to handle these
high pressures to assist in the development

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:28.549
of this high pressure turbomachinery.

00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:35.950
I think it became pretty clear, pretty early
in the program, that that very methodical

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:42.780
way of developing the engine, and that is,
before we go to an engine system test, let's

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.990
develop it at the component level so we eliminate
those problems.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.100
Although, theoretically it sounded very good.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.409
It just didn't work.

00:23:52.409 --> 00:23:59.559
The facilities were not available in time
to do that.

00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:08.380
And the money was going to be exorbitant Kind
of a side story.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:16.930
There was a contractor Bovey Crail as I recall
was the name of the contractor out in Los

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:17.930
Angeles.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:28.960
And early in the program when they were having
contract discussions and Bovey Crail was late

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:35.380
and Rocketdyne, at the instance of NASA, was
withholding money until they made certain

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.419
progress.

00:24:37.419 --> 00:24:44.700
And so this fellow who was the president of
Rocketdyne, Bill Brennan, I was spending a

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:51.660
lot of time out there, and he invited me to
sit in this meeting that he was going to have

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.020
with the head of Bovey Crail.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.760
I guess he thought maybe it would impress
him that somebody from NASA was watching this

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.870
thing.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:01.870
Anyway, so I joined him.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.400
I think it was a Saturday morning.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.730
And both Bill and I had on suits, coats and
ties.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:18.360
And this contractor or head guy from Bovey
Crail came in with some white bucks.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.140
He had on some yellow pants and a pink shirt.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.500
And he plopped down on Bill's sofa there.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:35.039
And, before Bill could open his mouth, he
said all I want is my blankety blank money.

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:37.539
And so it was a short discussion.

00:25:37.539 --> 00:25:47.600
[LAUGHTER] He was there to collect his money
and Brennan couldn't pay him because of some

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.280
of the restrictions that NASA had.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:55.110
So, it was a messy deal trying to get those
facilities built.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:26:03.049
And it became clear that we were going to
have to develop the components in parallel

00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:04.710
with the engine test.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:14.010
It was the biggest systems engineering challenge
that I think we had in the shuttle program.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:21.450
Certainly, there were a lot of challenges
in major systems integrating the shuttle engine

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.610
into the Orbiter, for example.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:29.919
But down at the engine level, the systems
engineering, to develop those components,

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:36.280
the two low pressure pumps, the two high pressure
pumps, the pre-burners, the hot gas manifold,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:41.270
the main injector, all the control valves.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:47.380
And then we also had on the engine, which
I didn't show on the schematic, a computer,

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:53.470
redundant computers that were cross-strapped
so that the input or the output could be cross-strapped

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:59.231
and be very tolerant to failure.

00:26:59.231 --> 00:27:06.049
We went to what we call an integrated subsystem
test bed, ISTB.

00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:10.630
That became the bobtail engine of the program.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:21.710
Bobtail was a 35:1 area ratio nozzle which
allows us to not only start the engine but

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:29.430
to operate it at the throttle condition 50%
of the rated thrust and the nozzle would still

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.840
flow full.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.320
It would not separate.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:38.919
And so then we could proceed with the development
of the testing or the development of the engine

00:27:38.919 --> 00:27:39.919
program.

00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:52.260
It was an efficient way to go about the program
so we didn't stall.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:28:00.090
It was tough because we had to solve the engine
problems in parallel with the component problems

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.470
all at the same time.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:07.270
And sometimes it was hard to tell which was
the problem.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:13.000
We started our first test in May of 1975.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:25.299
That is me there on the left, and Norm Reuel
who replaced Paul Castenholz they're in the

00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:32.711
center, and Dom Sanchini who I view to this
day as the strength of the Shuttle Program,

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:39.260
or rather the main engine who eventually replaced
Norm.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:46.409
A few comments on the evolution of some of
the people on the contractor side.

00:28:46.409 --> 00:28:55.870
I mentioned Paul Castenholz who to me was
the key to Rocketdyne winning the program.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:29:04.580
At that time, and this is a personal view,
I think Rocketdyne took a big sigh of relief

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:13.419
after they won the contract, probably relaxed
a little too long, got in trouble up at Santa

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:21.270
Susanna in not developing that component facility.

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:33.870
The test control centers up there, Coke bottles
were laying around, so it was not a well-disciplined

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.870
operation.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:39.399
They had gotten lax, I guess, was the best
way to say it.

00:29:39.399 --> 00:29:46.520
Norm Reuel came in to run the program at the
request of NASA.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:57.700
He had done the same job on a J2 and other
programs within Rocketdyne for the Saturn

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:06.270
Program and worked with me and the other fellows
at Marshall.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:15.241
And we appointed Dom to drive this ISTB to
help us learn how to start the engine to how

00:30:15.241 --> 00:30:21.630
we could properly integrate a number of the
components into the engine and proved in the

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:29.350
long-run to be a very valuable tool.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:37.240
This chart depicts the buildup of run time
on the engine.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:45.919
Test seconds are plotted on the right in thousands,
and the number of tests plotted on the left

00:30:45.919 --> 00:30:48.640
and the year is shown down here.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.000
We started, as I mentioned, in 1975.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:05.640
We finally flew in April of 1981 on STS-1.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.880
The title, someone asked me a little earlier,
that's first manned orbital flight.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:17.059
That's what we referred to our goal back at
that time.

00:31:17.059 --> 00:31:26.160
I've highlighted along the way, I believe,
14 major engine explosions all of which were

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.190
very traumatic in themselves.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:35.830
I'll show you some pictures shortly of what
an engine looks like after it goes through

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:36.830
that.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:42.160
And then you can extrapolate that to envision
what was in the boat tail of the Orbiter had

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:49.730
it occurred in flight and what it would have
done to the flight itself.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:53.409
The test seconds curve is down here.

00:31:53.409 --> 00:32:02.769
You can see the long plateau of about nine
months where a combination of learning to

00:32:02.769 --> 00:32:12.590
properly ignite the engine without over-temping
the turbine blades or other parts of the turbine

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:20.490
combined with what I'll call this sub-synchronous
whirl on the high pressure fuel pump.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:29.820
Sub-synchronous whirl, there is a very exotic
definition of it, but it's an orbiting of

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:38.279
the shaft within the bearings themselves caused
by a softening of that system.

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:43.530
And you can imagine the softening is attributed
to overheating of the bearings.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.110
You don't have the stiffness.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:56.679
And so this allows the rotor to orbit there,
vibrations get very high and we have to shut

00:32:56.679 --> 00:32:58.880
the engine down.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:08.000
We couldn't get into the test, but about 2.35
seconds was the nominal time before we would

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:17.169
encounter this very high vibration and then
have to shut the engine down.

00:33:17.169 --> 00:33:24.000
And then after that the engine and the turbomachinery
were located down in Mississippi where we

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.779
were doing the testing.

00:33:31.779 --> 00:33:33.980
It wasn't like you could just try it again.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:39.190
You had to bring it all back, replace the
bearings, try to figure out what the problem

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.690
was and put in some kind of a fix.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:48.659
We went through a number of fixes trying to
stiffen the system so we could be able to

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:52.370
tolerate and drive through.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:58.549
I thought at that time that if we could ever
get through this period then we would be all

00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:59.899
right.

00:33:59.899 --> 00:34:09.990
But, as it turned out [NOISE OBSCURES].

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:18.061
Well, it manifested itself in overheating
of the bearings, spalling of the bearings

00:34:18.061 --> 00:34:26.740
in their raceways.

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:35.659
I think turbine speeds at that time, or the
speed of the rotor was probably in the 15,000

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:43.429
rpm before you could catch the engine and
shut it down operating for a second or a half

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:50.021
a second with those high side loads, inadequate
cooling, overheating of the bearings.

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:56.159
You'd get the bearings back and you'd put
them in your hand and they were very much

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:57.159
damaged.

00:34:57.159 --> 00:35:04.780
I mean that was the manifestation of the problem.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:21.050
We went into this for quite a period of time.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.859
I think what I wanted to capture was the picture
over here.

00:35:24.859 --> 00:35:25.859
Ignore this.

00:35:25.859 --> 00:35:27.400
This is more dramatic.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.770
I will come back to that later.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:35.790
But this is a high pressure fuel turbopump.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:45.750
The sub-synchronous whirl and the overheating
of the bearings occurred on the turbine side.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.849
The coolant path is probably going to be hard
for you to see, but you come through some

00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:51.240
labyrinth seals here.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:59.940
You go down this passage, up through the center
of the shaft and in through some provisions

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:05.099
that were made to cool the bearings on a turbine
end.

00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:12.280
We brought in a lot of external consultants,
had a lot of cooperation from people across

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:21.329
the country, but after nine months it was
one of the internal guys at Rocketdyne, Joe

00:36:21.329 --> 00:36:27.390
Stangeland, and some of the people in his
turbomachinery group that came up with the

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:36.900
idea that there was a vortex that was occurring
in this cavity on a turbine end.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:41.651
And what we had to do was to kill that vortex
and then allow the coolant to go through.

00:36:41.651 --> 00:36:48.570
And so he put a little what he called a paddle,
which is this part you see right here, which

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:58.250
is about the size of dime that was screwed
into here to the rotor at that point.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:05.120
And the first task, after we included the
paddle right off the block where the engine

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:13.950
had been stalled and couldn't get beyond about
2.35 seconds, went right up to the minimum

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:22.470
power level, which is the power level we had
set and planned all of the tests to accelerate

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:26.550
to that level if we could make it.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:36.510
And so it was a very dramatic solution, fix,
and allowed the program to move on and see

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:43.240
what was behind the next hurtle we were going
to run into.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:50.760
So this problem number one was just being
able to understand and accommodate the start

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.500
sequence.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.839
You had to start the engine fuel rich.

00:37:57.839 --> 00:38:06.250
Any excessive oxidizer would give you a cutoff
because of all the sensors that we had.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:13.730
The second problem and the one that causes
the most time that I've mentioned is the high

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:17.619
pressure fuel turbopump sub-synchronous whirl.

00:38:17.619 --> 00:38:29.790
And then problem number three, which are duplicated
here several times, are the LOX pump explosions.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:40.390
They could be triggered by loss of a turbine
blade on a turbine end which would unbalance

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:52.210
the rotor, overload the bearings and then
cause a LOX rich fire which very quickly consumed

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.450
the whole engine.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:39:03.680
There were numerous, well, I think three,
rather four highlighted there.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.370
We had some other problems.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:13.960
I've noted a fuel pre-burner burn through,
just a structural burn through of the [OVERLAPPING

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:14.960
VOICES].

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:21.490
How did you eventually solve that, because
the last failure you had was also the liquid

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:28.010
oxygen explosion?

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:37.349
Well, I'm not sure I can differentiate between
the LOX pump explosions.

00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:51.510
But late in the program, probably at that
time, we had been having for a long time problems

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.190
with the turbine blades, very limited life.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.079
Cracks would grow.

00:39:57.079 --> 00:40:03.730
At that time, we didn't really understand
how long we could run them before we had to

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:11.230
replace them so we went to dampers on the
turbine blades.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:21.400
And this occurred fairly late in the program
that eventually solved the vibration of the

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:29.170
blades within the turbine wheel stack and
allowed us to proceed.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:35.180
Whether that was that one that caused the
imbalance of the rotor or some earlier when

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:42.000
they were primarily driven by bearing problems
considered for some time.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.880
We used ball bearings in the Rocketdyne turbomachinery.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.280
Later in the program they had gone to roller
bearings.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.011
Pratt &amp; Whitney has been contracted to develop
that.

00:40:56.011 --> 00:41:06.780
But the bearing problems and turbine blades
were the major problem, as I recall, that

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.589
caused the LOX pump problem.

00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:19.960
As a matter of fact, 
yes.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:30.550
Do you think you would have had similar problems
if you had developed an aerospike instead?

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:34.780
The turbo machinery was going to have to be
basically the same.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:41.380
And so, no, I think you'd have the same problems.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:53.230
The only problems that we had on the engine,
we had a nozzle steer horn failure.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:42:00.030
That was just a structural feed line that
was in the shape of a steer horn at the aft

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:03.200
end of the bell nozzle.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:09.730
We had two of those structural failures that
were very traumatic for the program.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:17.000
No, they were both right here.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:26.290
And, of course, as soon as you lose the coolant
to the nozzle, you start shutting down a lot

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:32.140
of the engine system LOX rich which causes
a fire.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.000
Certainly, you would have eliminated those.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:45.599
You would have eliminated a number of I'll
call them nuisance problems in terms of we

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:53.690
had 1,080 tubes that made up the nozzle that
we flowed the hydrogen through to keep the

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:54.690
nozzle cool.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:57.430
1,080 of them.

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:04.790
And we had a number of, again, I would call
them nuisance cracks or splits in those tubes

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.990
that we learned to live with.

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:14.520
We learned to go out and put a cap on them
post-flight, braise over and just cap off

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.780
the leak.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.130
Certainly, you wouldn't have had those.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:23.619
But all of the other problems I would have
seen come in between the aerospike as well

00:43:23.619 --> 00:43:24.790
as the bell nozzle.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:44.360
J.R., the shuttle main engine had the pressures
that you mentioned, the 3,000 pounds per square

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.760
inch up to 8,000.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.829
Give us some feeling for just how much higher
that was than the previous operational engine

00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:50.420
and whether the pressure itself was causing
a lot of those problems.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:44:02.740
Oh, yes, the J2, chamber pressure was about
700 pounds per square inch, as I recall it.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:11.390
RL10, which was the first LOX/hydrogen engine
in the country developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney,

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:17.740
chamber pressure was a couple hundred pounds
per square inch.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:24.060
This was a real push.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.109
Was it worth it?

00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:34.660
As you look back on the engine, you've now
taken into orbit over 300 of these engines

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.359
and 100 flights three at a time.

00:44:38.359 --> 00:44:48.800
You have had one shut down because of a safety
sensor that failed and shut one engine down

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.030
in flight.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:55.099
And we were far enough along in the flight
so we aborted to orbit and the other two burned

00:44:55.099 --> 00:45:00.210
a little longer and went to orbit.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:05.130
But it was a very costly program.

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:17.530
On some reflection, it was almost viewed in
the late `60s as that's the challenge.

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:20.450
Not the shuttle engine but the technology.

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:26.271
I mean let's really drive the technology and
make it very efficient, very high pressure.

00:45:26.271 --> 00:45:34.540
Aaron and I were talking a little earlier.

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:42.160
The engine people, had the Orbiter flown a
100 times and had several major failures,

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.869
people would have expected the Shuttle engine,
I think, to have been the cause.

00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:47.310
That's not the way it turned out.

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:52.400
And I'll comment on at least a contributor
in just a minute.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:46:07.930
But this is the aftermath.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:16.280
When you're in the middle of a development
program, you've got a lot of budget pressures,

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:24.490
you've got the Shuttle's first flight date
changed several times, you've got all that

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:33.260
hanging over your head and then you're called
down on Mississippi on a test and you look

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:40.160
down on the engine and that's what it looks
like, it's like a kick in the stomach.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.470
You've got to start all over.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:50.420
Well, that mental picture was in our minds
14 times in this program where you had to

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.420
start over.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:59.460
The recovery was typically it took about a
month.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:11.390
We formed a team, usually within Rocketdyne
and one within NASA, to go solve the problem.

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:20.960
Probably half of the time it was fairly evident
what the problem was quickly after the test.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:26.490
Sometimes it took a couple of weeks to narrow
it down it could have been this or that.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:34.349
And then you fix both this or that not knowing
exactly what it was.

00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:41.589
And so it was a very tedious and time-consuming.

00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:43.020
We were testing around the clock.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:49.760
If it occurred during the holidays you just
cancelled your holidays and jumped in, and

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.760
we did what we had to do.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:58.940
I will mention, as I look back, kind of one
of the dumbest things that I did on this program

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:02.660
was somewhat associated with the testing.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:11.849
This happened to be, I think back early on
in the sub-synchronous whirl days, we were

00:48:11.849 --> 00:48:18.560
changing out the turbo machinery after almost
every test because we were doing the damage

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.650
to the bearings that I described a little
earlier.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:29.099
And it took about three shifts to change out
a turbopump down in Mississippi.

00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:38.599
And then it took flight time to get the turbopump
back to LA and then tear it down.

00:48:38.599 --> 00:48:44.780
We had others in the meantime that we were
bringing along, but it was very time-consuming.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:53.800
And it was in the middle of the summer back
in whenever it was, '75 or whenever, and a

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.410
lot of rain showers.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:49:00.210
And that was holding us up because when it
was raining or it looked like it was going

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:05.230
to rain, you couldn't open up the engine,
drop the pump and take it back.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.130
So, that slowed us down.

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:14.700
And so I had a brilliant idea of first of
all, the engine, if any of you have ever been

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.300
down to Mississippi on those test stands,
it's on about the fifth level is the engine

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.390
position, about the fifth level.

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:28.750
And so on about the seventh level I wanted
to put here, what I want to call, a rain shield.

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:39.560
Put a tin roof a couple of levels higher than
the engine so the workers wouldn't have to

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.510
stop when it was raining.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:44.809
Well, you can probably imagine what happened.

00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:46.559
That was OK for a while.

00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:52.609
And then we were back into a test and we had
a hydrogen leak.

00:49:52.609 --> 00:50:02.670
And we weren't using the igniters at that
time at the end of the bell to burn off the

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.670
leak.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:10.720
So that leak just accumulated on those two
stories up to that rain shield.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:15.640
And then, when we went into the test and lit
the engine off, the whole Mississippi sky,

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.569
you know, there wasn't any fuel.

00:50:19.569 --> 00:50:22.970
It burned all the wires.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:26.470
It didn't damage the end canal on the engine
structure.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:31.710
I certainly got a lot of ribbing after that.

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:41.730
And, as I recall, the test was toward the
evening.

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:50.750
I wasn't down there at the time to see it,
but was listening to the test over the phone.

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:53.260
And the guys almost couldn't speak.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:58.559
I mean the whole place went up.

00:50:58.559 --> 00:50:59.829
These kinds of failures --

00:50:59.829 --> 00:51:05.900
This was not evidence of a little fuel fire.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:11.150
This was oxidizer and the fuel was the metal.

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:21.990
And so it was quite a problem for us.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:30.000
I might mention at this time that just this
last summer I attended a little event there

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.960
in Huntsville where the Rocketdyne team came
down.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:41.230
And now the engine program had just passed
its millionth test second mark.

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:49.240
And so you can see, for STS-1, the total test
seconds were about 110,000.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:52:00.660
A little over half of that, 65,000, almost
70,000 at the rated conditions, the conditions

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.200
you flew it at.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:15.420
And so it's gone up by about a factor of ten
in the meantime.

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:31.950
Another key to the Shuttle engine program
was the philosophy imparted by John Yardley.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:38.970
I think he recognized early on that we had
bitten off probably a little bit more than

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:49.410
we could chew to have an engine that you could
solve the problems of where you put the bearings

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:52.630
in there.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.500
The earlier view graph I had said 55 starts.

00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:00.450
You ran them for five starts and they came
out in pristine condition.

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:02.830
That wasn't going to happen.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:12.099
And the turbine blades, one blade failure,
I actually forget how many are in those two

00:53:12.099 --> 00:53:22.050
stages on that wheel, probably well over a
hundred, but one would offset or offload the

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:23.050
balance on that rotor.

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:31.710
Then you would overload the bearing going
at the high speed of the 35,000 rpm's and

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:33.640
would fail it.

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:41.030
The turbine blades, you just could not tolerate
a failure.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:47.599
But in evidence after testing, where you can
tear the blades down and de-stack them and

00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:52.040
look at them under a microscope, you could
see fatigue cracks.

00:53:52.040 --> 00:54:01.980
And so all of us, I think, but John provided
the leadership, recognized this fact.

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:08.040
And if the requirement were going to be that
you wouldn't fly with turbine blade cracks,

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.390
we weren't going to fly.

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:21.471
And so he encouraged us, in that instance,
in bearings and probably other areas to test

00:54:21.471 --> 00:54:30.840
to failure, drive it to failure, know where
the cliff was and then back off a sufficient

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.530
amount.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:41.640
And then conduct your certification with cracked
blades, with spalled bearings so that it was

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:51.550
clear to everybody, it was clear to the people
that were running the program and others that

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:59.799
had to fly that the problem was understood,
we thought reasonably well understood, and

00:54:59.799 --> 00:55:05.369
it was tested to accommodate that condition.

00:55:05.369 --> 00:55:13.680
And so that was the philosophy that was engrained
in the Shuttle.

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:18.190
And probably not enough in some of the other
areas.

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:29.420
The Shuttle Engine Program was a little bit
blessed with this fear of failure.

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:32.130
It's the toughest technical problem so we
got the most money.

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:36.430
I mean it's not all a downside.

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:46.559
So, we got the money to provide the test depth
that provided the insight to the Shuttle managers

00:55:46.559 --> 00:55:51.829
that could make the call as to when we were
ready to go.

00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:55.690
The squeaky wheel gets oiled.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:56:04.059
I contrast that with maybe the famous O rings
on the booster.

00:56:04.059 --> 00:56:14.880
That was a problem that was kind of observed,
a few tests were run, but not enough, you

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.349
know, not to failure.

00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:22.041
It wasn't ever tested to failure on the ground.

00:56:22.041 --> 00:56:31.710
It was tested so you could see that the O
rings were split maybe but not to be staring

00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:39.700
at a picture like that as to what is going
to happen when that O ring gives and very

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.270
quickly can burn through.

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:48.309
And the other example I would make is a tank.

00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:55.990
And this is the most frustrating to me because
early on we all saw some of that foam come

00:56:55.990 --> 00:57:06.089
off, but not in the sized pieces that the
Shuttle Program saw three flights before Columbia.

00:57:06.089 --> 00:57:10.349
I mean that was a piece of foam about this
size.

00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:13.500
It came straight down the vehicle.

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:20.220
It made a small dent in the aft skirt of the
solid rocket boosters that were subsequently

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.250
recovered.

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:28.120
But that should have been an eye-opener that
that piece of foam doesn't always have to

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:32.000
go straight down the side of that vehicle.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:39.400
It could get out in the slip stream and hit
a wing or something.

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:47.210
That type of testing was 
never done.

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:58.670
Whereas, on the engine program, there were
a number of flaws that were accommodated and

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:00.579
we felt comfortable with.

00:58:00.579 --> 00:58:08.170
Now, you go and read the Challenger report,
you read the Columbia report, and they will

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:17.970
almost tell you that NASA became comfortable
with flaws.

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:20.609
And that lead to the problem.

00:58:20.609 --> 00:58:26.180
But I take issue with that.

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:32.579
I viewed it different because that was almost
the foundation of the Shuttle Engine Program.

00:58:32.579 --> 00:58:34.589
It was built on flaws.

00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:52.470
It was tested so wherever the soft spots were
you knew it and you attacked it and tested

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:57.109
it in the appropriate way.

00:58:57.109 --> 00:59:04.410
John Yardley, I keep coming back to him, as
a part of the certification program of which

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:13.130
I think prior to the first Orbiter flight
there were eight certifications completed.

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:16.420
One of those certifications was to be conducted.

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:22.010
And a certification, as I recall, was about
13 tests.

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:26.069
One was abort to orbit which was 623 seconds.

00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:35.059
And a nominal shuttle test or mission is 520
seconds, I think.

00:59:35.059 --> 00:59:42.329
And then an RTLS, return to launch site is
820 something seconds.

00:59:42.329 --> 00:59:44.130
It had a mix of those in there.

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:48.981
The engine had some FPL, full power level.

00:59:48.981 --> 00:59:56.540
It was tested at all of the limits, but in
some of those certifications we had to go

00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.589
into the test with cracked turbine blades.

00:59:59.589 --> 01:00:04.450
We started the test with a known crack.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:14.520
And we knew, by analysis, what its growth
rate was that we had judged from other tests.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:18.380
And so we planted blades that did that.

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:23.030
We did the same thing with bearings.

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:31.240
One time both Dom Sanchini and I were trying
to get the most on every test.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:39.230
We put cracked blades and spalled balls and
combined them all in a test.

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:40.670
Now, Yardley didn't mean that.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:44.150
He didn't want to go that far.

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:57.430
But there was a lot of NASA leadership that
bucked up the back of the program manager's,

01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:59.089
both myself and Sanchini.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:05.950
I mean they knew the way to develop the confidence
in this engine was to test it.

01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:08.800
And that became the theme.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.720
That isn't true today.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.150
And that's what I worry about.

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:22.700
And I can come back and comment a little bit
more on that in a minute.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:28.940
I will say a few more words about Dom Sanchini.

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:39.990
He passed away about 15 years ago, probably
in his early sixties, was the deputy program

01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:50.559
manager on the F1 engine to Paul Castenholz,
a good engineer.

01:01:50.559 --> 01:01:58.480
He was a lawyer by trade but had also accumulated
a good background well steeped in engineering.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.549
He was a hard driver.

01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:11.680
He thrived on failures because he saw a failure
as that's when you're on the steepest part

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.680
of the learning curve.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:19.610
You never learn more than in the aftermath
of a failure where you're forced to go through

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:26.579
and look at all of the data and postulate
a lot of other different failure modes.

01:02:26.579 --> 01:02:32.450
He thrived on it.

01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:43.470
And he made sure that the whole Rocketdyne
team viewed it in that light so he was a real

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:44.491
strength to the program.

01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:55.400
I want to allow a little bit of time for some
discussion.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.730
A few minutes ago I alluded to the fact, but
that's not the case now.

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:11.210
The Shuttle engine, 
back in the hay-day or the time period when

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:16.910
we were in the development program, we were
building them around the clock out of Canova

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:32.589
Park three shifts out on a manufacturing floor
probably at a rate of about one a month, ten

01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:36.809
a year, that's about right.

01:03:36.809 --> 01:03:41.590
So, a pretty high production right there.

01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:48.280
I could probably ask for a show of hands,
do you know how much a shuttle engine costs,

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.190
you know, just to make one?

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:53.730
Do you have the foggiest idea?

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:59.190
My last count was about $40 million.

01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:09.280
I imagine in today's money it's probably closer
to $60 million a copy.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:17.809
But today they build about three-quarters
of an engine a year so the production rate

01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:19.900
is way down.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:30.309
They test, aside from a lot of the terrible
consequence of the two hurricanes down at

01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:33.560
Slidell, you know, they're not testing anything
right now.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:41.589
But, even prior to this time, the testing
was very infrequent.

01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:46.270
That's to save money.

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:48.230
You don't get that much out of it.

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:58.260
And that's the Achilles' heel, I view, of
the Shuttle Program.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:03.350
If you're not going to do it right, whether
you cannot afford to do it right or you have

01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:09.619
other ambitions, you want to do something
else in the Space Program or within NASA,

01:05:09.619 --> 01:05:10.940
you probably ought to stop it.

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:20.770
Because it's going to be the next failure
if you don't treat it right.

01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:26.440
Today you've got the Shuttle Program, back
when the engine started.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:32.819
It is a little over almost 3.5 decades old.

01:05:32.819 --> 01:05:42.780
That's at a minimum two generational changes
and a lot of small businesses that support

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.839
the Shuttle Program.

01:05:44.839 --> 01:05:54.329
And so you're going to lose a lot of the knowledge
when you have the turnover of these generational

01:05:54.329 --> 01:05:55.780
changes.

01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:01.109
And little things, I'll tell you, when you
look back.

01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:12.730
One of the major disappointments to me or
traumatic times in the program was back in

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:21.840
the late `70s when we were building the first
three engines that would power Columbia on

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:30.819
STS-1, when we were building those engines
we had a mix-up of well wire in the Canoga

01:06:30.819 --> 01:06:32.140
plan.

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:36.950
And the mix-up was the well wire was, you
know, one could take a heat treat and the

01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:39.380
other one couldn't take a heat treat.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:47.010
I forget the application where you wanted
the non-heat treatable well wire, but that

01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:53.789
was a mom and pop operation that came in,
got the well wire, took it home and cleaned

01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:58.859
it and then delivered it back in baskets to
Rocketdyne.

01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:00.720
Well, they got it mixed up.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:07.450
And so we built the first three flight engines
with well wire that would not take a heat

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:10.059
treat that we depended on.

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:17.000
You go out and look at those engines with
inches and inches and rows and rows of wells

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.109
that are not to the proper heat treat.

01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:30.329
We had to go through and analyze every section
and over test those engines at a little higher

01:07:30.329 --> 01:07:38.790
pressure than we normally would have to be
able to show that having been built with the

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:46.829
wrong well wire it was still good enough because
the design was up to FPL and a little beyond.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:50.789
That it could still take it and operate at
the rated thrust condition.

01:07:50.789 --> 01:08:02.369
It is mistakes like that, that without frequent
manufacturing exposure, without frequent test

01:08:02.369 --> 01:08:09.180
use you're going to lose in a program and
will become the next --

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:13.770
You know, the program has not been surprised
by a problem yet.

01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:16.291
I'm talking about all the shuttles.

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:28.339
The O ring failures, they winked early on,
To Thiokol and then to Marshall before Challenger.

01:08:28.339 --> 01:08:34.020
And the foam problem has been winking all
the time.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.980
And it got worse later.

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:47.069
I suppose it has something to do with the
change they made in the insulation later on.

01:08:47.069 --> 01:08:56.100
But, as you know and you read, the agency
is at a very critical time today.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:01.850
They've got to make some decisions in terms
of where their priorities are and what they

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:05.500
want to try to do.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:10.490
And they don't want to spend money on the
shuttle because they seem to be committed

01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:12.761
to replacing it.

01:09:12.761 --> 01:09:18.589
And if that's what you're going to do, that's
what you're going to do.

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:24.140
But between now and 2010, if that's the year
they choose to retire the Shuttle, they are

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:30.150
not going to be motivated to test.

01:09:30.150 --> 01:09:35.710
The program is going to be at more risk over
the next four years than it was in the first

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:42.210
four years because of that reason.

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:46.049
You don't know where the ledges are, where
the cliffs are.

01:09:46.049 --> 01:10:00.370
And testing once a month or once every two
months is just not going to do it.

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:05.710
You said something that I really never recognized.

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:10.060
You said there could have been a point of
time in the program where you could have gone

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:12.050
back and reduced the pressure levels and that
type of thing to make the engine a little

01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:13.050
simpler to certify.

01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:14.050
What effect would that have had?

01:10:14.050 --> 01:10:22.670
Well, an easy way to do it, we looked at probably
several years before the first flight.

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:29.440
We had seen enough, at that time, to know
that even with the philosophy that we had

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:36.080
adopted, we were on fairly shaky ground.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:41.530
I would never have guessed that the Shuttle
would have flown over a hundred times and

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:45.750
never had a failure of the Shuttle main engine
or some problem.

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:52.830
I would have never guessed that having looked
at what I looked at.

01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:53.830
We were starting to think.

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:58.610
And an easy way to do it is open up the throat
on a main combustion chamber.

01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:06.670
If you open up the throat you relax the pressures
up and down the turbine system, the pre-burners,

01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:10.420
the pump requirements.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.070
You wouldn't have to open it up much.

01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:14.690
You'd lose a little specific impulse.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:18.820
You'd gain a little in thrust.

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:20.610
And so you would get some offset there.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:25.610
You may want to adjust the mixture ratio overall
you operate at.

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:31.090
Instead of 6.0 maybe 6.2.

01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:35.230
You could have done it with a modest performance
here.

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:40.650
You're not going to get it for free, but you
could have relaxed the pressures throughout

01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:45.909
that whole system by a change in one component.

01:11:45.909 --> 01:11:52.230
And we were contemplating that and the monies
never came.

01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:56.120
It was a configuration change.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.020
There is a lot of the --

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:05.370
What don't you know about that change is what
would bother some people.

01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:11.600
I don't want to oversell it as simple, but
conceptually it was a simple change.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:17.250
That would be one.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:31.800
I think looking back and knowing the capability
of the shuttle and, to be honest, being somewhat

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:37.510
troubled, quite a bit troubled by what I hear
and read about NASA wanting to retire it.

01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:43.540
Although, I understand their reasoning.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.510
Some view it as a flawed design.

01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:49.380
I don't view it as a flawed design.

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:52.700
I think you need to relook at how you operate
it.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:13:01.730
I hadn't been particularly pleased with the
operation of the Shuttle.

01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:07.920
Watching all this foam fall off and not even
raising your hand.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:16.280
But then, after all that occurred, nobody
stopped and stripped all that foam off and

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:27.570
maybe replaced it with cork that's heavier,
that's got some tensile strength that you

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:31.170
can anchor it on there with glue or whatever
you want to do.

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:33.780
And it's going to cost you some performance.

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:35.151
NASA has been biased too much.

01:13:35.151 --> 01:13:41.800
And they certainly started this in the Shuttle
main engine in the direction of performance

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:48.320
where if you back off a little bit the system
will be a lot more robust, serve you a lot

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:58.150
better over the long haul, and maybe you don't
push too much in some of these directions

01:13:58.150 --> 01:13:59.150
that have got us in trouble.

01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:06.280
Do you think that we had a fictitious requirement
with the performance we were trying to achieve

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.460
with the Shuttle?

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:10.030
I don't think we needed it all.

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:15.630
Tell me the missions that we needed all that
performance on.

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:23.400
It's not there.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:34.909
You'd have to reset the manifest in some cases.

01:14:34.909 --> 01:14:39.810
Well, speaking for the one element that I
know the most about, the Shuttle engine.

01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:47.980
If you folks were to undertake the job, OK,
what would I do different?

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:55.360
They're talking about using a Shuttle engine
on this heavy lift launch vehicle for a cryogenic

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.360
upper stage engine.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:02.340
I would open that throat up and look hard
at that.

01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:04.000
Rocketdyne knows how to do that.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.179
They've done it.

01:15:06.179 --> 01:15:09.860
We just haven't incorporated it.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:13.409
Although, men aren't envisioned to be on that.

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:15.750
You're still going to be a lot better off.

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:27.530
I'll tell you a problem you're going to have
with the vacuum start or at upper stage start

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.909
is that start sequence.

01:15:29.909 --> 01:15:36.159
This start sequence is very, very sensitive,
and you're probably going to have to go to

01:15:36.159 --> 01:15:41.280
Tullahoma to get in some kind of a vacuum
system to demonstrate that.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.840
That's going to be expensive in itself.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:55.280
But, yes, Aaron, I think probably across the
board, we set the bar higher than we really

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.820
needed to.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:02.860
And it cost us in money.

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:09.850
And it has also cost us in margin that we
don't have that we wish we had.

01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:10.850
J.R., usually around this time we take about
a two-minute break.

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:11.850
OK.

01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:12.850
Give your voice a rest.

01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:16.190
Everybody stand up, turn around and just stretch
a bit.

01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:36.420
Two hours is a long time to go without a stretch.

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:47.420
I'll just give one statistic that I remember
really impressed me during our initial astronaut

01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.760
training when they were talking about the
main engine.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:55.260
And you talked a lot about the high pressure
turbopump.

01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:00.550
This is a device that is about the size of
a typical automobile engine, right?

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:01.950
That's right.

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:09.021
It produces 50,000 horsepower just to pump
the liquid oxygen at high pressure.

01:17:09.021 --> 01:17:11.620
I mean that really gets your attention.

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:17.440
When you talk about pushing the state of the
art and trying to get a lot of power out of

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:24.800
a small volume that just really amazed me.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:34.670
As was indicated, I think I would like to
just make a couple more remarks and then maybe

01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:40.400
open it up for some discussion in terms of
points that I haven't covered that are on

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:44.900
your mind or other questions that you'd like
to ask.

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:53.989
Just kind of in summary, if I look back on
the program, I think there were two main keys

01:17:53.989 --> 01:18:04.440
that were paramount to the success that the
Shuttle engine enjoyed, and is enjoying through

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.190
its track record today.

01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:17.130
One was a decision to use this ISTB, to get
away from the serial component test and then

01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:23.960
the systems test to try to combine it and
do a systems engineering job on a thing from

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.960
day one.

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.920
In other words, that was key to me.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:35.190
It might have been a little extra pain but
saved a lot of time and a lot of money.

01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:39.850
And I'm not sure we could have done it the
other way anyway.

01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:49.420
And the other one which may be a little bit
more important, but just as important, was

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:54.760
the philosophy in the program of test to failure.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.830
Know where the failures are.

01:18:56.830 --> 01:19:01.190
And certainly, if you look at that earlier
chart, we had plenty of data points.

01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:10.020
I mean we had encountered a number of them,
some of them three or four times.

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:18.080
Maybe in some cases we were slow learners,
but there 

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.060
wasn't just one problem with that high pressure
LOX turbopump.

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:33.800
I think I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge
some of the people as viewed from the engine

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:37.440
that made major contributions to the Shuttle.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.440
Not just the engine now but to Shuttle.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:44.070
And in Rocketdyne, I mentioned Dom Sanchini
a couple of time.

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:52.300
Bob Biggs, who has been there since day one
and has done all of the test planning and

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:53.300
is key.

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:59.630
He is the systems engineer on the SSME.

01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:03.631
Byron Wood, who is now the president at Rocketdyne.

01:20:03.631 --> 01:20:11.280
Joe Stangeland who was in charge of turbomachinery
who designed this little paddle and solved

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:24.840
this vortex problem that uncoupled us from
this terrible time that we were at a standstill.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:31.989
Matt Eck who was in charge of turbomachinery
at Rocketdyne before he passed on several

01:20:31.989 --> 01:20:33.489
years ago.

01:20:33.489 --> 01:20:38.800
And then, within NASA, I had mentioned John
Yardley.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:45.130
He has now passed on as well.

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:50.880
I don't think there would be a Shuttle without
John's leadership.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:57.460
Bob Thompson who you might get an opportunity
to hear a little bit later, I think he was

01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.750
a driving force in the Shuttle.

01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:03.980
Bob Lindstrom, who was my boss for some time.

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:11.280
Chris Kraft, who I understand you will hear
or have heard.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:25.320
Certainly Aaron, we had to interface with
the Orbiter and he had an equal challenge.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:30.320
Arnie Aldridge who I've always thought a lot
of, as well as Dick Coors.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:40.590
And then I'll mention Bill Lucas who was the
director at Marshall and George Hardy, both

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:47.150
of whom got caught up in a later controversy
on Challenger.

01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:49.840
Not necessarily fair, but that's life.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:58.380
I mean they were both superb engineers and
meant a lot.

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:13.520
And then also Gene Covert from MIT who, how
shall I say this, came in periodically and

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:23.159
chastised us appropriately and I think made
a major contribution to the program.

01:22:23.159 --> 01:22:33.460
At the time Gene was also head of the aero-astro
department here at MIT.

01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:44.090
I'm not sure who triggered bringing Gene in,
but I know John Yardley was a key driver in

01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:45.090
that.

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:49.690
And so I'm not sure I've touched on the kind
of things you'd be interested in, but I'll

01:22:49.690 --> 01:22:57.679
certainly be glad now to try to answer areas
that perhaps I haven't hit or maybe make a

01:22:57.679 --> 01:23:02.230
few broader comments.

01:23:02.230 --> 01:23:09.220
I understand the only element, other than
the Orbiter and maybe the overall system,

01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:18.180
but this is the only propulsion element that
is talked about, I think the tank, I've already

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.989
mentioned there the insulation was their tough
nut.

01:23:20.989 --> 01:23:27.560
And I think having had some data there are
certainly some things that we could have done

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:28.880
differently.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:37.230
The solid rocket boosters, 
there's quite a history there.

01:23:37.230 --> 01:23:51.761
Thiokol has now been acquired by ATK in consolidation
of the solid rocket motor industry, but they've

01:23:51.761 --> 01:23:57.440
also made major improvements in the way they
manufacture that.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.340
Those solid rocket motors are also made with
glue.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:05.320
That's put on by hand.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:14.870
I remember, in visiting up there, after the
Challenger accident back when I was a director

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:20.460
at Marshall, a number of changes were made
to automate a lot of that.

01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:35.380
I think probably the solid rocket boosters,
when properly used and appropriately tested

01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:43.670
and backed up by the right analysis, is an
excellent propulsion system.

01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:54.130
ISP is down some but they are more than adequate
to do the job.

01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:57.409
J.R., something that really strikes me as
complicated and didn't really seem, or at

01:24:57.409 --> 01:25:08.409
least I don't think we seemed to have that
much problem was integrating the engine to

01:25:08.409 --> 01:25:10.610
the aft end of the Orbiter.

01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:13.400
That was a complicated system, but it did
go pretty well.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.730
Was it the main propulsion test article that
did that?

01:25:16.730 --> 01:25:17.730
Well, yes.

01:25:17.730 --> 01:25:25.260
It was earlier when we went to school a lot
on the integration of the J2 into the S4B

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:35.920
stage and the S2 where the conditioning of
the engine, prior to engine start, was important

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.570
and was a big interface with the stage itself.

01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:44.110
And certainly that was true with the boat
tail of the Orbiter.

01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:52.590
And the main propulsion test article, which
Aaron mentioned, I guess we had a dozen tests

01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:55.692
done there, somewhere between a half dozen
and a dozen.

01:25:55.692 --> 01:26:06.331
As a matter of fact, we had a structural failure
of a main fuel valve crack down in Mississippi

01:26:06.331 --> 01:26:07.409
in that test article.

01:26:07.409 --> 01:26:13.820
And it caused some consternation along the
way.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:17.489
But the integration, as Aaron mentioned, went
quite well.

01:26:17.489 --> 01:26:28.570
I don't think in flight we have ever had any
problems with over-pressurizing that boat

01:26:28.570 --> 01:26:34.130
tail or any problems with it.

01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:40.240
There are a number of tests that we didn't
conduct, or a few that we didn't conduct on

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:49.690
the engine that I would have liked to, A,
for curiosity and then, B, to fill a square

01:26:49.690 --> 01:26:55.030
so we knew exactly what would happen if we
ever got in that condition.

01:26:55.030 --> 01:27:00.760
And that was with a LOX depletion.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:08.050
There is some thought that a LOX depletion
is going to allow you to imbalance the rotor

01:27:08.050 --> 01:27:14.179
of the LOX pumps and they're going to rub,
cause a fire and all that.

01:27:14.179 --> 01:27:23.690
On the other hand, it is, by definition, going
to be a fuel rich shutdown, I would tend to

01:27:23.690 --> 01:27:24.690
think.

01:27:24.690 --> 01:27:34.070
But it was one test that we debated quite
a bit about in the Shuttle Program and decided

01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:40.909
that the probability of getting in that situation
probably didn't merit the test.

01:27:40.909 --> 01:27:51.500
I will add that there was a lot of good tension
within the Shuttle Program up and down at

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.000
all levels.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:02.139
I thought the whole management team was relatively
cohesive, but there was good tension.

01:28:02.139 --> 01:28:12.780
I mean we got the best out of everybody and
arrived at the best answer by the balance

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:16.449
that we had between the institutional managers.

01:28:16.449 --> 01:28:22.139
I mentioned the contribution I think that
Chris Kraft made and Bill Lucas.

01:28:22.139 --> 01:28:29.060
I'd also add early on Rocco Petrone.

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.490
And then the program managers.

01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:38.580
The John Yardleys and Bob Thompsons and Arnie
Aldridges.

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:44.480
And then the so-called level three, which
Aaron and I were.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.480
I guess you were two.

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:57.480
I think it was a well-balanced management
structure.

01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:00.300
And I'm not sure you have that today.

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:07.600
Today, for whatever reason, the program has
gotten into an operational mindset.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:13.719
Center directors are more viewed to keep the
grass cut at the centers and that kind of

01:29:13.719 --> 01:29:15.389
thing.

01:29:15.389 --> 01:29:16.570
You don't have that tension.

01:29:16.570 --> 01:29:24.639
Who is holding the program people in check?

01:29:24.639 --> 01:29:25.639
I see that missing.

01:29:25.639 --> 01:29:37.650
I always felt that there was another institutional
side that had my hands cuffed at the right

01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:40.000
time.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.810
And so I think, as NASA goes forward, and
maybe some of you folks that are going to

01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:55.760
have careers in the industry, you ought to
make sure that, A, you're surrounded by good

01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:03.739
people and that you're surrounded by a good
system, I mean a good system that pulls you

01:30:03.739 --> 01:30:10.350
up at the right time or calls you in-check
at the right time whatever you do.

01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:17.010
Whether it's going back to the moon or mars
or, maybe in retrospect, flying a shuttle

01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:19.889
a little bit more.

01:30:19.889 --> 01:30:24.510
Here, let me slow down and stop a minute now
and see if there are any other areas that

01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:26.120
you all would like to cover.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.120
Yes.

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:31.010
We've talked in the past a lot about the slow
kind of turnaround on the Shuttle, and part

01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:36.440
of that has been attributed to having to remove
the engines and I'm not sure if it's overhauling

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.260
them but basically taking them partly apart
and looking at them and examining them.

01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:43.370
And I was wondering if that was part of the
original plan or what kind of changed the

01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:51.800
efficiency of that turnaround time, what caused
it to change and slow down in the original

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:52.850
plan.

01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:57.690
Well, the original plan was for 55 missions
on an engine.

01:30:57.690 --> 01:31:07.030
But that just didn't materialize at all once
we saw what we had.

01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:13.909
I don't know what today's life on a set of
bearings are, but it's a handful of missions.

01:31:13.909 --> 01:31:19.210
You've got to tear down both of the high pressure
pumps and replace a bearing.

01:31:19.210 --> 01:31:21.989
The same on turbine blades.

01:31:21.989 --> 01:31:28.850
You want to replace that stack after a few
missions that are defined in a current certification

01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:31.510
program.

01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:33.940
It's certainly less than a half a dozen.

01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.550
And, yes, that has built in the time.

01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:42.140
But you could overcome that by just dropping
the whole engine and replacing it with another

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:49.820
one and doing it all in parallel.

01:31:49.820 --> 01:32:01.870
There were a lot of people on this program
that I never envisioned you needed.

01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:08.380
I think NASA did the right thing by turning
it over to a contractor or a team of contractors,

01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:15.330
but they stayed too much involved so it was
all done by a committee.

01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:23.930
I mean 
I don't want to pick on anybody, but who was

01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:27.570
in charge?

01:32:27.570 --> 01:32:33.570
Who felt they were really responsible for
that accident?

01:32:33.570 --> 01:32:44.070
I couldn't see it and I followed it and could
offer my opinion, but I didn't sense that

01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:46.760
the program had somebody in charge.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.770
There was another one.

01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:49.770
Yes.

01:32:49.770 --> 01:33:00.110
I was wondering if you could talk about any
examples that you know where specific technologies

01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:05.090
that came out of the Shuttle main engines
have either been used or avoided in newer

01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:07.409
launch vehicles today.

01:33:07.409 --> 01:33:17.640
No, I think a lot of the materials 
will certainly be carried forward.

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:26.500
Coatings, seal technology, that's probably
one of the areas in the turbomachinery that

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:29.159
I didn't talk about enough.

01:33:29.159 --> 01:33:41.449
There are a number of seals on those shafts
that are very critical to the operation.

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:50.810
And there was a lot of technology advancement
made in the development of the SSME on seals.

01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:56.400
Those would be several examples.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:57.400
Yes.

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.860
I was wondering if there was much discussion
before the project started on the risks in

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:07.450
going from 700 psi operating [NOISE OBSCURES]
whether there was some option to go to an

01:34:07.450 --> 01:34:10.270
intermediate pressure.

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:15.770
I am sure there probably was.

01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:23.850
Again, I came in the program about a year
after it started so I was on a periphery of

01:34:23.850 --> 01:34:27.389
some of the early stuff.

01:34:27.389 --> 01:34:35.110
But I think the risk at that time more focused
on NASA, particularly at Marshall.

01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:37.511
I think they wanted a liquid booster.

01:34:37.511 --> 01:34:49.230
Eberhard Greff, the German felt very comfortable
with liquid boosters because you could shut

01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:54.219
them off, as opposed to the solids.

01:34:54.219 --> 01:35:03.320
But cost and other things, I think they eventually
became comfortable that the solids were fine.

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:06.650
I think the risk tradeoff was more on the
booster.

01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:10.300
You shut a liquid off.

01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:16.159
When you light those solids you're going somewhere.

01:35:16.159 --> 01:35:23.239
On the engine, I know they knew it was going
to be harder.

01:35:23.239 --> 01:35:34.290
I'm not sure they appreciated how hard it
actually got to end up with those 8,000 psi

01:35:34.290 --> 01:35:42.300
pressures at the head of the pre-burners and
what that did to the rest of the system.

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:50.110
And what it did to materials and what it did
to crack growth rates and everything from

01:35:50.110 --> 01:35:58.710
then on.

01:35:58.710 --> 01:36:03.100
You wouldn't fly today without it.

01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:07.630
You understood the mechanism, you applied
fraction mechanics, and then you applied several

01:36:07.630 --> 01:36:11.639
factors, and then you certified that and that's
where you went.

01:36:11.639 --> 01:36:15.900
Does the aircraft industry do the same thing
because they have turbine blades, too, that

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.880
crack, don't they?

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.090
I'm really not sure.

01:36:19.090 --> 01:36:26.100
I don't want to fly on an airplane that has
got a cracked blade.

01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:39.100
J.R., you talked about the lack of testing
nowadays compared to at the beginning of the

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.150
program.

01:36:40.150 --> 01:36:44.949
To what extent does the fact that, I mean
after every flight they take the engines out

01:36:44.949 --> 01:36:46.960
and they borescope them and look at that.

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:52.050
I mean does that, to some extent, constitute
continual testing?

01:36:52.050 --> 01:36:53.050
No.

01:36:53.050 --> 01:36:56.920
What's the difference between that and what
you get out of the tests?

01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:00.230
Well, I think probably --

01:37:00.230 --> 01:37:06.290
Today's teams, they go to the log book and
they read what was written down by the last

01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:08.219
generation and that's what they inspect.

01:37:08.219 --> 01:37:11.969
That's fine and that's very thorough.

01:37:11.969 --> 01:37:22.290
But the testing, the introduction of some
kind of a small change by a mom and pop operation,

01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:28.730
that I alluded to earlier, that's what a test
program will catch.

01:37:28.730 --> 01:37:36.159
Some new problem that creeps in or will get
caught that's not done there.

01:37:36.159 --> 01:37:37.159
No.

01:37:37.159 --> 01:37:41.780
Let me say it another way.

01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:48.389
I believe it is very dangerous to execute
this program in the way that I understand

01:37:48.389 --> 01:37:53.010
is planned to be executed between now and
when they retire the Shuttle.

01:37:53.010 --> 01:37:59.530
I think that's the most dangerous period in
the life of the Shuttle because of that.

01:37:59.530 --> 01:38:08.840
I mean the people that are in the program
now have not been part of developing it.

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:18.430
I don't know how many pictures they've seen
of a LOX pump that has burnt up.

01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:22.300
You just think about things differently once
you've been exposed to that first-hand, that's

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:25.060
my view of it.

01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:35.590
Now, how you transition out of a shuttle program
onto something new, I don't have that answer.

01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:41.199
I mean I think you've got to do both.

01:38:41.199 --> 01:38:47.110
Like the wing-walker, I wouldn't let loose
of a shuttle before I had something else in

01:38:47.110 --> 01:38:48.909
hand.

01:38:48.909 --> 01:38:53.980
And today they're going to let loose this
and hope this other thing comes along.

01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.620
And I think there's some risk to that.

01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:57.410
Along that line with the O ring issue and
the foam issue, do you think that those were

01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:59.000
never solved, were never looked at because
of lack of money or just confidence in the

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
technology at the time?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.010
I mean the O ring was kind of carried over
a little bit.

01:39:03.010 --> 01:39:14.469
The foam, I don't know how much of that was
brand-new.

01:39:14.469 --> 01:39:24.530
And nowadays are we just relying on the confidence
that these things have worked for a hundred

01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:25.530
mission or so or is it just lack of money?

01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:30.550
No, I cannot say there was a lack of money
back at the time of the O ring.

01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:40.970
Had 
the culture been and if they were inquisitive

01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:46.000
enough to pursue it, I think they could have
gotten the money to do it.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:54.429
On the Shuttle engine, out of necessity the
culture was there.

01:39:54.429 --> 01:39:56.620
I mean it was driven by people like Yardley.

01:39:56.620 --> 01:40:05.550
I think another thing at NASA and aerospace,
you know, you can do wonderful things with

01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:13.291
computers today, but too little of all this
analysis is anchored by a good failure.

01:40:13.291 --> 01:40:23.889
You've got the analysis, you've got a lot
of programs, you can do a heck of a job on

01:40:23.889 --> 01:40:31.840
analysis today, but it's not necessarily anchored
in the remnants of a good failure, one that

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:34.610
has adequate data.

01:40:34.610 --> 01:40:58.210
If I'm building a test bed now, how do I kind
of intelligently justify it to my sponsors

01:40:58.210 --> 01:41:04.389
that I want to have a budget [NOISE OBSCURES]?

01:41:04.389 --> 01:41:07.041
Well, I don't think you're going to sell it
that way.

01:41:07.041 --> 01:41:08.041
[LAUGHTER] Right.

01:41:08.041 --> 01:41:13.280
Well, I think your sponsor or whoever has
got to have a good appreciation of how far

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.520
you're going to be pushing the technology.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:26.040
If you oversell it then you're not going to
get the money to be able to stand those.

01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:31.280
If you push too hard in that direction your
sponsor is probably going to get disinterested.

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:37.760
That's going to be a fine line.

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:41.610
Pick a current example.

01:41:41.610 --> 01:41:53.710
Pick at least, as I understand it, what NASA
is trying to do with the Lunar project or

01:41:53.710 --> 01:41:55.150
the moon project.

01:41:55.150 --> 01:42:09.429
I, for one, think that their yardstick is
going to be tough.

01:42:09.429 --> 01:42:17.260
Apollo didn't have any failures, why are you
going to have any failure?

01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:21.690
I think they are going to have to be very
careful how they sell that program.

01:42:21.690 --> 01:42:33.119
Just because they're using or will use shuttle-derived
elements, an external tank, maybe a five or

01:42:33.119 --> 01:42:41.760
an additional segment to the solid motors,
the SSME, that's not going to be a freebee.

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:51.260
I mean, I've already told you, I would do
some things to the shuttle main engine in

01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:54.300
building a different program.

01:42:54.300 --> 01:43:04.360
The tank, 
you know, they're not going to keep the foam

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.830
from coming off on the configuration that
they have.

01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:13.219
And I also wouldn't assume that I don't have
a problem now because I don't have an orbiter

01:43:13.219 --> 01:43:14.500
on the side of it.

01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.760
The foam is not supposed to come off.

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:29.780
I would degrade the insulation and put on
something that would stay, as an example.

01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:30.780
Yes.

01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:55.124
How much of the original engine, the current
engine right now, is it exactly the same as

01:43:55.124 --> 01:43:56.124
the original one or what has changed.

01:43:56.124 --> 01:43:57.124
Materials?

01:43:57.124 --> 01:43:58.124
Is the computer the same?

01:43:58.124 --> 01:43:59.124
Is everything exactly the same?

01:43:59.124 --> 01:44:00.124
I think it is the same.

01:44:00.124 --> 01:44:07.739
I'm sure there are, through engineering change
proposals or fairly low-level change traffic,

01:44:07.739 --> 01:44:10.989
some things that have been upgraded.

01:44:10.989 --> 01:44:19.840
But Inconel is still the basic material of
the housing.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:29.601
The turbine blades are still Mar-M 246 which
is a high strength copper, I think.

01:44:29.601 --> 01:44:33.159
That's the same thing.

01:44:33.159 --> 01:44:37.250
They still use ball bearings when they fly.

01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:42.730
And I don't know the change point on this,
but Pratt &amp; Whitney makes the high pressure

01:44:42.730 --> 01:44:46.409
turbo pumps now and they used roller bearings.

01:44:46.409 --> 01:44:55.130
And that would be a big change, the two high
pressure pumps that have now been incorporated

01:44:55.130 --> 01:44:57.230
in the Shuttle engine.

01:44:57.230 --> 01:44:58.230
But other areas --

01:44:58.230 --> 01:45:03.040
[OVERLAPPING VOICES] the high pressure turbo
pumps?

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.040
Yeah.

01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:08.860
At some point a couple of years ago, I think,
they were incorporated and brought in.

01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:10.440
Those would be big part number changes.

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:17.210
But a lot of other areas of the engine, I
think it's the same.

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:23.440
And I think that's one of the reasons that
they feel they don't need to test much.

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:25.389
They've got all that.

01:45:25.389 --> 01:45:34.290
So, we will have to see how the next four
or five years play out.

01:45:34.290 --> 01:45:35.290
Anything else?

01:45:35.290 --> 01:45:43.619
Well, since they're talking about using a
lot of these with the next generation vehicle

01:45:43.619 --> 01:45:48.650
and they won't be reusable, what can be done?

01:45:48.650 --> 01:45:53.290
I mean what's the way to go about kind of
de-rating the Shuttle?

01:45:53.290 --> 01:45:59.929
You talked about opening the throat, but all
the other things that make the engine reusable

01:45:59.929 --> 01:46:02.489
and presumably make it more expensive.

01:46:02.489 --> 01:46:07.469
Will it really be the same engine when they
get finished?

01:46:07.469 --> 01:46:11.989
I mean what has to be done?

01:46:11.989 --> 01:46:12.989
I don't know.

01:46:12.989 --> 01:46:24.470
I mean some may argue and suppose because
the requirement for reusable engine isn't

01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:28.489
there will eliminate some of the things.

01:46:28.489 --> 01:46:29.560
I don't know what they'd be.

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:41.909
But, having paid all that development, I would
be more inclined to really minimize the change

01:46:41.909 --> 01:46:47.250
for change sake and do some things like open
up the throat.

01:46:47.250 --> 01:46:52.380
I mentioned that as an example that would
reduce the operating pressures and, I think,

01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:57.159
give them more margin across the board.

01:46:57.159 --> 01:47:05.540
On a tank, I would go to an installation system
that is going to be a little less efficient.

01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:14.969
You're going to have more boil off, weigh
a lot more, but something that doesn't give

01:47:14.969 --> 01:47:15.969
you other problems.

01:47:15.969 --> 01:47:21.139
J.R., let me ask a question that was asked
of me and I couldn't answer earlier.

01:47:21.139 --> 01:47:27.040
Did we ever look at putting the insulation
internal to the external tank rather than

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.540
the outside?

01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:32.389
I'm not aware that it was looked at.

01:47:32.389 --> 01:47:37.720
Somebody along the way, I suspect, could have.

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:53.820
No, I'm not aware of what it was or what it
would have been.

01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:57.679
Anything else?

01:47:57.679 --> 01:47:58.679
Well, I've enjoyed it.

01:47:58.679 --> 01:48:11.610
I hope you don't repeat the same mistakes
that we made this time around.

01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:12.670
And good luck in your projects.

01:48:12.670 --> 01:48:21.440
Thanks, J.R. [APPLAUSE] I'm just going to
take the last three minutes.

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:28.179
J.R. referred to the fact that we only had
one engine shut down in the whole history

01:48:28.179 --> 01:48:30.080
of the program.

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.151
And that was due to a sensor.

01:48:31.151 --> 01:48:42.070
Just to give you a sense of what goes into
the operation of this system.

01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:49.030
It was always recognized that you have sensors
looking at the temperatures.

01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:54.301
And the idea is that if anything starts to
go wrong with the engine, you want to shut

01:48:54.301 --> 01:48:58.550
it down now before the thing blows up.

01:48:58.550 --> 01:49:06.170
Because we can lose one engine and have an
intact abort, but if the engine blows up and

01:49:06.170 --> 01:49:09.910
takes the whole boat tail with it you're not
going to get back.

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:17.570
Generally, there's a little switch in the
cockpit which enables the ability of the sensors

01:49:17.570 --> 01:49:21.260
to shut down the engines and you fly with
that on.

01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:29.310
But the problem is if you lose one engine
and you get into an abort mode now, at least

01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:36.100
for the first part of that abort mode, if
you lose a second engine now, with only one

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:40.469
engine remaining, you cannot complete an intact
abort.

01:49:40.469 --> 01:49:46.840
What the crew does, if you lose an engine,
you take that switch and you disable the automatic

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:47.840
shutdown.

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:59.630
Well, what happened was a few minutes into
the launch 

01:49:59.630 --> 01:50:08.469
the sensor started to go off scale.

01:50:08.469 --> 01:50:09.680
The engine was shutdown.

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:13.910
But they were far enough into the launch that
they can actually do an abort to orbit.

01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:21.730
They took the engine switch to disable, normal
procedure.

01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:29.560
When they got a little further along so that
they were in what they would be able to, a

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:36.719
little further on, I forget the exact details,
but they took the switch back to enable.

01:50:36.719 --> 01:50:42.719
But the main engine flight controller on the
ground noticed that the sensor in one of the

01:50:42.719 --> 01:50:47.099
other engines was also starting to go off
scale.

01:50:47.099 --> 01:50:54.849
And, if that was allowed, it would basically
take down a second engine.

01:50:54.849 --> 01:50:59.719
That would have put them in a single engine,
what we would have called an intact transatlantic

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:00.719
abort.

01:51:00.719 --> 01:51:06.239
But, by that time, they were too far to land
in the normal abort site, and they would have

01:51:06.239 --> 01:51:09.369
ended up landing somewhere in Africa, I think,
in the dark.

01:51:09.369 --> 01:51:13.280
I mean it would have been a really bad situation.

01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:21.409
And so the flight controller was sharp enough
to tell the flight director we've got another

01:51:21.409 --> 01:51:24.580
bad sensor, tell the crew to take the switch
to inhibit.

01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:33.080
Luckily, the flight director's background
was in propulsion systems.

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:37.090
He knew exactly what the flight controller
was talking about.

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:42.199
They called it up to the crew, they took it,
and so the second engine did not shut down.

01:51:42.199 --> 01:51:47.300
And, in fact, they made it into orbit and
they managed to complete the mission.

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:50.500
But these are decisions which have to be made
in split seconds.

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:59.410
In fact, the flight controller who made that
call was given a special award from NASA.

01:51:59.410 --> 01:52:02.420
You really have to know these systems inside
and out.

01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:06.900
And that is, of course, why we have so many
simulations where they run those sorts of

01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:13.179
failure cases so that people are able to make
these decisions very quickly in real-time.

01:52:13.179 --> 01:52:22.130
And that basically saved the Shuttle and the
crew from potentially a really bad situation.

01:52:22.130 --> 01:52:26.810
Is the orbit burn done by the main engines?

01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:29.520
No, they're done by the OMS.

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:40.540
Once the main engines shut down, you've dropped
the tank so you don't have any more propellant.

01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:48.230
And there have been a few, I think four, engine
shutdowns on the pad.

01:52:48.230 --> 01:52:53.360
You start the engines about six seconds before
T zero.

01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:57.201
That gives them enough time to come up to
full operating performance so that you can

01:52:57.201 --> 01:52:58.450
check out that they are OK.

01:52:58.450 --> 01:53:04.980
Remember we talked about the twang because
of the asymmetric thrust that gives you enough

01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:08.020
time for the Orbiter to tilt forward and then
come back?

01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:11.840
And then when you're vertical that is when
you fire the engines.

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:13.460
I've got some pictures of this.

01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:17.670
At one class I will show you some slow motion
pictures of the launch.

01:53:17.670 --> 01:53:18.800
You can see all that.

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:20.619
We've had four pad shutdowns.

01:53:20.619 --> 01:53:26.400
Of those two were due to real problems with
the engine and two were due to instrumentation

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:27.880
problems.

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:34.750
It's always a problem of how much instrumentation
do you put in and how much do you trust it?

01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:40.210
And I know Aaron has made the point, on several
occasions, of if you put an abort system in

01:53:40.210 --> 01:53:46.270
for the crew, is that going to be triggered
automatically or does it have to be manual?

01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:50.540
You certainly don't want to get shot off the
end of a good working rocket just because

01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:53.930
your sensors have told you that something
wrong is happening.

01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:59.949
There are a lot of interesting engineering
decisions to be made with that.

01:53:59.949 --> 01:54:00.949
End of class.

01:54:00.949 --> 01:54:02.230
We'll see you on Thursday.

01:54:02.230 --> 01:54:03.210
And thanks again to J.R.
