00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.210
Good morning.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.370
I am filling in for Professor Hoffman who
is off addressing the French Parliament at

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.370
this moment, or maybe it was yesterday afternoon.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.220
Tough choices of whether to stay here or go
there.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.000
Well, that's right, Noah.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.689
These days the issue of knowing where you
are, navigation is really taken for granted.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.980
We have GPS in our cell phones.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.480
GPS in handheld devices.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.630
GPS tells the taxi driver whether or not he
should be turning up that one way street.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.100
When we began with human space travel, particularly
as we entered the Apollo era, the question

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.590
of navigation, along with guidance and control,
was still a major issue.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.879
In fact, it was rather uncertain whether or
not, in the Apollo mission, we were going

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:07.390
to be able to, with assurance, do all of the
navigation required for going to lunar trajectory

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:21.390
and then doing the precise navigation to land
on 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.810
the moon.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:32.590
The 
history of leading guidance navigation and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.720
control has now, for a period of over half
a century, been located just adjacent to,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.439
at one time part of MIT, the Instrumentation
Laboratory, now Draper Laboratory.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.030
And the tradition carried on through Apollo
to the Space Shuttle Program.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.130
And then, as I think as you are aware, beyond
that into NASA's current plans.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.090
We're privileged today to have discuss with
us the guidance, navigation and control issues

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.369
on the Shuttle, Dr. Phil Hattis.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.380
Dr. Hattis, a graduate of Northwestern and
Caltech with his PhD from the Aero-Astro Department

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.510
at MIT, has been at Draper since 1974.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.040
He is a member of the Laboratory Technical
Staff, which is the highest technical position

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.480
available there.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.780
He serves as the Technical Lead for the Crew
Exploration Vehicle Development Program in

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.170
GN&amp;C at Draper Laboratory.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.410
Phil has been very active in AIAA.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.410
He is a fellow.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.430
He has been head of the New England region.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.420
Has received the Draper Lab Distinguished
Performance Awards and various NASA recognition

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.800
awards for his contributions to STS-1 and
STS-8 missions.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.880
Then we will hear about Draper's contributions
and the overall issue of GN&amp;C.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.840
Thanks a lot, Larry.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.440
I should just point out, when I came up here
as a graduate student to pursue my doctorate,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.770
I was a Draper fellow.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.250
I started working on the Shuttle as a Draper
fellow, so much of the work I will be talking

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.120
about here, I was probably only a year or
two older than any of you when I was doing

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.120
this.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.370
And that's turned out to be fairly useful
to NASA because with the Shuttle still flying

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.770
from time to time issues come up and they
stick pick my brain about what we did in 1974,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:34.510
'75 and '76, which wouldn't had been so easy
if I had been at my current age then.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.230
But it is also a little bit alarming because
it means the people that are working on the

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.700
system now don't really understand why it
was designed the way it is.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.440
Now, the other thing they could have asked
me for was the report on which this material

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.830
was based, which I wrote in 1983 to educate
the rest of the people at Draper who were

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.250
going to work on the program subsequently
about this system.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.540
Now, the other thing I just want to say is
feel free to interrupt me at any point to

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.540
ask questions.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.260
I am going to be covering a lot of ground,
and I may not get back to the area that you're

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.660
interested in asking me about if you wait.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.870
So just raise your hand or speak up or whatever
you feel like.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.329
And the other things I want to point out are
two things.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.250
One, what you're going to be looking is largely
what was done for the first Shuttle flight

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.940
except where I mention specific upgrades.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.774
Now, I am not going to be comprehensively
covering all the upgrades that have been done

00:04:27.774 --> 00:04:30.849
to the Shuttle since.

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.819
What you will also note is this presentation
will be largely monochrome.

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:34.819
And why?

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:39.060
Because it is drawn from a presentation of
1983 when there was no such thing as a laptop

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.900
or PowerPoint and color was a real pain to
get.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.849
You had to go to the artist and then get it
lithographically reproduced which was an incredibly

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.550
cost.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.900
What color you see, I've added now and it's
limited, except for a couple of pictures at

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.900
the end.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.220
I do have some before and after cockpit pictures
at the end.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.189
You will periodically see a chart like this,
topics of discussion, we'll go from section

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.240
to section and we're going to delineate the
areas I'm going to cover.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.270
There are going to be a whole bunch of sub-bullets
for each of these areas as I go through.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.189
This will be not real deep, unless you ask
me the questions and I will go as deep as

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:24.139
you want with the questions but covering a
lot of ground.

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.180
Some of these pictures you may have seen in
one form or another, but I should just highlight

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.180
certain points.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.880
The systems related to the flight control
were placed all over the Shuttle.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.759
In the forward area, which was the only pressurized
portion of the Shuttle, below the livable

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.290
areas was the avionics bay.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:50.020
And, in there where the computers, the inertial
measurement unit, and I want to say something

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.509
about that in a moment, what they refer to
as multiplexers-demultiplexers.

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.790
You've got a lot of analog systems or you
had to convert back and forth between digital

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.819
and analog.

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:05.970
And the electronic boxes that drove the commands
for the reaction control system thrusters.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.539
And then you have hand controllers and displays
and indicators in the cockpit.

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:17.340
In the back you have pods which have many
of the reaction control system jets, the orbital

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.990
maneuvering system thrusters.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.759
And I will be talking quite a bit more about
them later.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:28.250
And there was also in the aft avionics bay
that had specific subsystems for which it

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.940
was deemed unacceptable to have them forward.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:36.150
Some of them were local analog digital conversion
boxes, but also rate gyros which were used

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.620
during assent and entry where they wanted
them closer to the center of mass by being

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.659
in the back and in the front avoiding some
of the flexure issues associated with the

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:50.779
long distance to the front.

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:56.099
This particular configuration you're looking
at is before the external tank separated after

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.979
the solid rocket boosters had come off.

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:04.050
This configuration is where the story begins
because what I am going to be talking about

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:12.999
is the part that Draper did which is the exoatmospheric
flight control system.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:16.581
And that begins at main engine shutdown and
ends when you hit 400,000 feet on the way

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:22.919
back.

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:25.629
There are different phases that we will be
talking about.

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:30.409
The first is what we refer to as insertion
which is from the time the main engines cut

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:35.360
off to the time you do initial orbit circularization.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.430
And that includes a brief but design challenge
phase while you're attached to the external

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.430
tank.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.689
It includes the separation maneuver from that.

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:52.120
And, in the original flight profile for the
Shuttle two burns of the orbital maneuvering

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:59.099
system, the original orbit insertion strategy
for the Shuttle put it in an orbit that typically

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:04.550
had an apogee of about 60 nautical miles,
a perigee of just a few nautical miles.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.969
What you would do is the first burn would
raise that perigee up to the 100 plus nautical

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:13.499
mile target altitude and then the second burn
halfway around the earth would put you into

00:08:13.499 --> 00:08:16.490
a circular orbit and then you would begin
your mission there.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:24.419
Later in the program for overall efficiency,
in order to improve the payload margins, that

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:25.419
strategy changed.

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:31.440
And they tended to do more what they call
direct insertion which had a substantial higher

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.440
apogee.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:38.170
The perigee wasn't much higher but you would
end up somewhere between those two.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:43.850
And then you would do one OMS burn and you
would get a net gain of maybe one or two thousand

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.840
pounds which became very important.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.830
During this insertion phase all the applicable
sensors were on.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.840
Now, I said I was going to say something about
the IMU.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.330
And most of you don't even think probably
these days about having rate gyro separate

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.790
from an inertial measurement unit.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:07.900
You get these combined packages called inertial
navigation systems now.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.830
They're actually navigators that have the
software.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.530
They do all the processing for you.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.260
They even have built in GPS receivers.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.870
Of course, we didn't have GPS then.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.790
The inertial measurement unit was a pretty
clunky gimbaled device at the time the Shuttle

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.790
first flew.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:27.220
It subsequently got upgraded to ring laser
gyro systems.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:35.490
But that inertial measurement unit was simply
outputting angles that were significant throughput

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.490
issues.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.830
Because you had to do a lot of data crunching
to get rates from that.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.830
Computers are really slow.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.990
I will talk a little bit more about that in
a few minutes.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:50.260
Having rate gyros separate was a way to get
data that these days would be all built into

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.460
one box.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.050
General purpose computers, all of them were
on during ascent.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:03.750
I will talk about the partisan of them, but
there were actually five of them.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.680
And the Vernier reaction control system, which
is a small group of jets, and I will point

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.150
those out later, were not active.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.700
The larger thrusters were.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.730
And then, after the second OMS burn, you transition
to another flight phase.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:20.290
And why all these flight phases, I will get
to in a couple minutes also.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.650
Then orbit phase began after the second burn.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.960
You quickly open the doors so that you could
dump waste heat.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.760
The radiators are on the inside of the doors.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.880
And, when the doors are closed, the heat just
radiates back into the vehicle.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.190
All payload operations are during this phase.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.650
And you did a lot of power down to save.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.880
You're working off of fuel cells.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.640
It limits your mission life both because of
the limits on the weight of the reactants

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.460
and on the places you can put any extra tanks.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.270
So you turn off the rate gyros, you don't
need those anymore, and I will explain why.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.600
Two of the five general purpose computers
were shut down.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:05.100
This also being a late `70s computer design,
you're talking maybe on the order of a couple

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:15.390
hundred watts per computer which, by the way,
I will explain more about, but was a 104,000

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.370
word memory capacity.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:22.680
That was actually an improvement from the
approach and landing test when it was 64,000

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.220
words.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:30.830
And then you turned off two of the three redundant
inertial measurement units, except for critical

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.760
phases.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:39.380
Also the safe power, the feeling was that
if you lost your navigation reference you

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.200
would have a relatively benign environment
to bring one of the others up.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.000
And the Vernier thrusters were made available
because they were used for flying control.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.970
Then you have the deorbit phase.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.130
You close the doors again.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.220
You do the deorbit burn.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:59.160
You dump any residual propellant from the
forward tanks by simultaneously burning opposing

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:05.030
thrusters in order to get an acceptable center
of mass for entry.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.060
Getting the acceptable location of the center
of mass for attitude and thermal control during

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.630
entry is very critical.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.200
You reactive all the sensors.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.610
You go back to all the computers being up.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:24.020
Then you turn the Vernier jets back off and
you fly the vehicle using this mode until

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.910
you're at 400,000 feet which is about where
you pick up 0.05 Gs.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:33.490
And that is where the entry phase takes over.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.740
And this is just a summary of the profile.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.260
Now, this is where I wanted to take the opportunity
to talk a little bit about computers and profiles

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.170
and everything else.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:49.170
When we started this program with a 64,000
word computer, I talk in terms of words instead

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.340
of bytes.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.860
The architecture of this computer didn't have
bytes.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.420
You had words and half words.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.920
Each word was equivalent to about four bytes
in terms of number of characters you could

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.540
insert into it.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.400
But you only could break it down into pieces
of two.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:15.960
So we had 208,000 - well, a thousand times
24 pieces of memory that we could work with

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.200
on this computer.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.670
For the approach and landing test, which was
very limited, you flew it off of a 747 for

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:30.280
a couple of minutes, 64,000 words worked just
fine.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.780
And they were chugging along with the program
saying we're going to get all this orbital

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.280
mission stuff into that computer.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.920
And, of course, we discovered probably a year
after we really began the job, we began the

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.930
job seriously in '75, and by '76 it was obvious
64,000 words wasn't going to work.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.490
They upped it to 104,000 words.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:51.590
It was probably obvious four months later
that 104,000 words wasn't going to work.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:58.010
So the solution, in addition to descoping
as much as possible, what you had to have

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:03.350
was to separate the computer loads that you
had for up and down which you did when you

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.060
were doing your orbital mission.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.470
And then you had something called the mass
memory device which is basically a tape drive

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.840
which when you went from this phase to this
phase would reload some of the computers.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.080
And then you went from this phase to this
phase we'd reload them again.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.550
And I said there were five of these computers.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:26.110
Four of them, of what I'll be talking about,
were the primary computer set.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:34.900
Quad redundant so that they would vote all
data going in and out to decide whether or

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.960
not there was an inconsistency between one
computer and the other.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.492
And it would automatically deselect the bad
computer, the implications of which I will

00:14:41.492 --> 00:14:45.230
talk about probably about three-quarters of
the way through the presentation.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:50.590
When you went up and down, all four computers
were operating the same software.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.780
The fifth computer was called the backup flight
control system.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.930
And the reason it was there, these four primary
computers, a chunk of that 104,000 words,

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:03.650
probably 30,000 to 40,000 words was used to
assure the computer set operated successfully

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:04.650
redundantly.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:08.680
There was always a concern that there would
be a generic software error that would show

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.870
up at some bizarre time and that you could
pull down the whole computer set.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:21.070
It was an independently coded similar architecture
from the standpoint of algorithm content,

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:27.680
but independently coded software called the
backup flight control system that on the hand

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.010
controller there was a button the crew could
hit, a panic button, if they needed to.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.860
And the system would revert from the primary
system backup system.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:41.060
It never happened in the history of the program,
it has never been used, but it is still there.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:46.110
And so those five computers are all operating
on the way up and on the way down.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:51.250
Now, when you go to the onboard phase, and
only three computers are up, you freeze dry,

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.900
as they say, to the computers.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.660
One computer remains the backup flight computer
turned off ready to turn on from emergency

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.000
entry to backup.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.180
The other one is a primary software load ready
to start.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.590
The remaining three computers, two of them
were redundant set for the on-orbit functions.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:12.030
And one of them, again, because of memory
problems, everything payload related was in

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:18.780
a system management and monitoring other non-flight
control related functions with one of the

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.780
other computers.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:25.590
They did this spread of functions across computers,
in addition to adding the tape drive in order

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:30.870
to accommodate the memory constraints because
the Shuttle Mission was so much more complex

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:35.090
than what the computers were originally designed
to accommodate.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.580
So you say it never happened.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.250
Have there been instances in which any of
the backup computers have been brought online?

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.820
There have been instances in which primary
computers have failed.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.150
There has never been an instance in which
they've reverted to the backup system.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:55.870
Now, when the primary systems fail, and I
will elaborate this in more detail, while

00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:01.510
each computer computes the functionality for
everything, they only control more or less

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.860
a quarter of the subsystems.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.860
And there is a distribution.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.910
And some of the charts towards the end will
talk about how this was done.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.980
And there are implications associated with
what you lose when the computer goes down.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:17.220
But, if you have time in your noncritical
flight phase, you can restring those things

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.990
to the remaining healthy computers and recover
accessible systems even though that computer

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.399
has gone down.

00:17:22.399 --> 00:17:29.499
Now, on STS-9, that was incidentally our MIT
department's first Shuttle flight.

00:17:29.499 --> 00:17:31.350
And it had, Byron Lichtenberg, one of our
people.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.360
And what turned out happened to be floating
solder balls and an early version of these

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.039
computers that caused intermittent shorts.

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:41.960
And one computer went down before entry.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.889
They recovered the string.

00:17:44.889 --> 00:17:48.520
Another computer went down during entry.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.590
And, because they had reconfigured the string,
they had three of the four strings left but

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.909
only two computers.

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:58.360
And another one failed on touchdown.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:04.929
And had that one failed before touchdown they
probably would have reverted to the backup

00:18:04.929 --> 00:18:05.929
system.

00:18:05.929 --> 00:18:07.460
That's the closest they ever came to a backup
system.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.350
Now, the question that comes to my mind there,
since the generic failure was not software

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:16.370
but floating solder balls, which all the computers
were susceptible to, what would have happened

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.350
if they had gone to the backup system?

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.429
Because it could have gone down, too, and
then they would have had nothing.

00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:26.850
Because, once they've gone to the backup,
it is not easy to revert in critical flight

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.389
phase to the primary system.

00:18:28.389 --> 00:18:32.970
Lichtenberg, as I mentioned, was a crew member
from our lab.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.759
Later I asked him how did he feel when the
first computer went down and then the second

00:18:36.759 --> 00:18:37.950
computer went down?

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.220
Byron has an aero-astro PhD and pretty savvy.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.389
He said he was pretty worried until he looked
at the commander, who was John Young, and

00:18:47.389 --> 00:18:51.020
John said well, we might as well go to sleep
because we're not going to reenter today.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.870
And when John went to sleep he said he might
as well go to sleep, too, and it will be all

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:55.870
right.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.850
And it was.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:59.850
Yes?

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:04.149
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] The computer was the same.

00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:05.769
The software was not.

00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:09.149
The computers themselves are all interchangeable
AP101 computers.

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:15.409
Subsequently, they were changed to AP101S
computers, which is modified version that

00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:17.120
was used on the B-1 Bomber.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.299
And they went to 256,000 words of memory.

00:19:20.299 --> 00:19:21.880
And that is the current state-of-the-art.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.400
You have to understand several things.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.289
One, it is very expensive to upgrade systems
that are already flying.

00:19:29.289 --> 00:19:35.299
But, independent of that, you never fly in
space something that is close to the state-of-the-art

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:39.909
because you have to go through all the qualifications,
which takes a lot of time, and it has to be

00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:41.490
radiation hardened when you're in space.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.570
And when it's a human vehicle, it has also
got to go through human qualification.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:56.220
The Space Station architecture is IBM 386
processor quality, so it is basically like

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:03.539
maybe about 1986, '87 early laptop generation
computers.

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:10.980
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Oh, yes.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.090
There were quite a few missions.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.629
I don't think there have ever been any missions
where they lost two.

00:20:16.629 --> 00:20:21.690
The IMU failures don't seem to have been anything
systemic but just sort of a random problem.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:26.710
And I'm not sure since they have gone to the
ring laser gyro systems that they have had

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.710
any failures.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:33.760
I think it was the mechanical ones from the
early days that they had some problems.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.520
Now, major requirements for the systems.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.940
We had two different autopilots for three
phase transmission which incorporated both

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:45.610
the insertion and the orbit features and on-orbit,
so we only had two different software loads

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.710
on that tape drive for the primary flight
control system.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:54.830
The rules for Shuttle were that after any
subsystem failure you have the capability

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.330
to remain operational.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.309
No critical functions were lost.

00:20:58.309 --> 00:21:04.330
After two failures, safe operation, all critical
things necessary to terminate the mission

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.120
and bring them home would be possible.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:14.130
But some of the mission objectives may not
be achievable.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:21.669
The system was mainly aimed at controlling
rigid body characteristics and velocity changes

00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:22.669
within specification.

00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:27.041
Only when we started to look at docking with
the mirror in the Space Station did we start

00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:28.899
worrying about flexible body effects.

00:21:28.899 --> 00:21:32.460
And it was because of what they were attaching
to and not because of the Shuttle, all those

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.740
appendages and those things.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.980
If Shuttle does control Space Station and
did control Mir when it was docked.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.610
And so there have been some modes, which I
won't really be talking about today, but were

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:49.710
created to facilitate that control without
causing unacceptable loads on those flexible

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.960
appendages of the stations.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:58.010
And 80 millisecond app cycle, two reasons
that happened.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.909
We originally planned to do 40 milliseconds.

00:21:59.909 --> 00:22:02.150
The approach and landing test program was.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:07.169
First there is less process of burden if you
do it half as often.

00:22:07.169 --> 00:22:12.990
And the other, when it came to the reaction
control system, as we discovered in about

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:20.340
early 1980, a little more than a year before
the first flight that there was a water hammer

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:27.899
effect in the propellant lines on the RCS
jets were the opening of the valves caused

00:22:27.899 --> 00:22:32.790
an expansion wave which reflected as a compression
wave.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.549
The closing of the valves caused a compression
wave.

00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:39.110
The inner section compression waves, if the
valves were opened and closed too quickly,

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:43.399
could cause a catastrophically large compression
wave that could burst the line.

00:22:43.399 --> 00:22:49.450
So they deemed it better rather than redesign
the entire feed system to limit us to never

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:53.269
firing faster than 80 millisecond cycles.

00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:55.159
Now, that differed from Apollo.

00:22:55.159 --> 00:23:00.080
Apollo had 100 millisecond cycle time, but
they had the ability to interrupt the cycle

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.880
to turn out enough jets if they wanted a short
firing.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.290
We couldn't do that because of the water hammer
effect.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:18.720
And also because the propellant feed system
involved a liquid in the tank with zero G

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.059
acquisition devices around the surface of
the tank directly exposed to the pressured

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:28.120
helium, which means some of the helium dissolved
into the fluid.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:34.780
If the fluid was drawn too fast the helium
could bubble out causing a gap in those zero

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.059
G acquisition devices around the tank preventing
flow.

00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:44.019
If you get unbalanced flow of hypergolic propulsion
systems you can also get an explosion.

00:23:44.019 --> 00:23:47.850
So the solution to that was limiting how many
jets you could fire at one time off of one

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:48.850
tank.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.429
Does everybody understand what the zero G
acquisition problem is?

00:23:51.429 --> 00:23:53.610
It's a surface tension base.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:24:00.749
You have various types of rings and shapes
on there that captured fluid by surface tension

00:24:00.749 --> 00:24:04.320
to there, which would begin to draw the fluid.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.830
And once you began to get some flow because
of firing things it would pull the blobs of

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:15.380
fluid into the tanks and into the feed lines
from the tanks.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.340
As you recall, the origin of the problem is
that the fluid would not be at the bottom

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.730
of the tank so you risk drawing a bubble.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.130
The surface tension holds enough there to
start the firing.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.679
When you fire you get some force.

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:32.659
The force draws the blob to the same parts
of the tanks where you can acquire the fluid.

00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:38.019
And, as long as you don't draw too fast, the
communication between that part of the tank

00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:39.019
and the fluid remains.

00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:42.530
This was a very complicated qualification
program.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:50.269
A lot of C135 parabolic trajectory time got
used to test out various perturbating of the

00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:51.269
inside of the tanks.

00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:54.240
And I am not going to talk about that in detail
but I'm sure there are a lot of papers out

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.110
in the literature about how they qualified
these things.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:03.429
And I don't think there were too many systems
before the Shuttle that actually did it this

00:25:03.429 --> 00:25:04.429
way.

00:25:04.429 --> 00:25:08.530
One used systems that tended to use membranes
where you had the pressure on one side and

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:17.230
the fluid on the other side, and the membrane
would just force the fluid to stay in contact.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:22.639
But the problem is the membranes would degrade
over time on exposure to these hypergolic

00:25:22.639 --> 00:25:23.769
propellants.

00:25:23.769 --> 00:25:29.070
Hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide are very
chemical reactive materials.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:32.480
For instance, it was supposed to be used over
many years up to a hundred times.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.260
The idea that you would have periodically
keep opening up these tanks to change a membrane

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.610
was not attractive when you consider the tanks
are deep inside of the structure.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:44.549
So this may have been a unique issue because
of a reusable system, but it also may be relevant

00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:55.000
to systems that even if they aren't reusable
have to have a very long life in space.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.419
Modes and submodes I will quickly go through,
but you have rotation and translation modes.

00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:08.710
These modes could be used simultaneously for
the RCS system and then separately for the

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.899
OMS system.

00:26:11.899 --> 00:26:21.809
And you had special modes which to get extra
oomph out of the RCS jets, if you had an abort,

00:26:21.809 --> 00:26:26.049
that would sometimes be done if the OMS engineers
weren't available.

00:26:26.049 --> 00:26:33.460
The OMS engines, there were two of them which
were up on the back right and left pods from

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.799
that picture I showed a few minutes ago.

00:26:36.799 --> 00:26:39.350
And you could use one or two depending on
what you were doing.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:44.129
And in the RCS rotation modes, you had various
ways you could use it.

00:26:44.129 --> 00:26:46.750
Proportional meant you moved the stick.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:51.419
The response you get is in proportion to what
you do, how long the jets fire.

00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:55.419
Discrete means you move the stick and you
get a specific amount of rate change.

00:26:55.419 --> 00:26:58.570
Pulse means you just get a single little pulse
out.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:03.100
And acceleration means as long as you're holding
the stick out it keeps firing them.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.100
And those are all.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.309
There were push button displays that the crew
could adjust.

00:27:08.309 --> 00:27:13.200
There were some modes for each of those which
affected how many jets fired, whether or not

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:19.259
you wanted to force it to use something that
approximated couples or you were in propellant

00:27:19.259 --> 00:27:22.600
conservation mode and you were willing to
get accept getting a rotation rate.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.669
With coupled in the translation you would
care about that effect.

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:32.369
And in the translation there were various
submodes as well.

00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:36.580
And, in particular, you would use more jets
when you were separating from the external

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.250
tank to get away as fast as possible.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.250
Yes?

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:41.999
On the previous slide, are there different
modes for the RCS jets?

00:27:41.999 --> 00:27:47.869
Was there one that they happened to use the
most or was like supposed to be the primary

00:27:47.869 --> 00:27:51.279
usage or are they all part of the normal operating?

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:55.739
I think they would rarely use this or this.

00:27:55.739 --> 00:27:59.600
I think these two were commonly used.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.710
This is very fuel inefficient.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.330
It would only be used as kind of an emergency
measure.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:08.100
That's also very difficult from the point
of view of the pilot to have direct acceleration

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.100
control.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.100
Right.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.389
I mean this might be something you would call
upon if actually, for some reason, the vehicle

00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:17.570
started to spin up unexpectedly and you would
have to neutralize that.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.669
Does that adequately answer your question
for now?

00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:26.499
There will be an opportunity to collect a
little more detail on that later.

00:28:26.499 --> 00:28:30.749
But, again, you wanted to get off the tank
quickly so you would use all the jets you

00:28:30.749 --> 00:28:32.740
had to get off of it.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.610
You wouldn't do that later.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:40.260
You would have more jets that you would use
for roll control while you're on the tank

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.529
because you had a much higher roll inertia.

00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:46.590
You want to only spend a few seconds on the
tank after the main engines shut down.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.220
You could often be left with residual rates
you've got to quickly kill.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.010
There was an inhibit on the separation if
you had more than half a degree per second

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.010
on each of the axes.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:29:00.940
There was actually a phenomenon on the first
Shuttle flight which almost got us in trouble.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:07.549
One of the first things that happens after
the main engines shut down is you slew the

00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:12.429
engines back to stow position where you want
the engines for entry.

00:29:12.429 --> 00:29:16.320
The reason is the auxiliary power units are
needed to move the main engines.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.529
You want to shut those down and save the hydrazine
for those until you get back to it just before

00:29:20.529 --> 00:29:21.879
entry.

00:29:21.879 --> 00:29:27.190
On the first Shuttle flight they kicked those
engines at about one hertz.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:31.070
It turned out the first fundamental mode,
the rock mode of the orbiter on the external

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:38.749
tank had a subharmonic of about almost exactly
one-fourth of that slew rate on the main engines.

00:29:38.749 --> 00:29:44.309
The slewing of the engines then causes the
rocky mode to be excited.

00:29:44.309 --> 00:29:49.679
We were seeing oscillations very close to
the inhibit for the separation.

00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:54.179
The crew was getting a little worried but
we just got it in bounds in the automatic

00:29:54.179 --> 00:29:55.179
mode.

00:29:55.179 --> 00:29:59.460
And if they hadn't separated in time it would
have gotten pretty complicated to do it manually.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.910
We made quite a few changes after that.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:05.580
There were a lot of things we learned on the
first flight, and I will point a few of them

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.450
out as we go along.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.379
There was also a launch pad phenomenology.

00:30:10.379 --> 00:30:13.739
It is not part of my talk.

00:30:13.739 --> 00:30:18.299
Has this come up in the class about the shockwave
from the SRB ignition?

00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:19.299
Yes.

00:30:19.299 --> 00:30:20.299
OK.

00:30:20.299 --> 00:30:23.679
They didn't have those waterbeds in there
on the first flight.

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:28.950
What was relevant here, one of the things
that you may or may not know is that the struts

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:33.399
that held the forward RCS tanks on the first
flight were buckled almost to failure.

00:30:33.399 --> 00:30:36.040
That wasn't realized until they got home,
but had they failed they probably would have

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:42.059
burst and blown up the vehicle.

00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:50.730
The on-orbit modes, we have both primary and
Vernier jets which were only used separately,

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:55.190
except under special circumstances which were
designed substantially after the first flight.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:31:02.519
We have local, vertical and inertial frame
of reference control capability with respect

00:31:02.519 --> 00:31:04.760
to the discrete rate mode.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:11.059
And, otherwise, it is pretty similar to what
you saw in the previous picture.

00:31:11.059 --> 00:31:16.950
And submodes, some features were added because
of rendezvous.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.679
You could fire a lot of jets on the fort side.

00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:23.980
If you wanted to do a rapid breaking, you
could inhibit all the jets to fire in that

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.980
direction.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.220
If you wanted to limit the use of plumes,
it turns out that you didn't lose completely

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.690
your translation control authority.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:37.269
Because the jets, in the front and back, that
were in the x-axis coupled about 20% of the

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:38.399
trust into the z-axis.

00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:42.700
So if you fired them simultaneously in both
directions you could avoid pluming an object

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:50.970
in front of you and still get enough translation
to control that axis.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:57.019
And, just to show how everything was hooked
up, the inertial measurement units and rate

00:31:57.019 --> 00:32:06.429
gyros and hand controllers and panel controls
all went in through these multiplexer devices

00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:13.760
feeding the signals then into the computer
and displays.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:20.450
And then you had outputs going through these
similar types of electronic boxes specific

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:24.629
to the reaction control jets that generated
the commands that were needed by the solenoid

00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:33.879
valves that actually opened and closed the
hypergolic feed lines.

00:32:33.879 --> 00:32:39.049
Looking at the whole top level architecture
then of the GN&amp;C system is all those boxes

00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:41.269
feeding into what was inside of the computer.

00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:46.519
Inside of the computer you have subsystem
operation software managing each of the subsystems

00:32:46.519 --> 00:32:49.100
doing the redundancy management.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.830
The specific guidance navigation control algorithms.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:58.740
There was a moding and sequencing function
which was based on both manual and automatic

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.029
scripts.

00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:06.519
Then the actual driving of the displays of
controls is interactive with the flight control

00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:16.299
system both ways providing feedback to the
crew members and accepting their inputs.

00:33:16.299 --> 00:33:21.360
And then what was left was the system management
function on this computer that didn't go into

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.970
the separate computer.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:29.210
By the way, anything related to robotic arm
operations were operated through that separate

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:30.210
computer.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.769
One of the issues that came along later in
the program is the flight control computer

00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:35.470
never knew what was happening with the arm.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:40.110
If you take a space telescope sized payload
and put it 40 feet out there, it drastically

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.110
changes the mass properties.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:47.369
And one of the features you will see a little
later that we stuck in was the ability for

00:33:47.369 --> 00:33:52.100
the crew, by pushbutton, to select different
tables about expected accelerations of the

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.110
jets because we didn't know when we needed
to respond to that.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:34:01.739
There were also flexure issues with the arm
which came up as they went along, too, and

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:04.640
established constraints on how we operated.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.500
But was there any thought given to having
an adaptive system which would identify the

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.070
current parameters?

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:16.909
That would have gone way beyond the capacity
of the computers that we had.

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:22.570
It would be relatively easy to do with the
programs we had but it would never fit in

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.289
a 104k memory computer.

00:34:25.289 --> 00:34:31.860
But there has been lots of work that some
of my graduate students have done over the

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.960
years of how we should have done that.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:40.780
Brent Appleby, who is now a division leader
at the Lab, actually did some work back in

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:49.520
the `80s, I think that may have been his master's
thesis, on some of those issues.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:35:00.300
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] But, in reality, we're
approaching very large memories which would

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.549
allow you to do it.

00:35:01.549 --> 00:35:05.460
Well, when we go into CEV, we're probably
going to assume that 100 megabytes is no big

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.540
deal.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:13.319
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] unfortunately was cancelled,
but we were doing exactly that.

00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:17.900
We knew exactly the position [NOISE OBSCURES]
all the movement when we were grappling.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:23.549
And we were changing all the tables based
on the current angles [NOISE OBSCURES].

00:35:23.549 --> 00:35:29.440
It is a real challenge to maintain stability
on a system where you have no insight into

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.440
that.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:35.260
But you would never build a spacecraft that
way today so I'm not sure.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:40.030
The challenges we have are very interesting
but probably no longer relevant.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:45.230
The challenges that remain are the flexural
dynamic interaction problems.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:52.990
I just wanted to indicate that within the
control laws you have a steering processor,

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:57.760
which I will talk a little bit about more,
an RCS jet processor, a state estimator and

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.760
an OMS processor.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.589
The state estimator is unique to the on-orbit
flight.

00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:06.110
And there is more that represents that in
a minute.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:12.230
So I am going to now, having entered the overview,
go into each of the subsystems in more detail

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:21.140
by pulling up this picture to talk about it
a little more, these subsystems in the context.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:32.440
The forward RCS system had 14 primary 870
pound jets and two Vernier 24 pound jets.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.900
There were 24 and 4 respectively.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.079
Those systems in back evenly divided left
and right.

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:43.980
Each of the pods in the back had one OMS engine.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:50.420
The forward RCS system had its own self-contained
hypergolic tanks.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:37:01.780
The aft system had RCS tanks and OMS tanks
which could be interconnected from within

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.589
the pod or could be cross-fed across the pods.

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:08.560
Now, the consequence to the flight control
system, there were different constraints and

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.210
simultaneous jet firings.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:15.880
And how you counted, whether it was only left
or right or both, depending on which mode

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.410
you were in, if you had a mission and needed
a lot of RCS propellant and you had spare

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:24.280
space in the OMS tanks, it allowed benefiting
from that.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.450
Why are there so many thrusters pointing in
the same direction?

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.450
For redundancy?

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.130
Yes, redundancy and maximum control authority.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:38.380
You want to find control authority normally
with redundancy but for external tank separation

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.609
you wanted high acceleration in one direction.

00:37:41.609 --> 00:37:45.740
For high rendezvous breaking you wanted high
acceleration in the other direction plus or

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.000
minus Z.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:55.270
And for backup to the OMS engine you wanted
to have higher acceleration in the plus X

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.270
direction.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:01.000
And then, when you were doing entry, which
I'm not talking about today, you had an on-demand

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.240
RCS control authority in the upper atmosphere
during hypersonic flight.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:11.010
And you would turn on one, two, three or four
yaw thrusters in particular as needed.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:16.690
I think one, two, and occasionally three thrusters
had been turned on during disturbances.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:21.750
One of the things we've learned from the telemetry
of the Columbia accident is as this vehicle

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.650
was falling apart for probably 20 or 30 seconds,
the vehicle was controlling very nicely because

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.480
they kept turning on more and more jets.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.089
They were getting major torque imbalances
from missing pieces of the vehicle.

00:38:32.089 --> 00:38:36.740
But it was still controlling the attitude
until the damage got so severe that was no

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:40.920
longer possible.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:49.720
Again, I already talked about the number of
the thrusters.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.830
The primary thrusters, for the reasons we
talked about, there were many jets.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:57.349
And also because translation and rotation
control was accommodated by these Verniers,

00:38:57.349 --> 00:39:01.690
a feature I will mention briefly later.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.440
It was only a rotation control system and
fundamentally does not have redundancy.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.880
I already talked about the on-time.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:14.270
These are just typical propellant loads and
thrust levels and specific impulse numbers.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:19.690
You notice that large maneuvers are always
a little more efficiently done with the primary

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:23.770
jets and even more efficiently still with
the OMS as you will see in another chart.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:29.289
Life for duty cycles and on-time are relevant
for a vehicle that is going to fly a lot of

00:39:29.289 --> 00:39:31.829
missions.

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:34.830
Flying control almost always will be done
with Vernier jets, not just because of propellant,

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:40.940
which it is much more efficient, but also
because you will get a lot more mission life

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.240
out of it.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.150
This is a stick drawing of those.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.720
There is a numbering system associated with
it.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.980
FRL for which pot it's in.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.910
Up, down, forward, right, left.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.829
The last character for which direction it
fires.

00:39:57.829 --> 00:40:01.010
And then the middle number is a manifold.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.960
If you see a five that is the Vernier jets.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:09.250
One, two, three or four, any pod that has
got the same middle number is on one manifold.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:14.630
If a failure shut that manifold or a string
took down that manifold, all of those jets

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.279
were lost.

00:40:16.279 --> 00:40:21.590
When you lose a string, you would have one
manifold per pod that you would lose.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:25.220
That means under some circumstance, because
the Vernier system is redundant, a single

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.349
failure could take that out.

00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:32.309
But that wasn't critical to carrying out most
mission objectives or to safety.

00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:38.660
That is probably enough said on that.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:46.350
The OMS, typical propellant loads mentioned
here.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.369
On-time, never less than two seconds.

00:40:47.369 --> 00:40:52.779
Never less than, with one engine, 12,000 pound
second impulse with a 6,000 pound thrust not

00:40:52.779 --> 00:40:55.920
suitable for fine maneuvers.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.010
The RCS jets would always be used to trim
out any large OMS burn errors.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.339
Had a significantly higher specific impulse.

00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:09.000
For large maneuvers you're clearly better
off from a propellant weight perspective using

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.400
that system.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:18.710
Each of the engines had redundant gimbal control,
redundant by having one mechanical screw system,

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:23.859
but you could drive the nut or you could drive
the screw.

00:41:23.859 --> 00:41:26.680
And there were different electrical systems
that did that.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.300
This was the maximum authority.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:34.270
And the two axes at each engine could move
a portion of which was used to tract the center

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:39.730
of mass as the vehicle consumed propellant
or delivered payloads and a portion of which

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.869
was for actual thrust vector control management.

00:41:43.869 --> 00:41:45.220
We also had to subtract a little bit.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:48.539
You never want to go too close to the hard
stops because you risk mechanical failure

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:49.770
by doing that.

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:54.520
And you always have a little bit of mechanical
uncertainty of exactly where you are anyway.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:59.740
A portion of that was a mechanical uncertainty
and a portion of that was just a mechanical

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.369
safety margin.

00:42:01.369 --> 00:42:09.029
This is a drawing in the two different planes
of the rotation of the engines showing the

00:42:09.029 --> 00:42:16.770
span between the center, say about 15 feet
apart, no surprise given the general cross-section

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:17.770
of the Shuttle.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:24.059
An important thing to notice is that the engine,
while I can point through the CG, is not pointing

00:42:24.059 --> 00:42:27.010
anywhere near the body access of the vehicle.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:33.290
And, by the way, the vehicle body axes weren't
-- There was a significant offset between

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:40.970
the principle axis of the vehicle and the
body axis component of inertia, and the body

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:49.099
axis was quite large.

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:52.800
Three units, even with the replacements they
have gone through over the years, there remains

00:42:52.800 --> 00:43:03.170
three units for the INSs now, but the IMU
where mechanical systems with quanta for knowledge

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:06.440
of state which were not all that small.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.790
And the RGAs were even worse, the rate gyros.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.390
These quanta were quite significant.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:20.240
The reason was we had a half-word in that
multiplexity multiplexer for translating the

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:25.619
analog signal to a digital signal which determined,
based on the maximum range, the maximum range

00:43:25.619 --> 00:43:30.869
being dictated by maneuver rates where possible
during ascent and entry and not on orbit.

00:43:30.869 --> 00:43:33.420
But we were stuck with that.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.740
It was hardwired into the cards.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:45.800
And so these quanta then, we discovered there
was a one sigma probability of an every third

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:51.029
cycle one quanta noise spike on the data that
came across the MDMs.

00:43:51.029 --> 00:43:54.940
And that was pretty significant when we were
trying to do fine control during the transition

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.829
phase.

00:43:56.829 --> 00:44:09.200
Were the noise levels determined by this quantization,
in effect, the [NOISE OBSCURES]?

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.750
The noise phenomenology was related to the
electronics of the card, but it was directly

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:17.520
related to the least significant byte.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.280
But the mechanical sensors themselves were
superior to that?

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.280
Yes, they were.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.890
It was the MDM card that introduced the noise.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:33.330
If you had used one word from the MDMs that
would have [NOISE OBSCURES]?

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:40.619
Given the state-of-the-art to have processed
that much information across the MDMs would

00:44:40.619 --> 00:44:43.260
have made it too slow.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:50.140
We're talking orders of magnitude slower electronics
from the late `70s than you have today, so

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:59.079
the half-word was dictated by the data rates
that we required of these boxes.

00:44:59.079 --> 00:45:06.400
Now I'm going to go into specific features
on the software side.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.400
Yeah?

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.630
With the gyros, it seems on Hubble and Station,
for example, we always hear bad news on the

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:20.109
gyros having to be replaced every so often.

00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:24.550
Well, first of all, what I'm talking about
here, at the time the Shuttle first flew,

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.559
are mechanical gyros.

00:45:26.559 --> 00:45:28.400
Hubble may have started mechanical gyros.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.589
They have been changed out at least once or
twice.

00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:34.530
And are probably fiber optic systems.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:40.180
Hubble has the problem that it's in a fairly
high orbit, 300 plus nautical miles high for

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.180
the Shuttle anyway.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:46.289
It has a significant radiation exposure, particularly
when it goes through the South Atlantic Anomaly

00:45:46.289 --> 00:45:50.430
of the radiation belts which are 300 nautical
miles.

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:54.119
Much more time they spend on that than at
100 nautical miles.

00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:59.299
Cumulative radiation damage to the electronics
in those gyros is probably a contributing

00:45:59.299 --> 00:46:07.540
factor to the failure rates that they're seeing
on Hubble.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:12.170
I would say they must spend a few percentage
of their time in the South Atlantic Anomaly

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:14.420
at that altitude.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:23.170
Are the gyro replacements we're talking about
measurement gyros or attitude control gyros?

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:30.230
Well, the fine guidance gyros are the ones
that have been the big problem on the Hubble.

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:37.530
We're talking about quantitatively a different
regime we're operating here.

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:42.369
The quantization, take away the noise effects,
was something we could live with for operating

00:46:42.369 --> 00:46:43.369
the flight control system.

00:46:43.369 --> 00:46:47.140
In Hubble, you want to be able to measure
rates two or three orders of magnitude lower

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.470
than what we're talking about here.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:54.890
The actual design of the sensors is substantially
different because they're trying to get very,

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:56.640
very tiny little rates out.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:02.579
These are trying to maintain the image lock
when you're using the full magnification capability

00:47:02.579 --> 00:47:08.170
of the telescope and whatever target that
it has.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:12.940
Nevertheless, I would imagine that if the
Shuttle gyros are staying at 300 nautical

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:21.559
miles for five to ten years, they would fail,
too.

00:47:21.559 --> 00:47:23.910
Radiation is one of the fundamental drivers
for all missions.

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:28.500
And it often that Atlantic Anomaly is one
of the big drivers for low inclination.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.020
Space telescopes are 28.5 degree inclinations.

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:34.119
So they don't have to deal with the magnetic
fields coming in toward the poles which a

00:47:34.119 --> 00:47:39.820
polar mission has to, but there is this big
dip in the Van Allen Belts off the coast of

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:46.789
South America which poses a problem for everything
that isn't low orbit.

00:47:46.789 --> 00:47:54.549
The functionality we have in the autopilot,
we use the rate gyros and the inertial measurement

00:47:54.549 --> 00:48:00.400
unit on the transitioned app to get states
direction giving us altitude, giving us rate.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:06.420
On orbit we have the gyro shutdown to conserve
power, view data only.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:12.869
That then dictates that we are going to have
a state estimator on orbit.

00:48:12.869 --> 00:48:16.829
We have to put some special features to overcome
the rate gyro noise in the transition phase,

00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:20.010
which is irrelevant when the rate gyros aren't
operating in the on-orbit phase.

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:24.769
We have the Vernier jets and the associated
algorithm logic for on-orbit which isn't in

00:48:24.769 --> 00:48:26.970
the transition phase.

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:32.770
We worry a lot more about every detail propellant
deficiency on-orbit because we spend so much

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:33.770
more time there.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:39.700
We have a lot of features we've added to minimize
propellant there.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:47.410
The OMS capability in the two phases is actually
identical with both of them having a capability

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:51.799
to wrap around the RCS jets to the thrust
vector control should the thrust vector control

00:48:51.799 --> 00:48:55.150
not behave properly during that OMS burn.

00:48:55.150 --> 00:49:01.690
And this just delineates the various features
we have for steering.

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:03.250
OMS and RCS.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:07.690
Where we add lots more features because there
are a lot more things you are attempting to

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:13.170
track when you're doing your mission on orbit
than when you're just trying to get to and

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:18.049
from orbit.

00:49:18.049 --> 00:49:19.430
Notice the rates that we're talking about.

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:26.010
Typically, you look at an INS box these days
and you see hundreds of hertz data rates.

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:30.640
What restricted us here was how fast could
we -- For instance, none of the software was

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.150
in the sensor package.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:35.170
It was in our computer.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:38.710
And we had a severe throughput problem.

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:45.220
And the solution, since we had the rate gyros
for rates and we only needed the IMUs for

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:51.680
attitudes, and rates could be used to extrapolate
attitudes for a reasonable period of time,

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:57.319
was to greatly reduce the processing rate
of the IMU down to on the order of one hertz,

00:49:57.319 --> 00:49:59.510
submultiple of 25 hertz which is why it is
1.04.

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:09.530
On orbit, since it was our only source of
information, we had to eat a larger processing

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:16.380
burden, operating on a 6.25 hertz, but we
still were extrapolating in between the state

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.390
estimate of one time constant.

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:20.940
We'll talk a little bit about what we're doing
with that, but everything down here is operating

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:23.779
at 12.5 and we're getting the data in at 6.25.

00:50:23.779 --> 00:50:30.500
There are a lot of things you would do differently
simply because you don't have these low rate

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:38.130
constraints due to throughput limits.

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:43.850
The architecture then for the autopilot that
is being representative on orbit is you would

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:48.410
have a maneuver module where all the features
for steering the vehicle would be, kind of

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:50.010
an adjunct to guidance.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:53.960
You would have these modes controlled by the
crew and the push button display of what the

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.260
stick deflections would do.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:51:01.019
You would have the phase plane which would
be tracking attitude error, rate error and

00:51:01.019 --> 00:51:07.040
whether or not you should fire jets as a function
of those errors separate per axis.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.859
Are there people here that don't know about
phase planes?

00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:11.859
OK.

00:51:11.859 --> 00:51:16.990
Well, the concept of the phase plane, you
go to optimal control theory and you look

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:24.410
into a situation where you have a control
effector which is on or off by directional,

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:25.869
which is what thrusters are.

00:51:25.869 --> 00:51:31.730
And you look at what it takes, given an error
in a plane which is attitude error and rate

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:40.730
error, and you want to get minimum time to
neutralize that error to zero.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:52:01.670
51:35 But you have 
lots of dead zones, which I will talk about

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:07.220
more, to assure that you don't inefficiently
use the jets so that you are not constantly

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:12.680
trying to fire the jets to get exactly to
the origin which is never possible.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.920
The state estimator, which is a form of a
Kalman filter.

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.770
And then the jet selection logic which is
essentially for the primary jet lookup tables.

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:28.130
But it turned out to probably be the first
use of real based intelligence.

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:29.849
We didn't think about these things in that
time.

00:52:29.849 --> 00:52:34.390
And, when I talk about the stringing later,
I think we were also using an early version

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:36.980
of failure tree analysis.

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:44.109
But, in the 1970s, none of these things were
named.

00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:50.430
And then you have various loads for the parameters
that determine these dead zones and tables

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.430
and all that.

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:58.500
And the crew would select these from push
button displays.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:06.339
For the OMS, you could either have hand controller
inputs or cross-product steering and based

00:53:06.339 --> 00:53:18.630
guidance inputs which would then go into roll
and pitch and yaw.

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:23.900
Thrust vector processing channels were roll
and pitch coupled.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:28.410
Roll is only possible, of course, when you're
firing two engines by differentially pitching

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.269
the gimbals on the two engines.

00:53:30.269 --> 00:53:36.069
This would actually be an RCS loop automatically
with one engine, but you had to have the two

00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:38.829
pads coupled when you were trying to do both
of them.

00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:41.800
But the yaw axis was separate.

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.380
Just keeping in mind the time.

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:45.640
Go through one or two more charts before the
break?

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.300
That's fine.

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:53.600
I will go through the state estimator and
then we can take a short break.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:58.760
The state estimator, again, we were only getting
attitude information at 6.25 hertz from the

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:05.130
primary thrusters trying to maintain an estimate
of the vehicle rotation rates.

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:09.760
We also wanted to know what disturbances on
orbit you can have out-gassing the vehicle.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.760
You have gravity gradients.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.819
You have aero torques which have a diurnal
variation depending on where you are on earth

00:54:14.819 --> 00:54:20.640
orbit relative to where the sun is which are
tending to torque the vehicle in a particular

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.640
direction.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.940
Having knowledge of how that torque is behaving
in a certain time enables you to manipulate

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:30.790
your phase plane switching lines to more efficiently
use the jets.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:35.569
We were trying to estimate that.

00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:40.010
Given that we only had IMU data with noise
and quantization effects, we also had flexure

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:43.869
we weren't accounting for in doing that.

00:54:43.869 --> 00:54:49.210
So we had a low rate filter which incorporated
the measurements directly and a higher rate

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:54.230
filter which was also taking in feed forward
information we're going to fire the jets.

00:54:54.230 --> 00:55:01.330
We expect these velocity changes, rotational
and translational, to occur as a result of

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:02.980
the jet firing.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:09.079
And you can build that into the estimate to
anticipate that effect.

00:55:09.079 --> 00:55:14.599
And then, given all that information, basically
use that in the form of a common filter.

00:55:14.599 --> 00:55:21.799
We had different gains associated with primary
and Vernier jet usage because, given the factor

00:55:21.799 --> 00:55:27.150
of 30 difference in the rotational acceleration
authority of these jets, they were fundamentally

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:31.119
different bandwidth systems on the basis of
the actuators.

00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:33.770
We accommodated those different bandwidths
in the software.

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:41.140
That, by the way, affected us when we started
worrying about flexure on the arm because

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:46.759
we found that some of the modes with heavy
payloads in the arm actually fell within this

00:55:46.759 --> 00:55:47.759
bandwidth.

00:55:47.759 --> 00:55:51.490
And, in the case of the Vernier jets, were
falling right near the roll off point, which

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:54.630
was the worst possible place to have a flexure
mode.

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:58.080
And there were some significant design issues
that were addressed later in the program as

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.609
a result of that.

00:56:00.609 --> 00:56:02.849
And then this disturbance acceleration -- Question.

00:56:02.849 --> 00:56:08.380
At the time that you were designing these,
was there sufficient knowledge of the structural

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:09.950
modes or the bending modes?

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:12.180
For the RMS payload operations, not at all.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:16.960
We first learned about that when we started
looking at use of the arm to deploy the SPAS

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.869
one payload in STS-7.

00:56:19.869 --> 00:56:25.180
Nobody understood at the time we were designing
for the first Shuttle flight the kind of coupling

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.400
effects you would get from payloads on the
arm.

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.619
It hadn't been modeled yet.

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:32.340
I would say probably about the time the first
flights were occurring is when we started

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:38.000
to look at that stuff, but the Shuttle software
for the first flight was 95% frozen by '78,

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.320
even though the flight didn't occur until
'81.

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.329
You then discovered them in simulations or
from flight data?

00:56:43.329 --> 00:56:48.829
No, it was from high-fidelity simulations
with the arm dynamics included in that.

00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:49.990
We understood it pretty well.

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:55.500
We refined it after the flights.

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:59.400
We did even do some flight tests on STS-8
with an object called a payload flight test

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.490
article.

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:04.510
The original payload on that flight couldn't
fly in time so they put this 8,000 pound dumbbell

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:06.300
on there and the arm was able to manipulate.

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:10.912
Went through all kinds of exercises and pretty
much validated it with the simulations.

00:57:10.912 --> 00:57:12.599
Were towing us at that point in time.

00:57:12.599 --> 00:57:18.410
But it was a real lot of work that went into
those high-fidelity robotic arm simulations

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:21.369
and coupling that to the flight control system
to get those numbers.

00:57:21.369 --> 00:57:25.770
And a lot of work into evaluating what it
all meant in terms of restrictions on the

00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:27.470
use of the control system.

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:31.839
And then the last thing I will talk about
before the break, the disturbance acceleration

00:57:31.839 --> 00:57:35.400
estimator had a 56 second time constant.

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:41.569
Mostly the disturbances we are talking about
were either orbital or semi-orbit, half-orbit

00:57:41.569 --> 00:57:44.150
type of periodicity.

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:47.880
You wanted to allow adequate time to integrate
and determine their effect, but not so long

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:53.470
that you weren't able to properly respond
to it.

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:57.509
Somewhere in the one-minute range seemed to
be about right for something that would have

00:57:57.509 --> 00:57:59.360
45 minute periodicity.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.270
And I think the next topic will be RCS processor.

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:04.970
And that is a good point to take the break.

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:10.849
Before we break, let me ask one historical
question.

00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:15.510
The timeframe for the design of this was mid
to late '70s?

00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:20.869
We began the work in '75.

00:58:20.869 --> 00:58:26.819
There was a famous phase of '76 which is the
Hay Scrub which is where we realized that

00:58:26.819 --> 00:58:28.279
not everything can go onto one computer.

00:58:28.279 --> 00:58:30.570
The computer memory had to increase.

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:37.839
The real design architecture of what was going
to be the first flight started to gel in '76.

00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:41.589
The original expected launch date of the Shuttle
was '78.

00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:46.660
It kind of stayed ahead of us a certain amount
of time, but we had probably 90% or 95% of

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.340
the design done by '78.

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:53.490
We're going through detailed flight verification
and crew training with Jeff being one of the

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.010
crew members that was assigned to us.

00:58:55.010 --> 00:59:00.230
And we would go out to Downey to do that in
the '78 to '80 period.

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:07.070
In the design, now, you refer to the state
estimator and optimal control.

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:13.250
By that time, had that methodology been completely
accepted as a substitute for the classical

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:14.250
control design?

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:15.250
Oh, yeah, I think so.

00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.589
I think the phase plane concept first appeared,
actually, in Apollo.

00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:23.150
And there was sort of a rudimentary application
of optimal control theory that was quite successful.

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:30.130
By that time I think the aircraft zoom maneuver
[NOISE OBSCURES], people were happy with that.

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:35.549
The Kalman filter work, an early form of that
also made it into Apollo.

00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:39.150
I don't think we were actually pushing the
envelope that much in using these things.

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:41.450
We actually carried over.

00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:51.079
But Apollo, applying any of these technologies
in the mid to late `60s, was very groundbreaking.

00:59:51.079 --> 00:59:53.359
Any other questions before the break?

00:59:53.359 --> 00:59:54.359
OK.

00:59:54.359 --> 00:59:56.049
Let's take five minutes.

00:59:56.049 --> 00:59:58.880
Am I missing anybody?

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.130
I know Larry hasn't come back.

01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.549
Close enough.

01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:05.549
OK.

01:00:05.549 --> 01:00:10.289
Well, I'm going to go into the RCS processor
now.

01:00:10.289 --> 01:00:12.520
We've talked a lot about the presence of the
phase plane.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:16.740
We're going to go into some of the details
in the jet selection.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:25.259
Important consideration of the jet selection
is we had to accommodate failures, maintaining

01:00:25.259 --> 01:00:32.319
control authority for any type of single failure,
thruster, manifold, string, which you will

01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:33.569
see those later.

01:00:33.569 --> 01:00:40.730
And you also had to be able to maintain adequate
authority for safety with two of those combined

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:41.730
failures.

01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:45.410
We also had to limit plume restrictions, accommodate
the tank constraints.

01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:50.980
We talked about having couples, not having
couples, the balance propellant in tanks to

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:57.319
limit fuel usage when you didn't worry about
translational coupling and minor orbital perturbations

01:00:57.319 --> 01:01:00.769
and all those other special maneuvers that
we pointed out before they required higher

01:01:00.769 --> 01:01:02.279
authority.

01:01:02.279 --> 01:01:10.069
You had your manual modes going in and then
you had all these steering modes which without

01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:14.569
orbit, in addition to the ones we talked about,
discrete rate and pulse and acceleration and

01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:20.680
all that kind of stuff, you had various landmark
tracking modes, orbital object tracking modes

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:28.049
which were a guidance function providing inputs
to the control loop, that all had to be managed

01:01:28.049 --> 01:01:32.780
through a proper way of manipulating the phase
plans.

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:37.609
They were tracking the errors of matter with
respect to the mode that you were in and then

01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:41.910
sending, based on the errors being detected
in the phase plane commands, they would be

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:45.130
processed by the jet selection logic.

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:55.280
The principles of the phase plane, we figured
you weren't important enough to get started.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.530
[LAUGHTER] You had a phase plane per axis.

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:01.530
Roll.

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:02.530
Pitch.

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:03.530
Yaw.

01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:06.090
You had switch lines which were shaped based
on the expected torques.

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:10.519
You always had a parabolic feature, but much
more complicated than just that.

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:15.069
You added dead bands because you didn't want
to fire.

01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:19.579
When you didn't know exactly where you were,
you wanted to be able to get in the general

01:02:19.579 --> 01:02:23.599
vicinity far enough from a firing zone that
it would stay in the general vicinity for

01:02:23.599 --> 01:02:27.220
a while and then only fire when you had to
when you were diverging from that.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:32.950
You had to deal in the transition phase with
that rate gyro noise phenomenology.

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:38.130
And you had to get the disturbance acceleration
on orbit.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:46.180
What we did about all those maneuver modes
is each phase plane had an origin, the origin

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:50.849
being zero with respect to sun frame and attitude
and position.

01:02:50.849 --> 01:02:58.019
You could move that origin at a rate or you
could increment its attitude position if you

01:02:58.019 --> 01:03:02.880
were commanding the vehicle to do something
such as a tracking maneuver or a discrete

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.880
rate.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.849
And that way the errors of the phase plane
we're looking at with respect to where you

01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:10.460
wanted to be rather than in absolute sense.

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:15.039
And you would always create [NOISE OBSCURES]
in here so that if you had a big error you

01:03:15.039 --> 01:03:19.359
could spend a little bit of fuel to get to
somewhere which would cause you to go in the

01:03:19.359 --> 01:03:21.779
right direction without continuously firing
the jet.

01:03:21.779 --> 01:03:24.990
Whereas, if you truly followed the parabolic
switch curve you would just keep firing the

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:29.140
jet until you were back to the origin which
can be quite costly.

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:34.420
So I am going to show you this picture and
then the on-orbit one.

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:40.079
These are the residual parabolic switch lines
which, in the optimal control theory, would

01:03:40.079 --> 01:03:43.890
be going through the origin.

01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:48.799
And then if you're out over in these region
out here you will always fire a jet meaning

01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:51.811
a plus direction or the minus direction.

01:03:51.811 --> 01:03:54.190
You're inside here.

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:57.019
You will fire until you hit another switch
line on the other side.

01:03:57.019 --> 01:04:01.510
The expectation is that you're coming in this
way or you're coming in this way.

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:05.809
You want to get to a point where you're not
likely to fire again for a while.

01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:18.049
But then you also would be concerned because
you don't automatically want to fire back

01:04:18.049 --> 01:04:23.991
right away because the rate gyro noise phenomenology
could cause, where you think you are with

01:04:23.991 --> 01:04:29.730
respect to that line, to move back and forth
causing you to fire too soon, causing the

01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:31.960
fire again to reverse that and get in trouble.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:42.490
So what we actually did is if you actually
hit this line and began to fire, each time

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:50.319
you fired up to two or three times it would
move the line out temporarily so that the

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:55.140
quantum noise from that MDM would not make
you think, even though you were moving this

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.230
way, that you were going back out.

01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:03.099
Because, if you fired that jet again, not
only would you be spinning the propellant

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:05.690
to go faster, you'd hit the other line a lot
faster still.

01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:11.809
For every time you double the size of the
impulse that you use to reverse your rate,

01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:13.859
you're quadrupling the total propellant time.

01:05:13.859 --> 01:05:21.559
Because, if you double the propellant each
time, you hit a surface twice as fast before

01:05:21.559 --> 01:05:26.619
you get to the next one.

01:05:26.619 --> 01:05:32.259
Now, on-orbit we didn't have that noise problem
so we don't have that moving switch line there.

01:05:32.259 --> 01:05:33.579
But we have this moving switch line.

01:05:33.579 --> 01:05:37.430
If you're coming in you're looking to hit
the zero line and cut off, but here you're

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:40.040
not going to cut off until you hit the disturbance
acceleration line.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:44.260
It is expecting, when you hit that, that the
predicted acceleration is going to say you're

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.260
going to go up this way.

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:50.490
That means it will be longer before you hit
another surface than if you start doing that

01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:51.490
over here.

01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:59.359
So this one is a trick to lower the frequency
of the jet firings based on other knowledge

01:05:59.359 --> 01:06:04.859
that we had about the acceleration.

01:06:04.859 --> 01:06:05.859
Jet selection.

01:06:05.859 --> 01:06:08.200
We had entirely different laws for the primary
and the Vernier.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:16.150
The Verniers had a very complicated configuration,
had to be able to be fault tolerant, be able

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:19.619
to handle simultaneous translation rotation
commands.

01:06:19.619 --> 01:06:27.130
It turned out, because of throughput processing
limits, the correct approach was something

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:28.130
like a table lookup.

01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:32.540
But we had all kinds of rules we went through
to say which kind of table did we want to

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:33.540
go to?

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.960
What are the consequences of failures?

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.910
Do we want to start modifying the commands
we've received because of what we basically

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:48.529
know about which jets have failed and what
we no longer can accomplish?

01:06:48.529 --> 01:06:52.059
We actually had a Bullion implementation of
those tables that actually got implemented

01:06:52.059 --> 01:06:56.499
as tables because we developed algorithms
and IBM converted the software.

01:06:56.499 --> 01:07:00.280
And they didn't necessarily do exactly what
we told them.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:06.900
Subsequent to that there was an experiment
on the Shuttle called a phase space autopilot

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:14.930
which is based on looking for velocity changes
and optimal combinations of jets.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:24.210
You would go through a linear optimal search
and find the combinations.

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:27.029
That was flown a couple times for a few hours
on Shuttle.

01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:33.730
The experiment was quite successful but never
converted into a basic shuttle capability.

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:37.130
But certainly with the processing capability
that you have now would be a very good option

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:38.319
as an alternative to what we did.

01:07:38.319 --> 01:07:43.309
The Vernier jets, which were only used on
orbit, only had six jets.

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:47.150
We weren't trying to deal with redundancies
so an entirely different kind of scheme was

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:49.740
done there.

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:58.809
We were looking to find the jets with respect
to a three-axis command which best contributed

01:07:58.809 --> 01:08:01.079
to producing rates in that direction.

01:08:01.079 --> 01:08:04.910
We could find a first jet that would be the
best jet.

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:11.200
And then we could see, given how good that
one is, is there another one which is half

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.200
as good?

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.200
If so, we would pick it.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.060
And, if we found one half as good, we might
say if there is another one which is half

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:21.810
again as good we might pick that and end up
with an aggregate number of jets we would

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:28.380
turn on to start producing the command.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:33.420
This would be based not just on whether or
not the phase plane said you should have a

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:40.609
jet fire in an axis, but also on how big the
error was but not yet to the point of hitting

01:08:40.609 --> 01:08:44.460
the phase plane line in the other axis.

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:50.259
And so the composite vector you were trying
to neutralize would be a combination of the

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:52.380
command and error reduction on the other axes.

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:56.770
And you would find the jets which would then
respond your command and reduce the errors

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:57.810
on the other axes.

01:08:57.810 --> 01:08:59.960
Now, we would not re-compute that every cycle.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:08.400
If we found that the ones or minus ones in
the three axes for the commands were not changing,

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:13.029
even though the fractional values and the
uncommand of axes were changing for up to

01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:15.469
five cycles we would not re-compute the jets.

01:09:15.469 --> 01:09:22.069
And that would minimize the duty cycles which
was a life issue on the jets.

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:27.900
And then there was the other phenomenology
I mentioned which is you start having large

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:31.690
payloads or you're attached to Mir or something
like that.

01:09:31.690 --> 01:09:33.589
Mass properties are very different.

01:09:33.589 --> 01:09:37.529
We don't know about that unless the crew tells
us, but we could put a discrete number of

01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:41.819
alternative configurations in the tables for
what we expected accelerations of the jets

01:09:41.819 --> 01:09:42.900
would be.

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:45.940
The crew could tell us which one applies,
and then it would do this selection based

01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:48.529
on that.

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:50.609
The Vernier algorithm looks something like
this flow chart.

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:54.800
Whereas, the primary algorithm would probably
fill a 50 page flowchart.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.389
The Vernier algorithm was very simple.

01:09:57.389 --> 01:10:03.880
You go through and have a command vector which
was ones and minus ones or fractional values,

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:09.330
depending on whether or not phase planes have
commanded an axis or just had a bias because

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:11.270
of an error in that axis.

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:15.150
You would do a dot product of the six jets.

01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:22.940
You would look for the maximum value of that
dot product of the acceleration and the command.

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.670
And then, based on that value of that dot
product, you would see if there was one that

01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:26.670
was half as good.

01:10:26.670 --> 01:10:29.560
And, if there was one as half as good, you
would see if there was one that was a quarter

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.190
as good.

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:36.170
And then, if we already selected, we would
be doing this counter of up to five times

01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:38.100
where we wouldn't recomputed.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:42.639
Now, I was just talking during the break about
one of the constraints on here.

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:45.900
When we were using these computers, the dot
product of a three vector by three vector

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.239
took about one millisecond.

01:10:49.239 --> 01:10:50.570
We had an 80 millisecond cycle.

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:57.150
And, in that 80 millisecond cycle, seven to
ten milliseconds could be allocated to control

01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:01.019
some of the guidance and some of the other
functions.

01:11:01.019 --> 01:11:02.159
Six milliseconds was being used to do these
dot products.

01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:09.420
That is why we never could have considered
doing something like that for the primary

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:12.540
jets.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:22.210
The TVC processor, we have instead of discrete
control with thrusters, we have nearly continuous

01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:28.460
control because we're doing gimbal steering
up to the nonlinear effect of a gimbal limit.

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.210
Remind them what TVC is.

01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:31.770
Thrust vector control.

01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:36.730
Moving the thrust of the OMS engine by steering
the gimbals on which it is attached, which

01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:43.590
you cannot do with the RCS thrusters.

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.510
What we would do then is cross-product steering.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:49.949
You have an error vector and a thrust vector,
and the cross-product between the two could

01:11:49.949 --> 01:11:55.110
tell you the direction you needed to steer
the vehicle to turn into the desired direction

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:56.949
you wanted to thrust.

01:11:56.949 --> 01:12:02.290
That steering command was then used to determine
the commands we sent to the gimbals for moving

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:03.800
the engines.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.679
You had manual and automatic modes for doing
that.

01:12:08.679 --> 01:12:14.080
Generally, we were limited to two degrees
per second because the gimbals were fairly

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.080
slow.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.940
We didn't want to get ourselves in a situation
where we over-steered and had to correct back

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:22.710
which would take a lot of time and maybe cost
us some propellant.

01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:26.330
But, if we got into trouble, the reaction
control system could wrap around.

01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:30.050
And that could happen automatically if the
errors got big enough or the crew could induce

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:33.150
that by hitting the hand controller.

01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:38.110
And you have the two pads going into the manual
auto mode.

01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:43.310
And manual always overrides auto from any
of these operations.

01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:49.449
We had a lot of things we had to tolerate
in determining our filter gains.

01:12:49.449 --> 01:12:53.570
We didn't always know the thrust direction
engines all that way because of mechanical

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:54.570
misalignment.

01:12:54.570 --> 01:13:00.150
When you build this thing an additional misalignment
occurs after you launch the thing causing

01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:06.989
changes in the gimbal drive connections a
little bit.

01:13:06.989 --> 01:13:12.020
There are errors.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:15.920
You rotate to a desired burn direction with
the RCS jets before you light the engines.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.600
You're never exactly there when you start
up.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.199
You can have failures during burns.

01:13:20.199 --> 01:13:22.410
An engine can shut down.

01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:28.380
An actuator can stop driving.

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:36.140
If it is the OMS-1 burn in the early Shuttle
days, during that burn they were dumping the

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:41.200
residual oxygen and hydrogen in the feed lines
for the main engines during the burn causing

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.969
torque disturbance on the vehicle that we
had to overcome.

01:13:44.969 --> 01:13:49.280
The OMS burn actually helped drive that fluid
out of those lines.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:52.421
And then, of course, we had steering noise
and bias.

01:13:52.421 --> 01:13:57.550
And then we had to have margins for things
that all liquid propellant vehicles have.

01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:05.580
Slosh, flexure, actuator nonlinearities and
sample rate effects.

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:11.260
Now we had a design and then we had to change
it.

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:14.840
And the reason we had to change it is we flew
for a little while, and we discovered that

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:20.570
these brushless electric motors being used
for the OMS actuators were turning on and

01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:24.570
off at a high enough rate during the burns
that they were overheating making a hundred

01:14:24.570 --> 01:14:27.460
mission life maybe two or three missions.

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:33.150
And they could take the pods off, but they
were fairly hard to get and expensive to maintain.

01:14:33.150 --> 01:14:37.760
So they asked us to change the bandwidth.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:43.290
And that's what we did beginning with the
twelfth shuttle flight making these changes

01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:44.290
here.

01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:50.960
And that caused a little bit more sloppy behavior
at the beginning and the end of the burn but

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.090
didn't make very appreciable difference on
the performance and made a big difference

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:57.719
on the actuator life.

01:14:57.719 --> 01:15:02.010
There was an outer loop just showing where
the cross-product steering comes in and the

01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:07.409
fact that there are various filters and digital
compensation effects that are going into this

01:15:07.409 --> 01:15:13.639
to deal in an adequate manner with all those
effects that I listed a few minutes ago.

01:15:13.639 --> 01:15:22.840
The wraparound was there because we have the
means to cover for large perturbations.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.840
Why not implement it?

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:27.719
I mean the situation you always have with
human space flight, if there was a capability

01:15:27.719 --> 01:15:34.800
you can take advantage of in a contingency
scenario put it in.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:42.300
This also changed, though, between the first
flight and the twelfth flight.

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:46.380
And the reason we found is that you put this
contingency capability in, but when you really

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.860
study it you realize you can actually take
these two fundamentally different control

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:55.600
laws and cause them to interact adversely.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:01.150
We could perturb it and then induce the jets
to fire in a way that would cause it to counteract

01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:04.210
the effect that the thrust vector control
system was doing.

01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:09.800
So, when we lowered the bandwidth, we also
changed some of the parameters in there to,

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.970
in combination, preclude that first flight.

01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:18.969
This is a case where we continued to evaluate
the baseline system after we were flying and

01:16:18.969 --> 01:16:26.671
discovered additional potential unanticipated
deficiencies that we should fix, which is

01:16:26.671 --> 01:16:31.810
saying you're never done analyzing the system
even after it starts flying.

01:16:31.810 --> 01:16:38.449
The maneuver and track modes, I mentioned
that they were there, but we had this universal

01:16:38.449 --> 01:16:41.170
pointing display that the crew could manipulate.

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:42.170
Yes?

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:49.060
On that last general comment, on the last
subject of discovering issues and potential

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.210
problems after the system is flying.

01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:52.290
You're doing the analysis.

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:54.920
You're doing your research.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:01.130
What, in general, were the reactions of your
NASA counterparts when you bring that to their

01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:02.130
attention?

01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:04.370
Would they call for an immediate fix before
the next launch?

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:05.840
It depended on the nature of the problem.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.780
And let me mention two or three of them at
one time.

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:15.070
I mentioned one about that phenomenology for
the excitation or the rocking motion on the

01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:16.070
tank.

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:19.469
And then another one with the Vernier jets
which I will explain in a moment.

01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:23.630
The external tank one had to be fixed before
a second shuttle flight.

01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:26.440
There was one that potentially created a dangerous
situation.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.820
Tank separation violated safety of flight
rules.

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:34.820
This one was a potential wraparound interaction.

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:40.600
It could only occur if you already had a significant
contingency under fairly complex conditions.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:47.310
And, if the crew knew about it, there was
a procedural way to temporarily inhibit the

01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:51.040
reaction control system interactions stopping
the effect.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.840
Because there was a crew workaround, they
knew about the problem, it was deemed acceptable

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:59.530
to go some number of missions for an already
scheduled software update to insert it.

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:07.060
Now, the third problem discovered as a result
of analysis of STS-1 and 3 was a plume and

01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:12.320
pendulum phenomenology of the down firing
aft jets.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:20.719
The body flap sticks out as kind of a random
position on orbit, and the down firing thrusters,

01:18:20.719 --> 01:18:22.010
part of their plume hits it.

01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:27.590
They had evaluated that effect for the primary
jets because they knew in the direction they

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:31.550
pointed and their lower expansion ratio in
the Vernier jets there was going to be a problem.

01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:34.150
And that was properly dealt with in the flight
control system.

01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:39.790
They never modeled for the Vernier jets, but
only discovered that the state estimator was

01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:46.489
not converging as well as expected on the
first Shuttle flight when using the Vernier

01:18:46.489 --> 01:18:47.489
jets.

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:52.140
And it turned out there was probably a 20%
or 30% net reduction in thrust and a 15 or

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:57.530
20 degree effective change in the direction
of the thrusts, those two down firing Verniers.

01:18:57.530 --> 01:19:02.610
And the feed forward estimation from the RCS
jets, as a result, was giving the wrong data

01:19:02.610 --> 01:19:07.920
in the state estimator causing a jump in the
value and a long time constant to settle out.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:13.690
And that was causing a few percent increase
in the propellant consumption but probably

01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:17.369
a factor of ten increase in the duty cycles
of the jets which was unacceptable from the

01:19:17.369 --> 01:19:19.230
life of the jets.

01:19:19.230 --> 01:19:24.190
That was compounded by a problem in STS-3
which is the first time they used the arm.

01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:28.650
And they actually put a few hundred pound
payload and tried controlling the attitude

01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:30.460
of the vehicle in moving that payload.

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:36.280
The combination of those things they went
back and, by STS-5, had to make serious changes

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:44.800
to the phase plane estimation logic and tables
for the accelerations for those Vernier jets

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.239
because they didn't want to burn those jets.

01:19:47.239 --> 01:19:50.070
I think, after STS-2, they actually changed
some of the jets.

01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:55.360
And then they didn't want to have to change
them again.

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:59.550
The maneuver mode.

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:05.510
You want to do various types of [NOISE OBSCURES]
maneuvers with respect to various frames of

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:12.969
reference which could be landmark tracking,
local vertical tracking, second spacecraft

01:20:12.969 --> 01:20:14.870
if you're doing a rendezvous tracking.

01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:16.261
Guidance to provide that.

01:20:16.261 --> 01:20:22.239
That would be broken down into components
by axis.

01:20:22.239 --> 01:20:26.760
And then there was an additional level of
hysteresis about what you were telling the

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.760
face plane to do.

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.610
And I talked about adjusting the origin.

01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:34.320
This would decide whether or not you would
adjust the origin.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:39.210
If you're error in a given axis with respect
to what you wanted to do with the maneuver

01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:42.640
was less than twice the dead band, you would
not adjust the origin.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:46.219
And if it was more than twice you would.

01:20:46.219 --> 01:20:51.360
And, again, it is a case of why force it to
do things it doesn't have to do if it's going

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.969
to get there eventually anyway?

01:20:54.969 --> 01:21:02.790
And that is actually an adjustable parameter
which, for certain payload missions, they

01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:10.630
might change that value from something else.

01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:19.580
There were these various direct manual translation
rotation modes and the auto modes that I think

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:22.489
bit by bit I have talked about.

01:21:22.489 --> 01:21:28.860
The reason you have these different references,
inertial and local vertical, if you're doing

01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:32.619
an earth observation mission, almost everything
is going to be in a local vertical frame.

01:21:32.619 --> 01:21:35.690
You're going to have your payload bay pointing
down.

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:38.119
You want to keep it pointed at a certain spot.

01:21:38.119 --> 01:21:43.790
If you're doing a solar telescope mission,
everything is going to be in an inertial frame.

01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:49.210
You're going to want to keep it pointing at
the sun or within a few degrees where maybe

01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:57.010
the telescope will have a limited travel of
its own.

01:21:57.010 --> 01:22:01.050
If you're doing rendezvous then it's going
to have to be you're accounting for the orb

01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:02.389
rates of the two vehicles.

01:22:02.389 --> 01:22:07.850
You're going to want to keep your rendezvous
radar pointed in the right direction.

01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:14.960
By the way, the rendezvous radar, there is
a deployable dish antenna that goes out of

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.290
the payload bay, the side of the payload bay
of the Shuttle.

01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:20.520
That is a dual-purpose antenna.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:27.780
It can be used to point at the TDRS satellite
to send data at high rates to the earth and

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:28.780
track the satellite.

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:34.989
Or it can be used to point a radar beam at
another spacecraft.

01:22:34.989 --> 01:22:38.790
It was not used for TDRS in the beginning
of the program.

01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:47.020
It was only used for radar because the first
TDRS was launched by STS-6.

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:49.671
Electronic string, and I think we're about
at the right point of time on this, too, to

01:22:49.671 --> 01:22:55.150
allowing me to get into this in a little bit
of detail.

01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:59.270
This was something that kind of crept up on
us in importance.

01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:06.820
It was thought it would make the systems redundant,
have separate strings, don't put them all

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:08.010
on the same computer.

01:23:08.010 --> 01:23:12.000
All those things were recognized, but I don't
think until about a year, a year and half

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.020
before the first flight actually occurred
that we realized how difficult it is to be

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:22.900
sure that all the interactions of these strings,
the power string, the pluming string and the

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:29.020
electronic string and the possible combinations
of failures, how difficult it is to assure

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:32.050
that you meet those high level failure tolerance
requirements.

01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:39.630
And that is what I think I did in 1980, '81,
probably was the early form of fault tree

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:40.630
analysis.

01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:45.699
And I have in a handbook I developed for the
first flight, a series what if tables with

01:23:45.699 --> 01:23:49.880
all these different breakdowns of what could
happen.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:53.290
And actually a person that didn't know about
probabilities and all looked at it.

01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:58.920
It was a pretty scary table when you looked
at all the possible bizarre two failure combinations.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:03.639
But first you've got to understand what the
strings are.

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:16.340
You would have one forward, one aft left,
one aft right, so three boxes, three half

01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:21.739
boxes and multiplexers-demultiplexers on a
string.

01:24:21.739 --> 01:24:32.540
And there were two MDM boxes in each pod,
forward left right aft.

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:35.710
And the electronics were broken apart into
each half box.

01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:40.941
So you actually had, in effect, four sets
of electronics in each pod, even though you

01:24:40.941 --> 01:24:45.800
only had two boxes.

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:50.630
And one card from each of those boxes would
be dedicated to string, but each string would

01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:53.570
have a card per pod.

01:24:53.570 --> 01:25:00.070
So three cards would be tied electronically
to one computer anomaly.

01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:09.739
Now, you couldn't take a string that could
be commanded by more than one computer.

01:25:09.739 --> 01:25:13.870
The computer saw the data from all four strings
so they could vote the data to decide whether

01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:18.860
or not each of the computers was healthy,
but they could only command one string.

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:26.000
I should say each string could only be commanded
by one computer, but you could, if you started

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.630
losing computers, latch up more than one string
to one computer.

01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:34.000
Even though one string could only take commands
from one computer, more than one string could

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.780
take commands from the same computer if that
became necessary.

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:42.290
If you lost a computer and were in a benign
environment and you wanted to recover all

01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:47.199
those systems, that happened with the first
computer failure in STS-9, then you would

01:25:47.199 --> 01:25:51.860
manually re-latch those strings to a healthy
computer.

01:25:51.860 --> 01:26:03.190
Of course, if that computer went down then
it would take two strings down.

01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:10.840
There was a unique latch up of these string
components to power systems, but it wasn't

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.840
necessarily one-to-one.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:18.239
And that is where things got very complicated,
when you start crossing the subsystems where

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:21.980
one power system could cause some subsystems
to fail on more than one string.

01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.790
Then you take a string down.

01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:29.340
That would be a very different failure scenario
than taking two strings down.

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.440
This is showing how the thrusters laid out.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:37.070
You can see there are a lot of thrusters on
each string.

01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:43.250
If you go back and look at the vehicle carefully
and you look at the down firing thrusters,

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:49.170
you will see that in the front of the tank
there are two thrusters that point down to

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:55.800
the left and two thrusters that point down
to the right candid out about 40 degrees.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:01.260
That means that if you lose two thrusters,
two strings or two manifolds it was possible

01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:03.040
to lose both of them on one side.

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:08.960
That is very important because that's one
of the phenomena we had to protect against

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.250
for separating from the external tank.

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:14.450
And it becomes a highly coupled separation
maneuver.

01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:21.130
And there were some special jet select tables
created for that and some special control

01:27:21.130 --> 01:27:23.280
logic loops that were created just for that
one scenario.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:31.360
You go through these things and certain critical
events where things cannot fail even if your

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.390
subsystems have failed twice.

01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:38.560
And the subsystems may not have been designed
to make it very convenient, but you still

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.560
have to do it.

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.940
That happens to be one of the scenarios we
looked at a lot.

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:47.090
And that we see forward down left down left
or forward down right down right.

01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:50.650
So somehow you lose the thrusters, these strings
or whatever.

01:27:50.650 --> 01:27:53.450
That became a special design case.

01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:56.080
And there were a lot of those kinds of things.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:04.790
I would say 70% or 80% of our design time
goes into learning those special cases.

01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:15.890
With the thrusters the manifolds are basically
the valve lines, so there is a commonality

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:20.100
between the electronic stringing of manifolds
in those valves.

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:22.210
With the OMS that's not really true.

01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:27.800
The way the OMS engines work, each engine
[NOISE OBSCURES] is actually an oxidizer and

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:35.480
fuel tank going into two loops of lines each
with two valves.

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:44.010
At least one valve in each path had to open
to feed fuel.

01:28:44.010 --> 01:28:55.260
At least both valves in one loop had to close
to stop fuel from flowing.

01:28:55.260 --> 01:29:04.659
Any combination which would leave two open
after a burn started or would leave two closed

01:29:04.659 --> 01:29:08.780
before the burn started was a problem.

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:10.000
Then you have pressure sensors.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.880
And there was only one per engine.

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:19.219
You lacked insight into whether or not the
engine started based on pressure if one of

01:29:19.219 --> 01:29:21.179
those failed.

01:29:21.179 --> 01:29:26.270
The stringing of this was not the same as
the electronic string, so we had to start

01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:33.980
looking at the possibility of individual valve
failures and electronic string failures.

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.070
Taking down other valves.

01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:38.719
Did that happen before an engine started,
after an engine started?

01:29:38.719 --> 01:29:44.349
How did that correlate with then influence
on the same engine's actuator control?

01:29:44.349 --> 01:29:49.530
We could get situations where we could start
the engine but we couldn't steer it, engines

01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:57.679
that we could steer but couldn't start it,
and so we ended up with this maze of tables

01:29:57.679 --> 01:30:02.179
looking at those situations coming up with
contingency designs.

01:30:02.179 --> 01:30:08.330
Sometimes reverting to using the XRCS jets
under severe multiple failure scenarios that

01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:15.040
actually do deorbit burns.

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.679
We talked about what could go down.

01:30:16.679 --> 01:30:22.630
All of these things could be lost with a single
failure, though not all strings have an IMU

01:30:22.630 --> 01:30:24.190
because there are only three.

01:30:24.190 --> 01:30:27.770
And only two of the chamber pressure.

01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:32.580
Some strings were more important than others
with respect to a subset of the systems.

01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:39.610
And since there are only two thrusters on
one manifold per pod of the Verniers, there

01:30:39.610 --> 01:30:42.679
are also only three strings that affected
those.

01:30:42.679 --> 01:30:51.290
All this got set up so that any one failure
was quite manageable, but the moment you talked

01:30:51.290 --> 01:30:57.770
about any possible two failures was when it
became much more complicated.

01:30:57.770 --> 01:31:06.869
Generally, where we ended up, after lots and
lots of special design accommodation was we

01:31:06.869 --> 01:31:17.489
tolerated loss of translation control in the
axes that were not necessary for managing

01:31:17.489 --> 01:31:20.570
deorbit.

01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:27.010
We tolerated degradation and rotation control
but assured that we retained it, at least

01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:30.170
in a time average sense, in all three axes.

01:31:30.170 --> 01:31:37.430
The biggest complexity here was assuring we
still had adequate time averaged translation

01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:39.960
and rotation control for tank separation.

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:43.270
So we would pull away without recontacting
the tank.

01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:47.010
Remember, recontacting the tank meant tiles
hitting the tank.

01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:50.200
Those tiles are really fragile.

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:59.900
They can survive thousands of degrees but
not much impact.

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:04.760
We accommodated the scenario where we could
lose all thrust vector control on the OMS

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:12.080
engines and still do a deorbit burn usually
with RCS wraparound properly designed.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:17.349
And we had to accommodate the situations where
MDMs did not reset, so everything tied to

01:32:17.349 --> 01:32:19.420
an MDM would be lost.

01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:24.241
And that is the kind of situation where you
start having valve here, a valve here, a valve

01:32:24.241 --> 01:32:28.220
there being shut down along with a bunch of
jets.

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:36.139
And the real pain was understanding what things
could collectively go down together.

01:32:36.139 --> 01:32:42.619
You had to lay out all the faults, all the
things that could happen with each of the

01:32:42.619 --> 01:32:45.850
faults and then overlaying the combinations
of those.

01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:48.340
And then you would find it wasn't everything
you were worried about.

01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:54.230
It was usually a small fraction, but those
few fractions drove the design details and

01:32:54.230 --> 01:32:56.869
effort to a great degree.

01:32:56.869 --> 01:33:02.910
Now, on orbit, because you would often being
using one IMU and you only had two computers,

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:05.470
one of those strings going down meant you
lost your navigation base.

01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:09.960
But because you're in a relatively benign
environment, restringing and bringing up another

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.000
system wasn't a problem.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.040
If you were doing terminal rendezvous with
the Space Station, you would not be in a one

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.040
IMU mode.

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:23.410
You would be in a three IMU mode on two computers,
but you would not lose your navigation base.

01:33:23.410 --> 01:33:29.010
If you lost a computer at a critical point
in that, you would probably abort the rendezvous,

01:33:29.010 --> 01:33:33.140
reconfigure again and resume your operations.

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:37.880
One of the ground rules for all rendezvous
operations with the Shuttle, and I think will

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:42.219
be true of the CVE is an rendezvous operation
planned to do has to be able to be repeated

01:33:42.219 --> 01:33:43.219
at least once.

01:33:43.219 --> 01:33:55.480
The way I want to end this, and then we could
have questions, is two pictures, before and

01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:58.760
after cockpit upgrade on the Shuttle.

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:03.110
This was the way the Shuttle was for many
flights.

01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:16.980
Those are CRT displays, green monochrome where
no images could be drawn except little sticks,

01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:20.270
dots and lines and rudimentary.

01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:26.660
These are analog tape measures, analog eight
ball with analog needles for attitude and

01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:30.890
rate information.

01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:35.429
And really very 1970s.

01:34:35.429 --> 01:34:39.380
Comment on that.

01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:46.110
One of the things that we did as payload specialists
is we got some training in the cockpit, and

01:34:46.110 --> 01:34:49.179
that was the version that was available in
the early `90s when I was down there.

01:34:49.179 --> 01:34:54.421
And you would go from your desk at the Johnson
Space Center when you were using an IMB Think

01:34:54.421 --> 01:34:59.800
Pad or something, and you felt as though you
had gone through a time warp when you went

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:03.469
back to the simulator on what was the world's
most expensive vehicle.

01:35:03.469 --> 01:35:04.989
It was extraordinary.

01:35:04.989 --> 01:35:09.369
And, of course, you could explain why this
was kept on so long.

01:35:09.369 --> 01:35:16.710
Well, it was this multi seven digit figure
for its upgrade, as well as the issue about

01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:18.350
recertification.

01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:25.683
And let me mention both of those in a moment,
point out a couple of things and get back

01:35:25.683 --> 01:35:30.449
to that before I show you the current configuration.

01:35:30.449 --> 01:35:42.300
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] The amount in the Shuttle
versus the amount to support the Shuttle?

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:43.300
In the Shuttle because [NOISE OBSCURES].

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.640
Well, you only have a 104k memory computer.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:51.730
You have the actual number of lines that are
[NOISE OBSCURES].

01:35:51.730 --> 01:35:59.369
Yeah, you had the 104k for the backup system,
the 104k for ascent and entry, the 104k for

01:35:59.369 --> 01:36:05.650
on-orbit, the 104k for system management.

01:36:05.650 --> 01:36:08.850
And then there have been other things where
their own software capabilities have been

01:36:08.850 --> 01:36:10.000
added in subsequent years.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:18.360
So it is a lot of software now, but human
validation means if you make small change

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:22.679
everything has to be reassessed for possible
interaction to a degree that you would never

01:36:22.679 --> 01:36:28.630
do for a mission that doesn't put human safety
at risk.

01:36:28.630 --> 01:36:35.510
That means the cost of doing that each time
is probably an order of magnitude higher than

01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:38.170
it would be for an unmanned system.

01:36:38.170 --> 01:36:43.430
You look at what it was going to take to put
a cockpit upgrade in there.

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:47.070
We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars
to do it for the fleet.

01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:48.070
And when I say hundreds of millions, a couple
hundred million.

01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:52.869
It did eventually get done, as I will show
you in the next picture, but the main reason

01:36:52.869 --> 01:36:59.660
was obsolescence rather than wanting to be
contemporary.

01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:03.659
You cannot buy these pieces to replace them
anymore.

01:37:03.659 --> 01:37:08.579
The companies that actually made some of these
systems may not exist.

01:37:08.579 --> 01:37:13.380
Or, if they do, they have no economic incentive
for maintaining the base for a customer that

01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.550
may buy another five of them.

01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:21.320
And so, one of the things you have to deal
with when a system is going to do this many

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:27.110
years, another example of that is the B-52
or the Triton missiles or things that stay

01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:33.489
in operation for a long time, is you have
to plan, as part of your operation cost, for

01:37:33.489 --> 01:37:40.050
periodic upgrades to mitigate obsolescence.

01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:54.320
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] In some program they had
some support.

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:58.500
It was Digital microcomputers.

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:02.099
We had a room over in the Hill building that
had about 100 of them stacked up as backups.

01:38:02.099 --> 01:38:06.320
I don't think the boxes ever got opened.

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:12.250
I think the program did the buy, but the program
never lasted as long as it was supposed to.

01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:14.131
But you are right.

01:38:14.131 --> 01:38:15.140
You can try to buy it.

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:20.480
But, even so, even unused systems had a shelf
life.

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:24.420
And you don't know how good they are going
to be 30 years later.

01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:28.800
If you had asked me in 1978 how long the Shuttle
was going to fly before it was replaced, I

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.080
would have said ten years, maybe 15.

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.440
Before the Columbia accident they were talking
about another 20.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.969
It is only the safety issues now that are
going to make them stop it soon.

01:38:38.969 --> 01:38:45.860
Anyway, the other thing I want to point out
here, this is the crew interaction mechanism,

01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:49.679
a push button display.

01:38:49.679 --> 01:38:50.750
No such thing as GUI.

01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:54.409
That is unheard of in the Shuttle.

01:38:54.409 --> 01:38:57.969
Can you talk a bit about the hand controllers?

01:38:57.969 --> 01:38:58.969
Are they the same ones used for landings that
are also used for docking?

01:38:58.969 --> 01:39:02.449
I mean was it the same hand controller for
everything?

01:39:02.449 --> 01:39:06.260
It is the same hand controller for everything,
except there is another station in the back,

01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:09.540
I didn't bring a picture of it, which is used
for docking.

01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:14.570
The cockpit, you're looking out the forward
windows, you turn around and there is another

01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:17.780
set of cockpit instrumentation, hand controllers.

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:21.860
And there are two windows above you and two
windows looking on the payload bay.

01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:26.199
And there are also controllers there for the
arm.

01:39:26.199 --> 01:39:29.119
Everything related to the arm is done looking
out toward the payload bay.

01:39:29.119 --> 01:39:30.630
The arm is attached there.

01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:33.520
When you are doing rendezvous you're looking
out at the overhead windows of the vehicle

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:34.590
you are approaching.

01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:40.671
So, in effect, you have a couple of these
CRT displays and identical hand controller

01:39:40.671 --> 01:39:49.320
and the equivalent then or the updated equivalent
now of these displays on a back station.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:56.329
To avoid any issues of changing controllers
and changing viewpoints, you might note that

01:39:56.329 --> 01:39:59.990
normally the controls that are done out of
the back window with that separate controller

01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:03.489
and separate displays are done by different
crew members.

01:40:03.489 --> 01:40:09.010
That is typically a mission specialist's job,
not a pilot or commander job, and so they

01:40:09.010 --> 01:40:10.280
are separately trained.

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:11.280
Right.

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.389
That's an important point.

01:40:12.389 --> 01:40:17.080
For rendezvous and docking, it is the pilot
or commander who uses the aft controls to

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.650
control [NOISE OBSCURES].

01:40:22.650 --> 01:40:24.670
Do you know?

01:40:24.670 --> 01:40:27.810
I believe that everything related to the RMS
that you said is correct.

01:40:27.810 --> 01:40:31.780
But for a rendezvous the commander is always
involved.

01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:39.949
But the point was that in that case that is
done out the rear window.

01:40:39.949 --> 01:40:42.900
It is still done at the rear window, so he
has got to mentally reverse his frame of reference

01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:43.900
while he is doing that.

01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:44.900
That is correct.

01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:51.390
[NOISE OBSCURES] And that is something that
I think will not be done with the CEV.

01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:58.250
The same frame of reference will be used on
the CEV because I think that has always been

01:40:58.250 --> 01:41:04.750
a little bit of a point of contention in the
problems of maintaining simultaneous proficiency.

01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:09.610
For remote manipulation with the arm that
has been an issue.

01:41:09.610 --> 01:41:10.610
Yeah.

01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:15.800
And I think that has always been done by uniquely
trained mission specialists.

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:17.200
That's right.

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:21.969
Today's cockpit looks a lot more like what
you will see on a commercial airliner vintage

01:41:21.969 --> 01:41:30.030
mid `80s, the late `80s perhaps, but still
more familiar where you've got glass multicolored

01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:31.030
displays.

01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:39.349
The eight ball still exists in image form
because that is what a lot of the astronauts

01:41:39.349 --> 01:41:41.080
used to learn how to fly these vehicles.

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:48.780
They still fly with respect to it, except
it is a digital representation, but you're

01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.909
still not with the gooey environment.

01:41:51.909 --> 01:41:54.090
You still won't have touch pads or a mouse.

01:41:54.090 --> 01:41:55.829
It is all pushbutton displays.

01:41:55.829 --> 01:42:00.980
And there is a case to be made that touch
displays or touch screens don't work very

01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:04.300
well in a vehicle where you G environments
keep changing.

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:09.760
It is very difficult to get a touch display
that works with a light touch and a heavy

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:15.389
touch when you're in zero G or when you're
pulling several Gs.

01:42:15.389 --> 01:42:20.051
Even if the technology was space qualified,
it is not clear that they would use it, except

01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:23.690
on a vehicle that stays in a constant environment.

01:42:23.690 --> 01:42:28.560
At this point, let me introduce Dr. Hayashi.

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:36.550
Miwa Hayashi is, in fact, at NASA Ames Research
Center now, was here at MIT and worked on

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:40.860
the design of the next generation of the Shuttle
cockpit upgrade.

01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:47.430
In fact, that is what you will be talking
about in ten minutes across the hall in the

01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:48.430
16.400 class.

01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:54.420
It is essentially what would have been done
if Shuttle life had been extended.

01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:58.940
I might add that, although the room is very
crowded, if a few of you would like to sort

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:04.730
of hear where this story would have gone,
you're welcome to come across the hall to

01:43:04.730 --> 01:43:06.400
419 and hear Dr. Hayashi.

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:10.929
And you are also giving a lab meeting lecture
at 1:00.

01:43:10.929 --> 01:43:14.500
Could you tell us that subject?

01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:21.000
That is about the astronaut scanning behavior.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.659
Our team had a model about the astronaut's
scanning behavior in the cockpit, this upgraded

01:43:26.659 --> 01:43:27.659
cockpit.

01:43:27.659 --> 01:43:29.510
Anyone interested in this kind of topic you
are welcome.

01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:30.510
It is from 1:00 PM 33206.

01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:31.510
Thank you.

01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:32.510
Go ahead, Phil.

01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:35.210
Well, at this point, I think I'm open to a
few more questions.

01:43:35.210 --> 01:43:42.330
We have a couple of minutes for further questions,
any topic we've covered or that's related

01:43:42.330 --> 01:43:44.420
that we didn't cover.

01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:45.420
Yeah?

01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:57.989
You talked a lot about the constraints of
the invented computers.

01:43:57.989 --> 01:44:10.970
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Well, we had very large
facilities for that purpose that evolved over

01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:11.970
time.

01:44:11.970 --> 01:44:16.510
The first major facility was the Flight Simulation
Laboratory in Downing, California, which was

01:44:16.510 --> 01:44:17.750
then Rockwell.

01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:24.360
You had a room with a couple cockpits, you
had another room which had the digital interfaces

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:32.659
of the cockpit, and a half a floor with the
analog computers that provided a lot of the

01:44:32.659 --> 01:44:36.480
information generation at a rate that was
not achievable with digital systems.

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:43.909
You had this hybrid system for driving what
were man-in-the-loop simulations.

01:44:43.909 --> 01:44:50.920
And we spent 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
using those labs for several years.

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.380
I would often go out to California and be
on the 5:00 PM to 5:00 AM shift often spanning

01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:55.380
weekends.

01:44:55.380 --> 01:45:02.200
By the way, I was doing that, I think, when
I was still a graduate student, which was

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:04.380
kind of an interesting experience.

01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:10.670
But then NASA built the Shuttle Avionics Integration
Laboratory in Houston which eventually superseded

01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:13.770
the laboratory at Rockwell.

01:45:13.770 --> 01:45:15.560
That became an all-digital system.

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.650
The hybrid systems went away.

01:45:16.650 --> 01:45:22.929
The high capacity computers, they could fit
in one good size room everything they needed,

01:45:22.929 --> 01:45:28.950
and were able to get much more digital displays
for the crews.

01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:32.960
Sometimes what they used to do for the imagery
of the crew in the early days is they would

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:37.199
actually drive a camera across a simulated
scene because you couldn't generate the scene.

01:45:37.199 --> 01:45:42.480
By the time they got the sail facility developed
they were able to do scene generation with

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:48.239
fairly high computers.

01:45:48.239 --> 01:45:49.820
Now everything could almost be tabletop.

01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:54.430
I mean it is just so dramatic as how this
evolved over the years.

01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:58.199
The one thing they had at Rockwell that never
got replaced, though, is they also were able

01:45:58.199 --> 01:46:02.330
to put into the loop actual hydraulic systems.

01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:08.389
When they were doing entry they could turn
on aero surfaces and hydraulics with simulated

01:46:08.389 --> 01:46:09.579
loads.

01:46:09.579 --> 01:46:13.580
And you always knew when they were doing it
because the high pitch scream of the APUs,

01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:16.630
when they were doing it, you could hear two
blocks away.

01:46:16.630 --> 01:46:17.630
OK.

01:46:17.630 --> 01:46:18.630
Last question.

01:46:18.630 --> 01:46:32.530
Sir, I was wondering if you could give kind
of a concept of the cost of developing the

01:46:32.530 --> 01:46:35.571
software either in man hours or in comparison
of what they spent on the hardware.

01:46:35.571 --> 01:46:41.250
Well, the initial development of the system
probably involved the equivalent of 15 or

01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:49.560
20 full time people for a few years.

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:55.350
And this was to develop the algorithms and
support the validation.

01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:59.869
The actual flight software was actually produced
by IBM separately.

01:46:59.869 --> 01:47:04.349
And they had a small team of people that would
take the detail design specifications and

01:47:04.349 --> 01:47:19.270
create 

01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:21.610
the software.

01:47:21.610 --> 01:47:36.990
It is a big effort but a very small part of
the cost of developing a Shuttle.

01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:40.150
I mean you measure the Shuttle in billions.

01:47:40.150 --> 01:47:43.540
You measure the flight software development
in millions.

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:50.949
One thing that I remember when the software
was developed and we were working and validating

01:47:50.949 --> 01:47:56.660
it, IBM wanted every line of code change in
million dollars.

01:47:56.660 --> 01:48:02.159
A million dollars for one line of code change
because they had to verify the whole software.

01:48:02.159 --> 01:48:06.940
That is why you would never, unless there
was a flight critical thing, do that.

01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:14.590
NASA wanted generally, whenever possible,
to aggregate changes for a year or maybe two

01:48:14.590 --> 01:48:15.599
years sometimes.

01:48:15.599 --> 01:48:20.070
And then put them in there just for that reason
because there was this huge cost of revalidating.

01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:22.360
And that was the IBM cost.

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:25.640
It would be a cost to bringing us back in
to certify that, too.

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.160
Well, it worked and you should be very proud
of it, you and your colleagues.

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.160
Thank you very much, Phil.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:31.160
Thank you.

01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:31.161
