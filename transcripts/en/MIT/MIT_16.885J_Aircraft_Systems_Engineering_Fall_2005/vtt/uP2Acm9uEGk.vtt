00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.640
In that case, I will move on to introduce
Colonel Gordon Fullerton who got is bachelor's

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.280
and master's degree from Caltech in mechanical
engineering, did ROTC and went on to the Air

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.869
Force where, well, I guess he has flown, in
the course of his career about 135 different

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.710
types of airplanes.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.420
16,000 flying hours.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.420
He flew F86 interceptors, B47 Bombers before
going to Air Force test pilot school in the

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:54.550
mid `60s.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.550
In '66, he was chosen by the Air Force for
the Manned Orbiting Laboratory which was going

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.490
to be the Air Force's Space Station.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.490
That program was cancelled in 1969 and the
MOL, well, some of the MOL astronauts came

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.200
over to NASA and became NASA astronauts.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.049
That was in the heyday of Apollo.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.799
And Gordon was support crew on the last four
Apollo missions.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.799
Then went on to be the test pilot on three
of the first five approach and landing tests.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.060
If you remember, that is when the Shuttle
Enterprise, which was not designed for orbital

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.439
flight but was designed to test basically
the last 50,000 feet down to the ground, was

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.039
dropped from the 747.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.039
Went onto pilot the third Shuttle flight,
which was one of the orbital flight tests.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.549
That was the flight which landed in New Mexico.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:11.549
And then commanded STS-51F which was the first
flight of the instrument pointing system.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.709
That was also the flight, I am trying to think,
where you lost the engine, which we talked

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.650
about.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.349
That was the one flight where we had an engine
shutdown.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.980
And we went over that in some detail.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.440
I think they should hear about it from what
it seemed like inside the cockpit, now that

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.780
they have heard kind of the technical details.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.780
In any case, after leaving the Astronautic
Office, Gordon has moved into pilot's heaven

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.879
which is Edwards Air Force Base, the Dryden
Test Flight Center where he basically spends

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.879
all his time.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.989
Well, not all of his time because there is
management stuff as well.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.549
Unfortunately, that is the price you pay.

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.180
But basically he gets to fly airplanes for
a living.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.870
And lots of different kinds, including the
career aircraft and the B52 which launches

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.870
various test aircraft and a whole bunch of
other airplanes.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.120
If you remember in the whole systems engineering
approach to things, we talk about the conceived

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.620
design, manufacture, test and operation.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.090
So this is basically the final lecture and
this is the test and operation of the Space

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.450
Shuttle from a pilot's point of view.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.470
So, with that, I will give it to you, Gordon.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.980
Thanks.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.980
I was sitting at your place back in 1958 when
I was a grad student at Caltech for a year

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.129
before heading off to the Air Force.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.450
Wow, almost 50 years ago.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.480
But the real blessing of my life is to be
able to do what I love to do for as long as

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.350
I have done it, beyond all reason.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.220
Anyway, I hope to share some of that with
you this morning.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.970
This is my first time through this pitch.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.970
Feel free to holler out any questions as we
go and we will stumble through it together.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.250
I planned to talk about three different phases
of the orbiter test program.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.790
The first were called ALT, the Approach and
Landing Test, that consisted of really 13

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:57.030
flights, five captive inert flights where
the enterprise was flown on top of the 747

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.409
but nobody in the cockpit.

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.610
The controls were locked.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.370
That was to clear the envelope for the kind
of unlikely looking combination of a 747 with

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.290
an orbiter on top.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.820
And then there were three "captive active"
flights where we were manned up in the orbiter

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.570
with the systems running, the electronics,
the hydraulics were active.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.500
The controls were free to move a little bit,
not full throw.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.730
And we also determined how high the combination
could get.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:35.730
Because altitude was not 50,000 feet, it was
more like 28,000 feet max even with the 747

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.330
engines over boosted.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.070
Followed by three "free flights" were we actually
pushed the button, munched off the top and

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.600
glided to a landing.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.790
The orbital flight test, prior to the Shuttle
Program, OFT consisted of four flights.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.660
STS 1 through 4 of varying durations.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.660
STS-1 was planned for just a couple days to
get up and get down and have a look at how

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.300
things looked after it flew.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.590
STS-2 was supposed to be five days.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.050
They had a fuel cell problem that cut their
flight short, unfortunately for the crew.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.540
Then I was on STS-3.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.590
We were scheduled for seven days.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:32.040
And, because of a raging dust storm at the
planned landing site, we got an extra day.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.659
A real blessing.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:38.560
With no tests to do, we had a free day on
orbit.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.880
And ended up with eight days.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.850
STS-4 planned and flew seven days, landing
on the fourth of July with President Reagan

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.550
out there to watch.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.740
And then we got into operational flights of
which there had been a lot.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.690
Something over a hundred.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:05.690
The last flight to fly, the return to flight
was STS-114, but the number system went through

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.950
a couple of phases.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.860
There have not been 114 flights.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.440
I don't know how many it has been, but there
had been a bunch.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.440
I will talk about three, well, more than three
flights, but the ALT flights.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:31.580
If you have to have a crew patch, that is
a major hurdle that you have to overcome.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.140
When you are assigned to a crew, get the patch
designed and then get it approved by upper

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.600
management.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:49.600
Part of the OFT, STS-3 in 1982 and finally
then an operational flight 51F in 1985.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:03.610
Prior to any of these flights, I worked into
a dream job for really systems engineering,

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.800
I guess, and for a pilot.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.310
I had been to test pilot school.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:16.310
I was intrigued with all the airplanes I flew
with a cockpit design and was very aware of

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.450
the flaws of cockpit design.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:26.450
It seems like sometimes engineers lie awake
nights trying to make it hard to operate subsystems.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:35.770
I got in at the beginning of the orbiter crew
interface and became, before it was over,

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:46.700
sort of the Czar who was responsible to sign
off all the drawings, lots of reviews.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:53.700
It was a great responsibility because I was
immediately and early into subsystem design

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.420
because you have to know what the subsystem
does to make any intelligent choice of what

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.220
the controls and displays should be.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:11.220
This is a view of, not the Enterprise, but
probably, I don't know whether it is a simulator

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:20.580
or the real airplane, they look alike, but
one of the orbital capable shuttles.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:26.960
This is like the little old ladies always
say when you're out on display for Armed Forces

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.050
Day and look at all the things, how do you
remember what they all do?

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:38.450
Well, that really is a challenge to make things
straightforward.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:45.450
And I became painfully aware, especially later
on when we had a lot of experiments coming

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:54.650
in, that engineers in their little ivory tower
building a system in the lab are so totally,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:02.750
personally familiar with how their stuff works
that it doesn't bother them that the switches

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.180
are unlabeled or labeled illogically.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:10.990
And they bring that all in and want to put
it in the orbiter.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:17.990
And when the crew says wait a minute, I have
to remember, before I turn on switch A, switch

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:24.770
C and D have got to be turned on in this order
or the whole thing will blow up?

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.630
And they say oh, yeah, that is the way it
is.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.500
And they know it so well personally.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.170
And, yet, when you are overwhelmed with a
whole lot of experiments, I am sure you ran

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:41.170
into it on your flight, that all the stuff
that is just totally familiar to the guy that

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.720
invented it becomes a challenge when you are
faced with a whole lot of them and a limited

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.520
amount of time to learn it.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:57.520
And so, standardization of what the scheme,
especially in the software.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:05.440
While there are a lot of gadgets, in fact,
if you count all the switches, gauges, circuit

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:14.440
breakers, upstairs, downstairs and the mid
deck, there are about 2,100 total in the orbiter

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.800
cockpit.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:23.660
But the real challenge is what shows up on
the screens here.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:30.000
So the software was a bigger thing in making
them all play together.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.720
Here is a higher view in the overhead panel
above your head.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.430
And the forward cockpit has a lot of other
switches.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:44.430
An example of what I am talking about, this
array of switches right here controls the

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:54.660
reaction control system valving and then the
orbital maneuvering system.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:03.010
Back in Apollo, which I worked on when I first
came to Johnson Space Center, I learned, while

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:12.070
lying many hours in the Apollo crew simulator,
that that had the worst cockpit every designed

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.440
by man.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:23.440
As an example, it had a helium pressurization
system to push the propellants for the reaction

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:31.180
control jets out of the tanks and then the
valves that went to the various arrays of

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.900
thrusters all around the command module.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.370
And one would think logically, if you have
something to turn on the helium, you label

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.230
that helium on/off.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:49.230
And then the manifold, the next branch in
the Christmas tree manifold would be system

00:12:51.029 --> 00:12:53.550
A versus system B or something like that.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.860
And, in fact, it had names like that.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:02.860
But they put the switches in a long room and
labeled them A through H, right there on the

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.160
panel.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.670
No clue as to what you were throwing, so every
move you made in the cockpit, some of these

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:17.670
things were critical, required you to either
be a metal giant or open a checklist and say

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:26.630
to pressurize system B, I have got to throw
B on and then A next and then H last or something

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.170
like that.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.470
Obviously, unacceptable.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:41.470
It became my career and mania to try to improve
that.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:48.910
The first orbiter simulator built was called
the OAS, Orbiter Aeroflight Simulator.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:56.520
It was on a moving based platform like the
standard airline simulators you see today.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.260
This is Fred Hayes and I sitting in the cockpit.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.570
This one was built originally to be the Enterprise.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:12.570
And the Enterprise was OV-101 in the scheme
of things, a numbering of orbiters as they

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.900
were built.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:23.230
101 had only the systems it needed to fly
the approach and landing test.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:28.350
The plan was to retrofit it later to make
it into orbit capable.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:35.350
But before the ALT program it had just what
you needed and only that to fly in the atmosphere

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.740
very short flights.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:46.740
But this is our first chance to look at what
we had and what we were getting into as far

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.350
as pilot concerns.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.990
Now, I guess you have had all the subsystems,
right?

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:58.690
You were all completely briefed and experts
on subsystems by the people that had preceded

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.360
me here in the course.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:07.150
I will give you, though, a quick review here,
the avionics system.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:14.150
The Shuttle is build with inside the outer
mole line as the pressure vessel that is roughly

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:22.279
back to the forward bulkhead of the payload
bay and is imbedded inside basically aluminum

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:30.600
structure with a thermal protection system
applied to the outside.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:37.600
And most of the avionics are in racks right
up here, right in there with you in the cockpit

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.850
on the middeck.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:46.850
The stowage lockers are aft of the racks full
of black boxes and lots of wires.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.690
And the other place there were avionics is
back here just after the aft bulkhead of the

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:54.460
payload bay.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:16:01.460
And there are some areas where they put items
like rate gyros and accelerometers.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:08.570
A lot way back.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:17.430
From a systems engineering standpoint, Fred
Hayes and I were out at Palmdale where they

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.860
built all the orbiters.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:27.860
It seems like the testing always happens after
2:00 AM, tests would run around the clock.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:39.220
And we were out there way after midnight in
the cockpit participating in the first time

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.850
they were going to close the loop between
the rate gyros and the flight control system

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:51.040
which is contained back up here in the nose
and the general purpose computers.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:58.040
The whole orbiter was suspended on some big
airfield bag so it had compliance to move.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:05.089
And the hydraulic system was on powered by
a facility hydraulic source.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:12.089
The elevons were powered and the rudder speed
brake was powered and the process let us down

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:20.660
for the very first time that we were going
to close the loop between the software up

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:27.199
here and the rate gyros particularly and accelerometers
mounted in the back.

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:29.220
And it was a milestone.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:36.220
And we had people stationed around the back
to see if anything spit out hydraulic fluid

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.240
or whatever.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.290
Anyway, we went up to the glass shield and
pushed the button to go into CSS, Control

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:51.270
Stick Steering, which hooked the stick up
now to the flight control system.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:55.540
I will never forget.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:01.120
We pushed the button and a rumble started.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.360
And the rumble built very rapidly to a violent
rumble.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.620
I mean we were being bounced around the cockpit.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:14.620
This is 150,000 pounds of airplane dancing
on these rubber bags.

00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:19.640
And it didn't take us long to say this doesn't
feel good.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:25.440
We pulled the button that downloads back to
direct control so there is no feedback.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.809
And the upshot of it was that these rate gyros
are mounted on this flexible bulkhead.

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:35.890
And that had been taken into account properly.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:41.380
And so there was a structural resonance that
was just diversion.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:48.380
In spite of all the Grounds tests down at
Downy and the Iron Bird mockups and everything,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:56.200
when we put it in the real airplane it tried
to jump off the supports.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:05.190
And Fred and I were in the cockpit, our eyes
were big, and we called the control room which

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.370
were people back in an adjacent room.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:14.600
It seems like most spacecraft tests, traditionally,
are done with engineers all locked up in windowless

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.850
room, no view of the real hardware.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:23.390
Down at the Cape they are miles away when
the spacecraft is either out on the pad or

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.030
in the main checkout building.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:33.030
And so they said no, the procedure says this
is OK and we want you to re-engage.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.370
We tried one more time.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:42.630
And this time the guy stationed in back that
were watching said this doesn't look good.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:46.030
They started hollering on the loop so we pitched
it off.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:50.670
And we went into a raging argument.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.400
We need to complete this test, the engineers
were saying.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.420
And we were saying we don't want to break
something.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:01.080
And they got people out of bed down in California,
controls engineers.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:07.530
And so, it was a memorable night.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:14.530
The resolution was finally a redesign of the
mounting area back there and reanalysis of

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.700
the vibrational modes of the aft bulkhead
sorted all out.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:28.700
Here is what we had for a crew interface.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:38.540
You saw in the earlier picture, upfront three
CRTs, monochrome, green, it was either green

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:45.530
or nothing on the screen, and we had two keyboards,
three CRTs.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.710
There was always this little concern, when
you are punching on a keyboard, you want to

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:55.220
be sure it is selected to the CRT you think
you are doing something on.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.799
Another marginal design, but that is what
we ended up with.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:02.650
You notice we have a hexadecimal keyboard
here.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:09.650
We have some strange keys called item and
electric and ops which had to do with this

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.790
truly unique way you cause things to happen
through software.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.380
And lots of things were critical through software.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.530
And then this rather dim green screen.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:30.710
This was way before the days, I guess, Bill
Gates was still here at MIT or maybe even

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.270
hadn't registered yet.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.970
I don't know.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.630
It was way before Windows 1.0.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:43.630
And so it seems almost comical now when you
compare it to even modern airliner crew interface

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:51.049
with glass cockpits, but we were breaking
new ground here.

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:58.049
And it, even at the time, seemed antiquated
because that is all they were willing to embrace

00:21:58.059 --> 00:22:03.290
in the way of computer control and design.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.620
And it was unique.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:11.620
And it causes lots of headaches and delays.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:20.250
The big thing about the orbiter with its data
process system, the decision was made that

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:29.190
everything is going to be done with these
all powerful general purpose computers in

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.120
which there were five in an array that worked
together.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:40.120
Flight control, system management, navigation,
inertial subsystem control of everything.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:48.940
And so, the result was the software loads,
as they were built, had lots of flaws when

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.490
they came down, yet we couldn't fix them.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:23:01.490
We had cases as dumb as a display that showed
the Freon loop A pump on.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.600
And, when it got through the entire software
belt, it was backwards.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.650
It would say off when it was really on.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.250
Seems like a simple fix, right?

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:20.120
Go back to the programmer and rewrite the
code.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.730
But we couldn't do it.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.850
We had to live with it for a long period of
time through training until another whole

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.640
load was built.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:34.640
Because the load that would fix this dumb
little bi-level mistake was also the one that

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.210
steered you during ascent.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:42.679
So everything was frozen and there was great
fear of changing anything that would ricochet

00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:45.179
through to something truly critical.

00:23:45.179 --> 00:23:52.179
And so, even when we got to STS-3, we flew
with a book about this thick of program notes

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:04.070
that told you, line after line, what was wrong,
what was backwards, what was a trap.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:12.540
And really a big challenge to the crew to
embrace and live with because there just wasn't

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:19.540
time in the program to build another load,
check it out through all the different labs

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:26.730
that had to certify it.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.860
That is load for modular software where you
can change something here and be assured you

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:39.860
are not bollixing up something else in the
same machine.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.049
OMS, RCS.

00:24:41.049 --> 00:24:43.090
These are the two pods.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:50.010
On either side of the vertical tail are a
couple big OMS, propellant tanks, oxidizer

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.860
and fuel hypergolic.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.419
We didn't need any ignition system.

00:24:53.419 --> 00:24:59.890
As soon as these came together in a thruster
you had thrust.

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.140
And there were, I think, 44 main thrusters.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.410
Here are four yaw jets firing out to the side.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.120
S&amp;B pitch jets.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.590
The same thing repeated on the other side.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.910
And up in the nose are the forward RCS.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.610
They had jets that fired up and out to the
side and down.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:26.919
And I mentioned the controls in the cockpit,
which we did.

00:25:26.919 --> 00:25:33.919
One of my great successes was getting the
orbiter panels to be arranged in a plumbing

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.650
layout so that you could see what you were
pressurizing when you turned on the helium

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.190
for a given let and that sort of thing.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:51.190
Helium tanks are what pressurized in a really
cleaver system of OH control.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:26:00.340
That is when you are in zero G and you have
propellant floating around randomly.

00:26:00.679 --> 00:26:04.720
And you turn on the helium to push it toward
the outlet.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.510
If the outlet is uncovered, the helium is
going to squirt right out.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:17.059
But they had an elaborate system of surface
tension kind of baffles that kept and trapped

00:26:17.059 --> 00:26:24.059
fuel near the outlet of the tank so that when
the thrust came on and all the propellant

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:31.730
went down where it should, it sort of recharged
this chamber at the bottom of the tanks to

00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:38.669
keep it flowing smoothly and not lose all
the pressurization.

00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:45.669
I remember my first impression of what reaction
control jets would be like was based on science

00:26:53.660 --> 00:27:00.169
fiction movies where you would see the spacecraft
out there and there were little squirts of

00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:02.640
jets that nudge you around.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:09.640
And we went out to the Ground test facility
at White Sands on a fieldtrip out there where

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:16.070
they actually had the forward RCS setup, and
they were going to do real firings of the

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.049
main jets out there.

00:27:19.049 --> 00:27:24.250
And we were probably a couple hundred feet
away from the test setup.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:31.250
We were out there waiting for this sequence
of jet firing to start on a test.

00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:40.309
And the first firing of one of the main jets,
which are right up around 900 pounds thrust,

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:42.860
was just this short pulse.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.470
And everybody went about three feet off the
ground.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.770
I mean it was like you fired a howitzer.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.440
It was just stunning.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:56.000
Wham, wham, and it just blew you away.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.380
And the realization of we are going to be
in the cockpit here, and these things are

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.750
firing right outside the windshield.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:04.520
They did.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.490
In space, the ignition transient ricochets
through the structure.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.580
You can hear this kind of bombing effect.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:18.190
But once they are on, if it is a long duration
firing, it is silent.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:25.190
And the same way visually, you can see a flash
when the fuel is led a little bit in front

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.429
of the oxidizer to make sure you don't overheat
something.

00:28:28.429 --> 00:28:31.270
And so, there is incomplete combustion at
the ignition.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.789
You can see a flash go out there.

00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:38.880
But what is on during an OMS burn, for instance,
when these OMS engines are firing and you

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.929
are looking back at the aft, you see the flash
and they are on and they are pushing and you

00:28:42.929 --> 00:28:43.470
can feel it.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:48.600
But otherwise invisible is the way I remember.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.850
On the other hand, there are vernier jets,
little guys.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.750
I don't know if they are shown here.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:29:00.750
But there are little 25 pound thrusters or
something used 98% of the time on orbit.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:05.179
You really are doing that kind of thing with
the vernier jets.

00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:09.179
And you cannot hear those or see anything
when they are going off.

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:16.179
In fact, we got everybody quiet and kind of
held onto the walls just trying to see if

00:29:16.179 --> 00:29:22.880
we could barely detect when a vernier jet
fired physically in a cockpit.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:29.570
Interesting.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:36.570
The orbiter is one giant heat transfer machine.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:43.660
Lots of calories of heat energy pumped around
from one end to the other.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:52.470
And so, there are water loops within the cabin
that transfer the heat to Freon loops.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:30:00.190
The fluid is pumped through the radiators
to reject heat.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:07.190
In spite of all these heat rejection systems
then there are heaters everywhere, whole banks

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.150
of heaters to keep stuff from freezing.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:17.150
Then for the landing and takeoff phases, there
are flash evaporators that flash water and/or

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.299
ammonia.

00:30:23.299 --> 00:30:30.299
When you are down in the atmosphere you use
ammonia to cool the loops.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:35.580
And, of course, the payload bay doors are
closed.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:42.580
And it turns out STS-3, a major test of it
was test all these loops and how the structure

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:51.710
responded to long durations of given attitudes
with the sun shining on one side and cold

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:58.710
space on the other side and how the structure
would distort or hopefully not distort and

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.740
how all that system would work.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:07.740
As it turned out, if you like lots of redundancy,
this is probably the weak point I thought

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:12.049
in the whole orbiter design, we've got three
engines.

00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:16.140
We proved that you can get there with only
two.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:22.860
But the Freon loops, there were two redundant
through the radiators.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:28.320
And if one Freon loop pumped quick you are
in a severe emergency.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.549
That means stop everything and power down
severely.

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:38.549
Turn off all the computers except one, get
in a proper attitude and go into a panic reconfiguration

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.620
to come back and land.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.850
Originally, the design had three Freon loops.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:56.370
It could use one and go on with no concern.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:32:03.370
But, as it turned out, the heat loads were
so high and the weight criticality determined

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:13.820
that all we had electrical power to run were
two loops.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:19.590
And so we ended up with a single Freon loop
which fortunately, as far as I know, never

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.809
failed.

00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:27.809
But if it had it would have been a crash deorbit
landing under severely powered down conditions.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:37.030
While it is kind of mundane and people don't
think about it as a primary system, the thermal

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.049
control really was critical.

00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:49.049
Payload bay doors, this is a busy chart but
indicates these are really complicated.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:57.230
60 feet long and something like 120 little
motor driven latches to latch them closed.

00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:10.289
And you don't just go chunk close like the
bomb bay on a B52 and it is closed.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:17.200
To close the payload bay doors you get them
close and then the latches along the bulked,

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.549
all in a zipper fashion, have to sequentially
close.

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:27.549
And then you go down the center section to
latch the two left and right doors together.

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:33.179
All software controlled.

00:33:33.179 --> 00:33:39.950
And there was a lot of concern that we address
on STS-3 particularly about whether this is

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.210
all going to work.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:47.820
If you have been floating around with these
pointed to dark space, would they distort

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.830
to where the zipper scheme would work?

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:57.830
We worried about it enough that part of our
emergency training, contingency training,

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:07.500
a lot of time was spent underwater in the
neutral buoyancy tank looking at a system

00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:14.799
going out EVA with a series of come-alongs,
you know, the kind of things you use to pull

00:34:18.129 --> 00:34:25.129
the motor out a car, that kind of thing, that
we could go down there and hookup and latch

00:34:28.518 --> 00:34:35.518
the doors shut to actually manually get them
shut and then latch them shut with these.

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:39.190
Fortunately, that has never been used.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:46.190
And this complex system has worked good, but
it was scary the first time we flew it on

00:34:46.839 --> 00:34:47.728
STS-3.

00:34:47.728 --> 00:34:50.199
That was a big concern.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:57.200
What I have got here is hydraulic system.

00:34:58.819 --> 00:35:05.819
Hydraulics are hydrazine powered turbines
that run at some ridiculous RPM, like 200,000

00:35:08.269 --> 00:35:12.950
RPM to drive hydraulic pumps back here in
the backend.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:19.890
And then they are crucial during launch because
they have got to hold the elevons in position.

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:26.890
But they also have to provide the muscle to
gimbal the main engines and keep you steering

00:35:28.019 --> 00:35:31.400
straight during launch.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:37.160
During entry they are what you use to fly
when you get into a dynamic pressure situation.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.969
Control the rudder speed brake and the body
flap.

00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:47.969
The body flap is a big surface that sticks
out underneath the main engine bells and is

00:35:48.369 --> 00:35:50.859
a slow moving trem device.

00:35:50.859 --> 00:35:52.900
The body flat is always moved.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:59.869
You go through this mach 25 to mach zero envelope.

00:35:59.869 --> 00:36:06.869
And the trem conditions necessary with these
big elevons varies a lot.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:14.150
So, to desaturate the elevons and keep them
basically faired with the wing, the body flap

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.460
is your trim device.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:21.839
And it is like this row of tables long and
this wide.

00:36:21.839 --> 00:36:25.440
I remember asking to see the motor.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:31.099
It is driven by a whole lot of mechanical
advantage by a hydraulic motor.

00:36:31.099 --> 00:36:34.119
A guy took me around.

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:36.869
I couldn't find the actuator for the body
flap.

00:36:36.869 --> 00:36:37.349
He showed me.

00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:41.119
The motor was this big around and this long,
a little hydraulic motor.

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:45.130
So you can do anything with mechanical advantage.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.009
But it didn't have to move very fast.

00:36:47.009 --> 00:36:54.009
Finally, on the system pictures here, the
RMS.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.519
Hopefully, you have heard about this.

00:36:56.519 --> 00:36:59.450
It was built by Spara up in Canada.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:03.440
The Canadians main contribution to the orbiter
program.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.380
A pretty magical device.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:12.380
It can go on either side, but for our flights
mounted on the left-hand side or the right

00:37:13.859 --> 00:37:16.640
if you're looking out the back windows at
it.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:23.640
And it had joints logically called the shoulder
joint, elbow, wrist joint.

00:37:25.799 --> 00:37:29.969
All electric motor driven.

00:37:29.969 --> 00:37:32.279
But the interesting thing was a control.

00:37:32.279 --> 00:37:39.249
You had hand controllers mounted in the aft
part on the right console in the back where

00:37:39.249 --> 00:37:40.160
you looked out.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:46.900
And you could work in the mode where you actually
drive in the end left, right, up, down, in,

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.059
out without regard to whatever joint was done.

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:52.390
That is all resolved by the software.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.229
And worked well.

00:37:54.229 --> 00:38:00.960
The end effector was a cleaver kind of a hallow
cylindrical device.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.960
It would rotate inside and three cables that
would be curved around the periphery inside

00:38:12.259 --> 00:38:15.950
this cavity when activated.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:22.369
I put this over a post on whatever you wanted
to grab onto with a knob on the end.

00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:27.420
You go over the post and then rotate the inner
barrel and the cables would wrap up and grab

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.930
onto the post.

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:31.880
And then they would retract in to rigidize.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.549
And that was the grabber on the RMS.

00:38:34.549 --> 00:38:38.079
And we flew this on STS-3.

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:39.109
I will show you later.

00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:45.729
Anyway, that is the subsystem review.

00:38:45.729 --> 00:38:51.339
Let me show you how things went during approach
and landing tests.

00:38:51.339 --> 00:38:52.150
Now, let's see.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:59.150
I have never figured out how to imbed video
and PowerPoint so I am going to be doing it

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:01.660
manually.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:08.660
Any questions while we are waiting on this
to come up?

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:28.180
Well, this is the desert around where I live
and a Gila monster and a Joshua tree to set

00:39:28.489 --> 00:39:29.049
the scene.

00:39:29.049 --> 00:39:33.999
And here you have OV-101.

00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:38.789
The numbering system, as it turned out, is
kind of interesting.

00:39:38.789 --> 00:39:42.589
They built OV-99 as the structural test article.

00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:49.589
It was strictly built to be in the lab and
do all the structural testing on it.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:56.710
101 then was the first orbiter build, the
Enterprise, being hauled from Palmdale across

00:39:58.839 --> 00:40:03.739
the backgrounds and the desert roads to get
over to Edwards in these scenes.

00:40:03.739 --> 00:40:06.910
And 101 was the ALT airplane.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:10.910
You can see kind of phony looking RCS.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:17.910
It has, as I mentioned, only the systems that
you needed to fly atmospheric flight.

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:23.440
This was a big thing getting it across the
country.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.640
It had a Pitot boom on it.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.420
It has just simulated thermal protection.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:37.009
Styrofoam painted to look kind of like they
thought the space vehicles would look but

00:40:37.009 --> 00:40:38.029
wasn't real.

00:40:38.029 --> 00:40:45.029
It was put in the mating and docking device
which is at NASA Dryden where I work now.

00:40:46.089 --> 00:40:46.880
Hoisted it up.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:53.880
And then the 747 and 905, the first Shuttle
carrier aircraft, was pulled under and they

00:40:54.479 --> 00:40:55.119
mated them up.

00:40:55.119 --> 00:41:00.709
I remember flying out to Edwards and seeing
this unlikely combination.

00:41:00.709 --> 00:41:06.809
And the first time I saw the two together,
I thought they cannot be serious.

00:41:06.809 --> 00:41:10.239
But then I realized I was going to be in it.

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:14.559
There were 13 total flights.

00:41:14.559 --> 00:41:17.469
This is a taxi test.

00:41:17.469 --> 00:41:21.450
When you have an aerodynamic test you can
sneak up, and so you do baby steps.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:26.650
This was just a high speed down the runway
to see if it would rotate and if anything

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.489
would shake alarmingly.

00:41:29.489 --> 00:41:34.150
And that will look good.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:39.489
Preparations proceeded for the first of the
captive inert flights.

00:41:39.489 --> 00:41:45.410
This is Fitz Fulton and Tom McMurtry, both
real good friends, and they were the crew

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.269
on the 747 for this first milestone flight.

00:41:49.269 --> 00:41:55.940
A lot of people were out watching and wondering
if it would fly, which it did very well.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.609
And off it went.

00:41:57.609 --> 00:42:03.109
You notice a longer front attached structure
there.

00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:10.109
And the orbiter is purposely on there at angle
of attack to produce lift.

00:42:12.019 --> 00:42:19.019
I flew a 747 for ferry flights now and to
haul orbiters back to the Cape when they land

00:42:19.989 --> 00:42:22.559
at Edwards, as the last one did.

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:29.559
And the nose, that front bipod is much shorter
so that the orbiter is down for less drag

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.119
for the combination.

00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:40.119
But this setup here was so that we could get
the orbiter off the top and not the tail.

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:44.950
There is a rumble.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.829
The crew noticed a shaking.

00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:49.400
It is still the case when you fly.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:55.640
These vertical fins were added onto the horizontal
stabs to increase directional stability because

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.400
the orbiter blanks a lot of flow over the
normal vertical.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.749
In fact, they overdid it a little bit.

00:43:01.749 --> 00:43:08.749
There is too much structural stability which
has resulted in the weird situation.

00:43:08.969 --> 00:43:15.969
Your cross-wind limit, when you have an orbiter
onboard, is greater than when it is not because

00:43:19.099 --> 00:43:21.609
you have so much directional stability and
a crosswind.

00:43:21.609 --> 00:43:26.509
There is a strong weathervaning and you run
out of normal rudder without an orbiter, so

00:43:26.509 --> 00:43:31.630
you are good only to 15 knots crosswind with
the orbiter on.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.729
The limit is 20 knots.

00:43:33.729 --> 00:43:35.109
And it is a good limit.

00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:37.569
I have flown them both ways in cross winds.

00:43:37.569 --> 00:43:42.619
And, indeed, at those numbers you run out
of rudder as you land and are rolling out.

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:49.339
The strong weathervane intensity is leading
you out this side of the runway.

00:43:49.339 --> 00:43:50.440
Anyway, that looked good.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:55.549
And so I came back and we had a big post-flight
party.

00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:56.979
ALT was great for parties.

00:43:56.979 --> 00:43:59.099
We had 13 post-flight parties.

00:43:59.099 --> 00:44:06.099
And, at the same time we were doing the ALT
flights, we are developing a Shuttle training

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.259
aircraft.

00:44:12.259 --> 00:44:19.259
This is Gulfstream II with big side force
generators on the belly.

00:44:19.279 --> 00:44:21.640
That is an airborne simulator.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.200
The left seat is set up with orbiter instruments.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:32.200
And the right seat was the standard gulfstream
cockpit that had flown thousands of dives

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:41.160
at the ground in the SGA preparing for the
whole idea of first time for sure unpowered

00:44:47.549 --> 00:44:49.999
landing that you have to do right the first
time.

00:44:49.999 --> 00:44:56.999
And back in the simulator here for lots more
runs.

00:44:58.979 --> 00:45:05.150
And it was a great time because everything
was brand new, very interesting.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.299
This is a camera and an actual model.

00:45:08.299 --> 00:45:13.630
This is before the days of computer generated
video.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:16.630
It flew the little camera down to landing.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:19.869
And we learned a lot about [NOISE OBSCURES]

00:45:19.869 --> 00:45:21.269
characteristics.

00:45:21.269 --> 00:45:28.269
One that we really wondered about, when you
made a lateral input to roll the orbiter in

00:45:30.609 --> 00:45:32.969
the simulator, it would bang you.

00:45:32.969 --> 00:45:37.089
It was this lateral lurch, we call it.

00:45:37.089 --> 00:45:38.579
It would jolt you sideways.

00:45:38.579 --> 00:45:40.420
And we thought this cannot be real.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.130
It doesn't make any sense.

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.569
No airplane we ever flew does that.

00:45:43.569 --> 00:45:45.430
We squawked it.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:51.049
They came back and said the equations are
all worked out so we live with it and thought

00:45:51.049 --> 00:45:57.130
it was just an artifact that snuck in there
and didn't worry about it.

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:04.130
Now, the captive-active started where we actually
got in and cranked things up.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:14.369
On the second flight, I was chasing in a T-38.

00:46:14.369 --> 00:46:15.890
And Engle and Truly were in the cockpit.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:22.539
And I noticed a shiny look on the side.

00:46:22.539 --> 00:46:28.619
That big X on the CRT is what happens when
the computer that is driving that CRT quits.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:34.420
That is sort of the panic symbol when the
X shows up.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:38.910
Anyway, I noticed a leak, as it turned out
to be.

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:40.930
We had that severe hydrazine leak.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.920
Hydrazine is bad stuff to have leaking.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:49.969
And one of the APU supply tanks let go.

00:46:49.969 --> 00:46:53.920
Plus, they had an over temp.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:59.819
We found things that were wrong that made
these captive flights worthwhile.

00:46:59.819 --> 00:47:06.819
If we had just gone and launched off on the
first one, it could have been more exciting

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:10.089
than it needed to be.

00:47:10.089 --> 00:47:11.479
We had five of those.

00:47:11.479 --> 00:47:16.459
And Fred Hayes and I got the odd numbered
flights, one, three and five.

00:47:16.459 --> 00:47:17.869
Five more post-flight parties.

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:24.469
And then we decided we were ready to go.

00:47:24.469 --> 00:47:27.130
Well, this is the last of the captive-active
flights.

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:34.130
The scheme by which we plan to get off of
here and not take off the tail of the 747

00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:37.130
was that the 747 would go as high as it could
go.

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:43.069
It could get up to around 27,000 feet with
engines over-boosted.

00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:47.829
Pratt &amp; Whitney said you could go this long
with extra power.

00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:52.900
And then nose over and speed up to 240 knots.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.289
It was climbing maybe to 190, 200 knots.

00:47:57.289 --> 00:48:00.959
With a little downhill push, we got up to
240.

00:48:00.959 --> 00:48:07.959
At 240 the SEA pilots would go to idle power
and air brakes up to put drag on the carrier.

00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:18.089
At that condition of 240 knots and the angle
of attack of the orbiter, it was actually

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:22.089
lifting more than its own weight.

00:48:22.089 --> 00:48:27.779
So the result is we really dropped the carrier,
as it turns out.

00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:31.199
There is three-quarters of a G difference
between the two.

00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:33.959
And so, we got a lot of use.

00:48:33.959 --> 00:48:39.109
For some reason Fred's left shoulder, he is
in the left seat and he mashed the separation

00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:45.479
button after Fitz on the carrier aircraft
hollered "carrier ready," that is they were

00:48:45.479 --> 00:48:52.479
back at idle with the speed brakes up, pushed
the go button and bang, all seven explosive

00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:58.509
bolts would blow.

00:48:58.509 --> 00:49:00.259
Control Room was in Houston, strange enough.

00:49:00.259 --> 00:49:07.259
We are talking to people back in the old JSC
Control Room when we are out at Edwards flying

00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:08.609
these flights.

00:49:08.609 --> 00:49:09.599
It was just like they were there.

00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:13.549
And we were coming up on a condition.

00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:17.599
And this was in August of '77.

00:49:17.599 --> 00:49:20.209
All the ALT flights happened in 1977.

00:49:20.209 --> 00:49:26.239
You notice there is a tail cone on here.

00:49:26.239 --> 00:49:29.170
The tail cone was flown on the first three
flights.

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:32.949
That makes a big difference.

00:49:32.949 --> 00:49:39.749
It smoothes the flow s that the buffet on
the tail, the carrier aircraft was less, and

00:49:39.749 --> 00:49:43.079
it just about doubled the L/D of the orbiter.

00:49:43.079 --> 00:49:50.079
We are going to arm.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:58.440
And we had two chases, one off to the right
and in trail separation.

00:50:04.999 --> 00:50:11.999
Just like the engineer said and the load cells
that we had on there, testing exactly which

00:50:12.839 --> 00:50:16.650
was the thing tugging before we did it, said
we could do straight up.

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:18.209
This is slow motion.

00:50:18.209 --> 00:50:19.180
Nothing is leaking.

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:26.180
The vortex is out at the wing tips causing
condensation and away we went.

00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:32.910
And simultaneous with this bang that shutters
through the airplane with all these explosive

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:39.319
volts a big X on the CRT in front of me.

00:50:39.319 --> 00:50:44.410
We had cue cards and we had practiced this.

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:51.410
My job, while Fred flew, he actually got a
vertical clear from this chase pilot and then

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:58.650
rolled into a bank and a lateral clear from
the guy that was chasing from behind and knew

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:00.199
that it was OK to push over.

00:51:00.199 --> 00:51:04.259
Because we are only now at 200 knots and we
wanted to get to 300.

00:51:04.259 --> 00:51:09.859
And it took a considerable pushover to get
up to speed.

00:51:09.859 --> 00:51:14.779
Meanwhile, I am pulling circuit breakers on
rate gyros and turning off accelerometers

00:51:14.779 --> 00:51:21.779
at our preplanned procedure to accommodate
flaws in the redundancy management.

00:51:25.299 --> 00:51:31.279
When you lose one computer you also take out
part of the sensors in the flight control

00:51:31.279 --> 00:51:31.529
system.

00:51:31.449 --> 00:51:36.660
And, to be sure that a subsequent failure
wouldn't put you in worse shape, it took about

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.650
a minute's worth of manual reconfiguration
on my part.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.109
And I kind of missed the whole first part
of the flight.

00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:46.559
When I turned around I realized hey, this
thing is flying good, it is smooth and is

00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:47.819
on speed.

00:51:47.819 --> 00:51:49.789
And Fred was flying.

00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:55.349
We flew a rectangular pattern out of a downwind
leg here as we nosed over.

00:51:55.349 --> 00:52:01.199
And I got my chance to roll into a left 90
degree turn and fly base leg.

00:52:01.199 --> 00:52:07.009
And, as I put the stick over to roll, we got
this big lateral arch just like the simulator

00:52:07.009 --> 00:52:10.900
said.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:11.559
It just stunned me.

00:52:11.559 --> 00:52:13.869
Son of a gun, they were right after all.

00:52:13.869 --> 00:52:20.869
It was just the nature of something flying
at high alpha and rotating about a stability

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.759
axis and the cockpit gets slid sideways.

00:52:23.759 --> 00:52:26.890
It has big elevons so it flies like a fighter.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:27.299
It really does.

00:52:27.299 --> 00:52:31.279
And you are doing it all with a little stick
that doesn't move much.

00:52:31.279 --> 00:52:38.219
Anyway, we came down final at 290, I think
it was, flared out.

00:52:38.219 --> 00:52:40.890
My job was to put the gear down, a critical
function.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:47.890
And we are landing on lakebed 1-7 on the dry
lake at Edwards which is something like ten

00:52:50.469 --> 00:52:54.509
miles long, so we have pretty good margins
there.

00:52:54.509 --> 00:53:00.440
And Fred took the airplane back from ALT and
I got to fly base leg.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:06.299
But we touched down at about 185, I think
it was, nice and smooth.

00:53:06.299 --> 00:53:07.049
It was beautiful.

00:53:07.049 --> 00:53:14.049
The speed brake comes out to help cushion
the de-rotation, nose gear down and he raised

00:53:16.489 --> 00:53:18.180
a little dust as he rolled to a stop.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.170
So it was a good day.

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:27.170
Now, we had a really good post-flight party
after this one.

00:53:28.699 --> 00:53:35.699
And see the rudder speed brake flared there
and the elevons fold up.

00:53:39.219 --> 00:53:43.239
And so, now Fred truly did it again.

00:53:43.239 --> 00:53:50.239
A couple weeks later or thereabouts they got
their turn and they did much the same flight,

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.059
repeated it.

00:53:57.059 --> 00:54:00.369
Oh, one thing.

00:54:00.369 --> 00:54:03.630
You see the Pitot boom out there.

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:07.910
The Pitot boom is strictly on the Enterprise,
put out there to get good air data out in

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:14.249
front of this big blivit of an airplane which
is hard to get good measurements.

00:54:14.249 --> 00:54:21.249
Let me get the next one going here, if I can
figure out how to get out of this.

00:54:30.369 --> 00:54:32.319
The excitement came later.

00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:39.319
On STS-1, I looked out there when were on
final, I had to look out and look at the Pitot

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:54.829
boom, and it is going through an arch of about
three feet.

00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:59.189
It was built with the perfect resonance of
everything else with the airplane, and it

00:54:59.189 --> 00:55:02.209
was just a blur out there going back and forth.

00:55:02.209 --> 00:55:04.759
And I really thought it was going to break
off.

00:55:04.759 --> 00:55:11.759
Was that your only Pitot source or did you
have the normal ones [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?

00:55:13.689 --> 00:55:15.920
Good question.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.269
Somehow we had at least inertially derived
ones.

00:55:18.269 --> 00:55:20.469
Everything looked good.

00:55:20.469 --> 00:55:24.279
And, actually, it still put out good airspeed,
even though it was a blur.

00:55:24.279 --> 00:55:26.759
And I think the beta averaged out.

00:55:26.759 --> 00:55:33.759
Anyway, it wasn't a problem we noticed other
than visually it looked like it was going

00:55:35.459 --> 00:55:36.469
to break off.

00:55:36.469 --> 00:55:40.969
They changed and stiffened it up so it wasn't
a problem on subsequent flights.

00:55:40.969 --> 00:55:47.920
Now, you can see here we are at free flight
four now which was the other crew's turn.

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:54.920
The tail cone is off and our final pressure
glide slope with the tail cone on was 11 degrees.

00:55:59.569 --> 00:56:05.449
With tail cone off it was 23 degrees, halves
your L/D.

00:56:05.449 --> 00:56:11.189
So you really are in a steep dive.

00:56:11.189 --> 00:56:18.189
Normal ILS into Logan out here would be 2.5
degrees so you are coming down gangbusters.

00:56:20.739 --> 00:56:27.739
And it is even worse in ALT than it was in
the orbital missions which were coming down

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:30.439
with the same configuration but much heavier.

00:56:30.439 --> 00:56:33.989
Heavier you've got more gravity working for
you and you can fly shallower.

00:56:33.989 --> 00:56:36.339
It doesn't seem to figure, but that is the
way it is.

00:56:36.339 --> 00:56:41.289
So 19 degrees is a normal return from orbit.

00:56:41.289 --> 00:56:44.670
Final pressure glide slope we were up in the
20s.

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:51.009
Kind of catching up a little.

00:56:51.009 --> 00:56:57.180
One of our jobs on the flight preceding this
was to try the braking.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:00.170
We just let it roll out on the first couple
flights.

00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:02.829
They wanted to do brake tests.

00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:08.969
And Fred jumped on the brakes after we touched
down and another resonance problem, interaction

00:57:08.969 --> 00:57:15.969
between the structure and the anti-skid, and
I thought it was going to break the airplane.

00:57:19.339 --> 00:57:24.749
It was just violent shuttering, shaking, everything
rattling in the cockpit.

00:57:24.749 --> 00:57:27.930
And I hollered to Fred, get off the brakes,
we are going to brake something.

00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:30.910
He said no, the card says we have got to do
max braking.

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:33.969
I was pleading with him to get off the brakes,
which he did.

00:57:33.969 --> 00:57:34.900
Easy fix.

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:40.109
When they flew the next flight here they did
hard braking, and it was smooth.

00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:47.109
They went in to change the resister and the
feedback electrons, and that did it.

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.549
I mean it was instant fix.

00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:57.549
So there still is reason to do flight tests
because surprises happen.

00:58:02.519 --> 00:58:09.519
Now free flight five, it turns out there was
a little brake here.

00:58:09.529 --> 00:58:16.529
We are back at Houston and Prince Charles,
who wasn't married yet at that time, came

00:58:17.459 --> 00:58:19.299
by on a visit.

00:58:19.299 --> 00:58:24.920
And we gave him a ride in the simulator.

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.209
He had some flying time.

00:58:26.209 --> 00:58:28.819
And he got into a horrendous PIO.

00:58:28.819 --> 00:58:33.380
I mean he was out of control and crashed in
the simulator.

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.229
And felt bad.

00:58:34.229 --> 00:58:37.109
And we said that is because you're not used
to the stick and everything.

00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:38.299
And that was his tour.

00:58:38.299 --> 00:58:43.039
Now, for this flight, he was actually out
along the runway.

00:58:43.039 --> 00:58:46.859
They had him out there so he could watch.

00:58:46.859 --> 00:58:51.150
The objective here was to land on the concrete
runway, put it right on the line, there is

00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:57.869
a white line 5,000 feet down, and Fred was
really working at it, putting in a lot of

00:58:57.869 --> 00:58:58.119
inputs.
Look at the elevons going there.

00:58:59.749 --> 00:59:02.170
You see them?

00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:06.880
And he is making roll commands.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:13.880
And so we logged a couple landings.

00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:23.349
And down and rolled to a stop.

00:59:24.209 --> 00:59:26.849
Afterwards, we called out and he came up to
say hello.

00:59:26.849 --> 00:59:28.150
He said oh, you made me feel good.

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:31.069
You guys did as bad as I did.

00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:35.849
There he is right there with his binoculars.

00:59:35.849 --> 00:59:38.199
Well, that scared everybody to death.

00:59:38.199 --> 00:59:40.769
It looked worse from outside than it did in
the cockpit.

00:59:40.769 --> 00:59:45.199
And the flight control flaw that we found,
though, was serious.

00:59:45.199 --> 00:59:50.390
You've got elevons that do both pitch and
roll.

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:54.829
So, in the software, when you are asking for
both pitch and roll at the same time, it has

00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:58.819
got to decide which one do I move?

00:59:58.819 --> 01:00:05.819
This is just a supposition of what would come.

01:00:08.009 --> 01:00:10.549
The software had to give priority.

01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:13.630
And they decided to give priority to pitch.

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:20.630
And roll was taken second priority when you
had to limit the commands to the elevons to

01:00:22.039 --> 01:00:27.329
within the capability of the hydraulic system.

01:00:27.329 --> 01:00:32.689
The result was a lag in roll response when
you are working pitch hard.

01:00:32.689 --> 01:00:36.549
And the lag was up around two-tenths to three-tenths
of a second.

01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:40.539
You may be aware if you studied flight control
systems.

01:00:40.539 --> 01:00:47.539
Any kind of system that has a quarter second
delay between input and response is asking

01:00:50.949 --> 01:00:55.239
for a PIO, Pilot Induced Oscillation.

01:00:55.239 --> 01:00:57.400
And we had a big time in roll.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.529
Fred was clanking back and forth to stop and
roll trying to level the wings out there that

01:01:01.529 --> 01:01:02.749
first skip.

01:01:02.749 --> 01:01:06.759
I heard the controller banging over there.

01:01:06.759 --> 01:01:10.420
And I suggested if you get off maybe it will
damp.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:15.119
We're doing this and, sure enough, that is
what he did.

01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:21.150
He stopped the inputs, the airplane damped
right away and then it went OK.

01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:28.150
But it was something we had to fix, obviously.

01:01:30.869 --> 01:01:37.869
Here is a picture just a micro-second after
liftoff on one of the last two.

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:46.549
Well, there was a decision with a lot of debate
about do we go back and fix the flight control

01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:48.199
and fly some more ALT?

01:01:48.199 --> 01:01:52.289
But this is a huge production and it was costing
time and we weren't getting into orbit.

01:01:52.289 --> 01:01:58.869
A decision was made now we will do it in simulators
and in-flight simulators and fix the problem,

01:01:58.869 --> 01:01:59.819
but press on.

01:01:59.819 --> 01:02:04.479
That was the end of ALT, at the end of which,
when you do flight tests, you talk about opening

01:02:04.479 --> 01:02:05.819
the envelope of an airplane.

01:02:05.819 --> 01:02:12.279
Well, the envelope of the Space Shuttle is
400 nautical miles altitude and mach 25.

01:02:12.279 --> 01:02:16.069
And in ALT we got the four miles and 0.3 mach.

01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:23.069
It is really down in the lower left corner,
but worth doing.

01:02:23.299 --> 01:02:25.729
Test results.

01:02:25.729 --> 01:02:28.779
I mentioned as we went we had that APU fuel
leak.

01:02:28.779 --> 01:02:29.429
Fixed it.

01:02:29.429 --> 01:02:32.099
Didn't come back.

01:02:32.099 --> 01:02:37.009
The buffet lifter drag was right on what we
expected, no surprises there.

01:02:37.009 --> 01:02:40.619
Handling qualities were good, even with the
lurch.

01:02:40.619 --> 01:02:43.150
It was not a problem.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:46.670
I mentioned the Pitot boom, the anti-skid.

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:51.150
SCA did the job, although it struggled to
get up.

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:55.689
With the tail coming off, it could only get
to about 18,000 feet.

01:02:55.689 --> 01:03:00.670
So this was not a good program to build up
your flying time.

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:07.670
It was about a total, in three flights, of
about 12 minutes of flying time.

01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:16.630
And the biggie I mentioned was the handling
qualities and the PIO tendency that we fixed

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:25.160
with lots of studies later and changes in
the way the control equations were written.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:30.369
And, as a final thing, they did some more
flights with the nose lowered down and determine

01:03:30.369 --> 01:03:34.788
what the ferry flight performance of the combination
is.

01:03:34.788 --> 01:03:41.439
I, later after flying in space, checked out
on the 747 and still fly it on the ferry flights.

01:03:41.439 --> 01:03:44.559
And it does the job.

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:46.890
It burns lots of gas.

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:53.890
I figured out that the combination across
the country, the mileage is about 300 feet

01:03:56.549 --> 01:04:00.549
per gallon, so a football field per gallon
of fuel.

01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:04.519
40,000 pounds an hour is the field flow.

01:04:04.519 --> 01:04:11.519
It goes about 1.5 times its own length when
we get on the gas, but it gets there.

01:04:15.059 --> 01:04:17.819
I don't have to buy the fuel.

01:04:17.819 --> 01:04:20.979
A lot of people said wasn't this scary, ALT?

01:04:20.979 --> 01:04:25.609
Actually, from a risk standpoint, we had ejection
seats.

01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:31.709
If anything had gone wrong, anywhere along
the line, we could have pulled the handle

01:04:31.709 --> 01:04:33.140
and jumped out.

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:39.660
The scariest part of it was when we got in,
and during the captive flights, we would just

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.959
walk up a stairway and crawl through the hatch.

01:04:41.959 --> 01:04:43.380
And the same way getting out.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:50.380
But after the captive active flights, we would
land still on the orbiter.

01:04:52.979 --> 01:04:56.849
And they had this cherry picker to get us
out.

01:04:56.849 --> 01:05:00.890
Now, the situation here is it's a round hatch
hedged at the bottom.

01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:07.769
They only wanted on person at a time on the
end of this thing.

01:05:07.769 --> 01:05:13.849
You open a round hatch and then they bring
this up, the guy on the ground.

01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:19.410
And he doesn't want to get too close and ding
so he leaves about this much of a gap from

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:24.670
this round hatch which is 60 feet above the
ground that you have got to crawl out on your

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:31.670
knees, then stand up and then make the leap
across the thing onto this wobbly cage up

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:32.880
there.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.519
That is how our captive actives went.

01:05:37.519 --> 01:05:44.519
Where you wearing flight suits for all these
tests?

01:05:44.999 --> 01:05:51.999
Yeah, we were wearing flight suits and helmets
like you would in a 518 or any fighter.

01:05:52.509 --> 01:05:53.219
Not pressure suits.

01:05:53.219 --> 01:06:00.219
We didn't have a severe cabin pressure risk
at 25,000 feet.

01:06:02.219 --> 01:06:08.719
Let me get into the full screen mode here.

01:06:08.719 --> 01:06:15.049
I put in some thoughts about what is different
when you test an aircraft versus a spacecraft.

01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:18.589
With an airplane you can do little baby steps,
incremental tests.

01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:24.699
You can do static runs of the propulsion up
to the full power in the airplane itself.

01:06:24.699 --> 01:06:28.420
Then you taxi it slow and then faster and
faster down the runway.

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:31.739
You can rotate the nose a little bit.

01:06:31.739 --> 01:06:36.729
The first flight you will fly slow and leave
the gear down and then land it soon and check

01:06:36.729 --> 01:06:37.249
everything.

01:06:37.249 --> 01:06:40.049
And you could hold off for a perfect day to
do it.

01:06:40.049 --> 01:06:44.179
And then you go faster and faster to expand
the envelope.

01:06:44.179 --> 01:06:50.288
If anything goes wrong you can peel off and
get back on the ground quick.

01:06:50.288 --> 01:06:55.579
And, as I mentioned, you can always pull the
handle and bail out if things go really bad.

01:06:55.579 --> 01:07:01.299
When you have a spacecraft it is all or nothing.

01:07:01.299 --> 01:07:05.880
You have got to use the propulsion at its
full power.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:11.788
All the critical systems and subsystems have
got to work.

01:07:11.788 --> 01:07:14.819
You cannot make a quick abort.

01:07:14.819 --> 01:07:19.038
Long delays like days are sometimes required
to get back to the conditions where you can

01:07:19.038 --> 01:07:21.459
make an appropriate landing.

01:07:21.459 --> 01:07:27.788
And the weather could turn sour at the time.

01:07:27.788 --> 01:07:34.420
When you are going to flight test the spacecraft
you have got to have a lot of redundancy in

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:41.420
the design to allow for the bad day that has
to carry it through in a considerable amount

01:07:41.509 --> 01:07:41.910
of time.

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:48.910
You necessarily have got to test everything
to the limit, wind tunnels, CVD, thermal vacuum

01:07:50.819 --> 01:07:54.479
because the environment is lots more stressful.

01:07:54.479 --> 01:07:59.359
You have got to have a lot of instrumentation
so that you can tell what did go wrong or

01:07:59.359 --> 01:08:00.788
be sure that everything went right.

01:08:00.788 --> 01:08:07.788
You are talking about an army of controllers
in a control room to pull it off with a complex

01:08:08.839 --> 01:08:10.359
system like the Shuttle.

01:08:10.359 --> 01:08:14.380
And lots of simulation to get everybody trained.

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.310
A biggie is to verify the software.

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:22.120
I mentioned the software is guaranteed to
be wrong on the first release and several

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:22.729
subsequent.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:27.600
It is just the nature of building software.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.899
And so getting that checked out is a major
one.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:33.149
Procedures.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:40.040
When we flew the orbital flight, the stack
of checklists just laid on top of each other

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:49.109
was about this high, for 51F, and it weighed
210 pounds.

01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:55.059
It was called the Flight Data File.

01:08:55.059 --> 01:09:02.059
And then lots of time and expense getting
everybody really ready to go.

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:10.549
And being sure that when you're going into
an unknown part of the envelope that the margins

01:09:10.549 --> 01:09:12.279
on the flight control are adequate.

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:17.979
So the surprises and the aeroderivatives that
hit you can be accommodating.

01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:22.830
I have rambled on a long time here.

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:27.210
We can take the five-minute break, I can answer
questions, however you want to do it.

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.559
Maybe it's time for a stretch.

01:09:28.559 --> 01:09:32.529
Let's do a two-minute break.

01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:36.359
These people are tough.

01:09:36.359 --> 01:09:38.279
All right.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:40.200
Break is over.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:47.200
The next assignment for me was being put on
an orbital flight test, and specifically STS-3.

01:09:58.309 --> 01:10:05.309
A two man crew, Jack Lousma, a Marine, and
myself from the Air Force, we were in pressure

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:16.220
suits, you will notice there, and on ejection
seats in the Columbia.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:19.100
This is OV-102.

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:22.180
101 was the Enterprise.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.630
102 was the Columbia.

01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:28.170
And our countdown went smoothly.

01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:30.210
This was in March of '82.

01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:37.210
And this is a signature moment in your life
when the SRBs light.

01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:44.290
I mean it looks smooth and nice as we are
flying through a cloud here on launch, logging

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:53.400
weather time I might add, but it is rough
and noisy and rattley.

01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:03.090
And the acceleration is right away, and it
builds up to 3Gs.

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:06.020
When the main engines are throttled back,
the whole 3Gs.

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:10.670
And so, it is no doubt you are on your way
somewhere really fast wherever the solids

01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:14.020
want to go.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.040
Everything worked good right up to MECO.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.510
And the external tank, as you saw, drifted
away.

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:27.510
And then here come the first order of business,
opening the payload bay doors so we can start

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.240
rejecting heat with the radiators that are
mounted on the inside.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.440
We are tailed down.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:41.770
And as you watch here, we are going right
over Los Angeles at the time.

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:43.480
This is just north of LA.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.920
You can see LA.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:54.920
Sorry, this is Santa Monica, LAX and
Palos Verdes right there.

01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:09.370
Anyway, the first thing we had to do is get
out of Theodolite, that is a sighting device

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:16.620
that surveyors use, and take a daunting number
of readings on little targets that were pasted

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:23.980
around inside the payload bay and on the doors
to measure where they were.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:27.200
And we did that through the flight all the
way along.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.309
It wasn't fast enough.

01:12:30.309 --> 01:12:32.800
Out in front of the nose there were some dark
patches.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.470
That is where tile were, white tile, and fell
off during launch.

01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:38.350
They actually found some washed up on the
beach.

01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:44.870
Fortunately, none of the black tile on the
bottom fell off but we did lose some on the

01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:45.120
top.
Zero G is really one of the delights.

01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:58.490
There are two really good things about flying
in orbit, weightlessness and the view out

01:12:59.010 --> 01:12:59.330
the window.

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:06.330
And that is like nothing that you experience,
even flying high-performance airplanes.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.809
We had the RMS cranked up.

01:13:09.809 --> 01:13:12.210
That was my job as RMS operator.

01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:18.460
And we had a package in the back, the plasma
diagnostic package to grab and move out there.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.940
There are some things that show you the housekeeping
area.

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:27.940
In the corner there is the john.

01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:34.250
And long duration spaceflight exercise is
important.

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:39.040
It is really not a big deal on a seven-day
flight.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:46.040
Jack is a Marine, as I mentioned.

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:51.610
He has got to have his daily ration of pushups,
so here we go.

01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:54.210
How about a one-handed pushup, Jack?

01:13:54.210 --> 01:14:01.210
How about a no-handed pushup?

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.130
This is a quick summary.

01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:11.610
We went our seven days.

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:18.570
And the lakebed at Edwards, they had a really
wet spring, was unusable, so we went to White

01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:20.580
Sands, New Mexico.

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:27.580
The first day, right as we are about to light
the OMS engines to start deorbit, they said

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.750
hold off because this terrible dust storm
is going on.

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:39.750
And then we waited a delightful day with nothing
in the flight plane much to enjoy ourselves,

01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:42.250
and then came down the next day.

01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:49.250
Now we find another gotcha in handling quantities
here.

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:54.400
Right here Jack thought the nose might be
coming down too fast and tried to stop it,

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.080
and ended up doing a little wheelie.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:03.400
Subsequent analysis showed that the whole
response of the vehicle changes when you are

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.790
down on the main gear only.

01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:07.630
And nobody thought of that.

01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:14.630
It would seem like, well, they are worried
about pitch in the air but not while you are

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.650
rolling on the main gear trying to de-rotate.

01:15:18.650 --> 01:15:21.920
So it resulted in more software changes.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:28.920
Another thing we learned, they were pushing
for auto-land.

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:36.530
We flew the whole turn onto final and down
final hands off in auto-land.

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:43.530
The program wanted to take this out of the
hands of the crew, so here on the third flight

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:49.940
they had us sitting there watching the airplane
fly down to pre-flare.

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:55.210
And then the first chance Jack got to grab
the stick was at the last minute to do the

01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:57.230
flare and landing.

01:15:57.230 --> 01:15:59.410
And that was dumb when you look back, really
dumb.

01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:06.410
And so, now all flight commanders, if it has
been auto down to 40,000 feet where you go

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:11.150
subsonic, we will fly manually all the way
down to get a feel for the airplane.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.630
It makes a lot more sense.

01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:14.870
That is the way flights are done now.

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:18.370
Here is where we started from orbit.

01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:21.850
This is how Cape Canaveral looks.

01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:24.460
Right here is the shuttle landing strip that
is down there.

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.340
You can see it.

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:28.850
And the launch pads are these two dots.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:34.490
And so, that is where usually a shuttle flight
starts and ends.

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:37.210
Here is a picture of our payload bay on STS-3.

01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:40.220
And we did have a payload.

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:47.220
Previous crews had pretty much empty payload
bay, but we had an environmental measurement

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:51.670
thing, a lot of instrumentation.

01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:58.670
Then this PDP, Plasma Diagnostic Package that
we actually had something to grab with the

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.630
manipulator arm, as you see here.

01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:07.630
I looked around and found, I don't know if
you can recognize this, but that is Cape Cod

01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:08.400
back there.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:13.120
A picture of MIT.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.180
Not a good picture.

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.130
There have got to be lots of better ones.

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:22.160
And here is where we ended up, the White Sands
area near Alamogordo, New Mexico.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:29.160
What we learned, this is a pretty cryptic
summary.

01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:33.190
Training was a real problem.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:40.190
The first two crews that flew STS-1 and STS-2
had all the attention of the training people

01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:44.970
in the simulators.

01:17:44.970 --> 01:17:48.030
They had priority, properly so.

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:55.030
We, on the third flight, had low priority
and really struggled.

01:17:55.230 --> 01:18:00.350
And what we found, when we got in the simulators,
is when they didn't work right nobody could

01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:03.540
explain why.

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.840
Many times we try on ascent and crash and
burn.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.130
And you always were scratching your head is
this real?

01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:12.940
Is this the way the orbiter flies or is it
some flaw in the simulator?

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:19.940
Early on you are developing not only the orbiter
but the training facilities.

01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:22.850
And the people didn't understand the system.

01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:28.640
We had more exposure from ALT to subsystems
than the people that were supposed to be the

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.040
experts.

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:36.040
It was a group learning process and a long
way from what happens now when crews go in.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.309
And they get the straight word right from
the beginning on how things are.

01:18:40.309 --> 01:18:43.210
The tiles fell off.

01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:43.850
Not good.

01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:50.850
They changed the bonding scheme, improved
the quality control and, fortunately for the

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:55.610
program, no critical tiles fell off.

01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:57.090
But that was alarming.

01:18:57.090 --> 01:19:04.090
We looked out there, we reported it, took
pictures of it looking at these gaps in the

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:06.670
system right out in front of the windshield.

01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:13.670
But Ground said don't worry, that is a cool
area during entry.

01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:18.710
Entry is at 40 degrees angle of attack so
it is cool on top.

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:19.410
They were right.

01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:23.900
Everything was fine.

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:29.290
Another tile thing was after the flight, actually,
delay that.

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:32.350
It was really more after the next flight.

01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:36.080
I mentioned how the ride is.

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:40.100
The first two minutes were rough and exciting.

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:47.100
The next six or seven are unbelievably smooth
when you get on the main engines, and then

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:52.460
more vibration that you are getting sitting
in the chairs now.

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:54.480
And it is just a steady relentless push.

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:58.309
It is just a spectacular right.

01:19:58.309 --> 01:20:03.030
But you are back in the seat.

01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:09.630
Had an APU oil overheat during that 3G part.

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:15.460
Actually, about two minutes before MECO, Ground
called and said we needed to shut down one

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:15.910
APU.

01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:21.270
We were up past the point where we could live
without all three APUs running.

01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:28.270
I had a chance to test what I worked on years
previously with the cockpit design.

01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:35.290
You are concerned about visibility when you
are squashed in the seat at 3Gs and access.

01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:40.360
And the APU switches, we had to put them down
here.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:47.360
And, I remember worrying specifically, if
we have got to get to the APU switches, the

01:20:48.190 --> 01:20:52.920
guy on the right seat under 3Gs, can he lift
the helmet and look over there and find the

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.690
correct switch?

01:20:53.690 --> 01:20:58.380
And you do not want to shut down the wrong
one, one of the good ones.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:05.380
And it turned out, I guess with the adrenaline
lifting this heavy helmet at 3Gs, I did it

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.280
without even thinking about it and went right
to the switch.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:17.190
So it worked.

01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:19.920
General habitability was good in the orbiter.

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:26.059
The first time anybody lived there for eight
days.

01:21:26.059 --> 01:21:30.309
A good way to think about living in the orbiter,
think of it as a camping trip.

01:21:30.309 --> 01:21:37.309
You go on a camping trip you don't worry about
hot water, showers and all the niceties of

01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:39.020
home.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.240
You get in that frame of mind and it is fine.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:48.240
The food is adequate, the facilities are OK,
although in our case the toilet ground to

01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:52.740
a halt.

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:59.740
It is a drum that rotates to centrifugally
sling all fecal material out and contain it.

01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:02.760
And it ground to a halt.

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:09.760
We were in a real camping trip for a while
on that, although it worked out.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.440
The arm worked great, RMS.

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:19.210
The main jets I mentioned earlier.

01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:23.690
Of course, you don't use the main jets much.

01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:27.770
It would be hard to sleep with them booming
away, but you use the Verniers most of the

01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:28.020
time.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:32.809
Verniers are critical to smooth operation
over long periods of time.

01:22:32.809 --> 01:22:39.520
We spent a lot of time, for instance, tail
sun.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:45.620
For like three days we put the tail right
at the sun and stayed in that inertial attitude.

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:51.390
And so it cooked the backend while the front
end of the orbiter is cold.

01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:56.580
We took all the Theodolite measurements, opened
and closed the doors.

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:58.380
All of that worked fine.

01:22:58.380 --> 01:22:59.930
The systems handled it.

01:22:59.930 --> 01:23:01.670
A lot of it was ground analysis.

01:23:01.670 --> 01:23:06.140
And how the temperatures were, were extensively
instrumented.

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:12.940
And we did notice a strange thing.

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:15.880
Not strange but it became apparent.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:22.880
When you are in orbit, when you are on the
sunny side of the earth, as soon as the sun

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:31.309
comes up it is high noon bright, but there
is no atmosphere around to diffuse the light.

01:23:31.309 --> 01:23:38.309
When we were at tail sun, it is hidden behind
perfectly eclipsed by the aft structure.

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:45.740
And so, there is no sun ball to be seen anywhere,
even though it is bright sunny from just the

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:50.980
reflections of the structure you can see out
the window.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:57.980
I noticed, looking at the radiators, which
are very, very smooth concave surfaces out

01:23:58.370 --> 01:24:01.190
there and shiny silver colored.

01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:08.190
It looked like there were bright diamonds
all along the surface when we were tail sun.

01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:14.990
And I finally figured out it was just little
specks of dust on the radiators, which you

01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:16.730
wouldn't even notice normally.

01:24:16.730 --> 01:24:23.730
But exactly tail sun, the sun's rays are coming
right down exactly tangent to that surface.

01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:28.650
And the least little thing on it would flare.

01:24:28.650 --> 01:24:35.650
And interesting effect which took me a while
to figure out what all these bright spots

01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:43.460
on the radiators are.

01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:51.590
Entry on STS-3 was done to an about 1:00 in
the morning landing at White Sands, New Mexico.

01:24:53.150 --> 01:24:54.100
We started the entry.

01:24:54.100 --> 01:25:00.440
Halfway around the world it is dark, and most
of the entry was in the dark.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:05.809
The plasma light show that happens, as you
get down in the atmosphere, the ionization

01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:11.420
that happens produces a spectacular scene
out the windshield.

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:18.420
I mean it also had us thinking about the missing
tiles that are going.

01:25:19.059 --> 01:25:24.150
But a night entry is really a show.

01:25:24.150 --> 01:25:29.360
The next flight was a day entry which was
not nearly as spectacular.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:36.360
I mentioned about grabbing the stick too late,
unfair to Jack, and then the de-rotation.

01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:43.850
Now onto part three.

01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:45.050
How am I doing?

01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:46.059
I might make it yet.

01:25:46.059 --> 01:25:53.059
STS-51F was a whole different situation than
the earlier test flights.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:05.050
One big difference is there were seven people
instead of two.

01:26:05.050 --> 01:26:09.410
With seven we had to add a little bit on the
patch to put the extra two names.

01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:12.440
This is the ninth flight.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:15.059
There are nineteen stars.

01:26:15.059 --> 01:26:15.780
Primary experiments.

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:16.960
This was a science flight.

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.970
It was a space lab but without the laboratory.

01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:25.900
All equipment in the payload bay full stem
to stern with telescopes mostly.

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:31.650
And all the telescopes mounted on the pointing
system we had were solar telescopes.

01:26:31.650 --> 01:26:37.570
So we had the sun in the accurate part of
the sky.

01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:44.570
Here is Orion and Leo, the backwards question
mark.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.320
Nineteen stars.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:58.320
A lot of symbology here.

01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:08.070
A short entertaining video.

01:27:13.230 --> 01:27:20.230
We had seven people, including three mission
specialists, which Dr.

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:25.920
Hoffman was when he was down in Houston.

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:31.530
And we had two payload specialists, guys who
were not full time astronauts.

01:27:31.530 --> 01:27:33.030
They were solar physicists.

01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:39.740
And they were the experts on the solar telescopes
that we had and went along to fly.

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.780
First try here at main engine ignition ended
three seconds after ignition.

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:50.780
We felt the spacecraft rock around, the noise
and then nothing.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:58.600
And we had a pad shutdown because the left
engine, the automatic system detected a failure,

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.980
a slow-acting valve and it shut us off.

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:07.400
So we are there wondering if we are on fire
and whether we ought to race out and so forth.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:13.280
It was tense for a while but there wasn't
a fire, just this automatic shutdown.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.790
We crawled out.

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:22.790
We were told there would be a two-week delay,
so we took the kids to Disneyland and had

01:28:24.570 --> 01:28:28.260
a good time, went back home and started the
whole training cycle again.

01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:34.840
And came back two weeks later and got a good
start this time.

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:41.270
But not after lying on our back on the pads
strapped in for five hours because of some

01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:48.040
software glitches that had to be fixed and
computers reloaded and tested.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:52.490
And one of our reports was five hours is the
limit.

01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:58.490
I mean you are lying on your back with your
feet up in a pressure suit strapped in.

01:28:58.490 --> 01:29:05.490
That is more than is reasonable to ask prior
to launch.

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:10.740
On the way up, well, I will mention that later.

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:12.910
Here is the instrument system.

01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:15.040
This baby was built in Germany.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:22.040
It is this gimbal device that held these four
solar telescopes and the star trackers.

01:29:23.150 --> 01:29:25.380
Here is a physics experiment.

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:30.340
The OMS engines are lit and produces one-sixteenth
of a G.

01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:33.920
The thrust of the orbital maneuvering engines.

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:37.020
If you are trying to sleep, that is what happens
when the OMS engines come on.

01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:44.020
And you saw the water going across.

01:29:44.290 --> 01:29:46.870
It is déjà vu.

01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:52.270
We had the same old PDP package on this, but
with a difference this time.

01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:54.940
We took it out of the payload bay and brought
it up here.

01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:59.559
That is my right ear you are looking at in
profile out the window.

01:29:59.559 --> 01:30:05.240
It is crowded up there with seven people up
on the flight deck all trying to get a view

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:07.220
here, but we let go of it.

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:13.370
And it had a momentum wheel in there to cause
it to spin up slowly.

01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:20.370
And we backed away from it and flew a couple
of very challenging loops around it.

01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:26.080
Here is a sequel to the hairbrush.

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:26.760
This is not me.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:33.540
It is Story Musgrave who has the same hairdo
as I do.

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:37.740
And he is getting spiffed up for the TV show.

01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:44.740
That is all we did is horse around for seven
days.

01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:04.380
It got extended a day to eight days again.

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:11.380
And this landing was back at Edwards, runway
23 on August 6th when it was 105 degrees,

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:17.670
lots of heat waves.

01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:22.960
This landing was by far the most forward CG
because we still had all that equipment in

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:24.650
the payload bay.

01:31:24.650 --> 01:31:31.650
And we were almost the heaviest orbiter landing,
so getting the nose down before it fell down,

01:31:32.170 --> 01:31:39.170
crashed and broke the nose gear was one of
my primary concerns on this one.

01:32:01.230 --> 01:32:04.420
More about the actual launch itself.

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:05.850
There is the customary view.

01:32:05.850 --> 01:32:12.850
They put a camera right in close and got this
really close-up view, but it was about 5.5

01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:21.610
minutes after this picture.

01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:22.820
We had delayed five hours.

01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:29.820
It is late afternoon so very quickly heading
out over the Atlantic we were in darkness.

01:32:30.690 --> 01:32:31.980
And then, bang.

01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:38.559
Remember the left engine got us on the pad
abort?

01:32:38.559 --> 01:32:42.110
Well, the center engine shut down.

01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:47.090
We were at 3Gs and all of a sudden we are
at 2Gs or something like that.

01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:53.660
Instant square wave cutoff and acceleration.

01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:56.370
Looking there and confirming the center engine
shut down.

01:32:56.370 --> 01:33:01.860
What happened was there are a number of sensors
on the main engines.

01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:08.860
The particular one that got us was the fuel
high pressure turbo pump.

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:16.240
A piece of machinery running at 75,000 RPM
high pressures.

01:33:19.130 --> 01:33:26.130
The high-tech gear that makes the main engine
so efficient, IISP, but really run at the

01:33:26.150 --> 01:33:31.610
limits of metallurgy and technology.

01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:36.880
The sensor that senses the output temperature
was a series of four platinum wires in the

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:42.550
cavity in the output of that turbo pump.

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:45.730
They had some tendency for the wires to burn
through.

01:33:45.730 --> 01:33:52.730
When they burn through, they showed over-temp
was the electrical result of a burn through,

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.280
one of these sensors.

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:56.910
Well, we had two burn throughs.

01:33:56.910 --> 01:34:03.360
And the software said that must mean there
are two sensors that say you are too hot,

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.809
I will shut the motor off.

01:34:04.809 --> 01:34:06.850
And it did.

01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:13.850
With no reaction we just kept going straight
and smooth, but it now put us into what is

01:34:20.809 --> 01:34:21.490
called an abort.

01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:24.340
Well, here is the crew.

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:26.960
There are seven of us.

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:33.750
I need to practice this more.

01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:35.620
But, anyway, it was a two shift operation.

01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:39.550
We were going to work around the clock, so
we had a red team and a blue team.

01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:44.210
And I was the commander so I had a striped
shirt.

01:34:44.210 --> 01:34:44.710
Abort to orbit.

01:34:44.710 --> 01:34:49.980
We had to call from the ground, confirm what
we knew already, which means turning that

01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:54.040
rotary knob to ATO, abort to orbit, kind of
an oxymoron in a way.

01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:55.290
It is not really an abort.

01:34:55.290 --> 01:34:58.500
It is pressing on and pushing the button behind
it.

01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:04.059
It loads the software in to do a couple of
things, lower the insertion target.

01:35:04.059 --> 01:35:11.059
We had tried to get as high orbit as performance
would permit, but now we are going lower.

01:35:11.219 --> 01:35:15.760
Engine down costs you total performance.

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:20.170
And we also started dumping OMS fuel.

01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:26.010
We had to turn on the OMS engines, and we
ended up dumping 4500 pounds of OMS fuel,

01:35:26.010 --> 01:35:33.010
a little bit of extra thrust but a significant
loss of weight to allow the remaining performance

01:35:34.469 --> 01:35:38.469
to get us to an acceptable orbit.

01:35:38.469 --> 01:35:44.980
And, interestingly, the last sim we did in
training in Houston, before we went to the

01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:51.780
Cape to fly about two days before, was an
integrated sim where we are tied into all

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:53.730
the controllers and everybody is working as
a team.

01:35:53.730 --> 01:35:59.650
And the very last run we had was an ATO, abort
to orbit.

01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:01.650
And, son of a gun, that is what we did.

01:36:01.650 --> 01:36:05.110
We always had trouble starting a watch.

01:36:05.110 --> 01:36:09.219
And you try to do everything internally on
the crew so that if you lose communication

01:36:09.219 --> 01:36:15.530
with the ground you can complete the emergency
properly on your own.

01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:22.530
On ATOs before, we had to start a stopwatch
at the time we started the OMS dump.

01:36:22.630 --> 01:36:27.400
And we had a chart to go in to find out how
many minutes of OMS dump we needed to do given

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.200
at what velocity we lost the engine.

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.650
And Story's job was to do the watch.

01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:39.110
In the excitement of all the other stuff we
had to do to get the OMS on, we would always

01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.469
forget the watch.

01:36:39.469 --> 01:36:43.300
But this time he got the watch going so we
actually did it right.

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:50.300
And we knew that when we got to where we burned
out all the available fuel, which we did,

01:36:51.670 --> 01:36:58.670
we went to a fuel depletion cutoff, that we
would be really close to having to do right

01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:04.450
away another OMS burn to get an acceptable
orbit.

01:37:04.450 --> 01:37:09.000
We are right on the boundary, as it turned
out.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:16.000
We dumped the right amount of OMS, every last
drop of main propellant gone, we were just

01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:23.790
on the boundary of not having to do the first
OMS burn and we could relax 45 minutes later

01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:29.940
halfway around the world to do the final circularization.

01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:35.860
So it worked out good, except we were in a
lot lower orbit than we had planned.

01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:40.770
And everything about this space lab flight
depended on the orbit, so we were into a giant

01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:41.170
re-plan.

01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:45.719
Here is a nice picture of the IPS.

01:37:45.719 --> 01:37:52.719
Gordon, I also explain the situation of the
inhibit switch on and off.

01:37:55.170 --> 01:38:02.170
I don't know how much you were aware of what
was going on there in the cockpit.

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:08.610
There is a switch in the cockpit.

01:38:08.610 --> 01:38:13.400
You have a lot of parameters that are monitored
in the software on the main engines which,

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.210
if they go out of tolerance, will shut the
engine off.

01:38:17.210 --> 01:38:24.130
In fact, that is exactly why we lost the center
engine.

01:38:24.130 --> 01:38:28.830
But, right after that engine shutdown, we
were in a state where we really don't want

01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:29.740
to lose another engine.

01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:35.530
Because if, with only one left, we did not
have the performance to get to orbit, we would

01:38:35.530 --> 01:38:42.440
have had to have gone to Zaragoza, Spain and
land in the middle of the night where it was

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:45.059
a 10,000 foot overcast and raining.

01:38:45.059 --> 01:38:51.880
I mean if we pulled that off we would have
deserved some kind of metal.

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:58.880
And so, as a preplanned procedure, when you
lose one engine before, the point where you

01:38:59.510 --> 01:39:05.360
can stagger into orbit on one remaining engine
you inhibit the limits.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:12.360
You throw a switch that says you're telling
the engines to keep running regardless of

01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:18.500
over-temps or anything because you take the
chance, which is a big one if something let

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:25.500
go, to not be susceptible that got us for
the first engine, that is a sensor failure.

01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:29.780
And so we did that.

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:35.790
We inhibited the limits until we got to a
point in the energy profile where we were

01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:37.719
"press to MECO." That is the call.

01:39:37.719 --> 01:39:44.719
Press to MECO means that you are now at a
velocity where you can make it into acceptable

01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:51.790
low orbit on one engine if you should lose
another one.

01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:58.790
Press to MECO then the plan was we will re-enable
the limits so we are not hanging it out on

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:03.510
a possible second engine failure.

01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:07.570
And we would accept a second engine failure
because we knew we could make it on one engine.

01:40:07.570 --> 01:40:12.690
So we did that, the call came up, we went
to enable.

01:40:12.690 --> 01:40:17.059
And then, before we got there, we got another
call from the ground that said go back to

01:40:17.059 --> 01:40:18.870
inhibit.

01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:21.719
Well, it wasn't time to get a full explanation.

01:40:21.719 --> 01:40:23.990
We dutifully did it.

01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:28.490
What they saw on the ground is more failures
on the right engine.

01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:30.570
Remember the left got us on the pad abort?

01:40:30.570 --> 01:40:32.740
The center engine shut down on the way up.

01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:39.610
And, to make everything equal, the right engine,
the same sensors they can see on the ground,

01:40:39.610 --> 01:40:45.650
it is not visible in the cockpit, each of
those four platinum wires they saw starting

01:40:45.650 --> 01:40:47.820
to go.

01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:50.059
Clearly a design problem here.

01:40:50.059 --> 01:40:55.790
And they could tell those were going to go
and get us that second engine, so that is

01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:58.940
why we went back to inhibit for the rest of
the way.

01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:04.650
It made a good war story, but we got there.

01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:10.630
We started operating the IPS.

01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:15.990
A platform built in Germany with all the telescopes.

01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:19.460
These are start trackers to align where it
is.

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:22.150
And this baby could point.

01:41:22.150 --> 01:41:26.260
The spec was one arch second of accuracy.

01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:29.330
An arch second is the size of a dime.

01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:36.330
If you are standing at the capital and looking
at dime at the Lincoln Memorial, that is how

01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:38.080
much.

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:42.900
But, when we cranked it up, it didn't work
worth a hoot.

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:46.840
They just couldn't get it to stabilize or
point where it was supposed to.

01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:52.350
And, for three days, the payload specialists
and the MSs were in constant communication

01:41:52.350 --> 01:41:54.110
with the ground.

01:41:54.110 --> 01:41:59.559
And they patched the software in a major way
and kept sending up new software loads to

01:41:59.559 --> 01:42:01.620
get this thing to work.

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:08.620
And viola, on the third day they finally got
it right, then it worked well and got a lot

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:14.820
of good solar science.

01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:21.820
Just an aside, when you are looking at pictures
from space, you tend to think you walk around

01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:26.600
out here and the atmosphere is this big ocean
of air above you, right?

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:30.010
Lots of air way up there.

01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:37.010
This little bitty blue line right there, barely
perceptible, there always appears on any sunlit

01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:44.340
picture showing the limb of the earth, that
is the same blue as the scattering that causes

01:42:46.130 --> 01:42:47.760
the sky to be blue.

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.200
And that is how thick it is.

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:54.920
It is just this little thin shell of atmosphere
around.

01:42:54.920 --> 01:43:01.920
At 18,000 feet three miles up you have lost
half the atmospheric pressure.

01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:10.000
And that is laying on an 8,000 mile diameter
globe.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:17.000
And so that is where all of human history
has happened, in that little shell over there

01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:19.940
laying around the globe.

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:25.690
A philosophical point for you engineers.

01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:28.110
What is flying on orbit like?

01:43:28.110 --> 01:43:34.430
Well, it is one of the 215 pounds of checklist.

01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:39.980
Here I am checking propellant usage against
what we've got and where we are because we

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:46.980
dumped 4,500 pounds of crucial fuel that we
needed to make the planned most maneuvers

01:43:49.059 --> 01:43:55.580
that ever been done in the orbit on our mission.

01:43:55.580 --> 01:44:01.910
We didn't want an extra blip out of an RCS
thruster, and it worked very well.

01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:07.150
We got through seven days and even had enough
to have another day of science on the eighth

01:44:07.150 --> 01:44:07.400
day.

01:44:07.230 --> 01:44:11.530
Flying is mostly watching the clock.

01:44:11.530 --> 01:44:15.110
Everything happens according to time.

01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:21.360
And, since you have 16 sunrises and sunsets
every 24 hours, you never know what time it

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.780
is without looking at a watch.

01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:29.030
And you are looking at a crew activity plan
with everything laid out.

01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:36.030
And we even had an alarm system you could
set in the CRT to make a tone to wake you

01:44:40.090 --> 01:44:40.450
up.

01:44:40.450 --> 01:44:45.219
It is a lot of clock watching to pull off
a complex mission like this.

01:44:45.219 --> 01:44:47.400
It is just the way life is on orbit.

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:54.400
Now, here is one of our really serious high-level
scientific objectives.

01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:59.440
This was the official name, the Carbonated
Beverage Test.

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:04.440
I don't know if it was an MIT guy or not.

01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:09.980
He was a real serious academic type.

01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:12.380
An Indian I think.

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:19.380
Anyway, he built a Coke can that had a lot
of pressure regulators in there and laminar

01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:27.590
flow annular things.

01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:31.050
So many that this Coke can only held four
ounces of Coke.

01:45:31.050 --> 01:45:34.540
But he talked to the White House.

01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:35.650
Reagan was president.

01:45:35.650 --> 01:45:42.559
And somebody on the staff approved we are
going to fly these Coke cans and see if they

01:45:42.559 --> 01:45:49.280
had a system to provide pop in orbit with
the regular kind of carbonation and dispense

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.760
OK.

01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:55.050
We got the briefing and we had the four stowed
in a locker.

01:45:55.050 --> 01:45:57.880
And I got them out at the start of the test.

01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:03.809
But 30 days before launch, all of a sudden
this big thing came down.

01:46:03.809 --> 01:46:10.670
Pepsi got wind of this experiment and went
to the White House staff and they got Pepsi

01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:11.510
put on.

01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:18.510
Pepsi went into a crash program to fly more
cans of Pepsi.

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:24.880
Here is Carl trying the Pepsi.

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:29.250
You notice that looks a lot like a shaving
cream can.

01:46:29.250 --> 01:46:35.520
Well, that's how the Pepsi came out, just
like shaving cream, this frothy ball of stuff.

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.860
I mean theirs was the last minute deal.

01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:41.180
It didn't have any pressure regulators in
it.

01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:47.740
It just went out there.

01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:51.340
Now we worried about having to make a judgment,
which tasted better.

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:58.340
Well, the problem was we didn't have any kind
of refrigerator so they are both warm.

01:46:58.850 --> 01:47:04.550
Warm pop is not my favorite.

01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:11.550
And so, they were not anything anybody fought
over, either kind.

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:23.800
If you let the Pepsi float around it would
coalesce a little CO2 in random fashion, but

01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:30.950
the physics of it, Carl found by blowing very
carefully on the edge you could get it spinning

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.380
up.

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:40.380
And spinning Pepsi would have the froth at
the poles and the liquid around the equator.

01:47:40.969 --> 01:47:47.969
And we always had a tall guy standing by in
case it drifted into something.

01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:52.550
This is the end of the experiment here.

01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:59.550
He got it into his mouth without touching
any of it.

01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:06.550
We had the same PDP but, as I mentioned and
as you saw in the movie, we let go of it.

01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:10.730
We actually maneuvered all around the orbit
and looked at the wake through the plasma,

01:48:10.730 --> 01:48:11.850
let go of it.

01:48:11.850 --> 01:48:18.520
The proximity ops were very extensive and
challenging and many, many maneuvers.

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:20.070
That is in the Caribbean.

01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:21.690
The tongue of the ocean.

01:48:21.690 --> 01:48:25.950
A spectacular coral reef around very deep
water.

01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:28.880
Here is the Gibraltar.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.630
The rock, I believe, is out on the point.

01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:38.190
The Mediterranean here and the Atlantic here.

01:48:38.190 --> 01:48:40.280
You've heard you cannot see borders in space.

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.620
Not true.

01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:48.620
This is Israel this way and Egypt this way
and the Gaza strip along here, which has been

01:48:49.330 --> 01:48:53.469
in the news as of late.

01:48:53.469 --> 01:48:56.330
And in the same area the Dead Sea, the Sea
of Galilee.

01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:58.300
Here is most of Israel in one picture.

01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:04.219
A little closer to home.

01:49:04.219 --> 01:49:06.900
This is most of New Jersey.

01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:07.610
Long Island.

01:49:07.610 --> 01:49:08.420
There is Manhattan.

01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:11.389
Hudson River and East River.

01:49:11.389 --> 01:49:18.389
There are about 10,000 copies of this picture.

01:49:18.610 --> 01:49:20.219
This is Southern California.

01:49:20.219 --> 01:49:21.809
This is San Diego right here.

01:49:21.809 --> 01:49:23.880
Los Angeles.

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:29.719
And, in high rise print, you can see water
here which is San Francisco Bay.

01:49:29.719 --> 01:49:36.719
And the center of it all is the Antelope Valley
right here where I live and where Edwards

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.400
is right here.

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:44.110
This is the San Andreas Fault right through
here.

01:49:44.110 --> 01:49:51.110
Closer up of LA which, at the end of 51F,
we came right by Catalina Island, right up

01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:54.830
the Harbor Freeway into Edwards.

01:49:54.830 --> 01:50:01.830
And we went by Harbor Freeway at about mach
3.

01:50:03.170 --> 01:50:06.000
And closer up of the dry lake at Edwards.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.550
And the landing.

01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:15.550
Flight test results most of which I have mentioned
already.

01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:22.790
And, to finish up, I have reports on a memory
stick here, the pilot reports we wrote as

01:50:24.219 --> 01:50:28.090
crews which you can take at your leisure.

01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:30.739
If you are interested, copy it off.

01:50:30.739 --> 01:50:32.900
They are available.

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:39.900
Not great works of art, but the specific things
that we learned on doing the flight test.

01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:48.380
And these are just thoughts of transitioning
into operation from test mode, which I got

01:50:50.139 --> 01:50:53.969
to see the whole gamut from beginning to full
operational.

01:50:53.969 --> 01:50:56.750
I apologize for running over.

01:50:56.750 --> 01:51:00.430
I don't think anybody minded.

01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:04.230
As you see, everybody is listening very intently.

01:51:04.230 --> 01:51:06.489
Thank you very much for taking the time.

01:51:06.489 --> 01:51:06.739
[APPLAUSE]
