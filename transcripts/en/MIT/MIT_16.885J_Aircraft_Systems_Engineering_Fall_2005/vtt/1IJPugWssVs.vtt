00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.460
Well, it's my privilege to introduce Henry
Pohl today.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.920
Henry has been a longtime colleague of mine
working in the early days of Apollo and Shuttle.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:28.330
He is an old country boy but he has created
more innovative designs on technical problems

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.600
than anybody I know.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.470
And we will try to bring some of those out
because he has really created some very innovative

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.100
solutions to technical problems.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.540
And I am going to set Henry up a little bit
so let me set the stage for you a little bit.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:51.160
I was manager of the Space Shuttle Orbiter,
and the engineers came to me and said, Aaron,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.100
the waste management system on the Shuttle
is not working very well.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.950
Now, the waste management system, in simple
terms, is the toilet.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.100
They said the toilet is not working very well,
and we really need to go off and design a

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.199
new toilet.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.750
I thought for a moment, well, that's probably
a pretty important thing to do, so we did.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.720
Well, it turns out the original contract,
and I am quoting a little bit from memory,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.720
was about $10 million.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.880
Now, $10 million for a toilet when you can
go down to any place and get a toilet for

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.740
a couple hundred dollars is a pretty high
number.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.420
But that wasn't the worst of it.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.560
The worst of it, about six months later they
came to me and said, Aaron, guess what?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.210
It's not $10 million.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.240
It's $20 million.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.180
Congress got wind of this and wanted me to
come up and testify.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.439
And you can see what kind of fun they are
going to have.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.960
Waste management, they're really going to
have fun with this subject.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.350
And you may know some people in congress,
but the name was Mr.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.500
Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.880
I remember very clearly.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.880
He is still in congress now.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.240
He was head of the Science Committee, and
that is who we had to go testify for.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.000
Well, there was a reporter for The Washington
Post.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.659
Her name was Kathy Sawyer.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.750
Now, Kathy was the science reporter for The
Washington Post.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.270
Very, very good.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.290
Kathy was very smart, very fair, but she really
bore in on things.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.200
Kathy got wind of this so she wanted to publish
an article on it.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.280
She called me and said would you please talk
to me about the waste management system?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.220
I said, boy, she is going to get me in trouble.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.190
I said, I will tell you what, I've got somebody
that could really tell you about the waste

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.280
management system, and I will have Henry Pohl
call you.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.010
I talked to Henry about it.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.379
Now, that is going to be Henry's introduction
to this class of what he told Kathy Sawyer

00:02:37.379 --> 00:03:41.720
because it is a classic.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:52.430
Henry, it is all yours.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:05.840
Aaron almost forgot 
about Kathy Sawyer.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.070
Kathy called me up and said can you explain
to me how I might explain to my neighbor's

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:21.270
14 year old daughter why NASA has spent $10
million building a toilet?

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.700
And I said I will try.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.120
And I thought for a little bit on how am I
going to start out on this?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.919
I said, you know, if you take the commode
that you've got in your bathroom and you bolt

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.530
it upside down on the ceiling, now try using
it.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.060
[LAUGHTER] I said that is really a little
better situation than we have on the Orbiter

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.500
because at least we know which way the gravity
field is on that.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.470
In orbit you don't know.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.340
Most of the time you don't have any, but it
might be to the right or left or up or down.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.669
You know, that was the only reporter that
I ever talked to it that put everything down

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:05.600
verbatim of what I said, the questions she
asked and what I said and printed that article

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.430
in the newspaper.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.920
But that kind of sets a stage for operating
in the absence of gravity.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:24.140
I explained to her that the Space Shuttle
volume that the people had to live in is about

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.830
the same volume as you have in a modern bathroom.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:35.699
If you look at a bathroom with a shower and
a room just outside with a sink and everything,

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.010
we have just about that same volume in the
Shuttle.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.919
Now, you seal that all up, you've got a certain
amount of air that you can use in there and

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.230
you only have the air to replace gravity.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.360
You've got to have a flow of air to direct
whatever you want to direct in a certain direction.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360
You use that air.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.130
You run it through.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.600
You've got to deodorize it.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.070
You've got to clean it.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.120
You've got to run it back into the cabin almost
instantly.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.870
Otherwise, you pull the vacuum in the cabin.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.449
And so whenever you start putting all of that
equipment in there and all that stuff in there

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:22.410
on something that has never been done before,
$10 million or $20 million is kind of cheap

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.930
when you get right down to it.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.229
You look at the number of people that that
will hire for a year working on it is cheap.

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:32.590
But to try to get that message across is not
easy.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:41.730
Go ahead and give me my first slide.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.470
Let me just tell you another one since Aaron
got me off on a tangent here.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:54.880
The Chicago Tribune called me one day when
we had a problem on Shuttle, and she was badmouthing

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880
the Shuttle.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.400
And all she wanted to do was get a comment
out of me that I agreed with something that

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.419
she said since she could quote it.

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:03.710
And I said I don't agree with you.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.940
I said you know that Orbiter is really a pretty
good vehicle when you look at what it has

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.940
to do.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.800
I said you realize when it's in orbit it is
going eight times faster than a bullet when

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.620
it leaves the muzzle of a .30-06?

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.880
Silence on the other end.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.880
What's a .30-06?

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.340
Well, I knew that wasn't a good example.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:33.890
[LAUGHTER] But I told her that is a military
rifle that was used in the Second World War.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.050
And I used to fire that thing in the desert.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.599
And I could pull the trigger and see that
bullet hit the ground out of that 300 yards

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:40.650
almost instantly.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.810
Now, that shuttle is going eight times faster
than that.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.520
And I could see the headlines in the Chicago
Tribune, the shuttle flies eight times faster

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.910
than a bullet.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:51.910
Long silence.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.080
She said maybe I ought to find something else
to write about.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.610
I said why?

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.240
She said I don't think I have a story here.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.530
Well, it wasn't a story because it wasn't
negative.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:15.260
Kathy Sawyer was the only time I ever got
a good story from the press.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.830
I want you all to feel free to ask questions.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:26.930
I'm here more to talk about what you're interested
in talking about than my thoughts, so feel

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.819
free to ask questions any time.

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:31.440
I would like to talk about a half an hour.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.510
Somebody is going to have to tell me when
a half an hour is up.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:40.510
And then I would like to have some time for
some questions.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:48.700
My first involvement in the Space Shuttle
was Max Faget kind of came up with this idea

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.310
of a winged vehicle going into space.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.300
And we kicked it around for a while.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.980
And he formed a little committee, very small,
about 20 people as I recall.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.510
Put the people in a room.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.480
He wanted to keep it quiet.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.110
He wanted to keep it secret until he got enough
data so that he could know whether it was

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.610
feasible or not.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.570
Well, they wanted me to send the best engineer
I had over there.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:20.200
And he appointed a guy by the name of Jim
Chamberlain to head up that group.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.730
I sent a guy over there.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.990
They closed the doors, had a guard in front
of the doors so nobody could come in, no information

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.560
could get out.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.050
On the third day, Jim Chamberlain called me
up and said I need to have a talk with my

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.580
engineer.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.580
I said why?

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.580
He said he balked.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.420
I said what do you mean he balked?

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.710
He says, Henry, you know what an old mule
does when they balk, don't you?

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.250
I said, yeah, they won't go.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.430
He said, well, that's your Mr.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.080
Kindrick, he won't go.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:54.529
I called up my engineer and said what's going
on over there, girl?

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:57.440
He said, oh, they don't know what they want.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.020
He said they gave me some requirements.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.420
I designed them an RCS system for it.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.060
They gave me another set of requirements.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.170
I designed another RCS system.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.190
They gave me some different requirements.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.160
I designed them a different RCS system.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.640
And then they came out with another set of
requirements.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.940
I'm just going to wait until they decide what
they want and then I'll design them an RCS

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.740
system for it.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:28.209
Well, what he didn't understand was that's
the way you go about setting the requirements.

00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:29.760
You get a small group of people together.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.709
You set down a set of requirements.

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:36.670
You try to put a vehicle together and see
where it punches out.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.050
Usually weight, CG, something.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.420
So you change the requirements up a little
bit and you design another system.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.160
You do that very quickly and you look at where
that one punches out.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.440
And then you change your requirements again
and you look at those requirements and where

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.440
it punched out.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.780
The first requirements, where it punched out.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.220
You change the requirements a little bit and
see where it punches out.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.160
Very, very quickly you run through many configurations.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.740
That got the Shuttle started.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:15.660
After it got started we kept changing the
requirements as we went through the program.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:29.930
I would suggest that you understand your requirements
very, very clearly, and the impact of your

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.070
requirements very clearly.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:38.269
Things like fail op fail safe, or fail safe
fail safe fail op are very, very good buzz

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:40.690
words.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.880
But unless you really understand the impact
of those, they can actually make a system

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.220
less safe.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:58.920
I can make a very good case that a two engine
airplane is safer than a four engine airplane

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.570
simply by the way that you set your requirements.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:10.070
FAA has a requirement that an airplane has
to take off with one engine out.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:16.360
If you've got a two engine airplane then most
of the time you've got 100% more power than

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.380
you need.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.470
If you have a four engine airplane you only
have 25% more power than you need.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:28.300
Most airplane crashes are caused from lack
of power at the right time.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:37.900
If you've got the power when you need it then
you can get out of most bad situations.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:45.660
Our original requirements on the Shuttle,
after we got that started, was to keep the

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.899
operations cost low.

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:53.180
We wanted to keep the maintenance cost and
the operations cost low.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.800
We initially were looking at oxygen/hydrogen
systems.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:05.100
In fact, all of the early orbiters had the
hydrogen/oxygen onboard.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.360
In place of their payload, we had hydrogen
tanks and oxygen tanks in there and carried

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360
the hydrogen/oxygen onboard.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:17.610
And we actually looked at using the hydrogen
out of those tanks.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.860
You get it free to power the OMS and the RCS.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.380
And we looked at all kinds of ways of getting
the pressure up high enough to be able to

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.820
use the residuals to power the vehicle.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.550
One of the students asked the question the
other day and we didn't give a very good answer

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:42.311
that we did at one time look at putting the
hydrogen in the payload bay of the Shuttle.

00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:48.870
All of the very early configurations of the
Shuttle had the hydrogen and the oxygen in

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.930
the Shuttle in place of payload bay.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.120
That was the very early configuration.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:00.250
Later on, as DOD got involved and other people
wanted big spaces and carrying greyhound buses

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:05.029
up there and things like that we had to use
that space and that's when we came up with

00:14:05.029 --> 00:14:06.611
the external tank.

00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:10.089
And that's when we came up with a side-by-side
configuration on it.

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:13.660
That's the way I recall it.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.779
But we looked at oxygen/hydrogen.

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:28.029
Then we went to methane because we were looking
at bulk densities so that we had smaller tanks,

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:29.320
smaller volumes.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.930
Then we looked at oxygen/alcohol.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.490
And I really thought we had a good system
with oxygen/alcohol.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.449
I had a lot of confidence in that system.

00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:40.240
We used it on Redstone.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.399
My first job was working on Redstone.

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:44.200
I really liked alcohol.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.430
I thought we had developed a good ignition
system for the RCS so we didn't have to worry

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.949
about the thousand starts.

00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:56.910
But obviously that was going to cost us money
and cost a lot of development money.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:04.959
And, as time went on, we changed from having
low operational cost to low development cost.

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:13.580
And when we went to low development cost then
we went to bipropellant on the OMS and initially

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:19.839
to monopropellant on the RCS.

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:30.910
When I say bipropellant, what I mean are storables,
monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.420
Both are storable propellants.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:42.279
They are self-igniting so you don't have to
have an ignition system for it.

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:45.329
That simplifies the design a whole lot.

00:15:45.329 --> 00:15:52.490
We had a lot of experience with those propellants
on Titan II, on Agena and on Apollo, all of

00:15:52.490 --> 00:16:04.550
the Apollo stages used either aerozine 50
and nitrogen tetroxide or monomethyl hydrogen.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.690
So, we went to that.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:14.649
On the RCS, we initially went to hydrazine
as a monopropellant because it was the simplest

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:19.820
system, the cheapest system, but very quickly
the weight got out of hand and we had to go

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.630
to something that had a little bit more performance
than a hydrazine because all of that weight

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.990
was in the backend of the vehicle.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:31.899
And the backend of the vehicle was getting
too heavy.

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:39.171
If you only remember two things out of this
exercise and what I have to say today, two

00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:44.920
things I want you to remember is that it is
just not natural to think in terms of the

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:54.910
absence of gravity and it is not natural to
think in terms of the absence of pressure.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:17:00.130
When you think about it, you live in it around
here on the ground, it is so natural that

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:06.220
it's hard to think in terms of designing systems
and the impact that the absence of gravity

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:11.740
has or the absence of pressure has on the
design of the systems.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.539
The other thing I would like for you to remember
is that there is no substitute for a good

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:20.380
well thought out test program.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:29.840
Let me give you the OMS as an example.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:36.770
We did not have a vibration test program on
the propulsion systems, on the OMS or the

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:42.080
RCS in the program because, by that time,
we had good structural programs, we could

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:49.100
analyze the effect of vibration and stress
on the vehicle.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:59.480
But we had a good propulsion test program
and we built an OMS pod, just like the ones

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.710
we had on the vehicle for qualification.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.730
And when we got through with all the propulsion
tests on it, and we went through that program

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.960
in a breeze, we had no problems at all with
it, so we finished it early.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:20.080
We took that pod down to JSC, we put it in
a vibro-acoustic facility, and while we were

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:28.539
running the QVVT the low level vibration test
on that pod just to get the response of how

00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:35.200
things responded to everything, the helium
bottle fell out.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:40.570
Five minutes after that helium bottle fell
out every structural guy in the world could

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:47.000
tell you it should have fell out, it would
fall out, but nobody thought about it in advance.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.020
What happened, we had taken a high pressure
helium line coming out of the bottom of the

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:56.730
tank and going five feet or eight feet over
to the structure and bolting it to the structure

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.520
over there.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:04.560
Now, when you started shaking it, that was
acting as a torquing element on that tank

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.830
and torquing that tank this way.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:12.761
And the struts they had coming down holding
the tank, it was fatiguing where they were

00:19:12.761 --> 00:19:13.960
put onto the tank.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:19.380
It fatigued them right in there and broke
them off very quick, but we didn't pick it

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:25.520
up.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.370
The OMS was very, very straightforward from
a development standpoint.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.539
We came out with a platelet injector that
gave us very good combustion.

00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:36.690
You have to explain what a platelet injector
is.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.690
OK.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:46.630
A platelet injector is one where we used photographic
techniques to etch holes in the injector.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.490
You could get a very, very fine pattern.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:56.270
You made it in very thin sheets and you coated
the sheet with a coating where you could put

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.690
them in a press and heat them and glue them
together.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:07.240
You came up with an injector design that was
made out of many, many thousands of very thin

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.560
plates that set up the manifolding on it.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.090
Normal injectors you have to do a lot of very
integrated drilling.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:19.240
Normal injectors, you drill out a manifold
in the back, and then you take the face plate

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.180
and you have to drill holes in it.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.659
And the problem we get into when you start
doing that is with these very small drills

00:20:26.659 --> 00:20:29.429
they tend to walk or bend.

00:20:29.429 --> 00:20:31.490
And you don't get a straight hole.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.780
You don't get a good spray pattern.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.380
With a platelet injector we could get a very
close match.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:45.419
We could just kind of dribble a field in there
and oxidizer in there where it always matched

00:20:45.419 --> 00:20:46.419
real well.

00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:49.160
We got very high performance out of it.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:56.440
We're talking about the injector up here where
you have the fuel and oxygen, and then you

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:02.230
have to have a whole bunch of holes in a pattern
such that the fuel and the oxidizer are properly

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.450
mixed when they ignite inside.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:13.700
You need to get the oxidizer to impinge on
a fuel very precisely so that with an aero-storable

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:20.480
propellant, a hypergolic propellant as we
call it, that is self-igniting.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:27.059
And basically what you have is when the two
fuels come together it is like having a very

00:21:27.059 --> 00:21:29.960
strong acid and a very strong base coming
together.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.520
The first reaction that you get is a heating
reaction.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.600
That chemical reaction that you get will take
the propellant temperature up to 800, 1000,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.770
1200 degrees.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:45.780
Anyway, it gets it up to the combustion temperature
and then you start the combustion process.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.360
So you don't have to use any other ignition
source.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.950
All you do is bring those two propellants
together and you get that chemical reaction

00:21:52.950 --> 00:22:00.539
that provides the energy, the heat to heat
the propellant to the combustion temperature.

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:04.159
Like all high performance rocket engines,
we had a stability problem with the OMS.

00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:07.410
And we had to put big acoustic cavities.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:19.710
38% of the injector on the OMS was cavities
designed and sized to damp out the stability,

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.860
so we had a very good stable engine.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:27.620
The RCS, on the other hand, is a totally different
design.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:37.159
Now, we put the propellant tanks on the RCS
up in front of the OMS tanks for aerodynamic

00:22:37.159 --> 00:22:38.159
purposes.

00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:41.429
That gave us a 30 foot propellant line down
to the RCS.

00:22:41.429 --> 00:22:49.780
Then we would manifold three, four, five engines
on the end of that pipe that is pulsing in

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.289
and out of phase or steady state.

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:56.860
Some of them were running at 40 millisecond
or 80 millisecond pulses.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.740
Some of them might be running at four times
that on a pulse width.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.620
And some of them may be running at steady
state.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:09.350
Anyway, the dynamics, the pressure in that
line that the engine sees varies somewhere

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:15.080
between vapor pressure and about 1000 psi.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:23.220
And, since one propellant is 1.6 times the
density of the other propellant, when that

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.070
valve opens down there, that pressure wave
has got to go back up to the tank and come

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:34.860
back down to the injector before you get basically
any flow out of it.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.049
Just the compressibility that you have in
the pipe will come out.

00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:41.380
The pressure essentially drops to vapor pressure.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.080
And we use helium to pressurize those tanks.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.430
When we use helium to pressurize those tanks,
the helium is dissolved in the propellant.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.539
When it gets down to the engine it comes out
as solution.

00:23:52.539 --> 00:24:01.870
The engine has to be able to stay together
at any mixture ratio and almost any pressure.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:08.380
And you are looking at hundreds of thousands
of starts over the life of one of those programs

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.580
on one of those engines.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.660
And we talk about pulse width.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:21.669
Pulse width is the minimum ohm time that you
can have on a rocket engine.

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:28.020
Now, there is a volume between the face of
the valve and the face of the injector that

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.370
we call dribble volume.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:37.730
The larger that volume is the larger the pulse
width you need on it.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:45.250
You would like to have the seat of the valve
to be the face of the injector so you have

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.980
zero dribble volume in there.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:52.520
That way you would get closer to a square
wave pulse.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:59.980
And your friends in Guidance Control, they
always want to square away pulse.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:06.790
And they want it to have an infinite thrust
level and zero width so that you put an instantaneous

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:07.790
pulse.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.750
It makes it easier for them to calculate where
the vehicle is going to go than if you get

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:15.120
one that builds up kind of slow and goes down
kind of slow.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:27.279
The dribble volume, the volume that you have
between the valve seat and the injector phase

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:33.670
when the engine shuts down, when the valve
closes that flow stops and that amount of

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.340
propellant stays in there.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:40.910
Now, in a vacuum, when it gets down to the
vapor pressure starts boiling out and goes

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.110
out through the chamber.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:48.840
And you have a refrigeration effect from that
boiling of the propellant.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:26:00.090
If the pulse width is too short then the refrigeration
effect will overcome the heating effect from

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:05.140
that short pulse and you keep reducing the
temperature of the hardware.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:16.000
The colder the propellant gets the more heat
you have to put in the chemical reaction,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.520
when it first comes together, to get it to
ignite.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.980
You get an ignition delay in the thing and
then you start getting into hard starts if

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:23.980
it gets too cold.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:31.870
So, we set our pulse width on the Shuttle
at 40 milliseconds.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:40.799
That was the neutral point at which the refrigeration
effect equaled the heating effect from the

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.770
pulse, and so you would maintain the temperature.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.950
We later on went to 80 milliseconds on it
because we added the Veniers.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:52.100
That gave us a little bit of heat input.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.480
It's a pretty tough design in itself.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:03.210
The valve that we used for a 1000 pound rocket
on the Orbiter weighed less than the valves

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:08.080
that we used on the Apollo program for 100
pound thruster.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.799
And what we did is we went to a pilot operated
valve.

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:20.090
That was kind of my concept that I borrowed
from Sears Roebuck.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.730
If you ever take a washing machine apart on
a Sears Roebuck and you look at how the valve

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.700
is designed, it is a pilot operated valve.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.350
And they use the water pressure to open the
valve.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.309
Well, I thought that was good way to go.

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:37.169
You put a very small coil in there, a quick
acting coil and replace that rubber bellows

00:27:37.169 --> 00:27:42.940
that used on a Sears Roebuck washing machine
with a stainless steel diaphragm and you've

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.840
got it made.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.730
Well, unfortunately the water pressure in
a house doesn't vary as much as the water

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:55.990
hammer does on the Space Shuttle.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:28:00.460
So, before we got through with the design
of that valve, it got to be a very complex

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.460
valve.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.289
And it was a very expensive valve but it worked.

00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:13.230
Probably the other thing we ought to say about
designing any system that is going to work

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:19.659
with these hypergolic fuels, I mean they just
eat away at things like O ring seals.

00:28:19.659 --> 00:28:22.390
I mean it's just nasty stuff.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:27.270
And so, in addition to the mechanical problems
that Henry is talking about, you've got all

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.290
the materials problems which just makes your
life harder.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:40.250
We really wanted to stay away from hypergols,
from the very strong acids and the very strong

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:45.179
bases for the simple reason that there are
very few materials that are compatible with

00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:46.179
them.

00:28:46.179 --> 00:28:53.260
As a matter of fact, the main reason we went
to a hydrazine RCS in the beginning was to

00:28:53.260 --> 00:29:02.480
avoid having an expulsion system in the oxidizer
because we had no material available that

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.789
you could put in there as a diaphragm to push
the propellants out that was compatible with

00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:12.570
N2O4 that you could make cycles with.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.940
We could have used metal bellows, but they
weren't very reliable.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.130
They were extremely heavy.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.999
And so we had to come up with a better system
than that.

00:29:22.999 --> 00:29:27.100
And then we kind of got to looking into putting
in screens in the system.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.539
And that was really a hard sell.

00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:32.110
I mean I spent lots of time with Aaron.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:39.630
I was convinced that system would work because
if you look at an automobile gas tank, every

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:42.630
fuel tank on every automobile has got a sock
in it.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:52.010
That sock is about an inch and a half in diameter,
and it will suck every drop of fuel out of

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.010
that gas tank.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:59.510
They putit in a little sump in there, and
it will just draw that tank dry before it

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.169
will break down and let air go through it.

00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:05.890
I was convinced that we could build one of
those systems and make it work.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.529
But if you look at an automobile, you know
it goes over rough roads, it bounces, you've

00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:15.409
got G fields, you've got all kinds of forces
on that thing, and yet it works very good.

00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:20.409
The problem we had in trying to sell that
concept to the program, though, was how do

00:30:20.409 --> 00:30:22.250
you prove it?

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:27.330
The only technique we had to prove it was
through analysis.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:35.049
And you're trying to prove that something
like that will work purely from analysis.

00:30:35.049 --> 00:30:39.070
And qualified by analysis was a hard, hard
sell.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:44.140
We, later on in a program, came up with techniques
where we could wrap tape around most of the

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.510
screens in there so that we close up most
of the area.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:53.390
And so we would draw a propellant in, in very
small areas with aerospaces on top and prove

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:59.130
that you could get down to a certain delta
P and cross it before it would break down

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.990
to qualify our analysis.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:07.010
We still were not satisfied with that so we
made up a system with a glass tank, we put

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:14.169
it on our vomit comet and flew it.

00:31:14.169 --> 00:31:17.070
And that was the only time where I ever road
that thing.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:22.410
If we had made one more time it would have
been all over for me.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:27.039
[LAUGHTER] But you get up 38,000 feet and
you make a dive on that thing.

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:36.740
And you can maintain zero G in it through
that 30 second or 38 second period of time.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:42.650
And by expelling the right amount at the right
levels we could prove that it would work.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:46.360
And it has worked very, very well on all the
flights.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:54.860
In the future design of the spacecraft, what
is going to be the difference in the RCS system?

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.289
Because every system is going to have to have
some kind of reaction control system.

00:31:58.289 --> 00:32:02.340
What do you think they are going to go with
in the future systems?

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:10.580
I really believe that we ought to go with
either methane and LOX or alcohol and LOX.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:13.070
I think it's a much cleaner system.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:17.159
We developed that little piece of electric
igniter for the Shuttle Program.

00:32:17.159 --> 00:32:20.020
We never used it after we went away from those
systems.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.870
But you buy these little latch torches now
that you push a button and pull a trigger

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.200
on it.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:34.169
And they light off most of the time, although
the last one I got didn't light too well.

00:32:34.169 --> 00:32:38.300
But we have good, reliable ignition systems
now.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:47.600
And I think that you can design a system now
that has the reliability that you need for

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.809
a space system.

00:32:48.809 --> 00:32:56.250
Otherwise, we've done nothing in this country
since the Shuttle Program on developing [OVERLAPPING

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.490
VOICES].

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:07.390
The things you have got to remember is that
the thermal characteristics are very, very

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:13.760
different in a vacuum than it is on earth.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.470
It is very different in the absence of gravity.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.470
You wouldn't think gravity would make any
difference in it but it does.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.029
You've got some fluid in the tank.

00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:25.840
You put some heat on the bottom of the tank.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.840
Where does heat go?

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.840
It goes to the top of the tank.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.710
The top of the tank is always the hottest
part.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:34.010
When you've got a liquid in one G, you put
it in zero G, you put heat on the bottom of

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.960
the tank, a bubble forms down there, it pushes
the liquid away from it and nothing comes

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.270
out of the tank.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.090
Let me have some questions.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:50.940
I'm slightly confused on the fuel that the
system uses.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:56.580
Both RCS and the OMS use hydrazine or hypergolic?

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.900
I'm confused.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.830
Hydrazine is N2H4.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:04.820
We use that as a monopropellant.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.480
A bipropellant earth storable.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.770
A monopropellant system you normally run it
over a catalytic bed and it decomposes.

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:15.770
Yes.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:19.210
There are two monopropellants out there that
work very good.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.700
One is hydrogen peroxide.

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:26.600
And if you can get it above 90% it gets a
little more stable.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.980
And the other one is hydrazine.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.480
Both of those you run through a catalyst.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.179
When it hits a catalyst you get the reaction
out of it and it breaks down.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:48.639
The hydrogen peroxide breaks down to steam
and oxygen, and hydrazine breaks down to hydrogen

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:57.630
and ammonia, NH3.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:02.090
But both of those give you hot gases then
for propulsion.

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:07.480
You mix that with an acid and you get combustion.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.030
And we used aerozine 50 which I mentioned.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:18.589
Aerozine 50 was 50% hydrazine and 50% unsymmetrical
dimethylhydrazine.

00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:22.710
Monomethylhydrazine is just that, monomethylhydrazine.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:28.310
It is a lot more stable than is hydrazine.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:33.190
It has a wider freezing /boiling point than
hydrazine.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:39.450
Hydrazine has a lot of the characteristics
of water as far as density, freezing and boiling.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:44.000
It will freeze at about the same temperature
as water, it will boil at about the same temperature

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.420
as water and it has almost the same density
as water.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:54.060
Monomethylhydrazine has a little bit slightly
less density, it gives you a slightly better

00:35:54.060 --> 00:36:00.720
performance but it freezes at like minus 63
degrees or something like that.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.750
Monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.690
The same thing for the OMS.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:17.400
Now, one of the things we do is we put about
four-tenths of a percent of nitric oxide in

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.500
the nitrogen tetroxide to keep the tanks from
breaking.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.170
We have titanium tanks.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:28.910
And on the Apollo Program we got into a very
serious problem because a tank started exploding.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:37.130
It turned out with aerozine 50 or monopropellant
hydrazine, we had a little bit of water in

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:40.500
there and that gave off a little bit of free
hydrogen.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:45.020
And that free hydrogen, titanium just does
not like hydrogen.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:49.040
How many people have taken fraction mechanics?

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.810
Well, fraction mechanics really started from
that.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.520
That's when we started working with a gentleman
called Dr.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.550
Tiffany at Boeing.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:59.620
We worked with the whole world on that problem.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.140
That's how fraction mechanics really got started.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.560
You were going to ask something.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:10.630
While we're talking about fractions, one of
the other problems of dealing with these hypergolic

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.520
fuels is the freezing problem.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.560
Maybe we will talk a little bit about that.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:23.170
Because, unlike water, when the hydrazine
freezes it shrinks.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:29.000
And so if you imagine that you've got hydrazine
liquid in a line under pressure and now it

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.540
gets too cold so it freezes.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:36.140
And now that leaves a little bit of free volume
so you get more liquid that comes in there

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.240
and that will freeze.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:42.589
Until finally the entire line is clogged up
with solid hydrazine.

00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:47.220
Now, when it warms up it expands and you crack
the line.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.170
And now you've got a hypergolic leak which
is really bad news.

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:58.800
So, in fact, maintaining thermal control of
the OMS and RCS propellant lines becomes a

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.800
very critical issue.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.940
And there are heating coils all over the place
and thermostats.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:15.270
And so, again, you don't just have a propulsion
system in the systems engineering that we

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.510
talked about.

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:27.760
It affects the thermal, the electrical system,
because all these things are inner-related.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:34.900
If you lose an electrical system so that you
cannot run the heaters then you run the risk

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.089
of losing your propellant system.

00:38:37.089 --> 00:38:39.700
And so then you have to have redundant heaters
and so on.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.950
And it gets more and more complicated.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:47.360
That was a major, major problem we had on
Apollo 13.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.840
We didn't have enough power.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.860
We had to turn everything off quick.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:58.450
And trying to get those people to let that
temperature go down out of limits was not

00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.450
easy.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:04.520
And I remember sitting down and spending an
entire night running out the thermal calculations

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:10.610
and calculating out when we could turn the
heaters off or we could keep the service module

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:16.220
off of that vehicle and not freeze the propellant
and the RCS on the command module.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.079
And then I got really, really worried.

00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:22.599
I gave myself four degrees above freezing
on that system, and I missed it two degrees.

00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:26.770
It got two degrees colder than we had planned.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:32.390
The design of the RCS system was very, very
complicated.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:39.430
How many RCS specialists do we have on the
Shuttle, 40?

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:43.850
Thirty-eight primary and four Vernier.

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:47.369
And so it's a very complicated system in designing
it.

00:39:47.369 --> 00:39:49.640
It had a lot of requirements placed on it.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:55.190
On the other hand, the OMS engine, as I recall,
we have never had a failure on the OMS engine.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.540
The OMS engine has been very, very successful.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:01.390
It is a very straightforward program.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:07.579
By getting the combustion close to the injector
on the OMS then we could make the chamber

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:09.920
small on the OMS.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:15.970
And, by making the chamber very small on the
OMS, then you could cool it.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:21.160
You could put cooling channels down the chamber
and run the fuel down there and keep the chamber

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.810
cool so it wouldn't burn out.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:28.119
Now, we also did the same thing on the RCS
a little bit different.

00:40:28.119 --> 00:40:30.599
The RCS is a buried installation.

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:37.369
We have to run that engine for 500 seconds
or more if we want to use it for de-orbit

00:40:37.369 --> 00:40:40.180
in case the OMS plays out sometimes.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:45.040
That engine has to stay together on these
very, very short burns.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:52.800
It also has to stay together on these very,
very long burns with fluctuating inlet pressures

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.950
and fluctuating mixture ratios.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:41:03.109
We found that if we make a very, very short
chamber -- And that's why when you look at

00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:07.460
the RCS it is a big chamber, it is very short.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:13.960
We could put enough fuel down the walls of
that chamber to effectively cool the chamber

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:19.730
so it would only go up steady states to a
certain safe temperature and still have good

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.180
performance out of it.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.030
So, we put a lot of fuel down the walls on
it.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:34.410
Looking in this direction, if this is the
injector plate, the holes around the outer

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:37.339
most layer, those are all fuel.

00:41:37.339 --> 00:41:44.250
So, you basically get a fuel bath coming along
that actually comes in contact.

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:51.520
And if you have a fuel-rich mixture, the same
as in a car, the fuel mixture burns cooler.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:56.500
The thing that you're really afraid of, in
fact, you have to deal with a lot of contingencies

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:03.920
on this system, what happens if you get a
clog in one of your feed lines?

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:12.260
The worst situation you can get in is that
you get a clog in your fuel inlet line, and

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:16.030
that gives you an oxidizer-rich mixture which
burns hot.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:20.079
And you can then actually get a melt through.

00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:24.130
And so you've got to shut your engine down
in a hurry if that happens.

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:28.100
These are very, very small orifices, and a
lot of them around the outside of it.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:35.560
And if you get a couple of these orifices
plugged then that becomes a hot spot on the

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.829
side of the chamber.

00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:39.790
And we used columbium, which has very poor
heat transfer.

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:45.359
We used molybdenum on Apollo which has good
heat transfer.

00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:54.990
To return to your point about the possibility
of using the RCS as a backup for reentry,

00:42:54.990 --> 00:43:02.990
what prevents one from using a series of relatively
short burns [carried on the mass?] of the

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.630
Orbiter to smooth out the velocity chain?

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:15.450
Why do you have to have a single file of second
burn?

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:21.980
Before you start to burn, to come back in,
how much time you can put in between those

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:29.180
and how short, a 1,000 pound thruster for
deorbit takes a fairly long burn.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:38.930
And the engine goes to steady state fairly
quick, you know, in a matter of 20 seconds.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:47.250
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] We ran RCS engines
for the Shuttle up to an hour and a half on

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.250
a single burn.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:44:02.630
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] Even though you put
it in multiple burns you still have to have

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.390
fairly long pulse widths on each one of them.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.600
And that impacts the guidance very, very badly.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:14.610
Let me help with a little orbital mechanics.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:25.100
We talked about this before.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:31.390
You're in orbit.

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:47.089
When you do a burn, you can do a retrograde
burn which lowers the other side of your orbit

00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:50.910
so that now becomes the perigee.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:56.869
The thing is, from orbital mechanics, the
most efficient way to do a burn is to have,

00:44:56.869 --> 00:45:02.810
like Henry said, an infinite thrust with a
zero pulse width.

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:05.270
You do what they call an impulsive burn.

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:09.260
But, in the real world, that never happens.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:14.160
Now, it is 45 minutes from here to here, it's
a 90 minute orbit.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:22.500
Now, when you have two OMS engines, a typical
deorbit burn lasts two to two and a half minutes.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.819
You're burning over this segment.

00:45:25.819 --> 00:45:28.550
It's pretty close to an impulsive burn.

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:32.020
You lose one OMS engine and now you have to
double it.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.960
Now you're up to a five minute burn.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:39.210
But, if you lose your second OMS engine and
now you have to do an RCS deorbit, now you're

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.740
getting into a 10, 15 minute burn.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:46.780
And so you're actually really far away from
optimum.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.600
And the burn gets much less efficient.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:56.410
And so if you have plenty of propellant you're
fine, but if you're low on propellant you

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:58.800
need to worry about the efficiency of your
burn.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.860
If you were to do a little bit of a burn and
then shut it down to let your engines cool

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:07.569
off and then you try to complete the burn
around here, now it has gotten really, really

00:46:07.569 --> 00:46:15.210
inefficient and you might run out of propellant.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:23.010
We spent an enormous amount of time with our
orbital mechanics people and our guidance

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:28.000
people trying to get the OMS strut down as
low as we could get it.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.839
Because the lower you can get it the smaller
the hardware, the lighter the weight of the

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:36.810
hardware and the performance is essentially
the same.

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:43.349
The ISP for a 3,000 pound engine is essentially
the same as it is for a 20,000 or maybe even

00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:47.900
a little bit higher for 3,000.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.310
We had 5,000 pound thrust in there.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.410
We had 4,000 pound thrust in there.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.340
I think we finally wound up with 3,500.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:47:01.830
Been left up to me, I think we could have
done it with a 1,500 pound thrust engine.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:05.800
But we compromised.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:06.800
Yes.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:15.010
Professor Cohen once mentioned that some people
suggested putting some RCS thrusters on the

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:22.650
edge of the wing tips, but that would be very
difficult after the design was finalized.

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:29.700
All of our early configurations that we had,
we had the RCS pods out on the wing tips.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:33.430
It made the RCS very efficient.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:40.510
Our RCS was the OMS at one time, and we had
it all out on the wing tips.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:44.510
It didn't make our structures friends too
happy at first because that puts a lot of

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:49.300
mass out into the wings and they didn't like
it too much, but after they got looking at

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:54.400
it that turned out that really wasn't much
of a driver.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.040
It made the RCS very efficient.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:04.110
The thing that kind of changed that is when
we put the big payload bay on the inside of

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:08.440
the vehicle and then we had to put a big OMS
pod on there.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:16.280
And then to put the RCS pods out on a wing
tip of a delta system out there just didn't

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.840
weigh out good.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:24.190
It was more efficient from a weight standpoint
to put the OMS and RCS together because we

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:26.150
actually had those two interconnected.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:30.540
If we have to do an OMS burn with the RCS,
we can take the propellant out of the OMS

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.590
tank to feed the RCS.

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:40.260
And so it just made a more efficient system
to bring it all in.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.720
We had another requirement.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:49.420
When we went to the acid-based propellants,
we had a requirement that we had to have removable

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.420
pods.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:55.170
You had to be able to take the propulsion
system off of the orbiter and take it over

00:48:55.170 --> 00:49:00.569
to another facility to rework it because we
knew we were going to have a lot of work and

00:49:00.569 --> 00:49:09.690
rework on those systems, at least early on.

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:10.829
You had a question right here.

00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:20.310
To what extent can you change orbits due to
a higher or lower orbit [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:30.710
That is very limited, but we do have the capability
to go up and down in orbit.

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:32.210
I don't know, maybe 50 miles.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:33.210
I don't know.

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:34.210
I don't have a good answer.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.210
I don't remember that.

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:36.589
That has been too long ago.

00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:45.500
With a full load you have a few hundred feet
per second, I would have to go and look up,

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:47.080
you cannot make the plane change.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.450
No, plane changes are out.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:50:01.910
But we certainly have gone from, let's see,
like 180 nautical mile orbits down to a 105

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:02.910
mile.

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:06.540
I remember one flight where we did that.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:13.850
To go up, you know, what you really want to
do is, of course, use your main propulsion

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:17.260
system to get into the right orbit that you
want to go to.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.910
Then, if you're going to do a rendezvous,
you have to change the height a little bit.

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:28.730
But you typically try to get orbit insertion
within about 20 nautical miles, so about 40

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:35.170
kilometers radius of your ultimate intended
orbit.

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:42.940
For some special missions, like I was on one
mission where we were up at about 180 nautical

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:49.170
miles doing various operations, but then the
last couple of days they wanted to look at

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:55.390
the interaction of the Orbiter with the atomic
oxygen and nitrogen which causes this orbiter

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:59.170
glow phenomena, which maybe some of you have
heard about.

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:05.370
We had to go down to about 105 nautical miles,
which is about as low as you can go and stay

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:09.069
in orbit for more than a day or so.

00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:15.530
And so, yeah, that was OK because that was
just you're doing part of your deorbit burn

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:17.170
but then you stop.

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:21.891
What you wouldn't want to do is go to a 105
mile orbit and then go up, and then you would

00:51:21.891 --> 00:51:23.180
have to come all the way down again.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:27.910
I think we will take one more question and
go to break.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:33.920
It is awfully easy to decrease the orbit because
you're using part of the energy that you have

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.559
to use to come back home anyway.

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:38.020
When you start trying to go up is when you're
adding.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.329
But we have a lot of contingency propellant
onboard.

00:51:40.329 --> 00:51:44.910
We've got contingent propellant in case the
main engines shut off early.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:46.790
Then you have to use the RCS.

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:52.069
If you've got a docking mission we've got
propellant in there for three or four attempts

00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:55.330
at docking and things like that.

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:59.690
There is extra propellant that you can use
to give you a little bit of a boost.

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:01.720
You had a question here.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:22.119
Going back to the comment that was made about
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] and presenting

00:52:22.119 --> 00:52:24.090
a hazard that way, what kind of feedback did
the crew have when something like that was

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:25.090
happening?

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:26.090
Were there sensors in that system [UNINTELLIGIBLE
PHRASE]?

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:27.090
I don't hear too well.

00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:30.460
The question is what sort of sensors do we
have for the operation of the engines?

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.180
There are pressure sensors.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.230
There are temperature sensors.

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:41.410
Again, remember when we were talking earlier,
though, sensors don't always tell the truth.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:43.119
Sometimes you can get sensor failures.

00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:46.220
And so we spent a lot of time practicing.

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:49.490
And you work out all the different scenarios.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:52.030
This is what you will see if you have a real
failure.

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:54.720
This is what you will see if you have a sensor
failure.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:53:00.800
And, before you shut down a good working engine,
you would like to confirm the fact that it

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.190
is really an engine problem, not a sensor
problem.

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:10.510
On the other hand, you don't want to take
a chance that you're going to get into an

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:15.190
oxidizer-rich situation and blow up your engine.

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:23.890
You practice and after a while get pretty
good at diagnosing the problems fairly quickly.

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:32.240
The computer doesn't normally shut down the
OMS engine on its own.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.590
The computer will not shut down any of the
propulsion systems on its own.

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:41.280
It will shut down the main engine, but none
of these will it shut down on its own.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.390
Somebody has got to take some action to shut
it down.

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:49.569
We get an awful lot of data on the ground,
too, that you don't have in the cockpit that

00:53:49.569 --> 00:53:54.790
you can look at different instruments and
backup things and try to understand where

00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:57.119
there is a sensor failure.

00:53:57.119 --> 00:54:00.589
Any other questions on OMS/RCS?

00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:09.460
During entry, when you're coming down using
the RCS for like trajectory guidance before

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:15.300
your aerosurfaces are usable, how much propellant
would you typically use?

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:17.420
Is there like a certain percentage that would
be average?

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.599
That's a pretty low percentage, and I don't
recall.

00:54:19.599 --> 00:54:23.220
That has been a long time now, and I don't
recall the numbers.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:26.020
But I would say it's less than 10% of the
propellant.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.089
What did you say?

00:54:27.089 --> 00:54:28.089
About 10%.

00:54:28.089 --> 00:54:34.640
Well, at least that ought to be a pretty good
number.

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:40.760
[LAUGHTER] It's not a lot of propellant come
back in on it.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.330
The vehicle is a fairly stable vehicle.

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:48.360
Now, on Columbia, I guess they either ran
out of propellant or just about ran out of

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.970
propellant on it trying to hold it.

00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:56.670
RCS was doing all it could to try to hold
that vehicle on course after it started picking

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:59.130
up drag on one side.

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:08.810
And we actually did have procedures in place
for what we called a no RCS entry if you had

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:10.849
run out of propellant entirely.

00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:17.049
I don't know if it would have worked.

00:55:17.049 --> 00:55:24.670
You tried to get it into a stable aerodynamic
situation as possible and just hold it there.

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:30.520
I never had to actually do it.

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.400
Anymore OMS/RCS questions?

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:39.069
Otherwise, why don't we take a little break
and then we will come back for APU/hydraulics.

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:45.640
Two minute break.

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:52.220
Thank you all.

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.599
Appreciate it.

00:55:56.599 --> 00:56:03.170
You're not finished.

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:05.369
APU/hydraulics.

00:56:05.369 --> 00:56:11.830
And I guess I need to point out some acronyms.

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:16.559
Calling the APU an APU was the biggest mistake
we ever made.

00:56:16.559 --> 00:56:23.299
That gave me more grief than any other system
that I had to deal with, the acronym.

00:56:23.299 --> 00:56:27.230
APU stands for auxiliary power unit.

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:31.790
And the Aerospace Safety Advisory Committee
-- I will tell you, Henry, my kids growing

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:34.360
up used to think it was a three letter bad
word.

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.700
I mean they thought APU was a bad word.

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:40.490
[LAUGHTER] Because every time I got a call
there was something wrong with it.

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:49.460
If we would have called it primary power unit
then we would have had a lot less grief in

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:54.839
trying to defend it to the outside world.

00:56:54.839 --> 00:57:02.950
APU/hydraulics, like the OMS and RCS, all
of our first activity was directed toward

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:08.690
keeping the operational cost down low, keeping
the maintenance cost down low.

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:17.160
And we looked at those kinds of systems that
gave you clean propellants, easy propellants

00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:27.780
to deal with and you didn't have to worry
about the strong bases and strong acids to

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:31.799
work with.

00:57:31.799 --> 00:57:38.750
Later on, as time went on, we got more into
looking at what we could do cheap from a development

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:48.740
standpoint and let the operational cost float,
because it is obvious that the money was not

00:57:48.740 --> 00:58:01.280
going to be there to put into a big development
program.

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:13.000
The control of the vehicle in the atmosphere
was a major, major activity to try to find

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.000
out what you could get by with versus what
you would like to have.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:26.340
You try to move these huge barn doors fast
and a whole lot, there are huge forces on

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:27.340
those things.

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:32.700
It takes lots and lots of power to move them
and move them quick.

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:37.670
And our aero people and our guidance people
would like to have, like we were talking a

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:41.049
while ago, an instantaneous impulse into that
vehicle.

00:58:41.049 --> 00:58:44.560
When it starts to drift a little bit and they
want to move it some other way they like to

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.740
put an impulse in there and just kick it right
back where it is supposed to be instantly.

00:58:48.740 --> 00:59:01.380
But that becomes impractical when you look
at these kinds of systems.

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:04.020
We started out with dual tandem actuators.

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:11.640
Now, dual tandem actuators is something that
fail op fail safe criteria.

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:16.930
In other words, you had two pistons and one
actuator driven by two different hydraulic

00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:20.420
systems and you would move them together.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:25.230
When you start looking at all of the failure
modes associated with dual tandem actuators,

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:31.630
even though it meets the fail op fail safe
criteria that makes the safety people happy

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:38.430
and the people that are looking at the buzz
words, it actually was making the system less

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:39.430
safe.

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:45.020
Was that because you had a single passenger
[using up?] all the hydraulic fluid?

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:46.020
No.

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:50.240
What happened in a dual tandem actuator, in
order to get them to work well, if you busted

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.369
an actuator then that became a big sponge?

00:59:53.369 --> 00:59:59.270
You didn't have any way to take that space
out.

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:06.780
Trying to have that actuator work when the
other half went out made it very, very difficult,

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:11.869
from a design standpoint, to come up with
a system that you could lock it in place.

01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:18.549
And we even had designs where if one hydraulic
system failed that that shaft would actually

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:20.290
lock itself.

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.300
With the absence of pressure it would lock
itself.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:27.500
Well, that becomes a failure in itself because
if that mechanism fails then you've got a

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.030
locked actuator.

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:34.450
One thing you cannot stand on an aeroplane
is for an actuator not to move.

01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:37.299
We were finally able to convince the people.

01:00:37.299 --> 01:00:44.050
And Aaron was having lots and lots problems
about that time because all of the weight

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:45.500
was in the backend of the vehicle.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:50.299
The dual tandem actuators were extremely heavy
and the backend of the vehicle was getting

01:00:50.299 --> 01:00:54.589
too heavy, so we actually went to a single
actuator.

01:00:54.589 --> 01:01:00.569
And we put switching valves in there where
we could switch any one of the four APU systems

01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:04.600
into that actuator.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:12.329
And we had four APUs at that time.

01:01:12.329 --> 01:01:18.320
Weight was still a problem so we were able
to convince the community that we could live

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:26.110
with three APUs and have one APU fail and
come home normal mode with two.

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:32.430
And if you had two failures you could still
land the vehicle with one actuator.

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:38.460
You lost a whole bunch of systems but you
could still land it with one APU.

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:44.109
And we almost did that one time, because if
someone would have told me that we would ever

01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:52.320
have two failures of the same type on the
same flight of the nature that we had I would

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.609
have never believed it.

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:57.740
But we came home on one flight with two APUs
burning.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.190
We had a fire in both of the APUs.

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:06.040
And the reason for that, after the fact again,
is very, very simple.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.300
We went through a very good quality program.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:16.289
We did everything that we needed to on those
things only to find out that we had not planned

01:02:16.289 --> 01:02:23.260
on landing the vehicle in California and piggy
backing it back down to the Cape over and

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.650
over again.

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:30.880
What happens when you do that is that you
land the vehicle, there is a little bit of

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:36.010
residual APU hydrazine in those tubes between
the valves and the injector.

01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:39.590
You go back up into a vacuum or low pressure.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.099
All the air goes out of the system.

01:02:41.099 --> 01:02:43.539
And then we come and land in Florida.

01:02:43.539 --> 01:02:44.690
It is always humid in Florida.

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:46.609
There is a lot of moisture there.

01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:52.010
And as that moist air started feeding back
in the engine, it went up past the [cat?]

01:02:52.010 --> 01:03:00.799
bed and got in those tubes between the valve
and the injector and set up a very, very corrosive

01:03:00.799 --> 01:03:08.869
environment of residual hydrazine and water.

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:10.809
And that gave off free hydrogen.

01:03:10.809 --> 01:03:14.440
And you had hydrogen or intergranular corrosion
in those tubes.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:21.560
And we had two of them break on the same flight,
but it worked.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:31.720
We spent an awful lot of time looking at power
sources to power the hydraulic systems.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:37.260
And we even looked at going with all electrical
systems.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:43.170
DOD had some very good fuel cells out there
that had a lot of promise.

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:50.570
It put an awful lot of power at that time.

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:53.910
Let me just digress a little bit and talk
about shuttle fuel cells.

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:57.140
I don't think anybody can cover that.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:59.230
On Gemini the fuel cells never did work.

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:06.820
We always came back with half voltage or partial
voltage and most of the fuel cells out.

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:14.829
On Apollo, it only took 14 PhDs to start them
and shut them down.

01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:18.500
And then you couldn't start them again.

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:27.821
On the Space Shuttle, those fuel cells, it
is just a very, very good battery with the

01:04:27.821 --> 01:04:32.309
chemicals stored external to the battery.

01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:35.559
They would make an outstanding DC welder.

01:04:35.559 --> 01:04:39.390
I mean you could put electrodes in that thing
and put an electrical rod in there and strike

01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:43.630
and arc and weld with them and break the arc,
strike and arc and weld and break the arc.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.839
And they just do it repeatedly.

01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:51.930
You can throw a switch, they are on, you throw
a switch and they are off.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:53.920
And so they are very, very simple.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:59.039
I really, really wanted us to go with an all
electrical system using electrical motors

01:04:59.039 --> 01:05:08.950
and power hinges and electrical mechanical
actuators to drive the systems because I was

01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:13.930
absolutely convinced that one of these days
we were going to have a leak in the hydraulic

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:14.930
system.

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:24.210
And when we have a leak in the hydraulic system
we are going to have a fire.

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:25.920
All airplanes have hydraulic leaks.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.060
Now, you don't have to worry too much about
hydraulic leaks on an airplane.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:35.049
You have enough pressure where you seldom
have to worry about a fire.

01:05:35.049 --> 01:05:44.799
We went from 5606 hydraulic fluid to 83282
hydraulic fluid simply because it was advertised

01:05:44.799 --> 01:05:46.190
as being more flame-resistant.

01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:52.020
It is really not more flame-resistant.

01:05:52.020 --> 01:06:01.619
The 83282 hydraulic fluid has a much, much
lower vapor pressure than does 5606.

01:06:01.619 --> 01:06:05.490
And a way that they test it is they have got
a Bunsen burner out here.

01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:09.700
They take a pipe cleaner and dip it in the
fluid, clamp it in this device that rotates

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:15.370
past that Bunsen burner and they count the
number of times it will go across it before

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:17.140
the fire starts.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:23.210
Well, with 5606, it will usually start on
a third burn.

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:32.290
With 83282 it takes 10, 11, 12 passes before
it will ignite and start burning simply because

01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:38.670
it has a lower vapor pressure and you cannot
burn any liquid in a liquid stage.

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:42.950
You have to get it warm enough so that it
will gasify.

01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:47.530
And then you have to heat it enough in a gas
phase to get it up to the combustion temperature

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:50.160
or put a spark in it after it is in the gas
phase.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.819
But it won't ignite as a liquid.

01:06:52.819 --> 01:06:59.440
Well, with 6506, if you have a leak in the
hydraulic system going uphill you probably

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.872
don't have to worry about it coming home because
it's gone.

01:07:01.872 --> 01:07:06.440
It all boils off and is gone.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:12.510
With 83282 all it does is soak out into the
structure and in the insulation and all over

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:13.510
the place.

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:17.260
And then when you come back home, if it gets
in a hot spot and you start heating it up,

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:23.380
it forms a gas and you're going to get an
explosion in the back of the vehicle.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.890
So, that was a bad decision, Aaron.

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:35.650
We went in a bad direction, but it gave everybody
a warm feeling.

01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:46.820
We would have went with an electric mechanical
system but, by that time, we had a lot of

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.510
hydraulic people working on the program.

01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:53.760
And we would lay those people all off and
we had our whole bunch of electrical mechanical

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:57.800
people, and a lot of people were concerned
about the immaturity of those systems.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:02.119
And again it boiled down to development cost.

01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:04.920
Did we really have the energy source that
could handle that?

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:09.750
Oh, I'm convinced that we could have put six
or eight of those fuel cells that we've got

01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:15.099
on there right now and could have handled
it.

01:08:15.099 --> 01:08:19.450
Broke it down.

01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:27.949
And the fuel cells that DOD had under development
at that time were very, very good fuel cells.

01:08:27.949 --> 01:08:33.150
If I was upgrading the shuttle today that
is one of the things that I absolutely would

01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:34.150
go to.

01:08:34.150 --> 01:08:37.850
I would go to something to get rid of the
hydraulic fluid.

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:48.750
It creates a lot of other kinds of problems
that you have to deal with.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:54.330
Actually, before the decision was made that
the shuttle was going to be retired in five

01:08:54.330 --> 01:09:00.679
years, NASA was working on upgrades if we
were going to fly the shuttle for another

01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:02.679
20 or 25 years.

01:09:02.679 --> 01:09:08.501
And one of the upgrades, which actually got
to a fairly advanced stage in the design,

01:09:08.501 --> 01:09:10.460
was just what you were saying.

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:18.250
Get rid of the APU/hydraulics, use the latest
technology now available for electromechanical

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:19.250
actuators.

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:24.420
But the problem, I don't know the details
of it, but the costs just kept going up and

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:25.420
up and up.

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:30.640
And by the time it went up above about $300
million they just said we cannot afford to

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.259
do this.

01:09:32.259 --> 01:09:40.030
The problem we always had in trying to upgrade
the propulsion, we could have gone to an alcohol/LOX

01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:42.080
space RCS/OMS on it.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:48.210
We could have upgraded to an electromechanical
system, but it seemed to me like that the

01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:54.250
displays and those kinds of upgrades took
a lot of computers.

01:09:54.250 --> 01:10:11.280
Those systems took a lot of priority in where
the monies went in trying to upgrade the Orbiter.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:19.090
We did go from four to three systems.

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:30.231
We did go from 4 APUs to 3 APUs and still
having the ability to land the vehicle with

01:10:30.231 --> 01:10:33.570
one APU.

01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:35.860
We look at hydrogen/oxygen APUs.

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:40.160
We looked at bipropellant APUs.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.550
We looked at monopropellant APUs.

01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:49.570
We looked at pulse modulated versus pressure
modulated.

01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:54.460
If you don't know what I mean by that, pulse
modulated is when you have a valve that goes

01:10:54.460 --> 01:11:01.420
open and closed and you get steady state pressure
in your gas generator while it is on.

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:06.090
Pressure modulated you have a throttle valve
where you throttle the flow down going to

01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:12.610
the gas generator to give you just the power
that you need for the load that you are trying

01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:15.520
to pull at the time.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:24.929
And that was the easiest system to come up
with simply because we did not know at the

01:11:24.929 --> 01:11:32.150
time if we could build a valve that was capable
of millions and millions of cycles and not

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:34.080
a leak.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.540
But the problem with a pressure modulated
system was that most of the time you're operating

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.730
at very, very low power levels.

01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:47.470
The power just peaks up every once in a while
to high power levels.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:53.420
But when you're running very low pressures
in a gas turbine, the turbine becomes less

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.920
efficient.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:02.300
And the less efficient the turbine becomes
the more propellant you have to burn and,

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.800
again, the weight goes up.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:12.719
So we kind of bit the bullet on that and went
to a pressure modulated system where we varied

01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:15.570
the ohm time.

01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:18.650
In valve development we were very successful.

01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:27.530
We had very little trouble getting a valve
that would work, except for contamination.

01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:29.310
We always had a little contamination.

01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:32.900
We had a lot of problems down the Cape with
early valves leaking.

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:38.219
We finally put good filters in the system
and that eliminated that.

01:12:38.219 --> 01:12:39.219
Yes.

01:12:39.219 --> 01:12:46.850
Was the reason to go from four to three APUs
just a weight issue?

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:50.409
It's again a weight issue.

01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:54.120
All of that weight was in the back of the
vehicle, and the back of the vehicle was always

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.560
too heavy.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.090
And every time we could take a pound out of
the back of the vehicle, we could take a pound

01:12:59.090 --> 01:13:02.030
of ballast out of the front of the vehicle,
so there were two pounds you didn't have to

01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:03.030
carry.

01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:07.150
So, it was strictly weight.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:11.240
I'm sorry, the APUs are turbines?

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.659
I mean you're combusting [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

01:13:14.659 --> 01:13:23.330
The APUs we settled on was going with a monopropellant
hydrazine, feed that through a catalyst bed

01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:24.790
and then through a turbine.

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:27.380
We looked at dual stage, triple stage turbines.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:33.610
We finally wound up with a single stage turbine
running at about 38,000 to 45,000, I don't

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.170
remember the exact number now, RPM.

01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:36.590
About ten inches in diameter [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:49.469
The gas went in and then made a pass and went
back through, so we got maybe 5%, 10% more

01:13:49.469 --> 01:13:52.840
power out of it the second time through, a
little bit more power out of it the second

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.530
time through.

01:13:56.530 --> 01:14:05.160
When we contracted for the APU, the contractor
did not have altitude facilities.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:12.820
And so they proposed that we did not need
to test the APU in a vacuum because that was

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:18.210
all structure and all they had to do was pull
a vacuum on the exhaust and could get the

01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:19.820
performance out of that.

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:26.159
So we did not have it in our quality program
to test the APU in a vacuum.

01:14:26.159 --> 01:14:27.929
Fortunately, Dr.

01:14:27.929 --> 01:14:35.429
Cohen gave us enough money to buy an APU offline
of the Shuttle Program.

01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:37.030
We brought it down to JSC.

01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:40.580
We put it in our vacuum facilities there.

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:46.700
And we programmed the vacuum facility to go
down in pressure.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.780
The Orbiter was going up in altitude.

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:56.900
And we ran the ascent profile and shut the
APU off just like we would on a first flight.

01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:03.050
And five minutes after we shut it off it exploded,
it detonated.

01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:05.430
I mean talk about things coming unglued.

01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:06.520
Everything came unglued.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:10.380
Aaron came unglued.

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:11.770
We got another APU.

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:12.770
We brought it down there.

01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:16.199
We brought all of the contractor people down,
everybody down there.

01:15:16.199 --> 01:15:17.860
We repeated the test.

01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:19.730
It exploded again.

01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:24.070
[LAUGHTER] By that time we discovered what
the problem was.

01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:29.120
We have a requirement in the program that
you can only have hot surfaces up to about

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.120
500 degrees.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.040
I don't remember the exact temperature, but
some temperature like 500 degrees.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.429
If it is higher than that you have to shield
it.

01:15:36.429 --> 01:15:44.060
The gas generator is obviously running over
500 degrees, probably up around 800, 900 degrees,

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.790
so we put a heat shield around it.

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:51.270
We covered that whole thing up and had about
a half-inch standoff in the insulation on

01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:52.270
that thing.

01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:58.440
When you run it in one atmosphere, if you
shut it off it acts like a chimney.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:02.969
The air heats up between the insulation and
the hot surface and goes out the top.

01:16:02.969 --> 01:16:04.690
It draws cold air in.

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:05.710
It goes out the top.

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:09.570
It draws more cold air in so it cools it off.

01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:14.540
So the heat never did soak out into the valves
and get the valves too hot.

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:19.580
When you put it in a vacuum there is no place
for that heat to go.

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:23.420
And so all of that heat that was in the gas
generator and all of the catalyst and all

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:28.730
of that soaked back out through the structure
and through the tubes back up to the valves

01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:32.940
and got the valves up to the temperature at
which hydrazine will detonate.

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:35.660
And it did.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.280
It is so simple.

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.710
It is so easy to understand after you know
about it.

01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:45.530
But to think about it, I remember sitting
around there one night to 8:00, 9:00 with

01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:51.160
all of my troops discussing the pros and cons
of an altitude facility.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.420
Do we have to have it?

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:56.011
Do we have to direct the contractor to put
one in?

01:16:56.011 --> 01:17:03.210
And we could not come up with a good reason
to put an altitude test in the program so

01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:05.400
we didn't put it in there.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:11.570
Fortunately, just like on ohms with the helium
bottle falling out, we had a backup because

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:17.800
some of the people weren't confident in flying
the vehicle without that test.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.300
And we found something that we didn't expect.

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:23.940
The message that Henry is giving you on testing
is the same message that J.R.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:27.010
Thompson gave you on testing on the main engine.

01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:31.480
And, in contrast, we didn't really do that
type of testing on the solid rocket booster,

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.410
the fair we had and on the foam.

01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:35.520
And that is the difference, we really tested.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.460
When we saw a problem we tested it.

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:47.040
And we came out very fortunate, but we did
do it.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:52.530
Another thing with the development of the
APU, we flew those things on airplanes all

01:17:52.530 --> 01:18:02.590
the time in case they lost main engine, our
fighter aircraft and then some of the other

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:05.341
airplanes including that supersonic plane
that we had.

01:18:05.341 --> 01:18:11.920
It had APUs in there in case they lost engine
power to provide hydraulics to be able to

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.920
land the vehicle.

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:20.429
And that got a lot of the flack because the
Aerospace Safety Committee told me that those

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:23.210
systems never did work because they're called
auxiliary power units.

01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:26.239
They never worked when you needed them.

01:18:26.239 --> 01:18:29.860
But they had those systems.

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:31.570
And they were good systems.

01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:38.980
But when we tried to use that same kind of
design on the Shuttle the oil wouldn't go

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:43.260
back to the sump in the absence of gravity.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:46.159
You sling it out and it just coats the walls
on an automobile.

01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:51.670
You put an oil pan down the bottom, you put
a pump right at the bottom, you put a little

01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:55.360
filter in there and pump the oil out and pump
it through the engine and use it over and

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.469
over and over.

01:18:56.469 --> 01:19:00.850
But when you have no bottom, you have no place
for that oil to go.

01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:06.989
So we had to come up with a technique where
we could use the gears as oil pumps.

01:19:06.989 --> 01:19:14.040
And we came up with very, very close tolerances
between the gear and the case, and let the

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:19.340
gear sling the oil out or pump the oil out
into a cavity and pipe it off to where we

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:26.840
had a sump to where we could pick oil up with
an oil pump and pump it back through the system.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:32.210
And we had some problems with some hydrazine
getting in there and gelling it one time.

01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:37.560
And Fram came out with this deal where you
could pay me now or you can pay me later kind

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:43.610
of thing because they still aren't changing
the oil filter.

01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:50.210
Hydraulics was mostly off the shelf at the
time, the pump and that stuff.

01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:55.190
We did go to titanium propellant lines or
hydraulic lines.

01:19:55.190 --> 01:20:01.440
We did develop a special fitting to put titanium
lines together.

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.900
It turned out to be very, very good.

01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:12.510
We did have to add a water boiler to cool
the hydraulic fluid because on airplanes just

01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:16.800
put a little radiator in there and use the
atmosphere to cool it, but that didn't work

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.940
in space.

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:26.780
The first one they came up with was a bucket
and it had a core of tubes in that bucket

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:32.180
with a pipe that went out with some baffles
in there to keep the liquid from going out.

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:37.030
But there, again, they did not understand
the absence of gravity.

01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:43.400
When in zero G and you put heat in that water,
it just pushes the water out away from the

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:44.870
tube.

01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:49.460
And all the water would go out the exhaust
pipe and you would have nothing but gas in

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:50.460
the tank.

01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:54.590
We had to change that design and go into what
we call a water spray barge.

01:20:54.590 --> 01:21:03.360
To pulse the water in there as a spray is
more efficient.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:10.890
But complicated that system very much.

01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:14.260
It still does.

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:23.380
It is very, very difficult to handle water
in a vacuum.

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:28.950
Getting back to the RCS one moment, the first
rain we had down there at the Cape, the RCS

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:30.780
jets filled up with water.

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:38.090
And they wanted to launch that system assuming
that the water would boil out when they started

01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:39.090
going uphill.

01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:45.510
But, no, what happens is when you put water
in a vacuum, about 60% of it will go to a

01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:47.949
gas and 30% will freeze.

01:21:47.949 --> 01:21:52.429
When it freezes then it is a solid, you cannot
get it out, it just has to sublime which takes

01:21:52.429 --> 01:21:54.010
weeks and months.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:22:00.620
Now, trying to get us a water boiler, we had
valves in there that were supposed to open

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:03.880
and close when the pressure built up.

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:12.040
Well, when you get past that valve, when that
valve would open up that steam would instantly

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:16.340
freeze on the outside and it keeps growing
back.

01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:21.179
Finally, the valve would be stopped up and
you would build the pressure up way high and

01:22:21.179 --> 01:22:22.179
would blow the ice out.

01:22:22.179 --> 01:22:25.360
The pressure would come back down and start
working again.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.470
So, we went to an orifice.

01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:34.719
Trying to size that orifice to the right size
where it maintains a little pressure in there,

01:22:34.719 --> 01:22:39.790
and you've got a variable load on the system
and you're putting variable energy into it,

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:41.630
that's difficult to design that, too.

01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:43.440
The water boiler still freezes.

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.110
We still have a freezing problem on it.

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:51.380
It is not an easy solution to it.

01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:55.610
Questions?

01:22:55.610 --> 01:23:00.489
Do you lose that water?

01:23:00.489 --> 01:23:04.670
Yeah, we just dump it overboard.

01:23:04.670 --> 01:23:09.510
We have a whole bunch of tubes going through
this water, and we spray the water in, in

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:10.510
a spray.

01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:17.420
And it makes one pass through those tubes
and then it goes out the exhaust.

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:22.480
If you wanted to come up with some kind of
regenerative system where you would use the

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.730
water over and over and over then you've got
to go through some kind of system to cool

01:23:26.730 --> 01:23:30.130
the water or you have to carry too much water
aboard.

01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:35.440
Well, if you want to cool the water, the only
way you really have got to cool it is by using

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:42.949
more water or supplementing some of that water.

01:23:42.949 --> 01:23:50.160
In a vacuum, you cannot just put it out on
a surface some place.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.159
I guess the temperature varies maybe.

01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:59.650
Henry, could you say a word about the flight
control hydraulics lab, the tests we ran with

01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:02.440
the hydraulic systems.

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:07.340
The hydraulic system was probably one of the
most thoroughly tested systems that we had

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:12.860
as far as mechanical systems were concerned.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:19.820
We built a whole hydraulic system integrated
with the avionics, and we had it designed

01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:23.610
so you could put loads on it and react the
loads.

01:24:23.610 --> 01:24:28.090
And you could program in what you thought
was typical emissions where you could vary

01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:29.090
everything.

01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:34.739
The only difference is instead of driving
the hydraulic pumps with APUs, we drove the

01:24:34.739 --> 01:24:41.739
hydraulic pumps with electric motors because
we had ground-based electric motors to drive

01:24:41.739 --> 01:24:43.280
them.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:51.449
And one of the things we ground ruled out
was the use of flex hoses -belts- simply because

01:24:51.449 --> 01:24:58.280
they, at that time, were notorious for fatiguing
and breaking and not working very good.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.150
So we put trombone tubes in.

01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:05.761
Take a long tube and bring it back this way
and tie it in.

01:25:05.761 --> 01:25:09.670
And now, as the actuator moved, it could move.

01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:13.920
And you had enough spring or enough give in
those tubes.

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.710
On the very first time they fired that thing
up, standing up in there in the control room

01:25:18.710 --> 01:25:22.650
looking at it, those trombone tubes just vanished.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:29.449
They would be there and then all at once you
wouldn't see them.

01:25:29.449 --> 01:25:31.030
And I mean you couldn't see them.

01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:34.190
You're standing up there in the control room
looking and there are no tubes in there.

01:25:34.190 --> 01:25:36.679
They were shaking so bad that you couldn't
see them.

01:25:36.679 --> 01:25:43.310
So we went through a big effort to figure
out ways to damp those things and isolate

01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:49.420
them so that they didn't vibrate.

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:51.780
We had a major failure.

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:58.699
It was a hard, hard sell to convince the people
to go to a single actuary, from a dual tandem

01:25:58.699 --> 01:26:00.150
single actuator.

01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:09.710
Well, no more than we got our first single
actuator built, the initial design had too

01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:13.440
much slack in a tube that went from one side
to the other side because you had to have

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.900
an expansion joint in there.

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.949
And we had an O ring in there.

01:26:16.949 --> 01:26:22.340
And they had too much slack in there and it
blew one of the O rings out.

01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:26.070
Well, of course, when you blew an O ring out
you lost all the hydraulics not only from

01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:31.400
that system but all three systems because
it was downstream of the switching valves.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.940
And when one system ran out of fluid it would
switch over to the other one and you would

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:40.300
run out of fluid.

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:46.270
Had we not had a very, very strong guy in
the Program Office at that time that never

01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:51.570
gave up on anything that would have probably
finished us off as far as single actuators

01:26:51.570 --> 01:26:53.050
are concerned.

01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:59.090
But we were able to convince the program that
if we tightened the tolerance up on it, paid

01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:03.630
very close attention to the tolerance on it
that it could not happen.

01:27:03.630 --> 01:27:05.630
And it has not happened again.

01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:06.889
Another question?

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:07.889
Yes.

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:13.560
You talked a little bit before about maybe
substituting an electromechanical system for

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.560
hydraulic.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:22.580
Would there be any other changes you would
make in the design if you had to go back and

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.040
do it again?

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.870
Oh, if I had to do it again, I definitely
would go with electromechanical systems.

01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:30.590
Now, that takes on many varieties.

01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:37.540
You could have small electric motors driving
a hydraulic system right at the unit.

01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:40.470
Like you put an electric motor on an actuator.

01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:46.120
And that electric motor drives a small hydraulic
pump that would move the actuator if you did

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:59.330
not have confidence in worm gears and screw
jacks and those kind of things to provide

01:27:59.330 --> 01:28:03.699
the mechanical force, power hinges and things
like that.

01:28:03.699 --> 01:28:08.010
But there is absolutely no question in my
mind that one of the safest things you could

01:28:08.010 --> 01:28:21.060
do for the Orbiter right now would be to replace
the APUs in the hydraulic system with an electrical

01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:23.460
system.

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:31.510
We have the motor technology, we have, I think,
the gear and the ball screw technology to

01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:33.010
be able to do that.

01:28:33.010 --> 01:28:36.720
I think we could do it cheap.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.470
I think that would really change the operational
cost.

01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:44.420
It would reduce the operational of cost immensely.

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:49.400
It would move the CG further forward on the
vehicle so you probably could take out a little

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:52.580
bit more of the ballast that we usually fly
on the front-end.

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.740
I guess we're still flying it.

01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:58.130
We always did.

01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:02.650
I have another question.

01:29:02.650 --> 01:29:08.340
You talked earlier and you had it on the slide,
but you didn't really talk about it, how you

01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:12.090
were shifting weight between budgets, when
it came to like the controls people versus

01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:14.140
the hydraulics people and the APUs.

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:19.330
And I was wondering if you could kind of just
expand on that of how, in an actual development

01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:20.739
program, it goes back and forth.

01:29:20.739 --> 01:29:24.880
I mean does it usually come down from high
you're going to do this and you're going to

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:28.469
do that, or is it usually they let you kind
of work it out between the groups or what?

01:29:28.469 --> 01:29:31.050
The control people have no weight budget.

01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:39.600
I mean their budget is the electrons that
flow back and forth and the requirements.

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:44.469
What they do is they start out a requirement
that they would like to have.

01:29:44.469 --> 01:29:52.219
And it is usually two, three, four times what
they absolutely have to have.

01:29:52.219 --> 01:29:57.570
And then you have to sit down and start negotiating
with them and explaining to them what it is

01:29:57.570 --> 01:29:58.570
costing.

01:29:58.570 --> 01:30:02.840
And often it gets down to the fact that the
vehicle won't fly.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:05.139
I mean it just flat won't fly.

01:30:05.139 --> 01:30:09.420
And when they are convinced then that it cannot
fly then they are willing to concede that

01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:12.100
they can get by with a little more.

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:15.510
And it still won't fly and so they can get
by with a little bit more.

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:20.880
And that's kind of the way you get it done.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:26.590
That's what you do.

01:30:26.590 --> 01:30:30.860
You have a work breakdown structure, and you
parcel that work breakdown structure out to

01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:32.659
your subsystem managers.

01:30:32.659 --> 01:30:36.910
Now, there was an issue in the Shuttle and
the Apollo Program, since I was a project

01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:44.390
manager, you give the subsystem managers the
requirements and the authority technically.

01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:52.090
You tell them what their constraint is for
dollars, you give them the weight bogies or

01:30:52.090 --> 01:30:57.520
the weight requirements, the function requirements,
performance requirements, the schedule requirements,

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.520
but you keep the dollars.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.530
Now, that's been a very long argument.

01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:05.470
Do you allow the subsystem managers to actually
have control over the dollars?

01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:06.600
We decided not to.

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:11.199
That was a very big argument of whether you
should let the other people have the dollars.

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:14.170
I kept the dollars.

01:31:14.170 --> 01:31:18.350
They had to come to me if they wanted to make
a big change outside their work breakdown

01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:24.361
structure because I had the problem of trading
off the dollars between the propulsion system

01:31:24.361 --> 01:31:29.179
and the structure system or the aerodynamic
system.

01:31:29.179 --> 01:31:32.260
And you can argue that was the right or wrong
thing to do but that was how we did it.

01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:37.040
And I am not sure if aircraft companies like
Boeing now or Lockheed Martin how they do

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:41.670
it, but they all start off with a work breakdown
structure of some type.

01:31:41.670 --> 01:31:42.670
Yes.

01:31:42.670 --> 01:31:47.200
At that stage,do you also give them target
weights?

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.960
You can target weights also, yeah.

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.251
Negotiated target weights and negotiated schedules.

01:31:50.251 --> 01:31:53.490
And they develop the performance.

01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:59.830
You basically use the target weights, from
the preliminary designs that you've done,

01:31:59.830 --> 01:32:04.850
to look at the concept that you're looking
at to make sure that it is feasible.

01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:08.909
And when it looks like that is a feasible
design, then you break up the weights and

01:32:08.909 --> 01:32:14.949
you give all of the subsystem people their
target weights to stay within of which almost

01:32:14.949 --> 01:32:18.520
immediately the weights start growing.

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.520
That's right.

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:23.520
And, when you're a project manager like I
was, it is career limiting.

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:26.610
The first thing is your weight starts to go
up.

01:32:26.610 --> 01:32:32.490
The next thing is you start to have schedule
slips because you're finding technology problems.

01:32:32.490 --> 01:32:34.760
And then the cost starts to go up.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:44.550
You really come with a lot of career limiting
problems in project managing, but you have

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.020
to have good people working for you.

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:50.320
I think, Henry, another interesting thing
you might talk about is, they've seen Bass

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.020
Redd talk about the aerodynamics, they are
going to have Phil Hattis talk about the guidance,

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:58.551
navigation and control, you might give them
your perspective with the hydraulic system

01:32:58.551 --> 01:33:00.420
of tying those systems together.

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:09.889
You mentioned it a little bit but it is probably
a little bit harder than you think in putting

01:33:09.889 --> 01:33:12.909
the requirements on the hydraulic system.

01:33:12.909 --> 01:33:22.659
I probably spent more personal time dealing
with the avionics people, the guidance people

01:33:22.659 --> 01:33:32.520
and the aero people than I did working with
the subsystem designs early on just trying

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:37.420
to get some reasonableness in the requirements.

01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:42.980
Trying to get the size of the OMS engines
down, trying to get the size of the RCS down,

01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.580
trying to get the pulse width a little bit
wider.

01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:51.150
On the hydraulics, that was a major, major
issue because those were really big weight

01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:53.550
items.

01:33:53.550 --> 01:34:00.750
On the OMS and RCS it was not a big weight
impact, it was a performance impact of how

01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:03.699
much propellants you had to carry onboard.

01:34:03.699 --> 01:34:10.620
But on the hydraulics, on the design of that
system, how fast you had to move one of those

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:13.350
flaps on that thing was a big big issue.

01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:18.300
And I spent lots of time going over and looking
at their data, looking at what they were coming

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:22.100
up with, looking at their what-ifs.

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:28.550
That is what drives a system, is what if this
happens or what if that happens?

01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:32.110
Another problem I remember we had was the
gimbal rate of the main engines.

01:34:32.110 --> 01:34:36.090
The requirement they put on the gimbal rate.

01:34:36.090 --> 01:34:40.469
That was a compounded problem, too, because
you were kind of dealing between centers.

01:34:40.469 --> 01:34:45.700
But, yeah, the gimbal weight.

01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:52.000
And the need for a gimbal system on the solid
rocket motors, if I had my day in court, we

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.210
would take the gimbal system off of the solid
rocket boosters.

01:34:58.210 --> 01:35:03.520
That would save six or seven or eight tons
of weight back there.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:11.070
If you would take that system out, it would
make the solid rocket boosters much more reliable

01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:14.800
because they've got those great big old boots
in there and those big springs.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:19.909
They horse those things back and forth with
huge actuators on them.

01:35:19.909 --> 01:35:30.980
And the only reason we could not eliminate
the gimbal system on the SRBs is that we had

01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:36.340
one SRB that burned out with the max burn
time.

01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:39.770
And the other one on the other side burned
out with minimum burn time.

01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:44.690
And we lost the top engine on the SSME on
the same flight.

01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:49.199
Now, you know the probability of that happening
is once in a billion.

01:35:49.199 --> 01:35:55.130
But, yet, that is what drives the requirement
for having the gimbal system.

01:35:55.130 --> 01:36:02.369
We would have to gimbal the main engines another
two degrees to make that work.

01:36:02.369 --> 01:36:09.489
But that is what drove the design, that requirement
that we have on the solid rocket motors.

01:36:09.489 --> 01:36:15.480
So, if I can leave you with one message, it
is understand your requirements extremely

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:25.639
well and understand the impact that that requirement
is having on your system and on the flyability

01:36:25.639 --> 01:36:28.179
of the vehicle.

01:36:28.179 --> 01:36:37.380
I told you that Henry had a lot of innovative
design.

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:38.690
Talk a little bit more about the RCS.

01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:40.050
I thought you were going to mention that before.

01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:43.530
When they got water and how you solved that
problem.

01:36:43.530 --> 01:36:50.699
This is Henry Pohl's solution to a very complex
problem on the RCS system, on the pad.

01:36:50.699 --> 01:36:57.560
When we got the RCS engines filled up with
water we needed to come up with a design to

01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:03.450
keep the water out of the engines in case
of rain because it always rains at the Cape.

01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:11.840
So that requirement fell on the contractor
to design a system to keep water from getting

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.390
into the RCS engines.

01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:18.060
They came up with a plug with the throat and
another big seal to go around those big scarf

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:20.739
nozzles out there with an O ring on that.

01:37:20.739 --> 01:37:22.540
And that was all tied together with cables.

01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:25.610
And they stuck a big pole upside the vehicle.

01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:32.010
And just before liftoff they were going to
pop that pole over and jerk all of that stuff

01:37:32.010 --> 01:37:33.010
out.

01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:36.580
And they were going to jerk it out fast enough
so that those big tanks would not fall down

01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:38.780
and hit the tile and knock all the tile off.

01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:44.600
Well, that looked kind of complex and complicated
to me.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:50.860
We had a grocery store across the street by
the name of Wine Gardens, and I went down

01:37:50.860 --> 01:38:01.560
and got a roll of that wrapping paper that
you use to wrap meats in that has wax on one

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:05.340
side and then paper on the other side.

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:11.010
I call it butcher paper, but butcher paper
is actually a little bit different.

01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:17.699
If you go down and buy something it is freezer
paper, but I bought a roll of that.

01:38:17.699 --> 01:38:22.560
Then I got back up into the meeting by the
time it was over and said this is the way

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:23.560
to fix it.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:28.080
And I started tearing off sheets off and passed
it around to the managers to look at.

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:37.170
We are going to glue that on the surface with
the wax side out and glue it on with RTV.

01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:39.780
And then, when you lift it off, it would come
off.

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.780
It was light.

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:41.989
It wouldn't hurt the tile.

01:38:41.989 --> 01:38:43.510
If it impacted anything it wasn't going to
hurt anything.

01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:49.469
If it didn't come off when you fired the RCS
you would blow it off or burn it off.

01:38:49.469 --> 01:38:51.260
And that is what we did.

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:53.219
And we glued that on all of them.

01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:57.310
[LAUGHTER] It sounds funny but it is true.

01:38:57.310 --> 01:39:03.440
You look at the Orbiter sitting on the pad
and all the RCS jets are covered up with paper.

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.840
But after I left they changed that.

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:14.860
They changed from butcher paper to a special
paper developed special for that purpose that

01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:17.400
is made out of Teflon.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:23.730
You have to tell them one more story about
the SSME on the launch pad and the hydrogen.

01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:25.940
This was JR's.

01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:35.350
When we did the first firing on the pad -- Just
a test firing on the launch pad to make sure

01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:40.530
that everything worked right, we blew the
back end out of the shuttle.

01:39:40.530 --> 01:39:46.340
When those main engines light off, each one
of those engines dump out about 125 pounds

01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:50.219
of hydrogen before it ignites.

01:39:50.219 --> 01:39:52.610
That hydrogen is cold.

01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:55.159
It is fairly dense in liquid form.

01:39:55.159 --> 01:39:57.030
It is 4.5 pounds per cubic foot or something.

01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:58.969
By that time it is a little bit lighter.

01:39:58.969 --> 01:40:01.360
It goes down in the flame pit.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.929
It mixes with a lot of air in there.

01:40:03.929 --> 01:40:05.730
And then the flame hits it and detonates.

01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:12.810
And it blew the backend out of the vehicle.

01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:18.260
We needed a quick fix because we're going
to launch that thing in three or four days.

01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:24.430
I looked at the problem and said we will just
put Roman candles under it.

01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:29.489
You put a bunch of Roman candles under there
that fire those balls out across there and

01:40:29.489 --> 01:40:30.560
the hydrogen comes out.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.030
That will ignite the hydrogen.

01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:34.480
It will burn and won't accumulate behind the
pit.

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.239
And that is what we did.

01:40:36.239 --> 01:40:43.449
Those sparklers you see coming on before the
main engines light off, those are my Roman

01:40:43.449 --> 01:40:44.449
candles.

01:40:44.449 --> 01:40:47.243
And as long as we're talking about blowing
the back end of the Orbiter out, maybe you

01:40:47.243 --> 01:40:55.300
can talk about the pressure wave as well.

01:40:55.300 --> 01:41:01.380
The pressure wave that came back and the water
suppression.

01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:06.639
We had another problem, more of an acoustical
problem from the pressure waves coming back

01:41:06.639 --> 01:41:13.260
up under the Orbiter, and we needed some kind
of a solution to do that.

01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:19.050
Back while I was in Huntsville as a test engineer
in a test lab there in Huntsville, we blew

01:41:19.050 --> 01:41:25.760
the windows out seven miles away when we started
firing the Saturn 5 vehicle.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:37.949
We spent a lot of time on sound suppression
techniques to reduce the pressure effect.

01:41:37.949 --> 01:41:41.830
And one of the things we came up with is we
found water is very good at damping that.

01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:47.440
When we had that problem down the Cape what
we did is put those sausages, the hammocks

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:54.270
across down there and fill them with water
to damp out the pressure wave that came back

01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:55.800
up to the back of the vehicle.

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.530
There is another one of them.

01:41:58.530 --> 01:42:01.760
Essentially like big water balloons.

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:04.160
We called them sausage.

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.700
It was a fabric across the bottom, filled
it up with water and it was strong enough

01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:11.400
to hold the water up.

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:21.719
And then that dampened the sound waves, the
shockwaves that came back up through the vehicle.

01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:36.010
Again, just remember that it is not natural
for earth-bound humans to think in terms of

01:42:36.010 --> 01:42:40.219
the absence of gravity and the absence of
pressure.

01:42:40.219 --> 01:42:44.550
I cannot stress that too much.

01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:48.699
You take a pot of water, you put it on the
stove and it gets hot on top.

01:42:48.699 --> 01:42:52.320
You put it on a stove at zero G, it does not
get hot on top.

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.540
It pushes all the water out.

01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:56.540
Heat transfer.

01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:59.960
You don't realize how much heat is transferred
out through the atmosphere.

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:05.350
If you have no atmosphere you don't get any
of that heat transfer out.

01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:14.020
The other thing to remember is that there
is absolutely no substitute for a very well

01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:17.400
thought out test program.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.890
It is not easy to test in the absence of gravity.

01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:27.510
It is not easy to test in the absence of pressure
when you are reducing large quantities of

01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:29.080
gas or chemicals.

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.760
But that is very, very important.

01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:40.690
And that is the one thing that really separates
a space program from anything that we do here

01:43:40.690 --> 01:43:48.510
on earth, is that you have no atmosphere and
you have no gravity to help you in your design.

01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:57.440
Yet, all of our thought process is based on
having gravity and having an atmosphere.

01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:06.980
And some of the designs of various experiments
that I've worked with on Spacelab flights

01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:07.980
and other flights, numerous failures.

01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:17.030
And over half of the equipment that failed,
this is stuff generally that we use inside

01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:24.179
the shuttle, it was because of thermal problems
that they would overheat just because people

01:44:24.179 --> 01:44:26.239
didn't get the calculations right.

01:44:26.239 --> 01:44:27.679
You have no convection.

01:44:27.679 --> 01:44:35.440
And getting the thermal design to work is
just really difficult.

01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:43.370
Convection is one of the major problems that
is overlooked because when you put heat in

01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:46.440
one place on the ground it goes up.

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:51.480
If you take the gravity away it will not go
up.

01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:56.580
And that changes the whole complex, the thermal
matrix.

01:44:56.580 --> 01:45:03.110
Henry talked a little bit about the screen
system that was developed for the OMS and

01:45:03.110 --> 01:45:12.010
RCS tanks, but just to make sure you appreciate
the complexity of this, you've probably seen

01:45:12.010 --> 01:45:17.460
pictures of astronauts playing with food and
liquid, you blow these big liquid bubbles

01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:19.239
and they just sort of float there.

01:45:19.239 --> 01:45:22.500
Well, the liquid does the same thing inside
a fuel tank.

01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:25.989
And when you push the button because you want
to turn your engine to turn on, how do you

01:45:25.989 --> 01:45:35.619
get the fuel to flow into the engine?

01:45:35.619 --> 01:45:38.597
And, as Henry said, in the old-days you had
kind of a diaphragm.

01:45:38.597 --> 01:45:48.610
Everything was in like a little balloon and
you would pressurize the outside of the balloon

01:45:48.610 --> 01:45:50.369
and that would force the fuel out, but that
balloon would get eaten away.

01:45:50.369 --> 01:45:52.860
I mean remember that was a system that is
only used for one flight.

01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:56.900
Now we have a system that has to be reusable.

01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:02.489
And if you didn't want to replace those diaphragms
or balloons every flight you needed something

01:46:02.489 --> 01:46:03.750
that was a different system.

01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:08.880
And that is where they came up with the idea
of the screens which would have surface tension

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:12.780
so enough of the propellant would stick to
the screen.

01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:20.300
And then you would get the helium on the other
side that would push it out of the screen.

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:29.580
With the OMS, of course, once you got the
system started then you're producing an acceleration.

01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:35.290
And it is always in the same direction so
that the OMS tanks are designed so that they

01:46:35.290 --> 01:46:40.699
only have to feed enough propellant through
the screening system to get the engine started.

01:46:40.699 --> 01:46:45.690
And then everything, I won't call it gravity-fed,
but is fed by the acceleration.

01:46:45.690 --> 01:46:48.760
When both engines are burning, it is about
a tenth of a G.

01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:53.119
But the RCS, that can push you in any direction.

01:46:53.119 --> 01:46:59.740
And so you have to have a system which will
continuously feed, no matter which direction

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:01.820
your acceleration vector is.

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:04.430
It is a really complex and cleaver system.

01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:09.170
And the design is based strictly on surface
tension.

01:47:09.170 --> 01:47:11.679
Why are there so many RCS engines?

01:47:11.679 --> 01:47:19.510
For example, in the nose, there are 16.

01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:22.730
Is that for redundancy?

01:47:22.730 --> 01:47:25.889
Part of it is for redundancy and part of it
is to make sure that you've got one to cover

01:47:25.889 --> 01:47:28.940
every direction.

01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:31.910
I guess we've got six going down in front.

01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:37.050
Now, we need two of those for certain maneuvers.

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:41.429
So you can lose four of them.

01:47:41.429 --> 01:47:46.010
And we have four going out.

01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:49.030
You can lose one on either side.

01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:53.900
And remember you need a couple pair.

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:59.119
You would like to be able to do a pure rotation.

01:47:59.119 --> 01:48:04.929
If you just fire one engine in the aft you're
going to get a rotation, but you will also

01:48:04.929 --> 01:48:05.929
get a translation.

01:48:05.929 --> 01:48:07.570
So, you need a couple pairs.

01:48:07.570 --> 01:48:10.320
And then for redundancy we have three sets.

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:16.400
If you add up the x-axis, the y-axis, the
z-axis, you've got to be able to translate

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:23.650
in three axies, you've got to be able to rotate
about three axies, and then you need dual

01:48:23.650 --> 01:48:26.230
redundancy for each of that axis.

01:48:26.230 --> 01:48:30.660
You add it up and you end up with 38 primary
jets.

01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:32.390
And then, on top of that, those are 850 pound
jets.

01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:35.040
They use a lot of propellant.

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:40.199
When you are in orbit generally and all you
worry about is your attitude and you're not

01:48:40.199 --> 01:48:46.070
doing a propulsive burn for rendezvous or
anything, we shut down the primary RCS system

01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:52.639
and we just use six little 25 pound Vernier
thrusters, all of which are pointed down.

01:48:52.639 --> 01:49:02.150
When you use those for attitude control they
do give you a little bit of propulsive impulse

01:49:02.150 --> 01:49:03.150
as well.

01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:10.659
But it is a small enough thrust that it doesn't
change your orbit by very much.

01:49:10.659 --> 01:49:22.690
Let me tell you another story about the expulsion
devices on the Shuttle.

01:49:22.690 --> 01:49:26.670
Back in my young days, I grew up in the country,
and we had a Ford tractor.

01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:32.060
The Ford tractor had a screen in the fuel
tank and it stood up about that tall.

01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:33.600
And it had a little stand pipe in there.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:39.900
And the valve was such that when you got down
you could set the valve one way and it would

01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:41.770
leave about a gallon of fuel in the tank.

01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:45.650
You turn it the other way at the end and it
would use that gallon of fuel out, kind of

01:49:45.650 --> 01:49:49.200
like a gas gauge on the early Volkswagen.

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:56.130
Well, what happened is that I had that out
one day and it had a tenth of an inch diameter

01:49:56.130 --> 01:49:59.750
hole punched in that screen about halfway
up on the screen.

01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:02.800
I said that screen is not doing any good if
it has a hole in it.

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:07.760
I got me a ball of solder and I stopped up
that screen.

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:13.179
You know, after that, you could have it set
where the fuel are supposed to remain in the

01:50:13.179 --> 01:50:14.179
tank.

01:50:14.179 --> 01:50:15.449
And when it quit it was empty.

01:50:15.449 --> 01:50:17.680
You'd switch it over and it still wouldn't
run.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:18.680
You couldn't get home.

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:20.150
You would have to walk home.

01:50:20.150 --> 01:50:27.510
Well, it turned out that they had put that
hole in there as a vacuum breaker to break

01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:29.330
the vacuum on it.

01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:33.880
And that is the way that the Shuttle system
works.

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.909
The screens that we have in there, it is fine
enough so that the surface tension across

01:50:38.909 --> 01:50:43.429
those small pores is strong enough so that
it will keep the air from punching through,

01:50:43.429 --> 01:50:45.760
unless you put a big hole in them.

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.679
We had to make sure.

01:50:48.679 --> 01:50:54.219
And that was another one of the things that
convinced me that we could design a screen

01:50:54.219 --> 01:50:59.119
system that would work in the absence of gravity.

01:50:59.119 --> 01:51:03.650
It goes back to a Ford tractor.

01:51:03.650 --> 01:51:07.330
It goes all the way back to 1947 and a Ford
tractor.

01:51:07.330 --> 01:51:08.330
Henry, we've come to the end.

01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:09.330
Let's thank Henry.

01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:09.331
[APPLAUSE]
