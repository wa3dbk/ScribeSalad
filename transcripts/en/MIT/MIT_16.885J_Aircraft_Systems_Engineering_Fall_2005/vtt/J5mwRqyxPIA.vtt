00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.240
Let's see.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.560
The original schedule today had Colonel Gordon
Fullerton going to come and talk to us about

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.730
both cockpit design, but primarily about test
flying the Shuttle.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.351
Unfortunately, he is in charge of Flight Operations.

00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:28.351
Well, not unfortunately.

00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:35.960
He is in charge of Flight Operations at Dryden
Flight Research Center for NASA.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.150
Unfortunately for us, since the time that
we had agreed on this date, they scheduled,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.780
at the beginning of next week, a major base
inspection.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.500
And if any of you are connected with the military
you know what that involves.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.619
And, since he is head of flight operations,
he really has to be there to make sure that

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:59.619
they are ready for it.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:00.619
He has rescheduled.

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:01.730
He will be here in November.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.220
And I will make adjustments to the syllabus.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.649
On Thursday, Bob Ried is going to talk about
aerothermodynamics.

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:21.789
And what I thought I would do today is kind
of a potpourri maybe doing a little bit of

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.859
recap on where we've gotten to so far.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:34.960
And also I brought a few videos just to give
you a visual reminder of some of the things

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.900
that we've been talking about with the Shuttle.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.590
Any sort of general questions about what I
handed back to you?

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.259
I am happy to meet with teams individually
to discuss any specific questions.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.210
OK.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.210
Let's see.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.319
One thing that I -- Hi.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.619
I was just telling the class Gordon Fullerton
was supposed to be here, but he has had to

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.611
postpone to November because they're having
a base inspection of flight operations.

00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:13.320
So, he is not here.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.960
I had an email from Professor Cohen who will
be here.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:37.460
And let's see if this is -- He had an idea
that now that we've kind of started going

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:45.030
into details on various subsystems that it
might be interesting to work our way through

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.680
a Shuttle flight and just remind ourselves
of the different subsystems that are brought

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.180
into play at various times during a Shuttle
mission.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.090
This is kind of part of the systems integration
process.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.530
And remember that we talked at the beginning
how in the systems engineering process we

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.790
always want to keep in mind the eventual operational
use of the systems that are being designed.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.420
So, the idea, for instance, would be start
at the very beginning.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.460
You're sitting on the pad.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:34.570
You could even go further than that because
remember we talked about how systems had to

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.980
be developed, for instance, for loading the
payload into the cargo bay.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.040
They have that big payload changeout room.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:51.400
They had to design the hypergolic reaction
control and OMS motors in such a way that

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.320
the pods were actually removable from the
Shuttle because they were using hazardous

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.650
hypergolic fuel and they cannot be serviced
in the main hanger.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.120
They have to be taken over to a remote section
of the Kennedy Space Center.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.320
And then, of course, the servicing of the
tiles.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:17.850
There is a lot of servicing and maintenance
work that has to be done on all the subsystems.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.130
And, ideally, it should be designed in from
the beginning.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.590
Of course, in many cases, we got a lot smarter
after we started to use the Shuttle.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:38.870
And, if we were doing it again, which is something
that you will be thinking about, we would,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.370
in fact, have built certain things into the
subsystems which would have made it easier

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.919
for them to be maintained and repaired.

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:59.129
What I am going to do, just as an experiment
here, let's think briefly about these subsystems.

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:06.360
And I've got a little video taking us through
the launch and the entry stages.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.889
And then I have one or two other things to
show you, which will just illustrate certain

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.020
other aspects of the Shuttle Mission.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:26.099
Right at the moment of liftoff, just kind
of to set the stage, the final countdown starts

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.650
at T minus nine minutes.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.910
They typically will have holds built into
the count so that particularly when you're

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.250
going for a very tight launch window, like
if you're on a rendezvous mission to the Space

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:49.580
Station, you have to launch when the Space
Station basically is pretty much going overhead.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:56.360
And, since the Space Station is in a 51-degree
orbit, it takes more energy to get into a

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.710
51-degree orbit.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.999
Because normally if you launch from Cape Canaveral,
hopefully you understand the orbital dynamics,

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:09.879
if you launch due east you get the full speed
of the earth's rotation.

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:15.259
And since the latitude of Cape Canaveral is
28 degrees that puts you into an orbit which

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.340
is inclined 28 degrees to the equator.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.420
That is what we did when we did a rendezvous
with the Hubble Telescope which is in 28 degrees.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.199
In fact, I remember my brother was telling
me that we launched about 4:00 AM so it was

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.199
night.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.529
And just about 20 minutes before we launched
they saw Hubble fly over and everybody thought

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.010
that is a good sign, they seem to know what
they are doing.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:50.830
[LAUGHTER] The thing is that when you have
an object that is in orbit, and the orbit

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.629
you can think of as being roughly fixed in
inertial space, obviously it precesses a few

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:56.629
degrees every day.

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:02.759
But if you think of it as fixed in inertial
space on the time scale of a day or so then

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:05.620
the earth is turning underneath it.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.930
And you have to launch basically when you
are in that orbital plane.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.509
Now, if you have a little bit of extra energy
to burn you can launch a little bit earlier

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:22.300
or a little bit later and use that extra delta
V to change your velocity to get into that

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.599
plane.

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:29.050
If you're launching to rendezvous with Hubble,
say, which is in a 28-degree orbit, you have

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.900
a bigger launch window than you do if you
launch into the Space Station at a 51-degree

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.900
orbit.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.569
Because, going into a 51-degree orbit, you
are using a lot of extra delta V just to change

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:44.069
from a 28 to a 51-degree inclination.

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:48.340
So the launch window to rendezvous with the
Space Station is very short.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.210
It is only about five minutes.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:08:00.559
So in order to make sure that they have the
maximum chance of making the launch window,

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:05.999
they actually build in some extra large holes,
even more so than for a normal launch.

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:10.430
But you pick up the final count at nine minutes.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.749
The Shuttle, at that point, is on external
power.

00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:21.990
At about seven minutes, the pilot, that is
the person sitting on the right-hand side

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.240
who should be called the copilot, and I've
talked about this with a few of you.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:31.249
None of the astronaut test pilots, you know,
these are kind of big ego people.

00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:32.849
Nobody wants to be called a copilot.

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:34.801
The person sitting in the right seat is the
pilot.

00:08:34.801 --> 00:08:40.889
The person sitting in the left seat, who is
really the pilot, is called the commander.

00:08:40.889 --> 00:08:47.570
The pilot does not fly the Shuttle, except
for usually if you have a nice commander he

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:55.089
will let the pilot -- when you're pulling
away from the Space Station it is kind of

00:08:55.089 --> 00:09:01.170
a tradition that you give the pilot the stick
and let the pilot do a fly around.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.529
And, in the old days, some of the commanders
actually gave the pilots a little bit of stick

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:07.190
time before landing.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.000
But that generally doesn't happen now.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.170
Anyway, the pilot is in charge of a lot of
the subsystems, the main engines, the electrical

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:21.290
power system, the auxiliary power units.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:27.730
It is the pilot who has to throw a switch
to put the Shuttle on internal power.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:32.630
At about eight minutes before a launch you
go onto fuel cell power.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:40.750
Then at about 5.5 minutes before a launch
you turn on the auxiliary power unit.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.810
Remember we talked about that subsystem.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:51.770
That generates the hydraulic pressure to move
the flight control surfaces and the main engine

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.770
bells.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:59.470
And you will see, if you watch a launch sequence,
starting at about three minutes after the

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:04.970
auxiliary power unit comes on -- at that point
you can sort of feel a little bit of humming

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:12.680
in the vehicle when you're sitting in it -- they
then move the engine bells back and forth

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.750
through their entire range just to make sure
that the hydraulics are working.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.589
And actually the whole Shuttle shakes when
that happens so you can sort of feel that

00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:23.589
when you're sitting there.

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:28.170
And then, of course, one of the challenges
with a cryogenic engine -- and this going

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:33.050
to be an interesting development project for
the future when they want to have a restartable

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.050
engine.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:39.500
Remember these are cryogenic engines and so
you have to do a cool down.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:46.720
And so you start to flow the liquid oxygen
and liquid hydrogen through the piping.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:59.300
Again, inside a minute you can feel kind of
a rumbling down below as valves are opening

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.019
and things are starting to flow.

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:09.519
At 31 seconds the launch control center gives
control over to the Shuttle computers.

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:16.231
And the last 31 seconds are controlled entirely
by the Shuttle computers.

00:11:16.231 --> 00:11:21.940
They look at thousands of data points to make
sure that everything is working properly.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:31.500
At T minus six seconds the engines go through
an ignite sequence.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.009
The engine starts are staggered.

00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:38.089
And you will see that when you look at the
slow motion of the video that I am going to

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:39.810
show you.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.029
That reduces the shock on the system.

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:47.880
It only takes a couple of seconds for the
engines to come up to full power.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:55.269
You certainly don't want to commit yourself
to lighting the solid boosters unless you

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:57.949
are 100% sure that your main engines are firing.

00:11:57.949 --> 00:12:10.649
Because if even one main engine is not operating
at 100% efficiency you cannot make it to orbit.

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:16.569
In fact, if you have one engine out on the
pad, you have to do a return to launch site

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.569
abort.

00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:21.560
We will talk about the details of that whole
process at some point.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:31.149
AUDIENCE QUESTION You can abort launch right
up to when the solid -- Once the boosters

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:33.029
are lit you are going.

00:12:33.029 --> 00:12:38.279
Just hope you're pointed in the right direction
because there is no thrust termination on

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.440
the solids.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.610
And it has happened four times that we have
had pad shutdowns.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.670
The engines are monitored.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:56.050
On two of those occasions it turned out that
the problems were instrumentation.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:01.509
On two occasions it turned out that there
were, in fact, real engine problems.

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:06.350
And I would say, for a 50% success rate, you're
doing well.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.100
I mean it was the right thing to shut down
the engines all those times.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.740
Although, the very first time when they had
an engine shutdown on the pad, well first

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:22.630
of all, just an acronym is MECO, main engine
cutoff, which normally happens about 8.5 minutes

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.190
after launch.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:29.050
The comment by Steve Hawley, who was the flight
engineer in the center seat when they had

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:34.330
-- this was on the fourteenth Shuttle flight
-- when they had a pad abort, his comment

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:43.110
was, "Somehow I thought we would be a little
bit higher at MECO." And it turned out, they

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:48.319
didn't realize it at the time, but they actually
had a hydrogen fire on the pad.

00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:50.189
Remember we talked about how there was a lot
of hydrogen.

00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:56.620
And, of course, before the engine ignition,
we have those sparklers to get rid of the

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.620
excess hydrogen.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:03.209
But, in the process of shutting down the engines,
there was also a lot of excess hydrogen which

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:04.690
got into the engine [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:10.800
And the problem is that a hydrogen fire, as
you know, is pretty much invisible.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.319
And they didn't have any infrared cameras
at the time.

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:24.949
And so basically everybody went around, the
crew took their time and everybody went out.

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:30.649
Once they realized it, they put on a water
douse.

00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:33.220
Now we have infrared cameras.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:39.660
And, whenever you have an engine shutdown,
you have to be very careful that you don't,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:50.339
in fact, have a hydrogen fire.

00:14:50.339 --> 00:15:02.680
Coming back to the subsystem, the last stage
of the launch, the main engines have gone

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.189
on.

00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:08.680
You have turned on the hydraulic system both
for the main engine and the boosters have

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:15.480
their own hydraulic systems and the boosters
have their own auxiliary power unit.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.160
Guidance navigation and control, of course,
is absolutely critical.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:26.460
Now, first stage is what they call basically
open loop guidance.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:35.480
There is a specific projectory that you are
supposed to follow.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.259
Once the solid boosters are off you are following
a closed loop guidance which is taking you

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:51.680
to a specific point and velocity in time and
space and the trajectory is actively adjusted

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.759
to get there.

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:59.129
Because the solid boosters have so much thrust
you don't want to do a lot of sporty maneuvering.

00:15:59.129 --> 00:16:06.329
In fact, the biggest challenge from a maneuvering
point of view is when you're going through

00:16:06.329 --> 00:16:16.190
max Q and maximum dynamic pressure and you
have to relieve wind shear loads on the aero

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.610
surfaces.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:25.240
Basically, when the boosters are firing, from
the crew's point of view, it is hands-off.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.209
There is now way that you could take manual
control over the boosters.

00:16:29.209 --> 00:16:30.670
There is just too much power.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:37.790
And just a little bit of deviation from your
course and you will break up aerodynamically.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:42.449
It is hands-off.

00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:49.329
The fuel cells are generating all of the power.

00:16:49.329 --> 00:16:57.269
The guidance, navigation and control is being
done inside the Shuttle and the results are

00:16:57.269 --> 00:17:00.560
sent to the solid boosters.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.079
The gimbals can move.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:08.900
So the roll maneuver, for instance, is done
by the solid engines.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.580
How do the solids gimbal?

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.890
The solids can gimbal, yeah.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.620
How do they gimbal?

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.371
The same way as the main engines.

00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:23.909
I mean they are on a mounting with hydraulic
actuators.

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:26.819
And so the actuators expand and contract.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:36.029
And you can imagine the forces that are involved
there because these are 2.5 million pound

00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:37.120
thrust engines.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:46.240
It is pretty amazing.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.770
Going through maximum dynamic pressure, SRB
separation, main engine cutoff, basically

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.570
the same systems are working.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:18:02.110
The critical things are, of course, the main
engine has to be throttleable.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:08.179
This was a big challenge, as we heard, in
making the main engine.

00:18:08.179 --> 00:18:11.010
It is throttleable for two reasons.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.059
Going through a maximum dynamic pressure.

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:22.909
And at that point, the solids are also, you
know, the way the solid propellant is loaded,

00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:28.630
the actual cross-sectional profile is such
that you don't have a constant thrust profile.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:33.850
The thrust profile is very high right at liftoff
where you need a lot of thrust.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:38.360
It falls off as you're going through maximum
dynamic pressure.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:48.799
And then it builds up as you burn through
the last two minutes of SRB firing.

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:55.779
The Shuttle is pulling about 2.5 Gs at SRB
cutoff.

00:18:55.779 --> 00:19:02.549
The aerodynamic separation of the solids got
a lot of attention.

00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:09.820
To have a re-contact would be a disaster,
so you have four separation motors, two at

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:16.660
the top and two at the bottom which basically
push the solid boosters away from the Shuttle.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:26.390
And, of course, those motors are pointed right
at the Shuttle in order to move the boosters

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.390
away.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.880
It is pretty spectacular when you're inside,
especially at night.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:40.930
They are little solid rocket motors and they
are firing right at you so visually it's spectacular.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:49.679
But it also, unfortunately, leaves kind of
a nasty coating on the front windshield most

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:52.970
of which luckily gets burned off during reentry.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:20:00.010
But the pilots were a little bit concerned
that that might hurt their visibility in landing,

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.500
particularly if you had a bad sun angle.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:12.100
They always try to consider the sun angle
for landing, as well as winds.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.059
After SRBs come off, now you're back to about
one G.

00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:21.909
You have second-stage guidance, which is closed
loop.

00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:27.390
You're sensing acceleration and orientation.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:38.669
Nowadays they often fire the OMS engines for
part of liftoff as well just to get a little

00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:45.330
extra oomph when they're going up to the Space
Station, so that's another system which is

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:52.100
brought into play during ascent.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:21:00.370
Then you get into, after MECO, 8.5, 8.75 minutes.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:11.279
Now you have to get rid of the external tank
and you've got a lot to do basically to power

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:12.670
down the main engines.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:17.409
Remember, you have been burning liquid oxygen,
liquid hydrogen.

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:22.440
You've got a tremendous amount of ice which
forms in the engine.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.690
I have some pictures to show you of what that
looks like when you get into orbit.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:34.200
Also, you've got thousands of pounds of hydrogen
and oxygen left inside the pipes.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:42.460
And if you just close your valves, eventually
that will all vaporize, build up pressure

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.090
and actually could cause an explosion.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:51.580
One of the first things that you have to do,
when you get into orbit, is to vent the main

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.570
propulsion system.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.240
Let's see.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:06.370
Actually, Professor Cohen did not put on RCS
here, which is absolutely critical, because

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:11.640
you have explosive bolts to separate you from
the external tank.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.130
But basically the external tank has no propulsion
on its own so you, on the Shuttle, have to

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.130
fly away from it.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.159
So you use your plus Z.

00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:23.510
That is the downward thrusters.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:28.001
Remember we talked about how the Shuttle has
two RCS systems.

00:22:28.001 --> 00:22:34.929
It has the primary systems which have about
850 pounds of thrust for each thruster.

00:22:34.929 --> 00:22:39.529
And then once you're in orbit and you don't
have to do a lot of propulsive maneuvering,

00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:45.529
then we shut down the primaries and we use
the verniers which only have 25 pounds.

00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:46.990
That takes a lot less fuel.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:54.610
But those primary thrusters we use not only
the ones in the aft but in the forward so

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.929
that you have balanced thrust.

00:22:55.929 --> 00:23:02.970
If you're trying to move away from the external
tank you want to fire the thrusters both in

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.779
the nose and in the tail so that you move
straight up.

00:23:06.779 --> 00:23:09.360
Well, we're sitting up in the nose.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.880
And when those thrusters go off, I mean I've
never been in a war or a battle, but it strikes

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.000
me that the sound is what you would get if
mortar shells were exploding around you.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.620
I mean it is just a boom.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:32.309
And right after riding through launch, the
first thing that happens is you go weightless.

00:23:32.309 --> 00:23:37.309
But then the next thing is you're hearing
these explosions all around you.

00:23:37.309 --> 00:23:39.679
And it can be quite exciting.

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:43.110
Actually, I will just share a story with you.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:51.390
On my first flight, they decided to do a special
kind of a test.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:58.799
There are fill and drain valves for the main
engine on the side of the Shuttle.

00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:05.570
Usually we vent the propulsion out through
the engines themselves, but they wanted to

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.420
look for a quicker way to do it.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.659
Let's see.

00:24:08.659 --> 00:24:13.170
This was the sixteenth Shuttle flight, which
was my first flight, and they gave us what

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:20.080
they call a detailed test objective where
right after external tank separation we opened

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.990
the side fill and drain valve.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:30.781
And I remember the commander asked some of
the guidance and control people is the Shuttle

00:24:30.781 --> 00:24:36.539
RCS going to be able to compensate for the
extra thrust that you get?

00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:40.490
They said, yeah, no problem, we've done the
calculations and it looks fine.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:45.909
And this is the reason why you do tests because,
in fact, what happened was we came off the

00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:53.150
tank, opened the fill and drain valve and
the Shuttle rolled over 90 degrees and the

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:59.700
RCS jets started going like crazy to try to
correct us.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.380
They were in a force fight.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:09.280
After about 15 seconds the pilot said to the
commander, do you think I should shut the

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.799
valve, because the noise was incredible.

00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:16.090
Like I say, it was like you were in the middle
of a battlefield.

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:20.289
And at that point the commander said, well,
it's too late now because we had gotten through

00:25:20.289 --> 00:25:21.419
most of the disturbance.

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:27.320
And we did recover and got to normal attitude,
but it was pretty exciting.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:35.429
The point is that at that point you are in
a transitional state.

00:25:35.429 --> 00:25:40.370
Your computers are still in the launch configuration.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.909
You have your primary RCS.

00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:54.330
And what you have to do is transform the Shuttle
now into an on-orbit configuration.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.289
The Shuttle computers are so ancient.

00:25:57.289 --> 00:26:04.179
Has anyone here ever, never mind used an overlay
technique, but, even heard of computer overlays?

00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:08.470
No, I didn't think so.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:15.450
Back in the old days when computers had rather
small memory and you had to run large programs,

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:20.919
what you would do is you would have your entire
program, well, originally it was on punch

00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:23.010
cards and then eventually on magnetic tape.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:29.919
But you would segment your program and then
you would load the first part of your program

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:31.789
as much as you could fit into memory.

00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:39.100
Run that, save the results, load the second
part, transfer the results, run on that and

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.429
so on.

00:26:40.429 --> 00:26:43.289
Well, believe it or not, that's the way the
Shuttle computers still operate.

00:26:43.289 --> 00:26:45.780
It is an overlay system.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:53.200
They cannot hold all the software for the
entire flight so we have a launch overlay,

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.779
an ascent, an on-orbit and an entry.

00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:04.269
Now, the backup flight system is stripped
down.

00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:09.020
And so the backup computers hold the software
for the entire mission, but there are a lot

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.429
of things that they don't do that the main
computers do.

00:27:13.429 --> 00:27:22.570
What you actually have to do is perform what
they call a major mode transition, which basically

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:30.850
means you punch a few buttons, tell the computers
to go into orbit mode and then all the screens

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:31.850
go blank.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.059
I mean it is a very kind of a strange feeling.

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:38.081
And you just have to sort of hold your hands
and not touch anything for about a minute

00:27:38.081 --> 00:27:43.440
or so while the tape recorders are spinning
down in the guts of the Shuttle and they're

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.630
loading the stuff onto the Shuttle computers.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:55.510
Now, I think they upgraded the tape recorders
to solid state, I believe.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.679
That's correct, isn't it?

00:27:57.679 --> 00:27:58.971
Do you know that?

00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:05.620
I don't think they use tape recorders in the
Shuttle anymore, but they did, in any case,

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.630
at the beginning.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:18.470
I mean just maintaining this computer system
has been a big challenge.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:26.460
And then you get into the orbit configuration.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:33.130
In the ascent configuration your vernier RCS
isn't even enabled.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:38.980
And inside the ascent configuration, of course,
you have not just your nominal ascent but

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:44.940
you have all of the launch abort modes or
return to launch site, transatlantic abort

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:50.830
and abort to orbit or abort once around.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:56.330
All that gets flushed, and now you are on-orbit.

00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:02.679
Your on-orbit software does not give you the
ability to do entry and landing.

00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:08.170
You are going to have to re-do another overlay
or what we call major mode transition before

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.170
you do that.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.170
Yeah?

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:19.480
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] There are several different
landings spots, right?

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.480
Right.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:31.389
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] There is always one picked
as a prime, but you have the ability to re-designate

00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:36.890
depending on where in the ascent you run into
a problem.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:45.929
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] All options are available,
but there always is a prime transatlantic

00:29:45.929 --> 00:29:50.870
abort site which is chosen.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:58.370
And usually what happens is, I mean there
are several transatlantic launch sites, sometimes

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.659
one or more of them is down because of weather.

00:30:00.659 --> 00:30:05.350
And, in fact, if all of them are down, even
if the weather is perfect in Florida, you

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:11.690
scrub because you need to have an abort site.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:12.690
OK.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:56.950
I am going to show you a video now.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:57.950
OK.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:08.660
I will try to walk you through some of these.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:15.570
Remember that is the water deluge to stop
the shockwave coming back.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.830
Now you have the stage combustion.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:21.231
These are the OMS engines, the RCS and the
main engines.

00:31:21.231 --> 00:31:27.009
Remember we talked about the off-angle thrust.

00:31:27.009 --> 00:31:35.750
Those are the bolts which hold the solid boosters
down.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:42.659
All eight of them have to fire at exactly
the moment of SRB ignition.

00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:47.830
If you watch closely, when you see it go up,
you can actually see it sort of moving that

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:55.389
way, again, because of the off-angle thrust
of the main engine.

00:31:55.389 --> 00:32:06.299
This is the roll maneuver which puts you -- You
go over on your back, headed towards the proper

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:12.210
orbit.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:19.049
And then, as you go through max dynamic pressure
and break mach one, you often get those condensation

00:32:19.049 --> 00:32:27.450
trails.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.960
This is a pilot's eye view now of a Shuttle
launch.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.769
This is speeded up by a factor of two.

00:32:35.769 --> 00:32:44.769
That was the roll maneuver and the Florida
coastline.

00:32:44.769 --> 00:32:50.799
And I always thought one of the amazing things
was actually how fast the blue sky turns black

00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:52.231
as you are going up.

00:32:52.231 --> 00:32:59.169
SRB separation, you're up at an altitude of
about 20 miles.

00:32:59.169 --> 00:33:07.010
And you can see up there that very quickly
the blue sky of earth is turning into the

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:11.309
black of space.

00:33:11.309 --> 00:33:17.169
This launch was a high inclination launch
so they were actually going into a 58 degree

00:33:17.169 --> 00:33:20.260
orbit, so they flew literally right up the
Eastern seaboard.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:36.669
AUDIENCE QUESTION

00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:40.120
It was a SpaceLab mission, I believe, and
one of the things they were going to do was

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:44.900
observe the earth so they wanted to get into
as high an inclination as possible.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:51.750
Remember when Bass Redd was talking about
the aerodynamics of the Shuttle he said that

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:56.909
one of the things that they never were able
to get quite right was the plume.

00:33:56.909 --> 00:34:02.600
And he talked a lot about the angle of the
skirt and how that affects the aerodynamics

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.309
of the plume.

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:11.419
And you can watch how the plume is continually
changing as you are getting higher in the

00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:16.349
atmosphere and you have less and less pressure.

00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:22.260
You also notice some of the flames are getting
sucked back.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:28.010
In between the Shuttle and the external tank,
of course that is where we had the problems

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:33.240
with the foam shutoff, you've got supersonic
shockwaves bouncing around.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.329
It is a very, very nasty environment in there.

00:34:37.329 --> 00:34:43.550
And you see, when the external tank comes
off, often there is a lot of area here which

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:47.460
is charred and burned out just because of
the shocks.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:53.490
You can see now that the plumes are tremendously
expanded.

00:34:53.490 --> 00:35:01.310
The other thing that you can -- Well, I will
wait until SRB separation.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:08.000
As I say, you are up to about 2.5 Gs at this
point, and now you can see that the solids

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.200
are starting to tail off.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:17.560
You can see a qualitative difference in the
flame pattern.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.339
And now you can definitely feel this inside.

00:35:20.339 --> 00:35:23.369
You see the separation motors.

00:35:23.369 --> 00:35:25.720
The boosters fall off.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.380
And, as you know, they were recovered.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:35.579
Making sure that the thrust tail-off matches,
as we heard, was critical.

00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:42.230
Now here is a picture from a belly camera
of the boosters falling off.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:47.010
Now the main engines are firing.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:36:01.770
When this happens -- I don't know if you have
seen pictures of Saturn launches.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:08.220
They actually have some of the most beautiful
patterns of the reentering plumes.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:13.840
But the plumes, as you get up into a vacuum,
the exhaust plume expands.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:24.190
And it actually folds back around the vehicle
which is not a danger to the vehicle, but

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.690
visually can be quite spectacular.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:35.680
On the first night launch of the Shuttle -- During
the day the plume is so faint that you really

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.170
cannot see it from outside the windows.

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:43.700
From the ground you can see the bright points
when you're looking right at the tail of the

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.960
Shuttle but you don't actually see the plumes.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:55.481
But the second flight engineer who has a good
view out the overhead window, about five minutes

00:36:55.481 --> 00:37:01.560
into launch he asked the pilot, who is in
charge of looking after the main propulsion

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.869
system, is everything OK with the engines?

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:07.020
Yeah, everything is OK.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.680
In about six minutes, everything OK with the
engines?

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.109
Yeah.

00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:21.450
And after they were on-orbit the pilot asked
him why did you keep asking me about the engines?

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.560
Everything was fine.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:29.130
Well, apparently the guy had been looking
out the overhead window and had seen flames

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:33.210
starting to come out which is essentially
the expanding plume.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:38.400
Of course it was the first night launch so
nobody had ever seen that on the Shuttle before.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.030
And so you're always looking for something
off nominal.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:49.829
But, as it turned out, it is just normal plume
behavior.

00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:58.859
Now we've got a few minutes riding on the
main engine to build up to orbital velocity.

00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:00.710
Essentially, we are flying up the Eastern
seaboard.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:04.770
And it will give you some sense of the acceleration.

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:10.020
Hopefully, you will recognize some of the
geography.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:18.910
When they talk about taking the Shuttle from
Washington to Boston or back, this is the

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:25.060
real thing.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:37.579
It takes about 8 minutes, 8.5 minutes, to
get from Cape Canaveral to Cape Cod.

00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:39.250
There is Long Island coming up.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:45.880
I heard Plattsburgh, New York was an alternate
landing site?

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.880
Yeah.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.940
We are really moving at this point.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:53.791
You're going about five miles a second orbital
velocity.

00:38:53.791 --> 00:38:55.400
There is Cape Cod.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:10.470
And now you will see a little bit of a pitch
as we separate from the tank.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:25.829
And here, again, is the belly camera as the
tank comes off.

00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:28.660
And you can see these little charred patterns
in here.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:36.570
That is where the big piece of foam came off
which destroyed the Columbia.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:58.830
We've talked about, for its orbital operation,
it was all the different things that the Shuttle

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:03.089
was supposed to do that really drove the design.

00:40:03.089 --> 00:40:08.380
Speaking of which, how did things go last
Thursday?

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.359
Colonel Young gave the lecture on the military.

00:40:12.359 --> 00:40:19.730
I haven't had a chance to talk with him yet
but hopefully maybe he had some new insights.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:25.809
I know we talked a lot already about military
requirements.

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:35.261
But, in addition to launching large satellites,
of course we have repaired satellites, we

00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:41.290
have done science experiments, we have done
a lot of educational activities.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:48.119
And I am not going to deal with those subsystems
so much now.

00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:59.130
Remember that the computers now really don't
deal with the main propulsion system anymore.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:06.681
The only thing that you have to be concerned
about generally in orbit you still have to

00:41:06.681 --> 00:41:14.980
maintain thermal control over all of the parts
of the Shuttle, so the thermal subsystem is

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.980
very critical.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.069
We talked about the problems with hydrazine.

00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:27.460
If hydrazine freezes and then it expands when
it thaws it can break the lines.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.290
Hydrazine leaks are very nasty.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:37.650
We had one instance on a Shuttle flight where
one of the thrusters did develop a leak, and

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:49.000
you could just see the exhaust coming out
of it until they shut off the isolation valve.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:57.390
There are several sets of RCS thrusters, each
of which is connected to the tanks by a set

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:00.450
of isolation valves.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:05.010
You have essentially triple redundancy in
your reaction control system.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:10.990
And if any one of the systems develops a leak
you can isolate individual thrusters to tell

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:18.750
them not to fire if it's a leak which only
occurs when you fire it, or you can shut down

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:22.559
an isolation valve for an entire set of jets.

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:29.119
I won't go into great details but we talked
about the importance of redundancy.

00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:34.740
And that is one of the ways that it is built
in.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.740
Let's see.

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:39.660
What else do we want to say about subsystems
during orbit?

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:49.530
What are some of the other subsystems which
get called into play for orbital operations?

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:50.740
Environmental subsystems.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.740
Environmental.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:56.119
Is that controlled by the computer or is that
kind of done separate and automated?

00:42:56.119 --> 00:42:59.730
A little bit of both.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:09.910
For instance, pressure valves are mechanical
so they will open at a specific pressure mechanically.

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:21.630
If you have an overpressure or you set your,
we have different settings.

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:24.800
The normal setting is for sea 0:43:20.526
level atmosphere.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.359
And, of course, you have to balance the oxygen
and the nitrogen.

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:33.200
And so there is a fairly complex algorithm.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.940
Well, it is fairly simple, I suppose.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:41.220
But there is an algorithm which senses both
the overall pressure and the oxygen partial

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:47.079
pressure so that if your pressure goes down
a little bit, the system has to know whether

00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:52.839
to open up the oxygen valve or the nitrogen
valve.

00:43:52.839 --> 00:44:00.550
Also, if we are going to be doing extended
space walks, and I will be giving a talk on

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:06.870
the airlock and the spacesuit and the other
systems that get involved in space walks,

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:12.130
so I won't go into that in detail here, but
we actually have to bring the cabin down to

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:16.309
two-thirds of an atmosphere, 10.2 pounds per
square inch.

00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:22.080
We keep the partial pressure of oxygen at
sea level so that raises the oxygen concentration

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.080
to about 30%.

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:28.830
And the reason we do that is to purge the
nitrogen out of our bodies so that you don't

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:35.720
get the bends when you go down to the 4 psi,
at pure oxygen, which is what we run our suits

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.470
at.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:51.000
At that point, we actually have to trick the
system because they didn't build in a 10.2

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
controller.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.150
They have a 14.7 psi controller.

00:44:56.150 --> 00:45:01.340
But, in any case, that we control manually.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:08.790
And we basically bring the cabin down to 10.2
psi.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.900
Humidity control, we have the water system.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:20.119
Of course, we make a lot of water with our
fuel cells for the electrical power system.

00:45:20.119 --> 00:45:22.400
There are five different water tanks.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.250
One of the tanks is sterilized for drinking.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:31.480
In the early days they put too much iodine
in the water.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:35.430
In fact, when I came back from my first flight
my teeth were totally brown.

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:40.230
The dentist had a fit, and they actually have
cut back on that.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.339
And the water is actually reasonably palatable
at this point.

00:45:43.339 --> 00:45:47.210
You couldn't drink it early on unless you
mixed it with Kool-Aid or Tang or something,

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:51.849
which is even worse, but that's another story.

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:58.770
The rest of the water tanks, there is just
a lot more water than anybody can drink, and

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:02.859
so those are called supply water tanks.

00:46:02.859 --> 00:46:06.730
And we use that water for cooling.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:10.480
Remember that is another part of the environmental
control system.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.131
We have talked about all of these a little
bit.

00:46:13.131 --> 00:46:17.210
This is just kind of a review.

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:22.270
Remember that during ascent, once you get
above 100,000 feet and during the early time

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:29.420
on-orbit, we get rid of excess heat by water
boiler.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:40.800
Now, it is an interesting system, a multi-component
system.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:48.069
Out in the cargo bay we use Freon to bring
the heat through the radiators.

00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:54.400
First it goes through the radiators, and so
once the payload bay doors are open, particularly

00:46:54.400 --> 00:47:00.770
if you're pointed away from the sun, you can
radiate a lot of heat.

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:08.960
After the Freon runs through the radiators,
if it is still hot, you can activate the water

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.960
boilers.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.869
And so if the payload bay doors are closed
or if there is some problem with the radiators

00:47:14.869 --> 00:47:19.010
and you need excess cooling capacity you activate
the water spray boilers.

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:28.920
Now the water boilers, if that is your only
cooling system, they use water at a rate faster

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.609
than the fuel cells produce it.

00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:37.309
If you cannot get your payload bay doors open
-- and that is part of the whole mechanisms,

00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:43.330
remember, which Henry Pohl talked about -- if
you cannot get your payload doors open within

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:49.890
a few hours, you have to turn around and come
home because you will run out of water.

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:54.309
Now, on the other hand, how do you get the
heat out of the crew cabin?

00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:59.530
You don't want Freon running around the crew
cabin because it is nasty stuff if you develop

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.500
a leak.

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:06.040
There are actually two ways.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:12.990
First of all, you circulate the cabin air
which gets heated up both by the people and

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.270
the electronics.

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:20.160
And you run the cabin air through a heat exchanger
where it dumps its heat into a cold water

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.160
loop.

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:26.369
And the cold water loop takes cabin heat,
and then the cold water loop is also circulated

00:48:26.369 --> 00:48:27.671
by some of the electronics.

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:31.000
Some of the electronics are air-cooled.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:39.579
And, of course, there is no density driven
thermal convection in weightlessness.

00:48:39.579 --> 00:48:43.349
You have to have forced-air convection, so
there are fans all over the place blowing

00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:52.079
air at the electronics and at the crew as
well.

00:48:52.079 --> 00:49:00.130
And these are all small fans running at very
high RPM and so they tend to be very noisy.

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:08.640
In fact, the typical environment in a space
cabin is dominated by high-pitched fan noise.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:16.730
In fact, it gets so bad that in the Russian
Mir, we found this once US astronauts starting

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:22.000
to fly up there, it was actually causing permanent
hearing damage in a lot of crew members.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:30.190
And people were having to wear earplugs or
headphones while they were working near some

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:31.190
of the equipment.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:39.230
From a human factors point of view, to have
earplugs in and then somebody tries to call

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:42.859
to you from the next module because there
is an emergency, that is not a good deal.

00:49:42.859 --> 00:49:45.369
Yeah.

00:49:45.369 --> 00:49:52.900
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] No.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:50:00.251
There are a lot of electrical signals up there
because the crew uses wireless headsets, but

00:50:00.251 --> 00:50:03.470
everything is checked for electromagnetic
compatibility.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:08.450
And, in fact, if you try to fly a payload
on the Shuttle or the Station, you have to

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:16.460
pass a lot of EMC compatibility testing.

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:21.000
Anyway, the water from the cabin, which is
taking the heat both from the air and the

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:28.490
electronics, is then taken out of the cabin
and passed through a water Freon heat exchanger.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:33.890
And then the Freon takes the heat further
aft where it is dumped into the radiator or

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:40.760
the water spray boiler.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:45.059
Cabin air revitalization.

00:50:45.059 --> 00:50:47.299
We re-breathe the air.

00:50:47.299 --> 00:50:52.730
It's not like in scuba diving where you take
a breath of air and then you just blow it

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:53.730
all away.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:59.040
We cannot afford that so the air is re-breathed,
which means you have to scrub out the carbon

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.040
dioxide.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:08.290
The Shuttle is not designed for long duration,
and so we use lithium hydroxide scrubbers,

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:13.670
lithium hydroxide plus carbon dioxide makes
lithium carbonate plus water plus heat.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:20.540
And so those are canisters which have to be
replaced twice a day.

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:27.511
And, in fact, the preparation for replacing
the lithium hydroxide scrubbers is you have

00:51:27.511 --> 00:51:38.839
to turn the cabin fans off so you don't get
a lot of air going through the cylinders where

00:51:38.839 --> 00:51:41.140
you put the scrubbers.

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:48.990
For that one minute, you can actually appreciate
the peace and quiet of being in orbit.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:52.201
And then you turn the fans on again and you
realize how noisy it is.

00:51:52.201 --> 00:51:57.510
Because, after a while, you get used to it
and you don't hear the noise until you turn

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.530
it off.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:02.150
So, that's air revitalization system.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:03.780
Humidity separation.

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:12.990
You're pumping out a lot of humidity in your
sweat, and that is put through a cooler and

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:17.441
essentially a centrifugal, they call it a
slinger which gets rid of the water.

00:52:17.441 --> 00:52:23.210
And that goes into the wastewater tank, along
with urine from the waste collection system.

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:24.700
And that is also dumped overboard.

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:34.319
There are separate dumps for the supply water
and the waste water.

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:43.180
And, when the water is dumped overboard, of
course up in orbit the pressure is below the

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:47.950
triple point of water so liquid water cannot
exist.

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:55.150
You either have gaseous water vapor or ice.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:53:04.890
And so, as soon as the water comes out the
wastewater dump valve, it solidifies.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:10.559
And you get essentially a snowstorm blowing
away from you.

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:16.960
And, if the sun is lighting it up in just
the right way, it can be quite spectacular.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:22.950
If I have time, I will show you a picture
of that.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:23.950
Let's see.

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:25.030
Other on-orbit systems?

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:29.750
Of course, we have the payload systems.

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:37.490
We talked about the remote manipulator, the
robotic arm.

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:47.230
Anything else?

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:59.970
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] The crew uses lots of
checklists and cue cards.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:08.589
Typically, the center of the front cockpit
has mostly the airplane-type controls which

00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:10.510
you use for flying the Shuttle.

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:13.869
The systems controls tend to be around the
sides.

00:54:13.869 --> 00:54:19.970
And then the controls for doing rendezvous
and operating payloads are in the aft part

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:21.400
of the cockpit.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:28.589
The forward center cockpit is not used very
much when you're on-orbit.

00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:31.760
Overhead panels is mostly OMS and RCS.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:36.330
And then electrical stuff is over the right.

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:41.270
And environmental control is over on the left.

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:49.190
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Yes.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:55.820
During the early phases of the rendezvous,
when you cannot see anything, typically the

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.710
commander and the pilot will sit in the front
seats.

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:05.910
But once you get close enough to have visual
contact, you typically don't approach straight

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:13.840
on, you typically approach with your payload
bay pointing towards the object you're rendezvousing

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.840
with.

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:19.559
That way the rendezvous radar can pick it
up.

00:55:19.559 --> 00:55:28.400
There is a rendezvous radar system, KU band
radar, which is on the starboard side.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.970
And there are also star trackers which can
pick it up when it is farther away.

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:36.520
And then visually you just look out the overhead
windows.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:44.369
And so you control the final phases of the
rendezvous, which we call proximity operations,

00:55:44.369 --> 00:55:45.369
from the aft flight deck.

00:55:45.369 --> 00:55:48.760
And there is a controller stick there.

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:53.339
And, actually, it is interesting.

00:55:53.339 --> 00:55:54.940
This is part of the human factors.

00:55:54.940 --> 00:56:03.400
Both for controlling the manipulator arm and
the Shuttle, there is a switch.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:09.261
For instance, there is a translational hand
controller and a rotational hand controller.

00:56:09.261 --> 00:56:20.940
The translational is to make the Orbiter go
in plus or minus X, Z or Y.

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:28.550
Normally, you think of the Shuttle, when you
push the stick back, you want the Shuttle

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.829
to go in the direction of the stick.

00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:36.520
And so that would be a plus or minus X, which
is along the long axis of the Shuttle.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.990
And that is the way the forward controller
works.

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:42.510
And you can set the back controller up so
that it is just the inverse of the forward

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:46.130
controller so, when you push on the stick,
the Shuttle goes backwards.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:53.230
But, when you are actually looking out the
window and you see the object -- the Space

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:58.280
Station, or Hubble or whatever you're rendezvousing
with -- is ahead of you and you want to go

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:01.289
towards it, you would like to be able to push
the stick.

00:57:01.289 --> 00:57:16.740
And so what they've done is, 
here is the upper window, they have the stick

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.460
actually at an angle.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:25.880
Depending on how you set the switch, you can
make it so that when you push on that stick

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:34.170
it gives you a minus X or you can put it in
the Z mode so when you push the stick it gives

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:37.910
you a minus Z.

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:40.440
And that is a nice human factor.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:48.980
They have a similar situation for the manipulator
arm.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:58:01.510
On the end of the end effector, when you're
coming into a grapple fixture, there are actually

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:03.619
three wires inside the end effector.

00:58:03.619 --> 00:58:13.289
And those actually are moved around like so,
so that they tighten up over the little knob.

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:17.720
But there is a camera up here.

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:27.240
And then above the grapple fixture there is
kind of a bull's-eye with a little stick on

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.470
it.

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:31.059
The stick is like this.

00:58:31.059 --> 00:58:39.160
And if you're off to the side a little bit
you can see by the angle on the stick both

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:45.349
how you are in translation and in the attitude
of the end effector.

00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:50.609
The thing is when you're actually flying the
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) and you're looking out the

00:58:50.609 --> 00:58:59.250
window, I might want to be able to push the
translational hand controller and the end

00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:02.069
effector will move away from me in the cargo
bay.

00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:05.200
That is called a Shuttle Coordinate Mode.

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.770
And they have a nice setup.

00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:11.940
Again, this was from a lot of human factor
studies.

00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:17.200
You can then go into a different mode when
you're actually bringing the end effector

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:22.260
right up to the docking fixture where you
switch over into what they call end-effector

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.260
mode.

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:35.250
Now, I am actually looking in the television
picture and I see this image.

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:39.339
And I want to correct it and I want to move
to the side a little bit and go in, but I

00:59:39.339 --> 00:59:42.839
want to do that in the frame of reference
of the end effector.

00:59:42.839 --> 00:59:47.710
And so by going into end-effector mode, when
I'm working the translational and rotational

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:52.119
hand controller, it actually works around
that coordinate system.

00:59:52.119 --> 00:59:57.640
And there are actually two other coordinate
systems for different types of payload operations.

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:09.660
They have done a lot of work in these systems
essentially to use computer-assisted modes

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:16.710
to make it easier to operate both the robotic
and also the Shuttle rendezvous and docking

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:17.710
system.

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:22.660
What else do we want to say about on-orbit?

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.849
That will probably do it.

01:00:24.849 --> 01:00:29.190
Let's take a two-minute break and then we
will move ahead to entry.

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:36.309
Enough of a stretch.

01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:37.309
Yeah?

01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:45.760
Before we leave the on-orbit part, how much
of the crews' time was taken up with changing

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:55.960
the carbon dioxide scrubbers, dumping wastewater,
just the general like you've got to do it

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.369
to survive stuff versus [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

01:00:59.369 --> 01:01:13.890
Typically one person can take care of most
of the on-orbit just maintenance activities.

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:22.690
You have to do things like periodically check
your filters.

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:26.860
Every one or two days you have to go through
with a vacuum cleaner and clear your filters.

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:30.021
You have to change the lithium hydroxide.

01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:34.990
There you want somebody to help to turn off
the cabin fans while the person downstairs

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:40.089
is changing them out.

01:01:40.089 --> 01:01:43.760
Periodically clean the toilet.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.930
Prepare food.

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:52.040
I would say more or less one person around
the clock can take care of most of the things

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.190
that have to get done, if nothing goes wrong.

01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:56.700
You kind of alternate between crew members?

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:57.700
Yeah.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:05.069
Typically, you can have either a one shift
or a two shift flight, depending on whether

01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:08.510
your payload requires 24-hour operations.

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:17.170
And typically the pilot and the commander
are considered to be the Orbiter crew, and

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:20.070
so they will take care of Orbiter-related
things.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:28.029
And other people concentrate more on the payload
or doing space walks or whatever the mission

01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:30.359
is about.

01:02:30.359 --> 01:02:35.859
Everybody is more or less trained to perform
maintenance activities so you can share the

01:02:35.859 --> 01:02:48.619
load, but typically with a crew of six or
seven you have the luxury of specialization.

01:02:48.619 --> 01:02:49.619
Let's see.

01:02:49.619 --> 01:02:55.849
I spoke at length about what goes on during
entry so I am not going to go through all

01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:56.849
that again.

01:02:56.849 --> 01:03:01.849
I will just run the video here to remind you.

01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:11.070
But do remember, again, before you are ready
to do your de-orbit burn once again you have

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:15.490
to reconfigure your computer system.

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:21.330
Again, everybody gets in their seats, hands-off
because you don't want to throw any switches,

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:25.609
and you definitely don't want to touch the
computer while it is going through this major

01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:26.760
mode reconfiguration.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:31.140
It is sort of like when your computer is booting
up, you don't want to mess with anything around.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.660
You just keep your hands off.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:47.599
Once you are in the de-orbit and entry major
mode, that is actually then subdivided into

01:03:47.599 --> 01:03:54.250
sub-modes where one of the software loads
controls your de-orbit burn and then another

01:03:54.250 --> 01:04:00.150
one is in effect while you are essentially
in free fall before you hit the atmosphere.

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:06.279
And then, once you hit the atmosphere, you
go through a series of sub-modes depending

01:04:06.279 --> 01:04:07.390
on your altitude.

01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:15.270
And remember we spoke about how the flight
control system continually has to upgrade

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:21.230
its flight control laws depending on the atmospheric
condition, so you need to know your nav.

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:23.400
state.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:29.339
And then finally it switches into the final
approach and landing mode when you go around

01:04:29.339 --> 01:04:31.460
the heading alignment circle.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:35.440
That is the final step, which I don't think
we talked about.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.609
Remember I pointed out to you that since the
Shuttle is a glider that energy management

01:04:41.609 --> 01:04:44.130
is absolutely critical.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:48.030
And so you always come in with a little bit
more energy than you are going to need because

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:53.359
it is easier to bleed the energy off through
a series of S turns.

01:04:53.359 --> 01:05:01.230
And then they make the transition when you're
essentially mach 2 or mach 3 and you are over

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:07.190
the landing field, either in Florida or in
California.

01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:16.260
If this is your landing runway, a regular
airplane will typically do a downwind, a base

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:19.210
and then come in for a landing.

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:26.369
With the Shuttle, we actually want a much
larger pattern to give you more opportunity

01:05:26.369 --> 01:05:27.400
for energy control.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:35.670
At about 50,000 feet the Shuttle should be
essentially overhead.

01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:38.809
And then it makes a big spiral.

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:43.380
And, since you're in this big spiral, you
have the option of either making the spiral

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:47.980
slightly bigger or slightly smaller in order
to control your energy.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:53.730
If you're a little bit too hot, have too much
energy, then you make your spiral a little

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:54.730
bit bigger.

01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:57.779
If you are a little low on energy you make
your spiral smaller.

01:05:57.779 --> 01:06:10.660
But by having every landing end in this spiral
which you can adjust the radius, but the basic

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:15.539
procedure and navigation is not going to change
from flight to flight, so that makes the whole

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:19.859
training process much easier.

01:06:19.859 --> 01:06:28.490
You go into the so-called heading alignment
circle and the pilot does have energy displays

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:32.069
available so you get predictors.

01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:38.700
It tells you where you will be 30 seconds,
one minute and 90 seconds in the future.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:42.559
You get a vertical display showing your energy,
a horizontal display.

01:06:42.559 --> 01:06:47.680
Unfortunately, and this is something for the
people who are looking at displays, the horizontal

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.990
and the vertical displays are not well integrated.

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:57.260
In the talk that some of you heard on the
cockpit electronics upgrade, they had some

01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:01.500
plans to upgrade that and have a unified landing
display.

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.779
But at the moment we don't have that.

01:07:04.779 --> 01:07:12.200
There is active guidance so that there are
guidance needles which you can fly to.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:17.400
And, of course, the pilots are well enough
trained that they are using their out-the-window

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:23.170
cues as well to make sure that they get the
right visual picture just in case something

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:24.849
should be wrong with guidance.

01:07:24.849 --> 01:07:25.869
Yeah.

01:07:25.869 --> 01:07:31.010
This is a ways back.

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:42.670
How noticeable are the big changes in acceleration
during like SRB separation or de-tail?

01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:50.460
SRB separation, as I said, right before SRB
tail-off, F equals MA and the force is pretty

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:55.309
much constant at that point, but the mass
is decelerating because you're burning a ton

01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:58.900
of fuel, over a ton per second.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.630
So the acceleration is increasing.

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:07.539
And you've built up to about 2.5 Gs when the
SRBs finally tail-off.

01:08:07.539 --> 01:08:12.710
Then you drop down to about one G.

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:13.710
You're sitting in your seat.

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:15.839
This is one G into your chest.

01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:20.470
Remember at this point the Shuttle is kind
of upside down.

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:27.680
And, since you haven't achieved orbital velocity
yet, you still have some weight pulling you

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.680
out of the seat.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.490
But you are strapped into the seat.

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:33.890
And mostly you feel yourself pulled back into
the seat.

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:39.250
And, of course, as your velocity increases
and you get closer and closer to orbital velocity

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:45.950
then the downward acceleration to the earth
essentially matches more and more the acceleration

01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:49.870
of the Shuttle itself until, by the time you're
in orbit, you are in freefall.

01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:57.730
MECO is different.

01:08:57.730 --> 01:09:00.750
The same thing happens.

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:05.840
The main engines are working at maximum, well,
104% thrust.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:09.080
We don't take them up to the 109% which is
emergency only.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:17.110
They are working at 104% thrust and your acceleration
now starts to pick up.

01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:20.830
After about seven minutes you've gotten up
to 3 Gs.

01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:23.560
And the Shuttle was designed for a 3 G maximum.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:28.250
They wanted to have smooth, easy right for
the payloads.

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:35.730
And they also wanted to make it possible for
nonprofessional astronauts to fly on the Shuttle

01:09:35.730 --> 01:09:38.310
as well, the payload specialist scientists.

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:45.100
The engines start to throttle down in order
to hold your acceleration to 3 Gs.

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:53.430
And they throttle down eventually to about
65% right at MECO.

01:09:53.430 --> 01:10:02.390
So you are sitting in your seat pulling 3
Gs, eyeballs-in, for the last minute and a

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:03.390
half or so.

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:11.080
3 Gs is not particularly comfortable but,
on the other hand, any healthy person can

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.250
tolerate 3 Gs for a minute or two.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:17.330
It is not a real big deal.

01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:21.120
There have been concerns.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.250
If the pilots have to reach some of the overhead
switches to reconfigure the OMS or the RCS

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:31.471
at 3 Gs, could they actually reach it?

01:10:31.471 --> 01:10:38.770
And some of the shorter pilots decided, with
the Gs, they probably couldn't.

01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:45.140
And so they actually made a special tool,
we called it a swizzle stick.

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:52.040
It is an aluminum rod about, I don't know,
80 centimeters long, that has an interface

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.720
so you can actually use that.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.390
And you have a little mirror if you need it
as well so that you can flick the overhead

01:10:57.390 --> 01:10:59.990
switches when you're pulling Gs.

01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:05.100
You cannot ignore human factors in these things
when you're designing it.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.580
If you've really got to flip those switches.

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:11.391
And it is not just the problem of being able
to reach it.

01:11:11.391 --> 01:11:15.560
It's also you have a helmet on.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:21.180
And, when you're pulling 3 Gs, your helmet
which may have weighed 15 pounds now weighs

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.430
45 pounds.

01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:25.790
And so you really cannot move your head around
very much.

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:32.160
And so just being able to pull yourself away
from the seat and look up, you cannot do at

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.790
3 Gs.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:39.380
So you do need some assistance there.

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:51.970
In principle, for future designs, I would
think taking advantage of the ability to send

01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:57.080
commands through computers would make a lot
of that easier, if your computer is within

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.970
easy reach.

01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:05.890
This was the early days of fly-by-wire and
people felt that they really wanted to have

01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:07.870
a hard switch that they could throw.

01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:14.480
But, in fact, in most cases, not all, but
in most cases the switches go through the

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.560
computer system.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:20.330
And it is possible, in fact, to go into the
guts of the computer.

01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:23.081
And all the switches tend to be multiple pole.

01:12:23.081 --> 01:12:28.960
I am getting into some of the details now,
maybe more than ever wanted to know, but just

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.130
to give you an idea of the levels of redundancy
that they have.

01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:37.610
Every switch has multiple poles, and it is
possible that you can get a little solder

01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:46.270
ball or a little piece of wire or just one
of the pole units that stops working.

01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:53.170
You can actually call up that switch on the
computer and disable one or more of the poles

01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:57.940
or you can disable the entire switch and take
over computer control of the switch.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:00.600
Like I say, most of the switches work like
that.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.600
Not all of them.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:08.020
But it is very much a computer-controlled
system.

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:09.020
Yeah?

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:17.210
How does the acceleration compare to a de-orbit
burn?

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:20.150
De-orbit burn is interesting.

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:26.480
When two OMS engines fire they only produce
about a tenth of G acceleration.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:33.810
However, you have been weightless for a week,
a month, six months depending what your mission

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:34.810
has been.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:44.110
And I will tell you, the Shuttle is accelerating
forward, although you're actually going backwards.

01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:52.160
But internally, the Shuttle is accelerating
forward, so everything wants to go aft.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.960
And, in fact, it is kind of fun.

01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:03.250
We have done just experiments and taking pictures
of it where you can actually pour water at

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:08.520
a tenth of a G and watch the water slowly
go through an arc into a cup.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.970
And then, of course, you've got to get it
closed up before the burn stops.

01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:24.750
And you can take a little pencil and push
it in the y-axis and watch it gradually curve

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:25.750
as you're accelerating.

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:32.180
It is only a tenth of a G but, I will tell
you, it feels like you're pressed against

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:38.390
the wall if you're not sitting in your seat,
just because you haven't been experiencing

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:40.180
any acceleration for all that time.

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:45.561
And then it gets a lot worse, as you hit the
atmosphere.

01:14:45.561 --> 01:14:49.210
By that time hopefully you are sitting in
your seat.

01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:51.280
It is kind of interesting.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:57.390
What I tended to like to do is keep a pencil
sort of floating in front of me.

01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:02.580
And, after a while, you see very slowly the
pencil is starting to come down.

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:07.960
And then you would pick it up and then it
is coming a little faster.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:13.570
One of the early things that you realize,
you know, if you've seen pictures of people

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:16.230
in orbit, you're hands are always floating
up here.

01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:21.530
The same thing as if you go into a swimming
pool, just hold your breath and float under

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:22.830
water.

01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:27.630
Your natural total relaxed body position is
sort of bent over a little bit and your hands

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:28.630
are out front.

01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:29.630
Try it some time.

01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:33.300
It is quite relaxed, quite comfortable.

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.210
And it was a strange feeling.

01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:38.270
Again, I got used to it after my first entry.

01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:42.770
But the first time, when I realized that I
was sitting in my seat and my hands were actually

01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:46.100
in my lap, and that hadn't happened.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:50.900
I had realized all the time before that your
hands were sort of floating out there.

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:56.850
And then I reached for the camera to take
a picture out the window of the shockwaves

01:15:56.850 --> 01:16:02.270
behind the Shuttle, and all of a sudden it
has got weight.

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:08.920
It is amazing how the human mind can get used
to a very bizarre situation, you know, like

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:15.620
weightlessness, such that when you get back
it feels strange.

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:17.030
It doesn't stay strange for long.

01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:25.460
I mean you grew up in one G and your body
has a pretty good memory, so it doesn't take

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:26.460
long to get back.

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:33.470
But there are potential vestibular problems.

01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:38.270
We have people in the Manned Vehicle Lab who
have spent their lifetimes studying some of

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:40.910
these phenomena.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:48.050
A lot of your orientations for up or down
come from your inner ear, which have gravity

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:49.400
receptors.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.510
Well, those basically don't work very well.

01:16:52.510 --> 01:17:01.580
They don't work at all, because the little
bone particles inside there are basically

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:02.710
floating around.

01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:11.100
You don't get the proper feedback, but you
still get visual feedback and you get rotational

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.580
feedback from your inner ear.

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:22.250
And so your body has to essentially reprogram
the feedback loops so that you can maintain

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:24.260
your sense of orientation.

01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:26.540
And that leads to space sickness.

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:33.660
And about roughly two-thirds of people who
go up experience some form of space sickness.

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.870
It is sort of like seasickness.

01:17:35.870 --> 01:19:48.180
Anywhere from mild -- [LOST VIDEO AND AUDIO]
[LOST VIDEO AND AUDIO] -- the feeling ofweightlessness.

01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:56.120
But launch is really an overwhelming experience
with all the vibration and the power and the

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.430
acceleration and everything.

01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:05.080
And I remember thinking to myself at MECO
when I started floating, I thought now I'm

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.920
in an environment that I understand.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:17.870
Because I had had so many 135 parabolas that
the feeling of being weightless was not as

01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:20.710
overwhelmingly new as it otherwise might have
been.

01:20:20.710 --> 01:20:27.210
Although, what I realized after about a minute,
I was sort of holding onto the seat waiting

01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:28.210
for the pullout.

01:20:28.210 --> 01:20:33.870
That is when I realized, no, wait a minute,
no pullout, you're really in orbit.

01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:38.181
And that is when I got really excited and
sort of floated over to the window.

01:20:38.181 --> 01:20:44.450
And I basically couldn't wipe the smile off
my face for about seven days.

01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:46.120
Yeah?

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:54.460
What about the internal clock?

01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.400
Do you still have 24-hour days?

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.400
Yeah, basically.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:03.350
The sun rises and sets every 90 minutes.

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:09.231
What we try to do, this wasn't done in the
early Shuttle flights, but often you have

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:15.460
to launch at odd hours, if you're doing a
rendezvous particularly.

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:21.960
For instance, when we launched to repair Hubble,
the launch was 4:00 AM because that's when

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.860
Hubble happened to be flying over.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:31.811
Now 4:00 AM, typically your body is at about
its lowest point in the 24-hour cycle.

01:21:31.811 --> 01:21:34.250
You know, your basal metabolism, your temperature.

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:40.900
Not the condition you want to be in when you
go through a launch in case there is any problem.

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.781
What you want to do is adjust your sleep cycle.

01:21:43.781 --> 01:21:50.200
It is very hard to adjust your sleep cycle
when you have the sun rising and setting every

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:55.550
90 minutes because you don't get any light
feedback, but what we do is, starting a week

01:21:55.550 --> 01:22:01.000
before a launch, the crew goes into a medical
quarantine so that you don't get exposed to

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.140
any cold germs because you don't want to get
sick on-orbit.

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:14.400
And so at that time what they have done is
use some medical research over the last 20

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:24.790
years or so which indicates that bright lights,
at the right time of day, can actually help

01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:27.060
your body change to a new time zone.

01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:32.030
That's why they say when you fly over to Europe,
you fly overnight and you don't usually sleep

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:33.100
too much in the airplane.

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.530
You land early in the morning.

01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:40.290
And a lot of people then want to go to their
hotel and go to sleep for a while, but the

01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:43.711
doctors tell you that is the worst thing to
do as far as getting used to the new time

01:22:43.711 --> 01:22:44.711
zone.

01:22:44.711 --> 01:22:48.580
What you really want to do is go stay out
in the bright sunlight at a time when your

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:54.540
body thinks it should be dark, get the sunlight
into your brain.

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:55.540
And that is what we do.

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:59.230
In the quarantine quarters everything is white.

01:22:59.230 --> 01:23:00.870
The tables have white butcher paper.

01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:03.020
And the walls and the ceiling are white.

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:08.640
And there is essentially wall-to-wall fluorescent
lights on the ceiling.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.750
And so it is really bright.

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:13.820
I mean you have to wear sunglasses when you
first go in the room.

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:21.550
And it is too bright to watch television or
even to use your computer, but it works.

01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:28.230
And after about two days you are pretty much
accommodated to the new time.

01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:35.460
And then, if you want to go out during the
day when the sun is out but it is a time when

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:38.790
the sun shouldn't be out for the time you
are trying to switch to, you have to wear

01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:43.400
really, really dark sunglasses so you don't
get deprogrammed.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:53.320
The problem is sometimes when you're on-orbit,
because of the procession of orbits, you tend

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:58.400
to have to re-enter, on a short shuttle flight
-- this is different for the Space Station

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:07.120
-- but on a short Shuttle flight you typically
reenter a few hours earlier than your equivalent

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.050
launch time.

01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:14.760
And that means that you have to often do a
sleep shift in orbit.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:18.370
And that is much more difficult, particularly
if you try to shift earlier.

01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:23.110
It is relatively easy to stay awake for an
extra hour.

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:25.410
I mean everybody likes to lie in bed for an
extra hour.

01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:26.410
That is easy.

01:24:26.410 --> 01:24:32.100
But to go to bed an hour or two hours early
it is hard to get to sleep.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:35.520
And then you have to wake up two hours early,
that is difficult.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:38.770
But that typically is what you have to do.

01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:47.370
The medical people have actually imposed maximum
shifts both per day, per week and per month

01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:52.140
for how much the crew can be asked to shift
their sleep schedule.

01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:59.750
The Russians have another problem when they
do space walks because they don't have a full

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:05.140
equivalent of a TDRS system, tracking data
relay system, like we do.

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:13.250
They like to be doing their space walks when
they're making passes over Russia so that

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:15.290
they can get ground tracking.

01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:22.500
And so often when a Russian crew is preparing
for a space walk, they have to shift sometimes

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:23.861
by eight hours at a time.

01:25:23.861 --> 01:25:28.380
And it can be really tough on a crew to have
to do that.

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:29.840
If any of you have worked third shift.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:39.190
It's not like pulling an all-nighter where
the next day you go back onto your normal

01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:40.190
shift.

01:25:40.190 --> 01:25:45.200
To actually stay on a different shift for
three or four days at a time can be tough

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:48.400
when you don't have any light cues to accommodate
you.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.400
Yeah?

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.230
Just an observation that all those measures
to shift the sleep cycle are obsolete now

01:25:52.230 --> 01:26:01.900
with the no night launches, right?

01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:08.980
As long as there are no night launches that
is probably true.

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:15.130
And what that means, of course, is that they
can only launch to the Space Station at certain

01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:16.130
times of the year.

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:19.380
That is the price you pay.

01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:20.380
Yeah?

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:34.850
On the launch pad, what is supporting the
entire weight of the Orbiter?

01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:35.850
And, secondly, if you are on the mid-deck,
are there any windows?

01:26:35.850 --> 01:26:36.850
And, if not, can you see?

01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:37.850
I should bring in the launch bolts.

01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:38.850
I have a couple in my office.

01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:43.830
The entire weight of the Shuttle stack is
supported on the two solid rocket boosters,

01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:49.680
so the bottom skirts of the boosters are actually
sitting on the launch pad.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:27:00.230
And so on each of the boosters there are four
big nuts and bolts, four on each booster.

01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:03.810
They are explosive nuts.

01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:12.660
And at the moment that the solid rocket boosters
ignite, all eight of those nuts are split

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:16.540
in half so that the boosters can lift off.

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:20.230
Now, I asked the question what would happen
if one of them didn't go.

01:27:20.230 --> 01:27:25.230
And the answer was, well, we think that the
booster is strong enough that it would just

01:27:25.230 --> 01:27:28.860
rip it out, but nobody wants to find out.

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:34.790
Obviously, these are redundant explosive bolts
or nuts.

01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:41.090
They did have, on one flight, they found that
one or two of the redundant firing units did

01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:42.300
not fire.

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:44.400
And that got people's attention.

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.960
And I don't know what the final resolution
was.

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:54.210
But basically those bolts, you know, if there
is wind blowing and the Shuttle is rocking

01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:59.190
back and forth, all of that load is taken
through those bolts.

01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:04.670
The structure of the solid boosters has to
be able to accommodate that.

01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:07.690
You asked me another question as well.

01:28:07.690 --> 01:28:12.000
Oh, the mid-deck.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.330
The hatch, where the crew gets in, has a window
in it.

01:28:16.330 --> 01:28:23.200
Before Challenger, one seat in the mid-deck
was right next to the hatch.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:30.330
My first flight, I actually sat next to the
hatch during ascent downstairs but had a great

01:28:30.330 --> 01:28:32.870
view out the window.

01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:45.930
Now, after Challenger, we have an ejection
pole, a telescoping pole which is suspended

01:28:45.930 --> 01:28:46.930
from the ceiling.

01:28:46.930 --> 01:28:50.630
I think we talked about this before.

01:28:50.630 --> 01:28:57.820
If the Shuttle is in a situation where it
is in stable flight but you cannot make it

01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:02.730
to a runway, at about 40,000 feet you blow
the hatch.

01:29:02.730 --> 01:29:11.401
The telescoping pole, you release the pin,
the pole will extend, and then one by one

01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:14.460
you clip onto the pole and you jump out.

01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:21.050
And the pole takes you below the wing so that
you won't hit the Shuttle structure.

01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:25.690
And then eventually your parachute will open.

01:29:25.690 --> 01:29:32.610
That now takes up the area over by the window
and the three seats no longer have a view.

01:29:32.610 --> 01:29:42.360
If you're sitting on the mid-deck how during
a launch, how do you know what is going on...?

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.360
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] You hear the comm.

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.360
loop.

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.981
And if you have a nice commander he will tell
you.

01:29:47.981 --> 01:29:52.730
For instance, if you have a rookie astronaut
onboard, they want to know when they go through

01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:58.590
100 kilometers because that means you have
officially been in space and you can get your

01:29:58.590 --> 01:29:59.590
astronaut wings.

01:29:59.590 --> 01:30:04.250
So, if the commander is nice, he will call
100 clicks on the way up and congratulate

01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:05.840
the new rookies.

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.050
But basically that is about it.

01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:12.020
And the same for entry, you don't have a view.

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:17.660
There are still plenty of physiological things
to keep your attention, so it is not like

01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:23.140
it is a boring ride, but you don't have the
view.

01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:24.140
OK.

01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:36.020
Let me run the entry picture here.

01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:37.020
OK.

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:44.460
OMS engine ignition is when you see that big
flame pattern.

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:49.920
During the burn you don't see anything.

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:55.500
Now, looking out the front, you see the plasma
sheath.

01:30:55.500 --> 01:31:04.620
It goes from a dull red gradually to orange
and then eventually white hot.

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:07.940
You can only see this at night.

01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:15.570
It is fairly faint, but typically a lot of
flights you land during the early part of

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:16.750
the day on the ground.

01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:23.670
And, of course, you do your burn halfway around
the world so the early part of your entry

01:31:23.670 --> 01:31:29.940
is very often at night and then you fly into
the day.

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:37.450
And then I think there is another shot looking
out the aft window where you actually see

01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:39.961
the plasma wake in the back of the Shuttle.

01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:53.220
And you can see this is the old-fashioned
computer screen.

01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:57.570
That is the wake looking out the overhead
window.

01:31:57.570 --> 01:32:02.930
And, where these converge, that little point
there they say is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

01:32:02.930 --> 01:32:04.641
which is the surface temperature of the sun.

01:32:04.641 --> 01:32:10.900
It is remarkably stable, although every once
in a while you get those instabilities.

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:16.380
And every once in a while you get big bright
things go flying past, which I assume are

01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:17.760
gap fillers coming out.

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:24.910
And I remember I would always think to myself
I hope that is nothing important.

01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:30.730
You're basically riding on a meteorite because
it is supposed to make it all the way down

01:32:30.730 --> 01:32:32.220
to the earth.

01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:38.130
But that is essentially what you are seeing,
that trail behind you.

01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:40.420
And I am sure you have all seen these landings.

01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:44.110
Remember all the talk about the landing gear
and the brakes.

01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:48.770
I looked for a video from my first flight
to show you the blowout.

01:32:48.770 --> 01:33:03.960
I couldn't find one, but if I find one I will
bring it in and show you another time.

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:06.490
This is a landing out at Edwards.

01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:10.671
Have you ever landed at night?

01:33:10.671 --> 01:33:13.010
I have landed at night.

01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:14.930
I was going to show you one other.

01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:18.150
It doesn't have a landing light, does it?

01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:19.150
No.

01:33:19.150 --> 01:33:20.150
Do they light up the runway?

01:33:20.150 --> 01:33:21.150
Yeah.

01:33:21.150 --> 01:33:36.880
They have two banks of xenon lights which
light up the runway for you.

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:43.840
Actually, this next video is from my last
flight where we deployed the tethered satellite.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:47.840
I am not going to show you all that stuff,
but I wanted to show you the launch sequence

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.250
because we have a few pictures showing the
opening of the payload bay doors.

01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:58.410
And then you can actually see back to the
aft end of the Shuttle where you have the

01:33:58.410 --> 01:33:59.420
main engine.

01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:06.770
And remember I talked about how the hydrogen
and oxygen have now combined into water and

01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:07.920
that forms ice.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:14.310
And so for the first day or so on-orbit there
are just constant ice particles coming out

01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:19.500
of the engines, and you are surrounded by
this cloud of ice.

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:23.930
Unfortunately the pictures are black and white
because it is low-light level TV, but visually

01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:30.640
it is spectacular because these little ice
particles glint in the sunlight.

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:37.670
And they are rotating so they go through all
the different colors of the spectrum and you

01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:38.791
are surrounded by this.

01:34:38.791 --> 01:34:54.700
You will also see one of the RCS jets firing.

01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.260
Water deluge.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:59.410
Main engine sequence.

01:34:59.410 --> 01:35:00.850
Again, you see the whole tilt.

01:35:00.850 --> 01:35:07.690
When it gets back to vertical we take off.

01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:13.550
This is a much shorter sequence here for the
launch than the last one.

01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:23.940
How does it roll?

01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:27.150
The SRB boosters go like that.

01:35:27.150 --> 01:35:32.340
Is it the entire stack or just the lower...?

01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:40.450
No, it is just the nozzle at the bottom.

01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:42.500
This was Columbia.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:46.860
You can always tell Columbia because, if you
look at the vertical stabilizer up here, that

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:49.110
is an infrared pod.

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:51.250
I will talk about that in a minute.

01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:56.670
The payload bay doors open right away.

01:35:56.670 --> 01:36:03.301
And so now you can see, when we've done the
engine vent, you can see all the ice particles

01:36:03.301 --> 01:36:04.301
coming out.

01:36:04.301 --> 01:36:10.550
And you will see a primary RCS thruster go
in there.

01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:14.520
It can be pretty spectacular.

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:19.270
And that just keeps going for about a day
and then you've gotten rid of most of the

01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:20.270
ice particles.

01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:21.270
OK.

01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:26.930
That is enough of that.

01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:29.250
Yeah?

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:41.711
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] That was a primary RCS
thruster.

01:36:41.711 --> 01:36:47.500
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Yeah, absolutely.

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:55.440
In fact, all of the vernier thrusters are
downward thrusting only.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:02.510
Remember we talked about with the primary
thrusters, they were designed and sized for

01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:07.460
rendezvous where you actually have to have
controlled propulsion.

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:16.671
And if you want a Z propulsion of the Shuttle,
you want to be able to get a pure Z so you

01:37:16.671 --> 01:37:20.150
fire thrusters on each end.

01:37:20.150 --> 01:37:23.210
And the same for roll and yaw.

01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:31.670
And you don't want a lot of cross-coupling
because you're targeting your burn to fractions

01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:36.000
of a foot per second in order to get your
rendezvous to come out right.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.610
And so that is when you're using the primary
thrusters.

01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:45.690
Other than that, the primaries use a lot of
propellant.

01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:49.630
And so we disable the primaries and use the
verniers.

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:56.230
With the verniers there are two verniers in
the nose which are sort of canted down at

01:37:56.230 --> 01:37:58.550
about 45 degrees.

01:37:58.550 --> 01:38:03.590
And, in the rear, there are two pointing straight
down and two pointing straight out.

01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:10.770
Typically, for a given maneuver, you will
fire only one or two.

01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:17.940
If you want to do a roll, for instance, you
will fire the 45-degree down forward thruster

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:25.180
and the downward pointing aft thruster.

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:28.770
But they are not completely balanced so you
will get a little bit of pitch and a little

01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:30.020
bit of yaw.

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:34.400
And you don't use the verniers for propulsion
at all.

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:41.480
Although, because all of the verniers are
essentially downward firing, if you are, for

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:47.380
instance, station keeping, if here is the
Space Station and you're in the same orbit

01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:53.860
but, say, half a mile in front of it, now
you're station keeping using your vernier

01:38:53.860 --> 01:39:01.250
thrusters, typically that does give you, after
a while, a little bit of propulsive maneuver

01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:02.250
which pushes you in.

01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:05.050
So, you have to compensate for that.

01:39:05.050 --> 01:39:07.420
The verniers are single string.

01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:09.210
There is no redundancy.

01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:13.250
They do have access-to-access cross-coupling.

01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:26.840
They are designed for attitude control only;
25 pound thrusters are reasonably efficient.

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:39.370
I thought at the end we could explore a little
bit together some of the ideas of improvements

01:39:39.370 --> 01:39:41.820
to the Shuttle which you are going to be thinking
about.

01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:47.620
And one of the things that I thought would
be interesting to think about, you know we

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:56.840
talked about the fact that if you're designing
the Shuttle to the same set of requirements

01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:06.570
that were originally put on it, your ability
to change some of the major physical characteristics

01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:09.450
of the Shuttle are very limited.

01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:21.130
We can do a lot with electronics and some
of the other systems.

01:40:21.130 --> 01:40:29.010
The new vehicle, the crew exploration vehicle,
is being designed not just to go to earth

01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:36.130
orbit but they want a vehicle that can actually
return to the earth from the moon or from

01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:37.130
mars.

01:40:37.130 --> 01:40:48.880
That means instead of an orbital velocity
of five miles per second you have a reentry

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:58.490
velocity, a hyperbolic velocity, of about
eight miles per second.

01:40:58.490 --> 01:41:04.900
Does anybody remember the relationship between
low orbital velocity and escape velocity?

01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:11.630
If your lower velocity is V, what is your
escape velocity?

01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:12.690
Square root of 2V.

01:41:12.690 --> 01:41:14.670
That is a nice thing to remember.

01:41:14.670 --> 01:41:23.290
It is an easy way to keep those things straight.

01:41:23.290 --> 01:41:24.880
First of all, you don't need wings to go to
the moon.

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.360
They don't do you much good when you get there.

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:35.000
To have a winged vehicle that you can thermally
protect against a hyperbolic reentry velocity

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
just doesn't make sense.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.840
It would be too heavy.

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.550
We don't think we can do that.

01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:47.440
And, in fact, the Russians are now talking
about building this new clipper vehicle which

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.980
possibly will have wings on it or be a lifting
body.

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:58.820
And that actually probably means that they
will only use it for low earth orbit.

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:08.530
But it does bring up the interesting question,
if you are designing a vehicle that is only

01:42:08.530 --> 01:42:15.190
designed to go to earth orbit as a passenger
carrying vehicle, one of the first things

01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:22.590
that we ought to ask ourselves, if we're doing
a new design, is should we have wings?

01:42:22.590 --> 01:42:28.800
Think a little bit about the advantages and
disadvantages of wings.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:33.900
If you're sitting down now with a blank drawing
board going through a design process, first

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:37.820
of all, what are the advantages of wings?

01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:44.570
You've heard quite a bit about Shuttle aerodynamics.

01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:48.900
What advantages do you get from using wings
during a reentry?

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:53.111
And, obviously, it's only during entry that
the wings are going to help you because they

01:42:53.111 --> 01:42:55.050
are a real nuisance during ascent.

01:42:55.050 --> 01:43:01.590
Greater cross-range?

01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:03.360
Cross-range helps with the wings.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:09.480
The glide?

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:14.190
Yeah, it allows you to land on a runway.

01:43:14.190 --> 01:43:20.300
In terms of having to design against the shock,
you know, the Crew Exploration Vehicle is

01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:21.820
going to land with parachutes.

01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:27.570
And they still don't know are they going to
use airbags or retrorockets or crushable structure

01:43:27.570 --> 01:43:28.570
or whatever.

01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:29.570
They don't know.

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:35.590
But it is going to take a much harder hit.

01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:40.700
That may potentially affect reusability, maintainability.

01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:41.700
Yeah?

01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:48.601
I was going to say just purely control while
coming back in ...

01:43:48.601 --> 01:43:54.920
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.600
Well, we had the cross-range.

01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:58.710
But targeting I guess, too?

01:43:58.710 --> 01:43:59.710
Targeting.

01:43:59.710 --> 01:44:03.660
If you were to land, say, in a certain part
of the desert in New Mexico, you would want

01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:07.230
to have a lot more accuracy?

01:44:07.230 --> 01:44:08.230
Right.

01:44:08.230 --> 01:44:12.920
For the CEV, they are just basically saying
they are going to land out in the Western

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:13.920
desert somewhere.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:16.940
Now, the Apollo shots were getting pretty
accurate.

01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:25.300
The last couple of Apollos landed within visual
range of the aircraft carrier that went to

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:26.800
pick them up, so they were getting pretty
good.

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:33.040
But that's within a couple of miles, which
is fine when you're landing in the ocean.

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:36.151
And maybe it's OK if you're landing in the
Western desert.

01:44:36.151 --> 01:44:38.230
It is certainly not OK if you're going to
land on a runway.

01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:43.120
Hardly an engineering consideration, but how
much thought in the design was put into making

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:49.330
it a winged vehicle for it to be a comfortable
and familiar look to people, especially if

01:44:49.330 --> 01:44:52.900
the idea was to have nonprofessional astronauts
fly?

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:58.700
It seems more comfortable to get in something
that looks like an airplane?

01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:03.330
I don't know about comfort from that point
of view, but there is no question that the

01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:08.480
whole aviation metaphor dominated discussion
in the early days.

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.520
And I think you have gotten a sense of this.

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:15.730
The idea was we want a reusable vehicle.

01:45:15.730 --> 01:45:19.750
That means we have to have airline-type operations.

01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:24.800
Well, if you're going to have airline-type
operations then you want a vehicle that lands

01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:25.800
on the runway.

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:26.800
You take it into the hangar.

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:27.800
You turn it around.

01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:29.600
You launch it again.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:33.100
I mean it's a very powerful metaphor.

01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:37.750
What are some of the disadvantages of wings?

01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:41.670
What are some of the things that argue against
wings?

01:45:41.670 --> 01:45:46.520
Again, we're going right back to the conceptual
design exercise here.

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:52.600
And this is not what you're doing for your
papers because we're totally changing the

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.620
concept of the Shuttle.

01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:58.320
But, for the purpose of the class, let's think
it through.

01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.151
What are the disadvantages of wings?

01:46:00.151 --> 01:46:05.510
I think a lot of what we talked about is initial
design cost versus, you know, and no wings

01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:09.170
obviously has a lot less initial design cost
because you don't have to design the structure

01:46:09.170 --> 01:46:12.240
to support the wings and it is a lot simpler
design, I think.

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:22.890
So, that probably saves you money in your
initial development.

01:46:22.890 --> 01:46:30.120
[AUDIENCE COMMENT] Now, on the other hand,
I don't know how much any of you have studied

01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:42.690
the theory of reentry bodies, but the reentry
of a ballistic capsule typically gives you

01:46:42.690 --> 01:46:48.570
much higher Gs than you can get if you have
a lifting body.

01:46:48.570 --> 01:46:54.030
And, of course, with wings you get much more
lift.

01:46:54.030 --> 01:47:03.370
You can actually decrease the G loading so
that with the Shuttle we can have a reentry

01:47:03.370 --> 01:47:06.190
pulling no more than about 1.5 Gs.

01:47:06.190 --> 01:47:14.100
Whereas, you come back in a capsule even from
low earth orbit and you're going to be pulling

01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:18.230
4, 5, 6 Gs.

01:47:18.230 --> 01:47:23.640
And that does relate back to the idea that
we wanted the Shuttle to be able to take much

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:31.440
more delicate payloads and hopefully take
people who were not necessarily trained astronauts.

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:37.320
So, again, it's an advantage but a disadvantage
of wings.

01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:45.860
The area under the wings is huge, so that
puts huge demands on your thermal protection

01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:51.570
system.

01:47:51.570 --> 01:47:56.981
I don't know what they're going to end up
using on the CEV, but it is going to be a

01:47:56.981 --> 01:48:02.880
much smaller area that has to be protected.

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.550
Another interesting thing, when you think
about a winged vehicle like the Shuttle, now

01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:13.180
I know that Buran, the Russian Shuttle, made
its one flight unmanned.

01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:20.300
They had some tense moments at the end, but
they did manage to land it successfully.

01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:29.101
But the way we fly our Shuttle, we have to
have two trained pilots who spend a tremendous

01:48:29.101 --> 01:48:36.820
amount of time doing nothing but learning
how to land the Shuttle.

01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:45.440
Sometimes we don't think about the crew requirements
on the design, but training is not an insignificant

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.880
part of the cost of operating the Shuttle.

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:55.820
There is a huge enterprise involved in training
astronauts.

01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:59.270
And training pilots particularly is very expensive.

01:48:59.270 --> 01:49:05.560
You have to keep them qualified as pilots
so NASA maintains a fleet of T38 supersonic

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:06.780
jets, which are great fun.

01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:09.210
I mean I love to fly backseat in them.

01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:14.880
But the only justification for having them
is if somebody is going to be a pilot they

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:17.860
have got to stay current as a pilot which
means you have got to fly.

01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:21.790
And we have the Shuttle Training Aircraft
which I have spoken to you about.

01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:27.190
And we have all the simulator time.

01:49:27.190 --> 01:49:32.520
And then we have the problem that people said
-- there was a time when they were talking

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:38.940
about having the Shuttle spend extended periods
of time up at the Space Station, you know,

01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:43.600
a month, maybe two months, make some adjustments
to the Shuttle System so you can do that.

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:50.942
Then the problem is, well, who is going to
land the Shuttle, because I talked to you

01:49:50.942 --> 01:49:55.190
about the spatial disorientation and everything
that you feel during reentry.

01:49:55.190 --> 01:49:58.360
Well, you don't want a pilot to do that.

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:03.410
And, if a pilot has been up in the Space Station
for one or two months, has not had any stick

01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:10.670
time, is going to have potentially serious
neurovestibular problems during entry.

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:19.580
And so the real question was what's the maximum
time that it is OK for a pilot to spend in

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:20.580
space?

01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:25.040
We will never actually have to answer that
because 17 or 18 days was the maximum Shuttle

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:26.040
Mission.

01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:28.380
That turned out to be OK.

01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:31.780
And we are never going to do long duration
missions with the Shuttle and the Space Station.

01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:32.780
Yeah?

01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:42.140
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] No.

01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:47.840
They learn a lot of the malfunction procedures,
but you don't actually fly the ballistic capsule.

01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:54.320
I mean I am not in any sense denigrating the
training that the Apollo astronauts needed

01:50:54.320 --> 01:51:00.980
to land their capsule, but it did not compare
in the least to the amount of training, for

01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:04.500
instance, to land on the moon where you were
actually piloting the vehicle.

01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:06.700
OK.

01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:21.820
Well, I hope just that very brief exploration
will make you think about designing new vehicles

01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:24.140
from a slightly different point of view.

01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:31.630
In other words, when we designed the Shuttle,
it was just assumed as gospel essentially

01:51:31.630 --> 01:51:37.350
that if you want a reusable vehicle put wings
on it.

01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:39.000
I don't know what the right answer is.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.440
It probably depends on some of the details
of the mission, but you really have to go

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:47.690
back and question your most basic assumptions.

01:51:47.690 --> 01:51:53.170
When you're doing your concepts and you're
setting out your requirements, you don't want

01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:58.250
to write your requirements in such a way that
they presuppose the technical solution.

01:51:58.250 --> 01:52:05.650
If you write your requirements for a winged
vehicle you have already shut down a whole

01:52:05.650 --> 01:52:07.000
part of designed space.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.330
And, as designers, you don't want to do that.

01:52:09.330 --> 01:52:10.330
Yeah?

01:52:10.330 --> 01:52:11.330
Last question.

01:52:11.330 --> 01:52:15.710
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] No.

01:52:15.710 --> 01:52:20.980
The Russians have actually taken, my understanding
is, they have taken some of the electronics

01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:25.090
out of capsules and reused internal parts.

01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:31.480
But the exterior shell of the capsules I don't
believe have ever been reused.

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.480
OK.

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:33.480
We will see you Thursday.

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:36.630
Bob Ried is going to give a talk on aerothermodynamics.

01:52:36.630 --> 01:52:39.190
And I will look forward to seeing your journals.

01:52:39.190 --> 01:52:47.540
Any questions on the reports, the outlines
that I returned, email me, come to see me.

01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:48.900
I am happy to talk with you about it.
