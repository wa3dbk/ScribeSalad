00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.330
The formal part of the class will start about
five past nine, but I'll just start with some

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.410
introductory remarks.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.750
First of all, I have got bios from a large
number of people.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.720
I haven't done a count yet to see from whom
I haven't gotten them, but if you haven't

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.500
sent me a short bio please do.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.000
It just helps us to get to know who you are.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let's see.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Second thing.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.120
The next deliverable, which is, I think, in
a week or so, I don't have the syllabus with

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.970
me right now, we would like a preliminary
indication from you.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.680
I am leaving it up to you to form your own
teams.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.370
Roughly, we've found about 4 people make up
a good team.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.470
That is a good way to spread the work around.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.460
If any of you are having difficulty or whatever,
let me know, we will try to help, but you

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.070
are almost all graduate students.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.830
You can organize yourself.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.500
With a preliminary indication of what system
you would like to do a study on.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.500
Take a handout.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.140
I am just wondering if you can provide a list
of email addresses to everyone so that we

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.210
can contact each other.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.521
I will be happy to do that.

00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:35.979
I will post that.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.119
Let's see.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.119
The second thing.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.320
There are a fair number of listeners in the
class, and quite a few of you have contacted

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.250
me to make sure that it is OK to be here as
listeners.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.850
I have no problem with that.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.970
The only thing that I would ask, right now
we are more or less filled to capacity.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.990
I expect that the class isn't going to grow
after this, so I think we are OK.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:12.120
What I did tell people is that if we get into
a seat crunch, obviously, the people who are

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.110
taking the course for credit have priorities
for seats.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.650
So any of you who are listeners please keep
that in mind.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.830
Next thing.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:30.560
I am going to be putting some things on reserve
in the library.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.930
This is courtesy of Professor Cohen.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.650
This is the proceedings of a Space Shuttle
Technical Conference.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.760
Aaron, do you want to say something just about
the background?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.599
The background is that we decided, after the
Shuttle had flown a couple of times, that

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.430
we would have a typical NACA, going back to
NACA, but this was NASA technical conference

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.270
where we actually had technical papers written
by the various people that designed the system,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.330
some you will hear talk, some you won't.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.250
But these are technical papers of how the
systems were developed.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.950
So it is a pretty detailed understanding of
the thermal protection system, the main propulsion

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.790
system, so forth and so on.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.569
So it is a pretty good documentary of how
it was done.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.900
This should be a good reference for your papers.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.959
It is 1983.

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.090
Like I say, I will go down this afternoon
and put this on reserve in the library.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:36.129
I will also put on reserve a copy of a systems
study that was done at Texas A&amp;M for a similar

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.400
course that Professor taught on systems engineering
and the Space Shuttle just to give you kind

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.739
of an idea of what someone else did.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.769
This was a rather good paper.

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:56.400
I see you gave them a very high mark so presumably
that means it is a good example.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:05.739
Finally, you have all got a copy of this paper
by Professor Cohen and Milt Silvera who was

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.320
also a very responsible person in the Shuttle
program.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.411
It is a high level background on the Shuttle
and its systems.

00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:23.669
I am sure there are some of you here who are
space enthusiasts and who probably have followed

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.900
the Shuttle system pretty closely and to whom
there won't be a whole lot new here.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.711
But, on the other hand, we want everybody
in the course to come up to a certain level

00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:42.509
of knowledge about the Shuttle, its systems
and the systems engineering that went behind

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:43.509
it.

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.080
So I think it's good to have something like
this available.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.770
It's a nice reference piece.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:01.680
Today and Thursday Professor Cohen is going
to give an introduction into the Shuttle,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.559
its systems and the system engineering that
went into it.

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:11.599
Before we start that, are there any other
questions either about the technicalities

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.660
of the course or just anything?

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.580
Oh, I know one thing.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.559
I have a few comments from people telling
me that the pdf files that I posted on the

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:27.080
website, some people could read them and some
people could not read them.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.979
I have Macs but have been posting pdf files
for numerous courses.

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:44.860
I have never had any problem with people reading
it before.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.919
First of all, who has tried to look at the
files?

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:49.919
OK.

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.580
Of those people who have tried to look at
the files, who has had difficulty?

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.879
This is strange.

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:08.020
Well, if anybody has any ideas about what
the problem might be, I would be very curious.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:19.179
I mean have you ever had this problem with
other courses?

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:28.210
I will do a couple of experiments and post
one or two more documents, both in pdf and

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.860
in either Word or PowerPoint form.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:39.360
I would suggest that everybody during the
next two days go and try to open them.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.301
Let's see if we can isolate where the problem
might be.

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:45.610
Like I said, I've never had this problem with
any other courses.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:52.199
And, in principle, I mean the whole point
of pdf files is it's supposed to be compatible

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.929
across Macs, PCs and all that.

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:58.919
So I don't know what the problem is but we'll
see if we can run it down.

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:04.399
And thanks to those of you who let me know
that there was a difficulty.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:06.059
That is all I have.

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:07.819
Any other questions, comments?

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:15.370
What are you kind of expecting with these
journal deliverables so we can kind of be

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.259
just ahead of that?

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:26.969
The idea is to basically put together the
highlights of the lecture from the systems

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:27.969
engineering point of view.

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:34.839
In other words, what we want -- When somebody
is talking about a specific system, we want

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:43.159
you to have a brief description of the system,
the purpose, what it does, something about

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:53.939
the design considerations, something about
the operations, kind of the basic concerns

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:55.590
from the systems engineering point of view.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:02.710
And anything they talk about, particular interactions
between that system and other systems.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.819
Can you think of anything else in particular?

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.119
I think that about it.

00:08:08.119 --> 00:08:09.119
OK.

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:13.779
I will think that through a little bit more,
and maybe I can come up with a checklist that

00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:16.989
would help you put that together.

00:08:16.989 --> 00:08:18.939
It's not meant to be a big burden.

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:28.110
It's just a way to organize everybody's thinking
on how to get the most out of the lecturers,

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:35.029
particularly because, as I mentioned, these
lectures are all being given, by and large,

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:36.029
by different people.

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:38.979
They will have different styles.

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:46.410
We have kind of explained to everybody the
structure of the course, what we're looking

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:52.300
for, but I cannot really guarantee in advance
what the content of the lecture will be.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:57.879
Professor Cohen and I will make any attempt,
if the lectures don't cover some of those

00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:04.839
critical points from a systems engineering
point of view, we will try to stimulate the

00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:07.300
discussion on that or fill in.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.140
But you should do the same thing.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.009
In other words, make sure that there is something
that you think you would like to be getting

00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:19.870
out of the lecture and you haven't gotten,
don't be embarrassed to ask questions.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.380
Something you ought to think about, when these
individual lectures come up, is it should

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.270
be the description and function of the system.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.449
If they don't bring that out then we ought
to try to bring it out.

00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:32.579
The requirements of the subsystem or the system,
what are the requirements?

00:09:32.579 --> 00:09:33.701
Because that is very fundamental.

00:09:33.701 --> 00:09:34.701
What are the requirements?

00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:36.581
The development of the subsystem.

00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:38.490
What kind of problems did they have?

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.910
What kind of technologies did they have to
overcome?

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.812
And, of course, the operation of the subsystems.

00:09:43.812 --> 00:09:45.550
Those are, I think, key points.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.501
Now, whether you're going to get that from
everybody or not, I don't know.

00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:50.340
But I think you need to look for that.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.850
And, if you don't, then we will try to develop
that.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:10:01.829
Are you looking for the notes to be taken
in class?

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:02.829
I don't follow you.

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:05.389
I mean I am not looking for a Xerox of what
you're writing in the notebook, if that's

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:06.389
what you mean.

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:07.389
No.

00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:13.029
I mean I would like you to put your thoughts
together into a concise form.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:18.449
And I think that will be a good reference
to you, hopefully, after the course on Shuttle

00:10:18.449 --> 00:10:19.449
systems.

00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:24.720
OK?

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.720
Over to you.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:40.320
You are going to have a very unique opportunity.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.649
You are going to have people speak, lecture
you on the various Shuttle subsystems in quite

00:10:46.649 --> 00:10:47.649
a bit of detail.

00:10:47.649 --> 00:10:53.550
You will have some people that will be very,
very positive about the Shuttle, that think

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.220
it's a great design, a great operation.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.459
You will have others that will not think it's
so good.

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:03.829
And you will have some that will give you
just a detailed technical approach of what

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:05.370
happened.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.990
What I would like to suggest to you, I think,
for your good and for the good of the future,

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:16.930
future students, future designers, is that
you ought to come up with your own decision.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.769
Was it the right design?

00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:19.769
Was it the correct design?

00:11:19.769 --> 00:11:22.149
Should it have been done differently?

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:24.850
And, if so, why and how would you do it?

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:30.839
And I think it will be good for, when you
go to work on future projects.

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:35.160
And it would also be good, I think, for NASA,
something we could turn over to NASA.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.259
I think it's a very valuable thing to do.

00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:42.129
So I would suggest you do that as you go through
the course.

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:49.209
And I will be very happy to talk to you about
any of your ideas that you have through the

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.009
Internet, through emails or in person discussion.

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:57.519
And you might want to do this later on as
the semester develops.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:03.889
A little bit what I am going to say today
really starts off where Dale Myers, your previous

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:04.910
speaker, left off.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.209
And it gets into a little bit more detail.

00:12:06.209 --> 00:12:10.110
So, as this course develops, you're going
to get more and more detail.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:15.079
But let me start off again, just very much
like Dale did, and talk about the Shuttle

00:12:15.079 --> 00:12:18.199
history.

00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:23.689
In 1952, the fully reusable launch vehicles
concept was discussed.

00:12:23.689 --> 00:12:26.620
People were interested in that.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.350
1962, fully reusable vehicles were seriously
considered.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.499
The Air Force study project Dynosaur was cancelled
in 1969.

00:12:35.499 --> 00:12:45.459
In 1969, NASA adopted the idea of a fully
reusable spaceship.

00:12:45.459 --> 00:12:52.170
I became the Orbiter Project Manager for NASA
in August of 1972.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:58.529
And, at that time, I also was manager of the
Systems Engineering Organization for the first

00:12:58.529 --> 00:12:59.529
two years.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:07.100
So I, you might say, the total system at that
time and the Orbiter in 1972.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.100
Yes?

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.769
Could you tell us a little bit about your
background?

00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:12.769
Yes.

00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:23.820
Well, my background was I graduated from Texas
A&amp;M University in 1952 and went to the Army,

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.839
went to Korea.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:29.130
And then when I came back went to work for
RCA.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:35.090
And I worked on the microwave tubes, the microwave
oven.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:41.560
In fact, when I told my wife what I was working
on, I said I'm working on a microwave oven.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.709
That was in 1954.

00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:45.060
That was a long time ago.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.829
How many people have microwave ovens today?

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:48.829
Everybody does.

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:52.819
Well, in 1954-1955, when they came out, they
were about $3,000 a piece.

00:13:52.819 --> 00:13:54.400
I was working on one and told my wife.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.399
And we'd been married a long time.

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:58.990
I told my wife that I was working on something
called a microwave oven.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.120
And you are going to be able to cook a roast
in a couple of minutes and a potato in a couple

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.120
of minutes.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120
And she looked at me and said that will never
sell.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.301
Anyway, that's what I worked on.

00:14:08.301 --> 00:14:12.180
Then I worked for General Dynamics on the
Atlas and Centaur.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:19.829
And then, in 1962, I went to the Johnson Space
Center and worked very closely on the Apollo

00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:23.620
Program, worked very closely with the MIT
Instrumentation Lab, now the Draper Lab on

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.370
the guidance and navigation control system.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.600
I became head of System Engineering in Apollo.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.230
Then manager of the Command and Service Module
in Apollo.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:39.029
Then, in August 1972, I became the manager
of the Space Shuttle Orbiter.

00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:41.999
Then I became Director of Research and Engineering
at Johnson Space Center.

00:14:41.999 --> 00:14:44.569
And then I became Director of the Johnson
Space Center.

00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:50.689
And then, for a while, I was the Acting Deputy
Administrator in Washington.

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:53.899
And then I retired and went to Texas A&amp;M to
teach.

00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:56.490
Then Jeff asked me to come to do this, and
I am very happy to be here.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:04.790
Actually, one thing you mentioned reminded
me of something, not to divert the lecture

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:10.980
today, but the fact that there was specifically
a systems engineering group at the center

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.970
which was separate from the project offices
is something which is probably worth talking

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:16.970
about at some point.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.970
That's right.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:18.970
Well, let me just make a mention of that.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:25.649
When we were in Apollo we sat around the table
for many days and months trying to figure

00:15:25.649 --> 00:15:27.999
out how you define systems engineering.

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:29.540
We didn't even know what systems engineering
was.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:34.079
In fact, today, I'm not sure you'll get a
clear definition of what it is.

00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:35.730
I want to give you some examples.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.850
As we go through the lecture, I am going to
give you some examples of what I think it

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.050
is and how it was used.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.510
So we will do that.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:46.319
Let me say just one other thing.

00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:51.699
Professor Cohen has these view graphs in electronic
form down in Texas and, when he gets back,

00:15:51.699 --> 00:15:54.949
he will send them to me and I will post them
on the website.

00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:57.140
Well, I will give you this whole package because
there are also some pictures.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.529
I don't know what you want to do with the
photos.

00:15:59.529 --> 00:16:06.129
Something that is very key in any design and
something you really need to pursue, whenever

00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:09.481
you do a design project, is understand the
requirements.

00:16:09.481 --> 00:16:14.560
Because, if you don't understand the requirements,
you might get a very good product that is

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560
useless.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.559
So you have to understand what your customer
wants, the top level requirements.

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:22.810
One thing that was handed down to us is it
was supposed to be fully reusable.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:23.810
That was one requirement.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.930
14-day turnaround time.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.231
You were supposed to be able to turn the Shuttle
around in 14 days.

00:16:29.231 --> 00:16:32.420
Deploy and retrieve payloads.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.490
You had to deploy a payload and you had to
retrieve a payload.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:44.050
Design, development and test is estimated
to be $5.1 billion in 1971 dollars.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.220
Dale Myers didn't tell you the whole story,
but one reason Dale Myers and I are such good

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.019
friends is he was Associate Administrator
of Manned Space Flight, I was the Orbiter

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:57.899
Project Manager and they, they being headquarters,
headquarters was always there to help, actually

00:16:57.899 --> 00:16:59.830
took away two years of inflation.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:04.589
If they had given those two years of inflation,
we would have met the $5.1 billion in 1971

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:05.589
dollars.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:06.589
And Dale fought for that but lost.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.699
Now, here is where we missed it.

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:15.600
The original cost per flight for 65,000 pounds
was $10.5 million per flight in 1971 dollars

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.649
but for a flight rate of 60 flights per year.

00:17:18.649 --> 00:17:21.920
When I told my wife I was doing that, and
she's been around the space program a long

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.401
time, she said you never agreed to that, did
you?

00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:35.560
Sixty flights per year is pretty hard to do,
but that's what we came up with at the time.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.580
Now, Dale mentioned the Air Force requirements,
but here were the phase A studies.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.700
The phase A studies were conducted to determine
the basic requirements and their effects on

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.779
design in 1969.

00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:53.840
The principle issues were the size and weight
of the payload, the cross-range of the Orbiter

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.340
and what kind of heat material was going to
be used.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.940
You have to recognize are we going to use
heat-resistant structure or reusable insulating

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.940
material?

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.470
You have to recognize that our background
was Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, and they all

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.580
used an ablative material.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.580
Ablative material cannot be reused because
basically the surface changes.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.090
You had to have some kind of insulated material
so the surface did not change.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:30.820
Let me now go through very quickly for you,
just for the sake of completeness, Dale showed

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:31.820
you a few of the studies.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:36.750
I want to flash up a lot of phase A studies
just to let you take a look at what people

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.610
were doing.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.280
And you don't have to read the words but you
might just look at the diagram.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.799
There was General Dynamic's phase A study.

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:46.260
There was North American Rockwell.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.640
That is the one Dale was talking about because
that was where he was.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.860
And there was a phase B study for McDonnell
Douglas.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.960
So that is what they all looked like at the
time.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.870
Now, I am going to go through some just for
the sake of completeness here.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:10.559
There was, again, another McDonnell Douglas
study, Martin Marietta.

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:12.840
So those were basically some of the studies.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.351
You can see they all had some kind of a wing-type
vehicle.

00:19:16.351 --> 00:19:23.580
Already most of those were delta wings so
the decision had already been made.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:30.280
Interestingly enough, and I am going to quote
some names to you, and you might go back and

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.280
research it.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.630
Max Faget was like the lead engineer.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:40.049
He was sort of a man that was immortalized
in terms of the space program.

00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:41.960
He felt we ought to go with the straight wing.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:47.970
He felt very strongly about a straight wing,
but that eliminated the very large cost range

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.080
the Air Force needed.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:54.399
Straight wing was easier to build, not as
high loads on it and so forth.

00:19:54.399 --> 00:20:00.340
Here, interestingly enough, if you look at
Chrysler.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.679
Chrysler had a study.

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:09.049
And Chrysler actually had a capsule, but here
were more vehicles.

00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:12.980
And people were really thinking about this
time of a fly back booster where you actually

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.279
had a booster that returned and came back
and landed.

00:20:16.279 --> 00:20:20.191
And they also had a land vehicle that landed.

00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:23.529
So that was what the real requirement was
at the time.

00:20:23.529 --> 00:20:26.990
Somebody sort of commented about Chrysler.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.820
There was also Ford.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.190
There were a lot of aerospace companies back
in those days.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.460
It has changed a lot, that's right.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.470
And here is McDonnell Douglas, of course Grumman.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.590
So a lot of these studies.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.090
Then you're getting to see something already
starting to look a little bit like the Shuttle.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:51.730
And I am almost through.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.340
And here are more.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.860
These are, I think, getting maybe in the phase
B studies.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:04.240
But you can see some of them are starting
to look like the existing Shuttle.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.240
Lockheed.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:21.429
Now, the principle issues in the Shuttle studies,
now we're starting to get a little bit more

00:21:21.429 --> 00:21:26.419
technical and a little more detailed, is should
the reaction control system, now, the reaction

00:21:26.419 --> 00:21:33.170
control system is basically a propulsion system
that controls the vehicle about its center

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.170
of gravity.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.690
It's for alttitude control, basically.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:43.929
Should the reaction control system be liquid
oxygen/liquid hydrogen or should you use a

00:21:43.929 --> 00:21:47.880
hypergolic system where you know it is a storable
type system.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.880
That was a big issue.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.140
Does everybody here know what hypergolic fuel
is?

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.929
Let's talk about it a little bit.

00:21:55.929 --> 00:22:00.890
Well, hypergolic fuel is a fuel like hydrazine.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:09.029
It actually has an oxidizer and a propellant
in the same fuel.

00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:12.090
Now, another issue was a fly-by-wire flight
control system.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.110
That was a big issue.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.490
Do we have a fly-by-wire flight control system?

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.280
And now everything has a fly-by-wire.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.340
All the military jets have fly-by-wire.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:24.480
But basically was it going to be a computer
controlled system or are we going to have

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.820
cables fly the machine?

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.309
That was a very big issue at the time.

00:22:28.309 --> 00:22:31.990
Wind tunnel tests to determine wing size and
configuration.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.309
That is a very difficult thing to do.

00:22:35.309 --> 00:22:42.769
This is starting to get into what you might
say is systems engineering.

00:22:42.769 --> 00:22:55.480
Air breathing engines were considered for
fly back and later determined to be too heavy.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:02.940
And some Shuttle studies that still had to
be done was the entry techniques, landing

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.010
speed, what type of landing speed were we
going to have and the approach pattern?

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:12.480
So these were all some things that had to
be understood during the studies.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:21.559
The phase B 
studies were performed in the mid 1970s to

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:24.809
determine the preliminary design.

00:23:24.809 --> 00:23:31.050
The results showed a fully recoverable Orbiter.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.159
Disposable fuel tank.

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:35.661
Parachute recoverable solid rocket boosters.

00:23:35.661 --> 00:23:41.519
High performance hydrogen oxygen engines placed
in the Orbiter to recover.

00:23:41.519 --> 00:23:44.670
This was all systems engineering that lead
up to the design.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.779
So you have systems engineering in various
phases of the program.

00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:54.919
And usually systems engineering composes of
an interdisciplinary team that has been given

00:23:54.919 --> 00:23:57.899
some assumptions, some constraints.

00:23:57.899 --> 00:24:00.210
They have some top level requirements.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:08.070
They do an iterative process with some tools
such as computer tools for calculation of

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.220
loads and flight mechanics.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.440
And they come up with an iteration of what
the design is going to be.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:19.350
So that is basically how it was done.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.929
Now, some of that was sort of like the ground
rules.

00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:26.320
Some of the things that came out of it, once
we started putting the total system together,

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:33.169
we showed that the fully reusable with a fly
back booster was greater than $5.1 billion.

00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:35.340
So that was thrown out.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:40.130
Now, there is a question, and that's what
I asked Dale, should we have said, hey, we

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.049
need to money to really have a fly back booster?

00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:49.950
But they gave us a constraint of $5.1 billion
in 1971 dollars and it didn't make it.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.649
I showed you, many configurations were studies.

00:24:53.649 --> 00:25:02.059
And the turnaround time of 14 days dictated
a landing with a winged vehicle on a runway.

00:25:02.059 --> 00:25:04.590
You weren't going to be able to land this
in the water or with parachutes.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:10.179
You wouldn't have to land it on a runway so
you could quickly turn it around in 14 days.

00:25:10.179 --> 00:25:14.500
The payload, deployment and retrieval requirement
determined the location of the Orbiter and

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.190
the launch configuration.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.610
If you look at that large payload bay, it
would be very difficult to put that on top

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.610
of the vehicle.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:25.950
One of the requirements that NASA has now
is the CEV should be on top of the stack.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.520
Well, if you're going to have that large a
vehicle, it is pretty hard to put it on top

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.070
of the stack, particularly with wings.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:33.401
This is what we had to come up.

00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:34.919
These are some of the results.

00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:36.510
And these are all systems studies.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.659
This is systems engineering.

00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:47.049
Now you're getting to look at what the design
is starting to look like.

00:25:47.049 --> 00:25:50.909
This is the agency commitment in March of
1972.

00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:59.179
In May of 1972, you had the North American
Proposal.

00:25:59.179 --> 00:26:02.810
And then I became Orbiter Project Manager
in August of 1972.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:03.810
We did a study.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:08.019
And PRR is the preliminary requirements review.

00:26:08.019 --> 00:26:09.750
But that was the configuration.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.750
We made some changes.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.850
And the production commitment was made in
May of 1973.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:23.789
This chart, which was sort of the gee-whiz
chart at one point in time, showed the 1971

00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:29.960
dollars cost per flight for the Thor, the
Atlas, the Titan 3c, the Saturn 1b and the

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.960
Shuttle.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.570
And that is payload to orbit.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:38.760
So you can see that the thing that was really
missed in the Shuttle was the $10.5 million

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.169
cost per flight.

00:26:40.169 --> 00:26:41.169
Yes, sir.

00:26:41.169 --> 00:26:49.060
What is the notch on top of the second two
that disappeared?

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.060
That up there?

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.060
That was their data probe.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.299
It was taken off because it wasn't needed.

00:26:55.299 --> 00:26:56.299
Good question.

00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:57.299
Thank you.

00:26:57.299 --> 00:26:59.970
And, by the way, do not hesitate to interrupt
me and ask me questions any time.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:03.861
And, if you don't understand what I'm saying,
please stop me, tell me slow down or ask me

00:27:03.861 --> 00:27:06.529
any questions you would like to ask me.

00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:08.600
There are data probes on the Shuttle.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.250
Major configuration decisions.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:18.490
And, by the way, you don't see them on the
Shuttle because they are inside the thermal

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:19.490
protection system.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:24.039
And they are only sort of turned outwards
to take data when you get down to about mach

00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:25.490
3 and you're through the heating.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.799
Otherwise, they would burn off.

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:30.220
In the approach and landing test they were
out front.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:36.070
When we separated from the 747, I am going
to tell you that story in a minute.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.440
Here are some of the major decisions.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.101
We were going to go with a hydrogen/oxygen
main engine.

00:27:40.101 --> 00:27:45.600
That is one of the system problems you have
to decide.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:54.600
Once you decide what kind of engine you are
going to use, that basically sizes the tankage.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.549
And I will show you that on another chart.

00:27:57.549 --> 00:28:03.901
As I said, this size, the liquid oxygen/hydrogen
tanks are not reusable, and I will make that

00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:06.980
point to you a little later on, but once you
decide what kind of engine you are going to

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:12.519
use, that size of the tank because of using
the equations of motion you can figure out

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:16.350
how much propellants you need, you get the
density of the propellant and now you know

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.460
what size tank you are going to use.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.460
Yes, sir.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:24.370
A couple slides back you had said the main
engines of the Orbiter had to be recovered.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.370
Right.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.370
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.950
It was a separate contract, but it was placed
inside the Orbiter.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.289
When the Orbiter came back the engines came
back with it.

00:28:32.289 --> 00:28:34.150
Was that your question?

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.150
Yes.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.110
For example, the Johnson Space Center was
responsible for the Orbiter.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:43.080
And you're going to have the person talk that
was responsible for the engine, J.R. Thompson.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.809
He was at the Marshall Space Flight Center.

00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:53.600
But the engines were installed in the Orbiter
so the Orbiter brought them back.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.750
Solid rocket boosters provided the additional
propulsion required to get the Orbiter in

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:01.429
orbit and the solid rocket boosters were designed
to be recoverable and reused.

00:29:01.429 --> 00:29:04.870
Those were some of the system studies that
led to the configuration.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:05.870
Yes, sir.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:11.759
At that period, was there any discussion of
the environmental impact of solids being used

00:29:11.759 --> 00:29:13.789
at 60 flights a year?

00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:14.789
Yes there was.

00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:15.789
There was quite a bit.

00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:21.200
I don't recall the details, but I do know
there was a lot of work on that many solids

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.200
being used.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.551
And I guess we basically put that to rest,
but there was a lot.

00:29:26.551 --> 00:29:27.799
I don't know the details of it.

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:29.279
In fact, that might be a good question.

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:30.980
If you are not here, we will ask J.R.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:31.980
Thompson because J.R.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.100
should know that.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:41.720
I met with some of the Russians who worked
on the Buran which was the Russian comparable

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.720
to the Shuttle.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.909
One of the big changes was that they said
how could the Americans have used solids for

00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:46.909
that many flights?

00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:49.679
It was studied and actually put to bed, or
put to rest, should I say?

00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:52.180
I don't know the details, but that is a very
good question.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:57.120
There are going to be various speakers, as
I said, and J.R.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.179
should have that answer.

00:29:58.179 --> 00:30:06.159
Solid rockets recovered and reused.

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:15.990
Well, some of the things I have said before,
the Orbiter entry cross-range required delta

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.990
wings.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.159
To go 1100 nautical miles cross-range you
needed delta wings.

00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:25.639
Deletion of the air breathing engines for
moving the Orbiter required the Boeing 747

00:30:25.639 --> 00:30:26.639
to carry the Orbiter.

00:30:26.639 --> 00:30:27.990
Let me tell you that story.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:33.070
All of you are very familiar now that when
we land at Edwards Air Force Space, we put

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:38.750
the Orbiter on top of the 747 and we fly it
back to Kennedy.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:44.779
Well, I was the Orbiter Project Manager, I
became Orbiter Project Manager August of 1972,

00:30:44.779 --> 00:30:46.149
and I was having all sorts of problems.

00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:49.190
The first thing they did to me was cut my
budget in half.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.190
The OMB cut my budget in half.

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:51.809
That was the first thing that happened.

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:55.169
And then I just had a lot of problems.

00:30:55.169 --> 00:30:56.500
But I had worked on the Apollo Program.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.950
I had a lot of friends in the organization,
although I was Orbiter Project Manager.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:04.210
Three of my friends came into the office one
afternoon, I forget, maybe two or three months

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.590
after we started, and said Aaron, we have
a great idea.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:07.860
I said what's that?

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:15.401
They said we can put the Orbiter on top of
a 747 or a DC10 and ferry it back to Kennedy

00:31:15.401 --> 00:31:16.909
from Edwards Air Force Base.

00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:18.960
We may have to make one or two stops and ferry
it back.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.320
I look at him for a moment and said that is
absolutely the dumbest idea I heard in my

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.251
life, and I basically threw the people out
of my office.

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:27.251
And these were my friends.

00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:29.290
Well, these people will not take no for answer.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.330
It happened to be they had another very good
quality.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.590
They were all world-class model airplane builders.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:39.429
And these guys had won competition all over
the world, three of them.

00:31:39.429 --> 00:31:41.159
So they came back about ten days later.

00:31:41.159 --> 00:31:44.790
And I don't know how many of you have seen
the Johnson Space Center but we have a lot

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.220
of acreage out there in Texas.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.160
They said come out, we want to show you something.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:54.809
They had built a radio controlled model of
the 747 and an Orbiter and actually flew it

00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:57.480
for me and separated the Orbiter from the
747.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.250
That is how it got started.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.610
And so we eliminated the air breathing engines.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.769
But I remember throwing them out of the office.

00:32:04.769 --> 00:32:06.480
Fly-by-wire with a digital autopilot.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.480
Yes, sir.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:13.220
Are you saying that you had air breathing
engines and the Orbiter itself would fly back

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.269
to Edwards Air Force Base?

00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:15.269
That's a good question.

00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:16.269
I missed that point.

00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:17.269
Let me explain it to you.

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:18.970
That is exactly right.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:24.350
If you recall, when the Orbiter lands, the
nose gear is very short.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:30.129
What we had to do, he asked a very pertinent
question, we had to actually replace the landing

00:32:30.129 --> 00:32:34.090
gear with a different landing gear that caused
the Orbiter to have an attitude like this.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.520
It wasn't like this.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.520
It was like this.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:43.009
We put air breathing engines on and took off
and had to have five in-flight refuelings

00:32:43.009 --> 00:32:44.559
to get to California.

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:47.659
Strap on air breathing engines.

00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:50.309
And, plus, a different landing gear.

00:32:50.309 --> 00:32:52.230
And we took off horizontally.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:55.220
And five in-flight refuelings to get from
California to Florida.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:59.600
And you brought up an important point that
I left out, that's the reason why we changed

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.600
it.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.690
Thank you very much.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.759
And, of course, we went with the fly-by-wire
with a digital autopilot.

00:33:06.759 --> 00:33:09.419
This was a very fundamental change.

00:33:09.419 --> 00:33:14.090
The astronauts at that time did not like this
very much.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:19.201
Now, when you get all these new pilots in,
they wouldn't know what you were talking about.

00:33:19.201 --> 00:33:22.029
Why not have a fly-by-wire system?

00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:25.529
They didn't like it at one time, but we went
with a fly-by-wire with a digital autopilot.

00:33:25.529 --> 00:33:30.809
Even though you are going to have a special
briefing on the guidance navigation control

00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:33.480
system, I am going to talk a little bit more
in detail about that because that happens

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.610
to be my expertise.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:40.320
So I am going to talk about that a little
bit in more detail.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.320
Yes, sir.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.320
What does fly-by-wire mean?

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:47.669
It means that you actually have a computer
which actually controls the surfaces.

00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:54.940
Whereas, in past airplanes, your stick actually
had cables that controlled the surfaces.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.350
So you get a lot more performance.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:02.759
It is a little bit confusing in the sense
of a wire.

00:34:02.759 --> 00:34:09.889
Don't think of it as a hard wire which is
like the old type of airplanes where there

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:11.110
was a cable.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:16.130
When you pulled on the stick there was actually
a cable that went back to the ailerons and

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.750
the rudder and everything.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:24.331
And, as professor Cohen says, everything now
has a computer in the middle.

00:34:24.331 --> 00:34:26.560
And what you're really doing is flying the
computer.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.370
And the computer then issues the commands
to the hydraulic system.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:37.740
But the Shuttle, I guess, was the first vehicle
that really had that system.

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:46.500
There were no commercial planes flying with
that system or military planes flying.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.610
And the real concern was safety and reliability.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:55.170
Suppose you have a computer problem, what
are you going to do?

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.780
I will talk about that in detail.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.780
That's a good question.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.780
Any other questions.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.780
Those are very good questions.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.780
I appreciate them.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.780
Yes, sir.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.860
Can you just explain cross-range for a moment?

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:04.860
Cross-range.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.520
Realize the Orbiter is a glider so-to-speak.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.540
Not much of a glider but a glider.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:16.400
And, actually, downrange would be going in
this direction.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.020
Cross-range would be out of plane direction,
so you could actually maneuver out of plane.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.860
We have a nice globe here.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.920
I am not going to carry it up to the front
and I don't have a piece of chalk either.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:31.840
These are very good questions, by the way.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.470
Thank you very much.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.630
Here is the United State roughly.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:41.090
This was designed for the military requirements.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:45.590
They wanted to be able to, for reconnaissance
satellites, basically, you want to be in polar

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:51.030
orbit because you are going around, let's
say this is an orbit here, then the earth

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:57.070
turns underneath it, and so you basically
fly over all parts of the earth.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:58.950
That was the basic military requirement.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:05.670
They wanted to be able to launch out of Vandenberg
on the West Coast into a polar orbit.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:13.090
And, because of security reasons, this sounds
a little bit strange when we think back on

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:18.950
it, but in a time of crisis, remember we were
in the Cold War and everything, you wanted

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:26.670
to be able to put a satellite up without necessarily
giving the other side a chance to make all

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:30.570
the radar measurements on the Shuttle and
everything and figure out right away where

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.100
the satellite is.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.150
And also there might be hostilities.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.920
The Shuttle was a strategic asset.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:42.680
So basically they wanted the Shuttle to be
able to land the very next orbit.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:48.450
Well, all right, you take off from California,
you fly over the pole and you deploy your

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:49.690
satellite.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:54.120
And, by the way, we have never, with all the
satellites we have deployed, ever deployed

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.550
a satellite on the first orbit.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:59.010
That would be an incredible feat, but that
was the requirement.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:02.650
So you fly over the pole, you come back around.

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:04.870
Now you're ready to land in California.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:13.790
But, during that time, the earth has turned
by a thousand miles, 24,000 mile circumference

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:17.170
in 24 hours.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:23.530
Actually, 1500 miles because an orbit is 90
minutes, 1.5 hours.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:27.660
Your orbit now would put you right over the
Pacific Ocean.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:33.100
If you just burn your engines, slow down and
come down through the atmosphere, that is

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.220
where you are going to land.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:41.510
So instead, as you're flying through the atmosphere,
you basically have to come down banked on

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.170
your side.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.990
So, essentially, you're generating a lift
vector.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.570
And, instead of turning your lift vector up,
you turn your lift vector to the side and

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.270
that pushes you over.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.730
And delta wings can generate a higher lift
vector than the straight wings, and that was

00:37:55.730 --> 00:38:04.940
the determining factor.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.940
Very good.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.200
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.200
Well, I think that's right.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.200
Can you address that, Jeff?

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:19.680
My recollection at the time was that even
coming in over the Pacific, yes, there were

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:26.570
some places where you could land on land but
it would mean landing in hostile territory,

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:34.250
the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe, and we
didn't want to do that.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.830
So the cross-range initially was to be able
to make Australia.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:36.830
Well, I'm sure that's right.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.300
Certainly, there were landing sites that we
had all over the world.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:48.680
It could have been a much smaller cross-range
if we were willing [OVERLAPPING VOICES].

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:56.620
And, I will say, continue to remind us if
we don't explain some basic things.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:01.840
Because we've been dealing with this for so
long that some of these things just seem like

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.850
second-nature.

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:08.310
You weren't even born when the Shuttle started
flying.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:12.730
And so the level of backgrounds is going to
be very different.

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.670
We want to bring everybody along with us.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:21.050
So if there is something that we say the same
thing, you know, the question about hypergolic

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:26.520
fuel, if we use a term and you don't understand
it, we will try not to use a lot of acronyms.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.020
I cannot guaranty that the speakers won't
use acronyms.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:34.610
Don't be embarrassed to just stop and say
what does that mean, what are you talking

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:35.610
about?

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.141
But, as we go through the course, you are
going to get more detail, more detail.

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:42.750
For example, you have a total lecture by a
man named Henry Pole who is going to talk

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:43.790
about the reaction control system.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.880
He will give you all the details you want
to know about hypergolics and storables, more

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.290
than you ever wanted to know.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.921
So you are going to get more details as you
go through.

00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:52.150
But don't hesitate to ask questions because
it's good for us.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:58.340
Let me tell you another satellite story.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.780
My wife and I moved to College Station.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.060
My wife was working at a junior college in
the registrar's office.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.250
She was working with a young lady and Apollo
13 came out.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:17.652
Well, Apollo 13 happened to be my first mission
when I was Manager of Command and Service

00:40:17.652 --> 00:40:19.970
Module so I know a little bit about it.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:24.030
In fact, I am going to give a lecture in Dick
Batten's course on the 26th on Apollo 13.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:32.120
But my wife talked to this young lady and
said I went to see Apollo 13 yesterday.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.461
And she said it was so exciting.

00:40:34.461 --> 00:40:37.810
I didn't know how it was going to end.

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:42.520
[LAUGHTER] So it is a frame of reference.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.640
Well, we've talked about this.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.930
The size of the payload bay is 60 feet long
by 15 feet diameter.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:50.150
Size of the crew cabin defined to be over
2600 cubic feet.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:56.250
The payload, as you know, is 65,000 pounds
at liftoff, 35 pounds at landing.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:04.150
And what you need to understand is the Orbiter
is a launch vehicle, it's a spacecraft and

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:05.840
it's an aircraft.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:11.950
And when you look at the two different systems,
I worked on Apollo, as I said, very much and

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:16.991
on the Shuttle, and there is no question that
the Shuttle is much more complicated than

00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:17.991
Apollo.

00:41:17.991 --> 00:41:20.050
On the other hand, the Apollo mission is much
more complicated than the Shuttle mission.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:24.290
But this is something that makes it very,
very interesting.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.170
This is a very old chart.

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:28.330
And, in fact, this is the original chart.

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:30.610
It comes out yellow.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:40.140
This was the original cost estimate and how
they totaled up the $5.15 billion.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.501
We talked about that.

00:41:41.501 --> 00:41:47.530
And that was the very original cost estimate
done on a cost analyst chart.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:51.081
There were no personal computers at the time.

00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:56.380
In fact, I found that in my files.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.190
That's a very old yellow chart.

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:01.620
It's hard to believe some of those numbers.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:07.010
On the other hand, I had a gentleman who worked
for me who got his PhD at the University of

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.020
Colorado and his subject was the cost of the
shuttle Orbiter.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:14.300
And it turns out that if we had those two
years of inflation we really would have made

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:21.150
that cost on the $5.15 in 1971 dollars.

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:23.900
It only ran over by about 10%.

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:24.900
That's right.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.820
Let's now talk a little bit about configuration.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.912
I don't know if you can see this chart or
not.

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:40.620
Now, you might say how did you go from that
conception in August of 1972 to something

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.040
with all these numbers on it?

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.780
Now, this is really a case in systems engineering.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.730
And let me explain to you what I mean by that.

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:54.180
Certain assumptions had been made.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:43:02.160
One assumption was that in the Orbiter it
was going to weigh about 175,000 pounds without

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:07.580
payload and you were going to have a 65,000
pound payload.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.020
You had to make that assumption.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:19.710
You also had to make an assumption that you
were going to use a liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:20.710
engine.

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:21.710
And why did you select that?

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:26.700
Today I'm not quite sure it was a good decision,
but we did.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.700
Why?

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.980
Because of specific impulse, the ISP or the
performance of the engine was the highest

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.120
for the liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen chemical
compulsion that we know today.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.700
So we selected that.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:44.250
Well, when you use the equations of motion,
you integrate the equations of motion or any

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:50.430
other techniques you may want to use, you
then show how much propellant you're going

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:53.430
to need to get that into orbit.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:44:00.010
Then you know that liquid hydrogen has a density
of about 4 pounds per cubic foot, very low

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:01.050
density.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:04.590
That means this big external tank is mostly
hydrogen.

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.230
It's a very, very big volume.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:11.030
And liquid oxygen is about 70 pounds per cubic
foot.

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:14.030
That basically sizes your external tank.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:19.530
It's a very simplified approach but that systems
engineering.

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:24.700
You get much iteration because there is an
old adage that the devil is in the details.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:30.040
So you keep iterating on that with this expert
team.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:36.210
You then say, well, that's still not going
to be the most efficient way to get you to

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:37.210
orbit.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:40.890
You say you need really a stage system, so
you put the solid rocket boosters on.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:44.870
You don't have what they call a single-stage-to-orbit,
you really have more like a two-staged orbit

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:49.620
and you size the solid rocket boosters and
determine when they have to come off.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:55.440
Basically, that is how you go about doing
the systems approach using systems engineering

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.660
to come up with a configuration.

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:03.070
Now, that is a very over-simplified way of
doing it, the statement I made, but that's

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.310
basically how you do it.

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:08.170
And these are some of the dimensions that
then come out of the vehicle.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.240
And I think they're in that handout we gave
you also.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.550
And it looks like I am going to take off.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:16.060
I did know that this chart tries to lift off
on me.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:26.930
I don't know what the best way to do it is.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:29.650
You can find those dimensions, I believe,
in that paper that was handed out.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:37.720
But this shows you all the dimensions of the
Space Shuttle system, the solid rocket boosters,

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.970
the external tank and the Orbiter.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:47.340
Now, an interesting sideline in this, which
I got to thinking about after the Columbia

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.360
accident where the foam came off.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:56.280
Of course, the reason why we put foam on was
because with liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen,

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.930
at those temperatures you are going to have
a lot of ice form.

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:05.060
And when ice forms and comes down and hits
the Orbiter with the thermal protection system,

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.160
I am going to talk about that in more detail,
you are going to do some damage.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:12.530
So one solution would be to put foam on the
tank to eliminate the ice.

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:16.180
And, of course, you would assume that foam
could stay on the tank.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:20.330
Another solution would have been to not go
with the liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen engine

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:21.770
and go with what we call storables.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:26.021
Of course, they wouldn't have gotten as much
performance and you probably couldn't put

00:46:26.021 --> 00:46:29.080
65,000 pounds of payload into orbit.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.840
But the point of bringing this to you, those
are some of the decisions, as you go into

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.770
various projects, you need to challenge the
requirements because the requirements are

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:43.840
really going to decide what kind of system
you are going to have.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.230
That's really the point I wanted to make.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:46.410
Are there any questions?

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:47.410
Yes.

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:53.790
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:54.790
That's a good question.

00:46:54.790 --> 00:47:04.370
One thought at one time was to put the liquid
hydrogen tank in the Orbiter and that would

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:05.370
basically isolate it.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.370
You'd put it inside.

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:10.390
Or, put insulation on the inside, as you pointed
out.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:14.360
Those were thought about.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.551
The decision, obviously, was not to do it.

00:47:15.551 --> 00:47:17.480
I don't recall the reason why.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.480
But, when J.R.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.800
Thomas comes, I will ask him that question.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.431
That is a very good question.

00:47:22.431 --> 00:47:24.930
Yes, it was two things.

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:26.551
Could you put some of this propellant inside
the tank?

00:47:26.551 --> 00:47:32.980
And the other is could you put insulation
inside the tank itself?

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:33.980
And that was looked at.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:39.970
And I guess it was complicated and very costly
to do it that way, but it was looked at.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:40.970
That's a very good question.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:42.300
By the way, these are very good questions.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:51.500
One thing, when you look at this external
tank, only the very upper part is for oxygen

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.820
because the density of hydrogen is so low.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:58.670
I mean all of this part of the tank is for
hydrogen.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:04.700
So, to have put all the hydrogen inside the
Orbiter, you would have a very different looking

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.700
Orbiter.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.700
You wouldn't have been able to do it.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:11.060
But she really said could you put insulation
inside the tank [OVERLAPPING VOICES].

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.520
Any other questions?

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.110
But that's basically how the system evolved.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:20.450
Now, I oversimplified it to quite an extent
but you have to realize there were a lot of

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:21.450
iterations.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:27.120
One other key thing, though, when you have
new systems engineering, you do it in a team.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:33.670
You usually have different capabilities on
the team, arrows, mechanical engineers, electrical

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:37.480
engineers, so you have different types of
disciplines on the systems engineering team

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.740
that can help you do that.

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:43.110
And then you have a systems engineer that
sort of heads it up.

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:45.690
But we're going to concentrate more on the
Orbiter.

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:50.650
And we have one of the speakers who is going
to concentrate on the engine and so forth.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:51.650
That's what the system looked like.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:56.680
The other thing that is interesting, I think,
is what the mission profile essentially looked

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.680
like.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:04.310
And this happens to be for STS-5, but this
is the basic mission profile.

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:08.360
Now, before I start that, let me say this
gentleman right here has flown that profile

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.870
five times.

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:12.041
And so he's done that five times.

00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:14.250
He can talk much more about it than I can.

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:18.720
One time, I will tell the story, I'm just
about tired of hearing it, but when I was

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.980
Director of the Johnson Space Center we had
a lot of visitors.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:23.980
One time I had Mr.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.530
James Baker, who at that time was Secretary
of the State, and Eduard Shevardnadze from

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:30.990
Russia who had the same position in Russia
at the time.

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:35.260
And I took them over to Mission Control as
a visit and put Mr.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:40.900
Shevardnadze down in the flight controller
seat and was going to let him talk to the

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.990
crew.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:49.040
Not knowing that Jeff Hoffman was on duty
at the time, Edward Shevardnadze spoke in

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.410
Russian up to the crew.

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:54.800
And, before the interpreter could answer it,
down comes this beautiful answer in Russian

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.830
from Jeff Hoffman.

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:59.990
So that really floored both Mr.

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:02.020
Baker and Edward Shevardnadze, and me.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.870
That was an interesting story.

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:10.030
Here gives you a little profile of the Shuttle
mission.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:11.030
You lift off.

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:14.770
You've reached max dynamic pressure in about
one minute.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.400
About 3800 feet is where you reach dynamic
pressure.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.970
You have the SRB sep in about two minutes.

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:24.810
You remember in the Challenger action, I believe
it happened at about 60 seconds.

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:27.900
But in two minutes you get SRB sep.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:32.460
And it lands the SRB by parachutes.

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.651
You have MECO, which is main engine cutoff.

00:50:34.651 --> 00:50:35.651
The main engine cuts off.

00:50:35.651 --> 00:50:38.640
And that, to me, is the biggest issue.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:44.210
When that main engine has to burn for over
eight minutes that is taking all the propellant

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:52.490
out of that big tank, the liquid oxygen, liquid
hydrogen firing the main engines.

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:56.550
What's the velocity of the main engine cutoff,
do you know?

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:59.400
It's within a few hundred feet per second
of [OVERLAPPING VOICES].

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.700
And then you get external tank separation.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:09.410
The external tank comes down about 9000 miles
downrange and lands in the Indian Ocean.

00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:13.510
Then you use the orbital maneuvering system,
the OMS engine, the pods on the back of the

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:14.510
Orbiter.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:19.520
You use that for a very short period of time
to get into orbit.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.650
Then you have your operations, whatever you're
going to do, go out and service the Hubble

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:24.740
or whatever.

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:28.180
You de-orbit with the orbital maneuvering
system engine.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.890
You have entry interface at 400,000 feet.

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:31.740
And why do you pick 400,000 feet?

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.410
Because that's where you start sensing gravity.

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:38.540
You get about 0.05 Gs at 400,000 feet.

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:43.321
And then you reenter and land either at Edwards
or Kennedy.

00:51:43.321 --> 00:51:46.100
[AUDIENCE QUESTION].

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.100
Yes?

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.520
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.520
Why does it turn?

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:55.070
Yes.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.270
You mean liftoff?

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:57.270
Yes.

00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:00.000
Well, that's a very good question.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.940
Let's see if I can repeat that very accurately.

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:11.490
The fact is that we used the Apollo launch
pad and the ditches for the flame bucket,

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:12.800
where the engine goes.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:18.280
So, in order to get it to the right alttitude,
we had to make that maneuver.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.140
You had to make that roll maneuver during
liftoff.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:21.511
Is that what you're talking about, the roll
maneuver during liftoff?

00:52:21.511 --> 00:52:22.511
Yes.

00:52:22.511 --> 00:52:24.240
We had to make that roll maneuver because
we weren't in the right orientation.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:29.400
We had to make the roll maneuver because it
wasn't oriented correctly on the pad.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.860
Now, let me answer your question.

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.520
The Buron was a Russian vehicle.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:42.431
Well, Dan Brandenstein who was an astronaut
headed the Astronaut Office saw that the Russians

00:52:42.431 --> 00:52:44.680
made this roll maneuver.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:48.001
And he asked the Russians why they made that
roll maneuver?

00:52:48.001 --> 00:52:50.690
I mean they didn't have to do it, he said,
because you do.

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:52.150
[LAUGHTER] That's true.

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:53.530
Did you hear that story?

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:55.100
Did I say it correctly?

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.610
I think so.

00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:58.450
He said because you do.

00:52:58.450 --> 00:52:59.450
That is a good question.

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:04.750
There may be one other aspect to it, and that's
the question of why does the Shuttle actually

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:07.160
fly upside down on the way up?

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:13.880
And I believe the original decision was aerodynamics
because the thrust is asymmetric.

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:21.490
You have the external tank, and the Shuttle
is sitting on the external tank, so the thrust

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:24.640
actually has to be through the center of mass
of the whole system.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.930
So it is actually flying not straight but
is a little bit screwed.

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:33.830
And, for aerodynamic purposes, I guess they
figured there was less stress.

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:42.860
Although, recently they've started partway
through the launch doing another roll maneuver.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:46.030
And I think that's for communications.

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:51.390
I'm not 100% sure when they started doing
that again.

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:52.510
I'm not sure either.

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:59.020
But the early part of the launch, when you're
riding the solids aerodynamically, you go

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:05.880
through max Q you're in much better shape
if you're upside down.

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.700
Yes?

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:17.340
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:27.990
Well, to use a big solid rocket booster, it's
not very efficient.

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.180
Many people have studied single-stage-to-orbits.

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:34.890
Let me just ask a question.

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:41.170
I know we've got a mixture of aero-astro and
TPP, ESD.

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:47.570
Are there people here who have not seen the
rocket equation?

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:48.570
Everybody.

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:49.570
Well, OK.

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:50.570
That's very important.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:59.890
Let me just very briefly If you have a rocket
and you want to increase the velocity of the

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:08.840
rocket, I mean that's a critical thing, by
a certain delta V, you can take the mass of

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:19.170
the rocket when you start the burn, which
we call M sub i, the initial mass, and the

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:21.730
final mass.

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:27.340
And, of course, the initial mass equals the
final mass plus the mass of the propellant.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:42.500
And that equals an exponential 
to the negative power of the velocity decrement,

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:49.140
which you're trying to put in, divided by
the exhaust velocity of the propellant that's

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.140
coming out.

00:55:50.140 --> 00:56:00.150
Now, this is usually phrased in terms of what
we call the specific impulse times gravity

00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:04.330
because it's done by engineers.

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:05.330
That's right.

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:12.470
So you will hear reference to the specific
impulse and the units of that are seconds.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:16.740
But, if you multiply that by the gravitational
acceleration, it will actually give you the

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:17.890
exhaust velocity.

00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:25.050
Because this is in an exponential it is extremely
sensitive to the exhaust velocity.

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:34.530
Whatever delta V you are trying to get out,
if you can add a few more seconds to the specific

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:40.180
impulse then the actual mass of propellant
that you have to burn in order to create that

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:43.170
delta V goes down substantially.

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:56.770
Now, for hydrogen/oxygen, the specific impulse
is about 450 seconds.

00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:07.420
For solid rocket motors, the specific impulse
is on the order of about 250, something like

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:08.420
that.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:10.410
That's what I thought it was, about 250.

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:12.060
That's almost a factor of two.

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:19.730
And you put that into an exponent, if you
try to get into orbit with purely a solid

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:24.750
rocket motor, you need a lot more propellant.

00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:31.770
And that means the payload mass you can take
into orbit is reduced.

00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:38.410
That's why, in addition to using hydrogen
and oxygen, and we will have a lecture specifically

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:45.430
on the main engine, they got every last ounce
of performance out of it by running it.

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:52.260
You'll hear references to running it at 104%
abraded thrust, 109% abraded thrust.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:58:00.140
And all of these have engineering consequences
because, in order to increase the exhaust

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:04.310
velocity -- Which, of course, if you do that,
that's in the denominator so that's going

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:09.160
in the right direction, you have to increase
the chamber pressure, the temperature and

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.640
all of the design problems.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.600
He is going to ask you the question why don't
you use liquids all the way?

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:20.560
I knew what your question was.

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.930
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:32.740
He is asking why don't you use the liquid
hydrogen engine all the way rather than using

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:33.740
solid rocket boosters?

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:43.740
Well, first of all, why not just have a bigger
fuel tank, one big fuel tank and just use

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:44.740
the Shuttle engine?

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.740
That's what he's saying.

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:47.930
That would be essentially single-stage-to-orbit.

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:56.100
And I'm not going to spend a lot of time with
the rocket equation, but the delta V that

00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:03.040
you need to get into orbit is, well, orbital
velocity is just under 8 kilometers per second.

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:08.609
But to that you have to add the gravity loss
[OVERLAPPING VOICES].

00:59:08.609 --> 00:59:14.420
And so the overall delta V is effectively
about 9 kilometers per second.

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:21.880
If you put that into the equation, you actually
can get the ratio of the final to the initial

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:22.880
masses.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:32.630
And even for a hydrogen/oxygen engine you
can basically almost 95% of the mass sitting

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:36.070
on the launch pad has to be propellant.

00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:40.770
Which means that all of your structure can
only be about 5%.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:48.230
Now, if we could make super strong, super
light structures, like an eggshell, then,

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:52.260
in principle, we could get to orbit without
staging.

00:59:52.260 --> 01:00:00.490
Now, the first thing you learn in Rockets
101 is why you cannot do single-stage-to-orbit.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.850
It is because right now we do not have the
technology to do that.

01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:05.220
Well, see, many people have studied single-stage-to-orbit.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:11.210
In fact, NASA tried to build one the X-23
and we failed.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:16.900
What they say is really what you need is to
be as smart or as high-tech as an eggshell,

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:20.630
be able to make the structure as thin as an
eggshell, hold all the fluid in it and have

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:23.250
very low density.

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.141
Some day maybe we will do it.

01:00:25.141 --> 01:00:33.740
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:46.140
Basically, by using the boosters or, in a
more traditional rocket, a first stage, once

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:51.240
you've exhausted the fuel then you drop all
of that structural mass.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:56.310
And so, for the second stage, this initial
mass becomes much lower.

01:00:56.310 --> 01:01:04.010
[OVERLAPPING VOICES] The other thing that's
interesting is that if you go back to Apollo,

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:06.990
during Apollo there were three ways to go
to the moon.

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:08.470
One was direct.

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:12.960
Von Braun wanted to build a large vehicle
called the Nova where you actually lifted

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.850
off from the Cape and sent the whole vehicle
right to the moon.

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:17.400
The other was to do earth orbital rendezvous.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.130
And the other way was to do Lunar orbital
rendezvous like we did.

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:27.310
It turns out that that Nova vehicle had to
be so big that that was ruled out, so we wound

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:30.590
up with earth orbital rendezvous.

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:31.590
Yes, sir.

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:35.510
How much did the role of geography play in
the design considerations?

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:41.170
Because just looking at that, I mean, you
have to have the external tank separate at

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:45.780
a specific [OVERLAPPING VOICES] talking about
launching in Vandenberg.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:50.280
Originally we thought about launching out
of New Mexico.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:02:00.500
Actually, when you're doing flight design,
depending on whether you're going into a due

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:09.910
east launch to go into a 28 degree orbit or
a high inclination orbit, the placement of

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:14.400
the external tank reentry is a major factor
in flight design.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400
We spent a lot of time on that.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:23.230
And, in fact, often the trajectory has to
be shaped to be not quite efficient as it

01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:27.300
otherwise might be because you have to control
the landing of the external tank.

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.300
But your question is a good one.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:35.660
I did some consulting for a company, after
I retired, and we were looking at a commercial

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.800
launch vehicle.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:42.770
And we were trying to launch the vehicle out
of various places in the United States.

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:48.820
And it's very difficult to get approval because
of the concerns they had for types of failures

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.810
or anything that you're going to do.

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:51.810
Yes, sir.

01:02:51.810 --> 01:03:01.130
I'm not sure why I thought this, but I was
under the impression that the external tank

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:02.130
burned up in the atmosphere.

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:03.130
No.

01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:04.130
It didn't hit down.

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:05.130
It breaks up in the atmosphere.

01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:06.130
It didn't come down as one big glob.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:09.080
Some of it burns up, but some of it does get
back to the ground.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080
OK.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.670
Is there any talk about a need to clean up
all that?

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:16.670
Well, they haven't yet.

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:17.670
I'm not an astronaut.

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.670
That's mainly aluminum.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:23.130
Remember, the liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen
inside evaporate and are non-toxic.

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:24.460
They question that Dr.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:30.090
Young asked about the solid rocket booster
environmental problem is a real problem that

01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:32.260
had to be solved.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:37.920
The other problem I had, I worked on trying
to get the Galileo cleared because it had

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.360
a radio thermal nuclear generator on it.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.320
To get that cleared going into orbit is a
big job.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.990
I worked on that and thought I would never
finish it, but we finally got it cleared.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.580
But it was a very tough job.

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:51.600
We had RTGs cleared to be launched.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:57.160
I don't remember specifically all the noxious
chemicals that come out of the solid rocket

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.280
boosters, but it is pretty nasty stuff.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.280
Yeah, it is.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:06.860
I remember one of my launched, the families
and guests are taken to a launch site viewing

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:11.950
area about three miles inland from the launch
pad.

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:18.300
And it just so happened that the wind was
blowing onshore that day, it was an afternoon

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:26.160
launch, and my brother is a real space nut
who always liked to watch as the rocket went.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.070
After about seven and a half minutes it just
sort of disappears over the horizon.

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:38.240
But, after about five minutes, the solid rocket
exhaust was actually approaching the spectator

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.340
area because of the wind blowing in.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:46.220
And they made everyone get on the buses and
drove them away so that nobody got injured.

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:49.750
And my brother was really annoyed because
he didn't want to leave.

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:55.280
If we have time, I would like to talk to you
a little bit about the Challenger accident,

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.300
talk to you about the O ring seal.

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.550
I would like to talk to you about that.

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:01.040
I don't want to sweep those things under the
rug, but I would like to talk to you about

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.900
that because I've got my own thoughts on the
problem that I would like you to hear.

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:06.900
OK.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:07.900
Any other questions on the mission profile?

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.900
Shall we keep going?

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:09.900
Yeah.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.000
Tell you what.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.120
Let's take a two-minute break, stand up and
turn around.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:22.850
An hour is a long enough time to sit for a
bit.

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:28.790
I am assuming that everybody is aware that
the Russians, at one time, had a space Shuttle

01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:30.790
program.

01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:35.770
And they manufactured a vehicle which looked
almost identical.

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:37.920
Not exactly but almost identical.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.480
And it was no accident because they used our
plans.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.190
They used our thermal protection system, too.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.510
And they only ended up flying it once.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:48.700
And they actually flew it unmanned.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:59.980
And, despite a little bit of nail-biting during
the landing, they did recover it successfully.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:04.700
And then they discovered, just what we had
discovered, that it was a lot more expensive

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.840
to operate than they had anticipated.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.770
And they had a lot less money than we did.

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:13.390
And so it basically never flew again.

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:19.290
They had crews of cosmonauts who had been
training to fly the Buran, but there were

01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:21.330
actually two differences.

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:29.570
The first was that they put the engines on
the external tank.

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:30.570
This did two things.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.530
First of all, it did improve the performance.

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:43.580
And also the Russians were turning out engines
on assembly lines basically.

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.310
They turn out a tremendous amount of rocket
engines.

01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:52.141
And I guess, from their point of view, and
I don't know the details of the performance

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:58.790
of their engine, how their main engine is
compared to ours, I think they actually had

01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:00.310
four engines, if I remember.

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:11.430
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:14.990
The Orbiter was just a glider, and it was
no difference.

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:17.950
It was an unpowered glider.

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:25.831
They did learn one thing from us that when
you have a delta wing vehicle you are very,

01:07:25.831 --> 01:07:30.890
very sensitive to the center of mass of the
system.

01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:35.200
And it was a problem because the Orbiter,
when it flies back through the atmosphere,

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:44.090
it hits the top of the atmosphere at mach
25 and then flies all the way down to subsonic.

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:51.050
And the control characteristics and stability
characteristics change throughout that flight

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:52.050
envelope.

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:57.530
And we will have a lecture specifically on
the aerodynamics of the Shuttle, but it turns

01:07:57.530 --> 01:08:04.340
out that the Shuttle is extremely sensitive
to the forward CG.

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:09.930
And I think it was around the mach 3 flight
regime, if you're just an inch or two forward

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:14.570
of the critical area in the CG, you can lose
control.

01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:22.960
And so we actually, on many flights, they
always do a weight and balance on the Shuttle

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:30.581
before a launch, have had to be put lead ballast
in the aft engine compartment of the Shuttle

01:08:30.581 --> 01:08:36.239
just to get the CG far enough back to get
mach 3 stability.

01:08:36.239 --> 01:08:41.659
I hate to tell you how many tons of lead we've
launched into orbit over the course of the

01:08:41.659 --> 01:08:43.889
Shuttle program because of the CG.

01:08:43.889 --> 01:08:49.780
And, if you look, the delta wing profile of
Buran is slight different from the Orbiter

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:51.659
because I guess they learned the lesson.

01:08:51.659 --> 01:08:54.469
And so they were not as sensitive to the CG.

01:08:54.469 --> 01:09:01.230
But, of course, once you build an Orbiter
you cannot really change it.

01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:04.559
And so we were sort of stuck with it.

01:09:04.559 --> 01:09:09.989
To add on, one of the other concerns was having
the Orbiter with the thrust behind the Orbiter

01:09:09.989 --> 01:09:16.139
and this large mass in the tank you could
get a pogo-type activity.

01:09:16.139 --> 01:09:21.329
And so one concept that Max Faget had early
in the program was to have a swing engine,

01:09:21.329 --> 01:09:27.580
actually have the engines fire on the back
of the tank and then, when you get ready to

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.650
separate the tanks, swing the engines back
into the Orbiter and bring them back into

01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:31.650
the Orbiter.

01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:32.940
And we threw that out.

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:33.940
That was a little complicated.

01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:37.800
You're going to have a discussion on mechanism
in mechanical systems.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:45.549
And, mechanisms in mechanical systems, everybody
can design but everybody has a hard time making

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:46.549
them work.

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:48.650
When you put up an electrical schematic everybody
accepts it.

01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:54.099
When you put up a mechanical drawing of a
mechanical system everybody has an idea of

01:09:54.099 --> 01:09:56.000
how it is supposed to work.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Let's move on.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.901
I've got some pictures now just to show you.

01:09:58.901 --> 01:10:01.320
It is showing a profile.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.340
And then, of course, you've seen the vehicle
when it gets to roll out of the assembly building.

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:08.699
There it is stacked.

01:10:08.699 --> 01:10:12.690
And then it's on a crawler.

01:10:12.690 --> 01:10:17.119
This crawler basically was used for Apollo,
and the crawler takes the vehicle out the

01:10:17.119 --> 01:10:18.119
pad.

01:10:18.119 --> 01:10:22.460
Just one thing so that people notice the difference
here.

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:28.440
Is anyone familiar enough with Apollo to be
able to say what the fundamental difference

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:34.030
is with the crawler mechanism here and the
crawler in the pad?

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:41.849
Well, if you look at the picture of a Saturn
rocket being rolled on the crawler, the whole

01:10:41.849 --> 01:10:44.519
launch tower was on the crawler.

01:10:44.519 --> 01:10:48.900
And so they rolled the whole thing out.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.550
With the Shuttle it's a little different.

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:58.519
I will be bringing in some pictures at some
point to show you some of these details, but

01:10:58.519 --> 01:11:05.170
they actually cut off the top part of the
Saturn launch tower because the shuttle stack

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:06.440
isn't quite as tall.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:12.929
And they added a movable what's called a payload
change-out fixture.

01:11:12.929 --> 01:11:20.289
And so once the shuttle actually gets on the
pad, there are actually railroad tracks here.

01:11:20.289 --> 01:11:22.489
Is this a better picture of it?

01:11:22.489 --> 01:11:23.489
OK.

01:11:23.489 --> 01:11:24.489
Yeah.

01:11:24.489 --> 01:11:34.130
This whole enclosure rolls over and forms
a kind of hermetic seal around the shuttle

01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:39.010
so that you can open the cargo bay doors which,
by the way, cannot support their own weight

01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:40.010
in one G.

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:42.289
So you have to put an external strong back
on them.

01:11:42.289 --> 01:11:49.870
And, in the meantime, you put the payload
that is going to be installed, this payload

01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:54.130
canister here, that is installed in the change-out
room.

01:11:54.130 --> 01:12:00.619
And then it is swung over, the doors are open,
the payload is installed in the bay.

01:12:00.619 --> 01:12:04.380
And then this forms a protective enclosure
over the shuttle.

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:08.900
And it is not swung back usually until the
day before launch.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:13.409
See, now this is again another detail in systems
engineering.

01:12:13.409 --> 01:12:20.269
You go in for that schematic or that little
plan form of the Orbiter, and you did iterations

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:25.699
of the size and then you had to do iterations
of the launch complex, how it was going to

01:12:25.699 --> 01:12:26.840
put payloads in.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:32.090
And that's all systems engineering, certain
levels of systems engineering.

01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:37.699
I mean it's very easy to say, well, we will
just put the payload in on the pad.

01:12:37.699 --> 01:12:44.670
But the actual development of the mechanisms
to do that is extremely complicated to say

01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:52.179
nothing of which, I mean what kind of amazes
me is that it has to be done essentially in

01:12:52.179 --> 01:12:54.059
a clean-room environment.

01:12:54.059 --> 01:13:00.519
You're up there crawling around the pad inside
the payload change-out room in white coats,

01:13:00.519 --> 01:13:03.820
bunny suits and gloves on.

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:07.159
And outside the wind is blowing and it could
be raining.

01:13:07.159 --> 01:13:08.889
There is sand blowing by.

01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:13.239
So the whole thing has to be done in a clean-room
environment, but it's on the scale of a naval

01:13:13.239 --> 01:13:14.659
shipyard.

01:13:14.659 --> 01:13:15.780
This is a huge vehicle.

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.369
So it's really a challenge.

01:13:17.369 --> 01:13:24.179
Of course, that's one of the reasons, in all
honesty why the cost per flight has gone up.

01:13:24.179 --> 01:13:29.400
The original concept, when Dale Myers was
Associate Administrator of Manned Space Flight,

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.900
the man who spoke to you, I went up to him,
seeing I was the Orbiter Project Manager.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:34.000
And we concluded this will be very simple.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.579
We were going to make very standard payloads.

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:41.820
You went, put the payload in, fixed it in,
we were going to launch it, deploy it, come

01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:46.110
back, fail the computer on the pad, we'd go
anyway, wouldn't replace the computer.

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:47.219
Of course, that all changed.

01:13:47.219 --> 01:13:51.390
The missions became very complicated and we
didn't do that.

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:54.099
That is another important point, though.

01:13:54.099 --> 01:13:59.550
You better be sure, when you get to be a project
manager or manager, you understand your requirements,

01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:01.210
understand your customer's need.

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:07.030
But, if the ground rules change, your performance
is going to change.

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.060
So you need to understand that.

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:10.559
Any other point you want to make, Jeff?

01:14:10.559 --> 01:14:11.559
Any other questions?

01:14:11.559 --> 01:14:13.280
I've just got some other pictures.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.829
Here is the liftoff, as you see, everything
burning.

01:14:16.829 --> 01:14:23.289
Have we had a case where we hit a bird on
launch?

01:14:23.289 --> 01:14:25.099
Yes, I believe we have.

01:14:25.099 --> 01:14:31.470
Of course, in the Orbiter windows, one of
the things we did, I hate to say this, is

01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:36.219
fired dead chickens into the window to see
if you could break the window in the system.

01:14:36.219 --> 01:14:38.420
I think we did an aircraft also.

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:48.280
And we actually did, I remember, one simulation
where in the simulator, right at liftoff,

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.670
the instructor came in and threw a rubber
bird in the commander's lap and said you've

01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:55.400
just been incapacitated by a bird strike.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.219
And so the copilot had to take over flying.

01:15:01.219 --> 01:15:07.130
You should realize that Kennedy Space Center
is actually a wildlife sanctuary, and so there

01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:09.800
are a lot of birds.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:15.780
There's a National Wildlife Sanctuary, park
rangers and a lot of eagles.

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:21.960
There are eagles and a lot of turkey buzzards.

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:26.010
There is a landing strip that is right in
the middle of the bird sanctuary.

01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:31.650
And so often, before the shuttle gets ready
to come in, they will send planes to sort

01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:36.429
of buzz the runway to scare the birds away.

01:15:36.429 --> 01:15:39.170
They also had a problem at one point with
owls.

01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:40.710
No, woodpeckers, excuse me.

01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:48.349
Woodpeckers were decided that the external
tank insulation was a good place to find bugs.

01:15:48.349 --> 01:15:57.929
It sounds funny, but think of what that actually
potentially could mean.

01:15:57.929 --> 01:16:05.010
They had to go down and had loudspeakers and
stuffed owls and everything, which they ended

01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:08.519
up putting around to scare away the woodpeckers.

01:16:08.519 --> 01:16:12.500
These are things, again, which I think the
original systems engineering never took into

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.690
account.

01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:15.780
We were worried about F equals MA.

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:24.210
And there is a typical deployment of [OBSCURED],
if I'm not mistaken, to get the payload into

01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:25.210
orbit.

01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:31.880
Here is a picture of the crew at their station
with their CRTs.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.219
And, of course, then you de-orbit.

01:16:33.219 --> 01:16:36.170
And this is, of course, not a real picture.

01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:38.590
Do I have that right?

01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:45.000
This is right.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:54.219
And then, of course, landing on the runway.

01:16:54.219 --> 01:16:58.030
That's a typical profile that we've gone through
in terms of showing.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:03.170
Now, let me talk a little bit more about systems
engineering.

01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:11.630
When I took over in August of 1972, we had
what we called Space Shuttle Orbiter Management

01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:12.630
Reviews.

01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:13.630
That's North American.

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:14.739
This was one of September 1972.

01:17:14.739 --> 01:17:20.770
And I think it might be interesting to look
at the agenda in September of 1972 what we

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:22.199
were talking about.

01:17:22.199 --> 01:17:23.199
And here was the agenda.

01:17:23.199 --> 01:17:28.210
I'm not going to go through all the paperwork
but here was the agenda.

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:33.050
Basic resizing of the vehicle because of certain
problems we had in the iteration.

01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:34.769
Cabin configuration and docking location.

01:17:34.769 --> 01:17:38.820
The Space Shuttle main engine interface control
document.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:44.269
It turns out interface control documents are
probably one of the most systems integration

01:17:44.269 --> 01:17:50.480
tool because interface control document defines
how you're going to put the main engine into

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.900
the Orbiter.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.000
What is interface?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.389
An interface could be this plug.

01:17:55.389 --> 01:18:00.019
If you had a plug in a socket, it would be
bad if you couldn't plug that in.

01:18:00.019 --> 01:18:01.300
But that's an interface.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:05.949
When you change your tire, if those bolt hole
patterns don't match you'd be very frustrated.

01:18:05.949 --> 01:18:06.949
So that's an interface.

01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:10.130
Interfaces can be as simple as that or they
can be very, very complicated.

01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:16.820
And so this was the SSME interface control
document, how we actually get the main engine

01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:23.199
in terms of mechanical propulsion put into
the Orbiter.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.659
Integrated asset control, abort requirements.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:33.889
And now we're talking about just procurement,
RCS and OMS procurement.

01:18:33.889 --> 01:18:35.989
The rocket motor's procurement package.

01:18:35.989 --> 01:18:40.199
Avionics definition, leading edge TPS and
emergency risk.

01:18:40.199 --> 01:18:42.869
These were some of the problems we started
talking about.

01:18:42.869 --> 01:18:45.989
Now, these are lower level systems engineering
problems.

01:18:45.989 --> 01:18:52.739
But they are systems engineering to make the
definition of the total launch configuration.

01:18:52.739 --> 01:18:57.829
Here is an interesting chart.

01:18:57.829 --> 01:18:59.349
This is dollars.

01:18:59.349 --> 01:19:07.920
Why this is interesting is you see on this
chart Rockwell's proposal.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.510
These are $1 million.

01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:15.659
$123 million the first year, but when I became
Orbiter Project Manager that was Rockwell's

01:19:15.659 --> 01:19:16.659
proposal.

01:19:16.659 --> 01:19:20.850
The first thing they did to me, they told
me I only had $73 million that year, so I

01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:22.630
had to re-phase the whole program.

01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:29.599
I had to rephrase the whole program to fit
the funding curve that the Office of Management

01:19:29.599 --> 01:19:34.190
Budget gave me.

01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:35.469
This was a major perturbation.

01:19:35.469 --> 01:19:41.900
When you do that and you don't get your money
as the proposal, it comes out to be a cost

01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:42.900
increase.

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:50.440
Right away we went a little bit cost increase
to 4.6, but as you don't get the funding requirements

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.210
you then essentially lose your momentum, you
lose your schedule.

01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:57.460
And once you lose schedule you start costing.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:58.769
As Dr.

01:19:58.769 --> 01:20:03.429
Hoffman mentioned, you have the three-ledged
stool, cost, schedule and performance.

01:20:03.429 --> 01:20:08.559
And that is a continual tradeoff as you go
through a systems engineering program.

01:20:08.559 --> 01:20:15.849
And the things you have to look at, the things
that cause project managers to lose their

01:20:15.849 --> 01:20:22.519
job is first you're going to recognize that
you have a weight increase in the vehicle.

01:20:22.519 --> 01:20:26.869
Whatever you build is going to cause to have
your weight increase.

01:20:26.869 --> 01:20:31.789
The next thing you're going to have is a schedule
slip.

01:20:31.789 --> 01:20:34.679
And then, when you put those together, you're
going to have a cost increase.

01:20:34.679 --> 01:20:36.969
And then you're going to have technical problems.

01:20:36.969 --> 01:20:41.510
And those are disastrous cases for a project
manager.

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:43.429
Those are reasons to firing somebody.

01:20:43.429 --> 01:20:45.719
Luckily I made it.

01:20:45.719 --> 01:20:49.280
I made it because of a man that you are going
to hear talk, Chris Kraft, because he was

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.260
my immediate boss and he ran interference
for me.

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.260
And you're going to hear Dr.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.260
Kraft talk.

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:56.150
He's a good man to have on your side running
interference for you.

01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:57.289
You're going to hear him talk.

01:20:57.289 --> 01:20:58.289
He's a great guy.

01:20:58.289 --> 01:21:00.290
And he's going to tell you what he thinks.

01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:02.210
And he'll tell you what he thinks.

01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:09.360
But that's a little bit about cost.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:15.900
Further systems engineering questions in the
Orbiter Management Review is Orbiter maximum

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.900
wing size.

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.650
ATP is our authority to proceed.

01:21:18.650 --> 01:21:19.980
Wing size is very important.

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.219
You've got to get the aerodynamic model wing
load squared away.

01:21:23.219 --> 01:21:28.880
We said no major line change after program
requirement is reviewed.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.659
Controlled dry weight was 170,000 pounds including
margin.

01:21:32.659 --> 01:21:35.570
And I don't think we made that, did we?

01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:37.369
No, we didn't.

01:21:37.369 --> 01:21:39.159
More like 200,000.

01:21:39.159 --> 01:21:42.760
No ejection seats on vertical flights.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.159
Top located docking port.

01:21:45.159 --> 01:21:47.909
Wing area for landing speeds of 150 knots.

01:21:47.909 --> 01:21:49.540
Wing stiffness criteria.

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:50.540
Flutter margins.

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.460
Control effectiveness for entry and ferry.

01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:53.949
Elevon design concepts.

01:21:53.949 --> 01:21:56.600
[OBSCURED] crew cabin.

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:00.760
These were some of the systems engineering
problems that had to be resolved before you

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.760
could start manufacturing.

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:08.469
One of the interesting things, I forgot who
was head of the astronaut office at the time.

01:22:08.469 --> 01:22:09.889
I don't know if it was Brandon Stein.

01:22:09.889 --> 01:22:10.889
I don't know who it was.

01:22:10.889 --> 01:22:12.519
At which time?

01:22:12.519 --> 01:22:14.860
Well, at about the time of the design of the
Shuttle.

01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:15.860
About this time.

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:18.180
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:23.079
I forgot who I asked, but we were trying to
get the cockpit laid out.

01:22:23.079 --> 01:22:25.309
It was very important to get the cockpit laid
out.

01:22:25.309 --> 01:22:29.360
And I wanted the crew to have their inputs
on how they wanted the cockpit.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.710
You want the crew to be a part of laying out
the cockpit.

01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:39.400
I called the head of the Astronaut Office
over and said we need to lay out this cockpit

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.600
and you need to come back to me with a decision
of how you want the cockpit.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.840
He said I cannot do it.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.050
I've got 100 astronauts over there and they
won't agree.

01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:47.489
I said I'll tell you what you do.

01:22:47.489 --> 01:22:50.550
You tell them that I will give two weeks and
then I'm going to do it.

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:53.920
And that really scared them because I didn't
know anything about laying out a cockpit.

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.400
And we had the cockpit laid out.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:08.320
So that's sometimes how you have to use management
techniques.

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:16.920
Now we're going to get more into the details
of what you're going to hear in some detail.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.320
And I'm going to start if off a little bit.

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:24.639
Here are basically the hardware subsystems.

01:23:24.639 --> 01:23:31.090
You're going to hear a technical briefing
on the thermal protection system and the structures.

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:37.539
You will see in your syllabus when that is,
but you're going to hear a very detailed discussion

01:23:37.539 --> 01:23:44.289
of the thermal protection system, the structures
by Tom Moser who actually did the work.

01:23:44.289 --> 01:23:49.590
He was actually what I call my subsystem manager
on the Shuttle in the early days of the program.

01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:54.969
You are going to hear a technical briefing
on the Space Shuttle main engines and a very

01:23:54.969 --> 01:23:56.389
detailed briefly by J.R.

01:23:56.389 --> 01:23:57.389
Thompson.

01:23:57.389 --> 01:23:58.389
J.R.

01:23:58.389 --> 01:24:01.630
Thompson, a little background about him, he
was Project Manager of the main engine at

01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:02.699
Marshall Space Flight Center.

01:24:02.699 --> 01:24:05.909
Then he became Director of the Marshall Space
Flight Center.

01:24:05.909 --> 01:24:07.980
Then he was Deputy Administrator at NASA.

01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:11.080
Now he is Vice President of Orbital Sciences.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:18.320
You are going to have a detailed briefing
on the hydraulic system, the auxiliary power

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.650
system, fuel cells, orbital maneuvering system
and the reaction control systems.

01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:24.011
That is going to be by Henry Pohl.

01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:32.550
Guidance, navigation and control is going
to be by Phil Hattis from the Draper Laboratories.

01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:36.800
Environment control and life support of the
crew cabin, that is going to be a man who

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.599
is currently working at the Johnson Space
Center, Walt Guy who actually did this job

01:24:41.599 --> 01:24:42.599
for the Apollo.

01:24:42.599 --> 01:24:47.090
Most of these people, by the way, did the
same thing for the Apollo that they did for

01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:48.980
Shuttle.

01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:52.861
Very similar jobs, so you can ask these people
about the Apollo program.

01:24:52.861 --> 01:24:56.119
Landing and mechanical systems by Al Louviere.

01:24:56.119 --> 01:24:58.550
Communications and electrical power we're
really not going to brief, although we will

01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:01.760
talk electrical power when we talk fuel cells,
but we're not going to really have a discussion

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:05.040
on communications and fuel cells.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:15.920
And then we're going to have some analytical
studies on aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:22.739
These will probably be detailed technical
discussions when we get into aerodynamics

01:25:22.739 --> 01:25:23.800
and aerothermodynamics.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:28.849
Again, these people did the same on Apollo
as they did on Shuttle.

01:25:28.849 --> 01:25:35.199
That is going to be your details of what you're
going to see.

01:25:35.199 --> 01:25:42.909
What I'd like to do now, with the few minutes
we have remaining, is talk to you a little

01:25:42.909 --> 01:25:47.610
bit and give you a little bit of flavor of
some of these subsystems, a little bit more

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:50.883
detail than that we've previously given you,
but not as much detail as you're going to

01:25:50.883 --> 01:25:52.239
see.

01:25:52.239 --> 01:26:00.070
Let's start off a little bit with the Orbiter
and just show you what the Orbiter looks like.

01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:08.970
And talk a little bit about some of the subsystems
in the Orbiter.

01:26:08.970 --> 01:26:13.840
The forward reaction control systems is up
in the far nose of the vehicle.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.090
And then you have the reaction control system
back in what is called the OMS pod, orbital

01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:21.090
maneuvering system pod.

01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:22.969
You have reaction control systems here and
here.

01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:24.889
That's reaction control systems.

01:26:24.889 --> 01:26:28.219
You have your Orbiter maneuvering system back
in these OMS pods.

01:26:28.219 --> 01:26:35.789
Of course, you have the main landing gear
and the nose landing gear.

01:26:35.789 --> 01:26:41.110
The wing, faring and the leading edge, which
is the carbon material.

01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:43.929
This wing edge is carbon material.

01:26:43.929 --> 01:26:48.400
And the side hatch.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.300
And the overhead windows.

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:53.110
And then the side windows and the far windows.

01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:58.551
The payload bay doors are made out of graphite
epoxy.

01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:03.409
They were originally made out of aluminum.

01:27:03.409 --> 01:27:05.929
We made it out of graphite epoxy because of
the weight growth.

01:27:05.929 --> 01:27:10.659
We could say quite a bit of weight if we went
from aluminum to graphite epoxy.

01:27:10.659 --> 01:27:15.010
That was the largest, probably at that time,
composite material used in an airplane.

01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:18.849
It was made out of graphite epoxy.

01:27:18.849 --> 01:27:24.760
And then the main engines, of course, are
in the aft end of the Orbiter.

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.999
And then you have the vertical tail stabilizer.

01:27:27.999 --> 01:27:29.630
And, of course, you've got your elevons.

01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:33.489
And you've got the body flap.

01:27:33.489 --> 01:27:38.239
The body flap was actually put on originally
to deflect some of the heat from the engine,

01:27:38.239 --> 01:27:41.409
but it actually turned out to be a control
surface also.

01:27:41.409 --> 01:27:44.889
It actually turned out to be both the focus
of a control surface.

01:27:44.889 --> 01:27:46.619
That's sort of the layout.

01:27:46.619 --> 01:27:52.210
And you can visualize where you use these
systems, these active systems.

01:27:52.210 --> 01:27:56.769
The reaction control system is used primarily
in orbit getting ready to de-orbit.

01:27:56.769 --> 01:28:00.860
The OMS is used to help you get into orbit
and get out of orbit or maneuvering you want

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:01.860
to do.

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:10.409
The body flaps and the elevons are actually
used primarily during entry, a little big

01:28:10.409 --> 01:28:12.139
during assent, during entry.

01:28:12.139 --> 01:28:15.150
We do use the RCS system a little bit during
entry.

01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:21.170
In the high altitude of entry you use the
RCS system, but eventually during entry the

01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:25.760
load just becomes so high the RCS system or
reaction control system does not become very

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:26.760
effective.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:32.710
I guess that's about all I want to say.

01:28:32.710 --> 01:28:35.079
Any questions on that?

01:28:35.079 --> 01:28:36.079
Yes, sir.

01:28:36.079 --> 01:28:38.150
I was wondering why the nose gear was so short.

01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:41.269
Well, it actually saves weight making it shorter.

01:28:41.269 --> 01:28:44.289
It was easier to put in and it saved weight.

01:28:44.289 --> 01:28:56.080
And I think also when you land, by having
the nose down you actually have an aerodynamic

01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.739
force pushing the Orbiter down on the runway
which increases your stability.

01:29:00.739 --> 01:29:05.809
And since you don't have to worry about eventually
taking off.

01:29:05.809 --> 01:29:10.770
Like Professor Cohen said, if they had wanted
the Shuttle to be able to take off horizontally

01:29:10.770 --> 01:29:16.670
from the runway they would have had to raise
the nose.

01:29:16.670 --> 01:29:18.440
Yes, sir.

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.210
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:25.420
Well, when you say under-designed, I mean
I would call it a minimum design.

01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:30.039
I mean if it were under-designed it would
break.

01:29:30.039 --> 01:29:32.440
I mean there are landing limits.

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:41.380
As I said, for a planned nominal landing,
and you have to realize there are different

01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:46.920
kinds, there are emergency limits and limits
for nominal operations, you can take off with

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.269
65,000 pounds.

01:29:49.269 --> 01:29:55.599
That means if you have a launch abort and
you have to return and land with your payload,

01:29:55.599 --> 01:29:59.659
you will be landing with 65,000 pounds.

01:29:59.659 --> 01:30:02.909
But you don't plan to do that.

01:30:02.909 --> 01:30:04.969
That's a one off deal.

01:30:04.969 --> 01:30:07.909
If you're planning to do it, it means you
can do it over and over again and then the

01:30:07.909 --> 01:30:09.560
limit is 35,000 pounds.

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.400
They don't build it like a Navy carrier landing
airplane, I will tell you that.

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:17.159
Not just landing gear, I found the tires are
just really small.

01:30:17.159 --> 01:30:20.489
The tires are small.

01:30:20.489 --> 01:30:24.269
They have no treads either.

01:30:24.269 --> 01:30:25.660
And the brakes were small.

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:31.030
Actually, the original brakes were under-designed
and we kept having brake failures.

01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:35.539
In fact, I took the drag shoots off and then
we put them back on.

01:30:35.539 --> 01:30:40.420
I took them off because of weight and put
them back on.

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:41.420
Tires are very interesting.

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:45.889
We're going to have a very detailed discussion
on tires, but tires are very, very complicated.

01:30:45.889 --> 01:30:52.949
You think by putting more plies on the tires
you make it stronger, but not necessarily

01:30:52.949 --> 01:31:00.210
because when you cycle them they got hot and
the more plies tend to hold the heat in and

01:31:00.210 --> 01:31:01.670
weakens the tire.

01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:03.789
Tires are not a very simple thing to design.

01:31:03.789 --> 01:31:05.820
They are only used once then.

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:06.820
No.

01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:10.179
I think we used these tires, I think, five
times, or could use them up to five times.

01:31:10.179 --> 01:31:11.500
The brakes are used five times.

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.280
I don't know about the tires.

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:16.230
I don't know.

01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:19.460
Let me talk about weight and margin.

01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:20.511
Let me go back to Apollo.

01:31:20.511 --> 01:31:24.559
We had Apollo designed.

01:31:24.559 --> 01:31:31.300
And we found that on the Lunar module taking
off from the Lunar surface it was too heavy.

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:32.840
We couldn't lift off.

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.349
The engines were already built, the tanks
were already sized and we couldn't get off

01:31:36.349 --> 01:31:37.349
the Lunar surface.

01:31:37.349 --> 01:31:39.300
And that's not a very good deal.

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:42.440
The astronauts didn't like that too well.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:46.929
George Low was the program manager at the
time.

01:31:46.929 --> 01:31:53.889
We were spending, in those year dollars, $24,000
a pound to get weight out of the Lunar module.

01:31:53.889 --> 01:32:00.940
And they scraped, they did everything they
could to get any [OVERLAPPING VOICES].

01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:06.389
You're basically offering them $24,000 for
every pound that they could scrub out because

01:32:06.389 --> 01:32:08.139
we couldn't resize the engine.

01:32:08.139 --> 01:32:09.139
The engine was there.

01:32:09.139 --> 01:32:16.099
They were literally in there with emery cloth
shaving down the aluminum from the inside.

01:32:16.099 --> 01:32:18.070
So weight can be very critical.

01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:25.199
I don't think most people realize how close
the margins were there.

01:32:25.199 --> 01:32:32.349
I mean the Lunar module was only certified
for, I think, five pressurizations.

01:32:32.349 --> 01:32:33.830
And then it was beyond its structure limits.

01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:38.159
My statement to many people is the next time
we go to the moon we are going to find out

01:32:38.159 --> 01:32:48.099
how hard it really was because, to tell you
the truth, we went to the moon with one computer

01:32:48.099 --> 01:32:53.730
in the service module and one computer in
the Lunar module.

01:32:53.730 --> 01:32:54.730
Excuse me.

01:32:54.730 --> 01:32:57.869
We did have two computers in the Lunar module.

01:32:57.869 --> 01:33:04.730
We had the MIT computer and then we had a
strap-down system built by TRW.

01:33:04.730 --> 01:33:07.969
That's an interesting point.

01:33:07.969 --> 01:33:10.139
I think somebody asked the question last time.

01:33:10.139 --> 01:33:15.420
Let me talk about the aft end of the Orbiter
a little bit because we did not have CAD/CAM

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:16.420
systems at the time.

01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:22.920
And let me show you some pictures taken.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:30.320
I don't know what vehicle it is, but that's
the aft end of the Orbiter.

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.520
That's where the big engines go into.

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:38.280
This looks like it is going to take off.

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:41.699
If you crawled in the back of the aft end
of the Orbiter there is plumbing, there is

01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:43.719
wiring, there is structure.

01:33:43.719 --> 01:33:51.280
Now, had we had computer-aided design at that
time, I am convinced we would have a much

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:53.760
neater, better design than we have today.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.140
We had to mark everything up.

01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.659
We marked it up and we changed it.

01:33:57.659 --> 01:33:58.920
People bumped their heads on it.

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:04.650
If you go to the aft end of the Orbiter you'd
wonder how they can do anything, but that

01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:10.770
was done because we did not have computer-aided
design.

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:13.610
Like airplanes now have virtual markups.

01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:17.079
You can actually build a virtual markup right
on your computer.

01:34:17.079 --> 01:34:19.269
We didn't have any of that.

01:34:19.269 --> 01:34:25.920
And this, again, is just to show you what
the crew module looks like in a structural

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.679
point of view.

01:34:28.679 --> 01:34:30.329
That was the pressure vessel.

01:34:30.329 --> 01:34:32.780
That's basically a pressure vessel going together.

01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:33.780
And there were the windows.

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:39.530
But the thing that's interesting about that,
it had very intricate welding techniques.

01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:44.309
And these techniques were very good and actually
proved to be a very, very satisfactory design

01:34:44.309 --> 01:34:51.599
in a pressure vessel.

01:34:51.599 --> 01:34:57.539
I would like to now talk a little bit about
a couple of subsystems that you're going to

01:34:57.539 --> 01:34:59.389
hear much more detail about.

01:34:59.389 --> 01:35:03.320
But now venture into some systems and tell
you a little bit about them.

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:08.880
It's probably going to be the thermal protection
system and the guidance and navigation system.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.460
I will talk to you a little bit about that.

01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:21.440
Here is an old chart that shows, now, unfortunately
I use English units, maximum heat rate and

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:29.499
BTUs per foot second squared, integrated heat
load and radiative equilibrium temperature.

01:35:29.499 --> 01:35:37.229
And then you see the Apollo return as number
four.

01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:43.860
And the Apollo design was about 100 BTUs per
foot squared integrated heat load, if I read

01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:52.670
the chart right, and a heat flux of about
300 BTUs per foot squared second with a radiative

01:35:52.670 --> 01:36:00.510
equilibrium temperature of about a little
over 5000 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:36:00.510 --> 01:36:02.949
On Apollo that was our baseline.

01:36:02.949 --> 01:36:04.599
We used an ablative head shield.

01:36:04.599 --> 01:36:13.420
Now, the ablative heat shield has a density
of about 130 to 140 pounds per cubic foot

01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:15.510
and is not reusable.

01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:25.269
On the Shuttle it was about 40,000 BTUs per
foot squared integrated heat load and 50 BTUs

01:36:25.269 --> 01:36:31.179
per foot squared second for heat flux with
a radiative equilibrium temperature of about

01:36:31.179 --> 01:36:32.179
3000 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:36:32.179 --> 01:36:39.860
Now, at that point of time we had to come
down from our baseline knowledge of an ablative

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:48.860
material to what we could use and make it
reusable and light.

01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:53.619
And there were several competitors at the
time.

01:36:53.619 --> 01:37:03.710
One was a metal insulation, Rene-41, I believe,
shingle-type material, very thin, very high

01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:07.999
temperature, and it had pretty low density.

01:37:07.999 --> 01:37:13.449
And then, of course, there was the ceramic
material or the so-called tiles which was

01:37:13.449 --> 01:37:14.710
basically a ceramic material.

01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:16.780
It is made out of silica.

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:20.550
In fact, interesting enough, it's made out
of what we call gopher sand that comes from

01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:21.550
Minnesota.

01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:22.990
Why is it gopher sand?

01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:26.499
I'm not quite sure, but it's got a very high
pure silica content.

01:37:26.499 --> 01:37:32.130
And you make it into a mulch and then you
actually bake it and it comes out in these

01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:33.130
tiles.

01:37:33.130 --> 01:37:34.639
And, of course, tiles sometimes are hard to
bond to the vehicle.

01:37:34.639 --> 01:37:38.170
How many people knew the tiles were hard to
stay on the vehicle?

01:37:38.170 --> 01:37:44.300
Well, I was the Orbiter Project Manager and
my home town is San Antonio, Texas.

01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:47.460
We would go back to San Antonio to visit my
family.

01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:52.039
My little old aunts would say their nephew
is in charge of the shuttle program and he

01:37:52.039 --> 01:37:54.300
was having trouble making the tiles stay on
the vehicle.

01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:57.570
They couldn't understand that because they
had tiles in their kitchen and their bathroom

01:37:57.570 --> 01:37:59.679
and had no trouble at all having those tiles
stay.

01:37:59.679 --> 01:38:03.690
So they couldn't understand why I was having
so much trouble having the tiles stay on the

01:38:03.690 --> 01:38:04.690
vehicle.

01:38:04.690 --> 01:38:05.690
We had a problem.

01:38:05.690 --> 01:38:06.690
What would we use?

01:38:06.690 --> 01:38:08.739
There were two competitions on it.

01:38:08.739 --> 01:38:14.110
One was the competition from two of the research
centers.

01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:18.310
The Langley Research Center wanted to go with
the metallic version and the Ames Research

01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:20.579
Center wanted to go with the ceramic version.

01:38:20.579 --> 01:38:25.200
And at JSC we're trying to figure out which
one to go with, and we decided to go with

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.760
the ceramic version.

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:33.079
Of course, Tom Moser is going to give us some
detail because Tom was the guy really in charge

01:38:33.079 --> 01:38:34.079
of it.

01:38:34.079 --> 01:38:45.229
But just to give you a little background,
and he'll go into more details of it, 

01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:55.079
the problem we had with the tiles 
is that when you bonded the tiles, of course,

01:38:55.079 --> 01:38:58.329
they were basically a ceramic material.

01:38:58.329 --> 01:39:03.340
Forget about this layer called densified for
a moment.

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:08.400
When you bonded the tiles to the room temperature
vulcanizing material, which is basically a

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:15.239
high temperature glue, to the strained isolator
pad, you got stress risers set up and the

01:39:15.239 --> 01:39:18.079
tile became very weak.

01:39:18.079 --> 01:39:22.320
It broke really at the bond line of the tile
because it became very weak.

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:26.869
The stress risers were such that because it
was ceramic it broke at the interface.

01:39:26.869 --> 01:39:37.300
We had one very cleaver engineer that saved
my day because tiles were falling off and

01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:40.050
I couldn't get the vehicle built.

01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:46.460
He said if we densified below a quarter of
an inch of the tiles, and tiles could be anywhere

01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:54.599
from two inches to four inches thick, and
by that I mean put liquid glass inside that

01:39:54.599 --> 01:40:03.269
tile, the bottom became like really a hard
surface, no stress riser, you could bond it

01:40:03.269 --> 01:40:07.780
like this and basically have the inherent
strength of the tile.

01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:13.849
It no longer broke at the bond line, it broke
at the tile, which had a very high load.

01:40:13.849 --> 01:40:18.880
So, after we did that, we really did solve
the tile problem to a large extent.

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:26.389
That was the day we really solved the tile
problem, but I remember this so distinctly

01:40:26.389 --> 01:40:31.219
that we were doing all these tests and all
these analyses and all of a sudden they called

01:40:31.219 --> 01:40:36.039
me one day and said Aaron, we're just doing
a very simple flat-wise tension test and tiles

01:40:36.039 --> 01:40:40.269
were just coming off the vehicle.

01:40:40.269 --> 01:40:42.290
So that is what saved the day.

01:40:42.290 --> 01:40:48.239
I think it's another good example of problems
in system engineering if you just leave it

01:40:48.239 --> 01:40:49.320
there for a moment.

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.749
Sure.

01:40:50.749 --> 01:40:56.699
We worked so hard figuring out how to make
these tiles, and they are extraordinary.

01:40:56.699 --> 01:41:04.989
You can take one of these tiles, put one side
of it into a kiln, heat it red hot and you

01:41:04.989 --> 01:41:07.289
can hold the other side of it in your fingers.

01:41:07.289 --> 01:41:10.460
I mean that's how good the insulation is.

01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:13.690
And I guess everybody just sort of figured
we know how to glue things on.

01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:18.019
You brought up another very good point that
I left out.

01:41:18.019 --> 01:41:24.530
The problem is we spent so much time figuring
out the efficiency of the tiles to do the

01:41:24.530 --> 01:41:25.789
thermal protection.

01:41:25.789 --> 01:41:31.699
In other words, this is fantastic tile.

01:41:31.699 --> 01:41:37.639
It weighs about like balsawood, so it is anywhere
from 10 to 12 pounds per cubic foot compared

01:41:37.639 --> 01:41:39.010
to 130 pounds per cubic foot.

01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:43.479
It can take the higher temperature ablative
material and be reused.

01:41:43.479 --> 01:41:47.670
So it answered all the questions we had about
thermal protection.

01:41:47.670 --> 01:41:51.249
What we didn't do, though, was figure out
how we're going to attach it to the vehicle.

01:41:51.249 --> 01:41:57.390
But everybody, I think, just assumed, I mean
it's almost like your relatives, we glue tiles

01:41:57.390 --> 01:41:59.420
in the bathroom all the time.

01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:01.559
Anybody can glue stuff onto something else.

01:42:01.559 --> 01:42:03.099
But we really did a bad job.

01:42:03.099 --> 01:42:06.440
In fact, that's an example I use in my course
at A&amp;M.

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:07.849
We come up with a function structure.

01:42:07.849 --> 01:42:09.440
What functions does this have to perform?

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.230
Well, it doesn't actually have to thermally
protect the vehicle.

01:42:12.230 --> 01:42:13.599
It has got to stay on.

01:42:13.599 --> 01:42:16.139
And we forgot about the staying on part.

01:42:16.139 --> 01:42:17.889
We talked about the thermal protection part.

01:42:17.889 --> 01:42:24.249
And this thing is so good, its thermal diffusivity
is so good that, like Professor Hoffman says,

01:42:24.249 --> 01:42:27.219
you could get the surface temperature to 2000
degrees Fahrenheit and hold it in the palm

01:42:27.219 --> 01:42:28.479
of your hand.

01:42:28.479 --> 01:42:33.960
And so it turned out it was a very, very good
solution but we almost blew the day by not

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.050
coming up with this design.

01:42:35.050 --> 01:42:38.599
Why does it have to be individual tiles rather
than big long panels?

01:42:38.599 --> 01:42:41.500
Well, because of the coefficient expansion.

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:45.380
Now, that's the point of this strain isolation.

01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:49.179
And it's another interface problem which is
part of the system's engineering.

01:42:49.179 --> 01:42:54.979
The structure of the shuttle is aluminum.

01:42:54.979 --> 01:42:59.730
Thermally, it expands and contracts by several
inches every time you go from night to day.

01:42:59.730 --> 01:43:04.860
I mean the Orbiter, we've done these measurements.

01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.590
One side of the Orbiter is pointed towards
the sun.

01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:08.599
The other side is cold.

01:43:08.599 --> 01:43:12.760
The Orbiter actually bananas by a couple of
degrees.

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:21.150
And they did thermal tests in some of the
orbital flight tests where the payload bay,

01:43:21.150 --> 01:43:25.520
the clearances could change by a couple of
inches depending on the thermal conditions

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:29.929
and designing mechanisms to latch them closed
with those tolerances.

01:43:29.929 --> 01:43:36.349
So the orbiter is flexible and expands and
contracts as a metal.

01:43:36.349 --> 01:43:37.679
The tiles don't.

01:43:37.679 --> 01:43:39.659
They are rigid.

01:43:39.659 --> 01:43:46.010
And so, if you have too large a tile area,
the aluminum is going to bend under it and

01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:47.479
the tiles will crack.

01:43:47.479 --> 01:43:53.619
And even with the small tiles, between the
aluminum and the tile there is this strain

01:43:53.619 --> 01:43:54.619
isolation pad.

01:43:54.619 --> 01:43:57.999
This of it as sort of like a felt type material.

01:43:57.999 --> 01:44:02.400
It kind of eases the interface between the
two.

01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:09.099
And, of course, if you look at the tile installation
on the vehicle, in between the tiles, remember

01:44:09.099 --> 01:44:15.150
on the last mission we went EVA to fix the
gap fillers between each one of those tiles

01:44:15.150 --> 01:44:18.900
mainly for problems during liftoff to keep
the tiles from vibrating and damaging each

01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:19.900
other.

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:24.969
And those gap fillers, I'm not concerned about
going EVA to fix it.

01:44:24.969 --> 01:44:28.820
Well, on the other hand, once you see the
problem you cannot let it go so you've got

01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:29.820
to do something about it.

01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:33.190
They went EVA and pulled the gap fillers out,
but those are the tile installations.

01:44:33.190 --> 01:44:34.690
But your question is a very pertinent one.

01:44:34.690 --> 01:44:35.719
Why are there so many?

01:44:35.719 --> 01:44:37.750
And that's the reason, because of the coefficient
expansion.

01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:42.389
Then you put gap fillers in between those
tiles to keep it from damaging during liftoff.

01:44:42.389 --> 01:44:52.520
It does turn out that one of our biggest concerns
is going to be how fragile the tiles were.

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:55.989
And they really turned out to be a pretty
good system.

01:44:55.989 --> 01:45:00.550
We were concerned about losing a tile and
then getting heat and having an unzippering

01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:02.429
effect where you lose a bunch of tiles.

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:04.820
And we really alleviated that problem.

01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:11.800
I will tell you another funny story.

01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:14.869
This is probably not so funny but it was a
story anyway.

01:45:14.869 --> 01:45:23.570
I've forgotten what mission it was but these
tiles are actually waterproof.

01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:27.889
We actually put Scotchgard on them because
the waterproofing is in the tile.

01:45:27.889 --> 01:45:31.179
And after a certain mission the waterproofing
boils out so we had to waterproof the tile.

01:45:31.179 --> 01:45:33.289
STS-4 was the hailstorm.

01:45:33.289 --> 01:45:37.800
That was the first one where they recognized
the problem.

01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:43.280
Well, anyway, Rockwell International was my
contractor.

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:50.360
The head engineer at Rockwell was a brilliant
guy, but he ran a test where he put a densified

01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:57.800
tile panel in a bucket of this Scotchgard
or this rain repellant material.

01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.800
And he called me about 11:00 at night.

01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:05.269
And I was getting ready to go in because we
were [OBSCURED].

01:46:05.269 --> 01:46:09.840
We just ran this test and all the tiles came
off.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:12.260
I said what do you want me to do with that
information?

01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:13.659
We're getting ready to back the de-orbit burn.

01:46:13.659 --> 01:46:16.570
I mean they were coming down.

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:17.789
I said what do you want me to do?

01:46:17.789 --> 01:46:19.949
I said that was sort of a dumb test, wasn't
it?

01:46:19.949 --> 01:46:21.941
I said is that what happened on the vehicle?

01:46:21.941 --> 01:46:27.559
Did you actually put the tiles in a bucket
of water repellent material?

01:46:27.559 --> 01:46:28.559
He said no.

01:46:28.559 --> 01:46:29.559
I said that's a dumb test.

01:46:29.559 --> 01:46:34.739
I took it upon myself, after talking to the
man you're going to hear, Tom Moser, what

01:46:34.739 --> 01:46:35.739
do we do with it?

01:46:35.739 --> 01:46:36.739
We didn't tell anybody.

01:46:36.739 --> 01:46:38.420
Now, I took a big risk on that.

01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:40.699
But what could you do about it?

01:46:40.699 --> 01:46:43.840
There was absolutely nothing you could do
about it on that test.

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:48.630
So that's an interesting case in discretionary
project management.

01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:49.960
But you will hear more.

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:54.789
Let me just mention the question of waterproofing
because, again, that was something that I

01:46:54.789 --> 01:46:57.030
think at first slipped through the systems
engineering.

01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:59.930
And it was the fourth shuttle flight STS-4.

01:46:59.930 --> 01:47:03.409
I was down at the Cape for some other activity.

01:47:03.409 --> 01:47:07.650
The night before a launch they had rolled
back the payload change-out room, the whole

01:47:07.650 --> 01:47:08.789
shuttle was exposed.

01:47:08.789 --> 01:47:17.869
Well, a thunderstorm with hail came through,
and it pelted the bottom of the shuttle.

01:47:17.869 --> 01:47:19.320
There were pox marks all over it.

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.199
And, of course, it was raining.

01:47:21.199 --> 01:47:28.729
And people realized that the tiles actually
were absorbing material.

01:47:28.729 --> 01:47:35.300
The outside of the tile is kind of impervious,
but once you crack that the rain can get in.

01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:46.190
And they actually brought a tile expert down
from the Cape and did some calculations.

01:47:46.190 --> 01:47:51.690
It was an early flight so we didn't have a
maximum payload luckily because we ended up

01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:59.159
carrying, they figured, probably a few hundred,
many over a thousand pounds of water into

01:47:59.159 --> 01:48:00.159
orbit.

01:48:00.159 --> 01:48:04.860
And there was so much water in the tiles that
the orbital dynamicists were able to measure

01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:09.429
the perturbation of the Shuttle's orbit because
of all of the water that was evaporating.

01:48:09.429 --> 01:48:13.530
And, of course, it was evaporating from the
bottom so that it effectively was asymmetrical

01:48:13.530 --> 01:48:14.940
and had a propulsive force.

01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:19.920
And after that was when they came up with
the idea of Scotchgarding.

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.579
And, if you look closely at each of the tiles,
there's a little hole where every tile before

01:48:25.579 --> 01:48:32.159
every flight they go through with a hypodermic
syringe and just inject a little bit of Scotchgard.

01:48:32.159 --> 01:48:35.469
And think how critical it is.

01:48:35.469 --> 01:48:38.079
You've got over 30,000 tiles.

01:48:38.079 --> 01:48:44.789
If you add one ounce to every tile, you do
the math, that's a lot of extra weight.

01:48:44.789 --> 01:48:51.219
So you want to put in as little as possible
Scotchgard but enough to do the job.

01:48:51.219 --> 01:48:55.260
This might be a very good subject for you
to decide to redesign.

01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:58.960
You might think about what are the technologies,
what are the differences, how would you do

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.139
it differently because their technology has
changed.

01:49:03.139 --> 01:49:04.199
That's why I brought this one up.

01:49:04.199 --> 01:49:07.280
And you will hear a much more detailed discussion
by Tom Moser, but you might think about this

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:09.090
as one of the subsystems to look at.

01:49:09.090 --> 01:49:10.090
I guess that's all for today.

01:49:10.090 --> 01:49:11.090
OK.

01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:11.096
We will see you on Thursday.
