00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.250
We will now talk about
conditional expectations of

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.280
one random variable
given another.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.240
As we will see, there will be
nothing new here, except for

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.560
older results but given
in new notation.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.840
Any PMF has an associated
expectation.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.550
And so conditional PMFs also
have associated expectations,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.420
which we call conditional
expectations.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.630
We have already seen them for
the case where we condition on

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.400
an event, A.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.850
The case where we condition
on random variables

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.440
is exactly the same.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.660
We let the event, A, be the
event that Y takes on a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.970
specific value.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.780
And then we calculate the
expectation using the relevant

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.500
conditional probabilities, those
that are given by the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.010
conditional PMF.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.380
So the conditional expectation
of X given that Y takes on a

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.920
certain value is defined as the
usual expectation, except

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.710
that we use the conditional
probabilities that apply given

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.289
that Y takes on a specific
value little y.

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.460
Recall now the expected value
rule for ordinary

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.300
expectations.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.480
And also the Expected Value
Rule for conditional

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.310
expectations given an event,
something that we

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.630
have already seen.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.640
Now, in PMF notation, the
expected value rule takes a

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.550
similar form.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.259
The event, A is replaced by
the specific event that Y

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.490
takes on a specific value.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.620
And in that case, the
conditional PMF given the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.310
event A is just the conditional
PMF given that

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.550
random variable Y takes on a
specific value, little y.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.210
For the case where we condition
on events, we also

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.000
developed a version of the total
probability theorem and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.910
the total expectation theorem.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.360
We can do the same when we
condition on random variables.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.650
So suppose that the sample space
has been partitioned

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.910
into n, disjoint scenarios.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.579
The total probability theorem
tells us that the probability

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:26.190
of the event that random
variable X takes on a value

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.610
little x, can be found by taking
the probabilities of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.079
this event under each one of
the possible scenarios.

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.870
And then weighing those
probabilities according to the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.390
probabilities of the different
scenarios.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.160
Now, suppose that we are dealing
with a random variable

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.995
that takes values in a set
consisting of n elements.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.550
And let us consider scenarios
Ai, the i-th scenario is the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.750
event that the random variable
Y takes on the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.270
i-th possible value.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.070
We can apply the total
probability

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.550
theorem to this situation.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.590
We can find the probability
that the random variable X

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.680
takes on a certain value, little
x, by considering the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.320
probability of this event
happening under each possible

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.640
scenario, where a scenario is
that Y took on a specific

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.620
value, and then weigh those
probabilities according to the

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.770
probabilities of the different
scenarios.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.670
The story with the total

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.190
expectation theorem is similar.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.579
We know that an expectation
can be found by taking the

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.630
conditional expectations under
each one of the scenarios and

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.520
weighing them according to
the probabilities of

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.280
the different scenarios.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.650
Again, let the event that Y
takes on a specific value be a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.490
different scenario.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.730
And with this correspondence
we obtain the following

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.830
version of the total expectation
theorem.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.940
We have a sum of different
terms.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.660
And each term in the sum is
the probability of a given

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.200
scenario times the expected
value of X under this

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.450
particular scenario.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.460
At this point, I have to
add a comment of a more

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.270
mathematical flavor.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.650
We have been talking about a
partition of the sample space

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.520
into finitely many scenarios.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.960
But if Y takes on values in a
discrete but infinite set, for

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.420
example, if Y can take on any
integer value, the argument

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.580
that we have given is
not quite complete.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.820
Fortunately, the total
probability theorem and the

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.150
total expectation theorem, they
both remain true, even

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.710
for the case where Y ranges over
an infinite set as long

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.310
as the random variable X has
a well-defined expectation.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.640
For the total probability
theorem, the proof for the

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.850
general case can be carried
out without a lot of

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.020
difficulty, just using the
countable additivity axiom.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.590
However, for the total
expectation theorem, it takes

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.470
some harder mathematical work.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.620
And this is beyond our scope.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.800
But we will just take this fact
for granted, that the

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.540
total expectation theorem
carries over to the case where

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.680
we're adding over an infinite
sequence of possible values of

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.870
Y.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.830
In the rest of the course we
will often use the total

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.520
expectation theorem, including
in cases where Y ranges over

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.960
an infinite discrete set.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.110
In fact, we will see that this
theorem is an extremely useful

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.670
tool that can be used
to divide and

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.670
conquer complicated models.
