00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.270
Let us now look at some examples
of sample spaces.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.640
Sample spaces are sets.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.430
And a set can be discrete,
finite, infinite,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.880
continuous, and so on.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.730
Let us start with a simpler case
in which we have a sample

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.620
space that is discrete
and finite.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.930
The particular experiment
we will be

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.340
looking at is the following.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.300
We take a very special die,
a tetrahedral die.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.590
So it's a die that has four
faces numbered from 1 up 4.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.730
We roll it once.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.280
And then we roll it
twice [again].

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.090
Were not dealing here with two
probabilistic experiments.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.430
We're dealing with a single
probabilistic experiment that

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.120
involves two rolls of the die
within that experiment.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.960
What is the sample space
of that experiment?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.170
Well, one possible

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.770
representation is the following.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.480
We take note of the result
of the first roll.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.220
And then we take note of the
result of the second roll.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.050
And this gives us a
pair of numbers.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.950
Each one of the possible pairs
of numbers corresponds to one

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.450
of the little squares
in this diagram.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.280
For example, if the first roll
is 1 and the second is also 1,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.990
then this particular outcome
has occurred.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.060
If the first roll is it 2 and
the second is a 3, then this

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.780
particular outcome occurs.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.950
If the first roll is a 3 and
then the next one is a 2, then

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.580
this particular outcome
occurs.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.250
Notice that these two outcomes
are pretty closely related.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.840
In both cases, we observe
a 2 and we observe a 3.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.050
But we distinguish those two
outcomes because in those two

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.500
outcomes, the 2 and the 3 happen
in different order.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.090
And the order in which they
appear may be a detail which

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.560
is of interest to us.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.620
And so we make this distinction

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.010
in the sample space.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:08.940
So we keep the (3, 2) and the
(2, 3) as separate outcomes.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.450
Now this is a case of a model
in which the probabilistic

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.170
experiment can be described
in phases or stages.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.240
We could think about rolling
the die once and then going

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.820
ahead with the second roll.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.720
So we have two stages.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.890
A very useful way of describing
the sample space of

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.950
experiments--

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.390
whenever we have an experiment
with several stages, either

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.780
real stages or imagined
stages.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.980
So a very useful way of
describing it is by providing

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.070
a sequential description
in terms of a tree.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.240
So a diagram of this kind,
we call it a tree.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.770
You can think of this as
the root of the tree

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.290
from which you start.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.770
And the endpoints of the
tree, we usually

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.780
call them the leaves.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.560
So the experiment starts.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.510
We carry out the first phase,
which in this case is the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.620
first roll.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.910
And we see what happens.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.570
So maybe we get a 2
in the first roll.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.880
And then we take note of what
happened in the second roll.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.840
And maybe the result was a 3.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.720
So we follow this branch here.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.610
And we end up at this particular
leaf, which is the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.030
leaf associated with
the outcome 2, 3.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.760
Notice that in this tree we once
more have a distinction.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.740
The outcome 2 followed by a 3 is
different from the outcome

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.190
3 followed by a 2, which would
correspond to this particular

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.890
place in the diagram.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.510
In both cases, we have
16 possible outcomes.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.360
4 times 4 makes 16.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.520
And similarly, if you count
here, the number of leaves is

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.230
equal to 16.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.670
The previous example involves
a sample space that was

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.510
discrete and finite.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.440
There were only 16 possible
outcomes.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.650
But sample spaces can
also be infinite.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.440
And they could also be
continuous sets.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.530
Here's an example of an
experiment that involves a

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.640
continuous sample space.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.130
So we have a rectangular target

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.040
which is the unit square.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.339
And you throw a dart
on that target.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:25.200
And suppose that you are so
skilled that no matter what,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.630
when you throw the
dart, it always

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.340
falls inside the target.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.970
Once the dart hits the target,
you record the coordinates x

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.930
and y of the particular
point that resulted

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.530
from your dart throw.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.380
And we record x and y with
infinite precision.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.120
So x and y are real numbers.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.020
So in this experiment, the
sample space is just the set

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.190
of x, y pairs that lie
between 0 and 1.
