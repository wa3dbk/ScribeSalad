00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.790
In this segment, we discuss
splitting a Poisson process

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.920
into two different streams.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.230
So we have a Poisson process
with some arrival rate lambda,

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.560
and whenever there
is an arrival,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.660
we decide to send it either
to one or another stream.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.030
And for example, this arrival
might be sent to that stream,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.030
this arrival might be
sent to this stream,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.230
this arrival might be
sent to this stream,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.910
that arrival might be
sent to that stream.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.780
How do we decide where
to send these arrivals?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.200
We make those decisions
using independent coin

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.850
flips with a coin that has a
certain fixed bias equal to q.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.880
So when this arrival
comes, there's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.390
probability q that it will
be sent that direction

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.480
or probability 1
minus q that it will

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.330
be sent in the other direction.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.210
All of these coin
flips are independent,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.970
so the decision on where
to send the second arrival

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.600
is going to be independent
from the decision of where

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.580
to send the first arrival.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.590
And furthermore, we
make one more assumption

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.580
that these coin flips are
independent from everything

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.080
else.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.750
They're independent
from the time history

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.400
of the original Poisson process.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.890
For example, the coin flip
that decides the destination

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.870
of this first arrival
can not depend

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.180
on how long it took for
this arrival to occur.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.170
We will argue now that this
stream is a Poisson process

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.680
and by symmetry,
therefore, this stream

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.759
is also a Poisson process.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.000
We need to verify
two assumptions.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.850
One has to do with independence.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.539
The argument here is entirely
analogous to arguments

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.690
that we have already
carried out in the past,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.650
namely disjoint time intervals
in the original process

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.200
are independent.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.330
Coin flips that happened during
those disjoint time intervals

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.479
are also independent
of each other,

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.490
and for this reason, whatever
happens during disjoint time

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.780
intervals in that stream
will also be independent.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.860
The other property
that we need to verify

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.840
has to do with probabilities
of small intervals.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.010
If we take a little interval
here of length delta,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.600
what is going to happen
during that interval?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.250
Well, we look at what happens
during the corresponding

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.120
interval in the original stream.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.360
In the original
stream, the probability

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.900
of having two or more arrivals--
this probability is order

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.840
of delta squared,
so there's no way

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.267
of having two or more arrivals
during that little interval,

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:39.850
or to be more precise,
the probability

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.950
of two or more arrivals here
is going to be negligible,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.340
order of delta squared.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.700
What is the probability
of having one arrival

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.829
during that little interval?

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.180
We will have one
arrival here if we've

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.410
had one arrival in this
time interval, which

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.200
happens with probability
lambda times delta,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.000
and also the coin
flip sent the arrival

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.120
in this direction,
which is something

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.860
that happens with probability
q, and the remaining probability

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.730
is assigned to the
event of having

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.430
zero arrivals during
that interval.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.780
So the probability of two or
more arrivals is negligible,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.470
and the probability
of one arrival

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.420
is proportional to delta.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.760
And that's what we need in
order to have a Poisson process.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.510
The factor of proportionality
that multiplies delta

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.850
is equal to lambda times q.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.100
Therefore, this is a Poisson
process with parameter,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.310
or arrival rate, equal
to lambda times q.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.060
And by a similar argument,
this process here

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.590
is going to be a Poisson
process with parameter

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.610
equal to lambda times 1 minus q.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.300
So by splitting a Poisson
process using independent coin

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.880
flips, we obtain two
different Poisson streams.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.610
Are these Poisson
streams independent?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.440
For the case of the
Bernoulli process,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.620
we had seen that the resulting
streams were not independent.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.360
The reason for the
Bernoulli process

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.770
was that if I tell you
that at a certain slot

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.490
we had an arrival
in this stream,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.050
that would tell you that
in the corresponding time

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.150
slot of the other process
you could not have an arrival

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.730
and that was a
source of dependence.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.050
It turns out that for
the Poisson process,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.400
because it runs in
continuous time,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.560
telling you that we had an
arrival at this particular time

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.090
instant does not give you
any substantial or any

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.960
nontrivial information
about the other process,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.159
and the two processes
remain independent.

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:51.550
This result is surprising in
some ways, but it is true.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.710
A mathematical
derivation proceeds

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.240
along a line that's a little
different from the intuitive

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.910
argument that I just outlined.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.450
And we will not go
through that derivation,

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.920
but it's a useful fact to know.
