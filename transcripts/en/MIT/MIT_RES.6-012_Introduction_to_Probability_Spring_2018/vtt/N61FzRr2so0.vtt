00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.960
In this lecture,
we will concentrate

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.000
on the study of Markov
chains in the long run,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.670
and study under what
conditions a Markov chain

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.780
exhibits steady-state behavior,
and under what conditions

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.620
such steady-state
behavior is independent

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.120
of the initial starting state.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.840
More precisely, we will look
at long-term state occupancy

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.470
behavior-- that is, in the
n-step transition probabilities

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.700
when n is large.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.860
So assume that we have a
Markov chain which is initially

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.770
in a given state i, and
consider the probability

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.900
that the chain is in a specific
state j after n transitions.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.450
Question-- does that probability
converge to some constant

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.010
when n goes to infinity?

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.940
And if this is the case-- second
question-- can this constant be

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.750
independent of the
initial state i?

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.490
We will see that for
nice Markov chains,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.800
the answers to both
questions will be yes.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.690
How to characterize
nice Markov chains?

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.780
We will use several new
concepts, one dealing

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.880
with a Markov chain
being aperiodic or not,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.230
and the other with the
notion of recurrent classes.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.930
Without going into
details now, let

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.380
us simply mention
that we will show

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.370
that the existence
of convergence

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.100
will be tied to having an
aperiodic Markov chain.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.220
And in case we have
convergence, the independence

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.990
from the initial
state will be tied

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.160
to having a single
recurrent class.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.580
We will end this lecture
by looking in detail

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.080
at the special and important
class of Markov chains usually

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.100
known as birth-death processes.
