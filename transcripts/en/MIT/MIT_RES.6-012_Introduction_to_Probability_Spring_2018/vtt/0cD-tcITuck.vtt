00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.620
Conditional PDFs share most
of the properties

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.370
of conditional PMFs.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.950
All facts for the discrete case
have continuous analogs.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.010
The intuition is more or less
the same, although it is much

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.760
easier to grasp in the
discrete case.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.390
For example, we have seen this
version of the total

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.260
probability theorem.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.710
There is a continuous
analog in which we

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.660
replace sums by integrals.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.100
And we replace PMFs by PDFs.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.380
The proof of this fact is
actually pretty simple.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.820
By the multiplication rule, the
integrand, here, is just

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.350
the joint PDF of X and Y.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.370
And we know that if we take the
joint PDF and integrate

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.880
with respect to one variable
then we recover the marginal

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.470
PDF of the other random
variable.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.700
So this is one theorem
that extends to

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.150
the continuous case.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.470
Moving along, we have defined
the conditional expectation in

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.810
this manner in the
discrete case.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.610
And we define it similarly
for the continuous case.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.660
So actually here we now
have a new definition.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.710
This definition is also
consistent with the definition

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.230
of the expectation of a
continuous random variable.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.720
The expected value for
continuous random variable is

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.890
the integral of X times [a]

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.830
density.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.440
Except that here we live in a
conditional universe where

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.770
we're conditioning
on this event.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.479
And therefore, we
need to use the

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.670
corresponding conditional PDF.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.080
Finally, we have the total
expectation theorem in the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.150
discrete case.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.289
And there is the obvious analog
in the continuous case

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.479
where we are using an integral
and a density.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.490
The interpretation is that we
consider all possibilities for

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.960
Y. Under each possibility of Y
we find the expected value of

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.850
X. And then we weigh those
different possibilities

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.790
according to the corresponding
values of the density.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.580
So we're taking a weighted
average of these conditional

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.600
expectations to obtain the
overall expectation of the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.190
random variable X.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.640
The derivation of this fact is
maybe a little instructive

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.900
because it uses various facts
that we have in our hands.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.060
So let's see how to derive it.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.010
We start from this expression in
the right-hand side and we

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.740
will show that it is equal to
the expected value of X. The

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.910
expression on the right-hand
side is equal to the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.910
following, it's the integral
of the density of Y.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.030
And then, inside here, we have
the conditional expectation

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.700
which is defined this way.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.079
So we just plug-in
the definition.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.380
And then what we do, is we take
this term and move it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.225
inside the integral.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.570
Which we can do because this
integral is with respect to x.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.310
And therefore, this is
like a constant.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.190
And we also interchange the
order of integration.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.300
Now, the inner integration
is with respect to y.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.650
As far as Y is concerned, this
term, x, is a constant.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.020
So we can take it and move it
outside this first integral

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.350
and place it out there.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.390
So this term disappears
and goes out there.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.850
What do we have here?

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.940
This part, by the previous fact,
the total probability

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.600
theorem, is just the density of
X. So we're left with the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.560
integral of x times the
density of x dx.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.959
And this is the expected
value of X.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.600
Finally, we have various forms
of the expected value rule,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.380
which barely deserve
writing down.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.460
Because they're exactly
what you might expect.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.450
Consider, for example, an
expression such as this one,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.330
the expected value of a
function of the random

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.270
variable X but conditioned on
the value of the random

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.909
variable Y. How do we calculate
this quantity?

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.840
Well, the expected value rule
tells us that we should

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:54.110
integrate g of x times the
density of X. But because,

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.740
here we live in a conditional
universe, we should actually

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.750
use the corresponding
conditional PDF of X. And

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.780
there are many other versions
of the expected value rule.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.010
Any version that we have seen
for the discrete case has,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.530
also, a continuous analog which
looks about the same

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.240
except that we integrate and
that we use densities.
