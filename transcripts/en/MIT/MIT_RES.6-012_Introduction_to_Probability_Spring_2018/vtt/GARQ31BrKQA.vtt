00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.670
We now note some elementary
properties of expectations.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.710
These will be some properties
that are extremely natural and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.650
intuitive, but even so, they
are worth recording.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.050
The first property
is the following.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.170
If you have a random variable
which is non-negative, then

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.950
its expected value is
also non-negative.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.830
What does it mean that the
random variable is

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.220
non-negative?

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.340
What it means is that for all
possible outcomes of the

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.680
experiment, no matter what the
outcome is, the associated

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.540
numerical value of the
random variable is a

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.570
non-negative number.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.080
What's the implication
of this?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.070
When we calculate an expectation
we're adding over

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.630
all the possible numerical
values of the random variable.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.270
All the possible numerical
values of the random variable

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.320
under this assumption
are non-negative.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.650
Probabilities are also
non-negative.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.440
So we have a sum of non-negative
entries and

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.580
therefore, the expected value
is also going to be

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.230
non-negative.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.870
The next property is a
generalization of this.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.260
Consider now a random variable
that has the property that no

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.440
matter what the outcome of the
experiment is, the value of

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.090
this random variable lies
in the range between two

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.330
constants, a and b.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.580
In this case, we argue
as follows.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.000
The expected value, by
definition, is a sum over all

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.750
possible values of the random
variable of certain terms.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.570
Now, the possible numerical
values of the random variable

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.190
are all of them at least as
large as a, so this gives us

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.780
an inequality of this type.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.920
Then, we pull a factor of a
outside of the summation.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.660
And finally, we recall that
the sum of a PMF over all

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.759
possible values of little
x is equal to 1.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.290
Why is that the case?

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.600
Well, these are the
probabilities for the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.360
different numerical values
of the random variable.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.650
The sum of the probabilities of
all the possible numerical

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.260
values has to be equal to 1,
because that exhausts all the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.440
possibilities.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.186
So we obtain a times
1, which is a.

00:02:28.186 --> 00:02:32.079
So, what we have proved is that
the expected value is at

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.210
least large as a.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.110
You can use a symmetrical
argument where the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.200
inequalities will go the
opposite way and where a's

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.540
will be replaced by b's,
to prove the second

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.870
inequality, as well.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.450
The last fact we want to take
note of is the following.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.600
If we have a constant and we
take its expected value, we

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.530
obtain the same constant.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.980
What does that mean?

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.540
We have only been talking
about expected values of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.440
random variables.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.750
What does it mean to take the
expected value of a constant?

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.100
Well, as we discussed earlier,
we can think of a constant as

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.560
being a random variable of
a very special type.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.690
A random variable whose
PMF takes this form.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.280
This random variable can take
only a single value and the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.230
probability of that single
value is equal to 1.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.540
This means that in the formula
for the expected value there's

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.120
going to be only one term in
this summation, and that term

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.190
is going to be c times the
probability that our random

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.820
variable takes the value c.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.280
Now, that probability is equal
to 1, and we're left with c.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.335
So this equality makes sense,
of course, as long as you

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:48.390
understand that a constant can
also be viewed as a random

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.420
variable of a very
degenerate type.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.454
Now, intuitively, of course,
it's certainly clear

00:03:48.454 --> 00:03:48.475
what this is saying.

00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:48.540
That if a certain quantity is
always equal to c, then on the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.790
average, it will also
be equal to c.
