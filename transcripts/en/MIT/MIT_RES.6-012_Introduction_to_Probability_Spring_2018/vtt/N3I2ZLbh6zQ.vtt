00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.830
We will now continue and
derive some additional

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.560
properties of probability laws
which are, again, consequences

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.680
of the axioms that we
have introduced.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.140
The first property
is the following.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.490
If we have two sets
and one set is

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.170
smaller than the other--

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.270
so we have a picture
as follows.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.120
We have our sample space.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.080
And we have a certain set, A.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.780
And then we have a certain set,
B, which is even bigger.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.230
So the set B is the
bigger blue set.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.890
So if B is a set which is
larger than A, then,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.200
naturally, the probability that
the outcome falls inside

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.290
B should be at least as big as
the probability that the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.380
outcome falls inside A.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.120
How do we prove this formally?

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.410
The set B can be expressed
as a union of two pieces.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.290
One piece is the set A itself.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.300
The second piece is whatever
elements of B there are, that

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.030
do not belong in A. What
are these elements?

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.789
They are elements that belong
to B. And they do not belong

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.720
to A, which means that they
belong to the complement of A.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.050
So we have expressed the set B
as the union of two pieces.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.930
Now this piece is A. This piece
here is outside A. So

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.979
these two pieces are disjoint.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.190
And so we can apply the
additivity axiom, and write

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.470
that the probability of B is
equal to the probability of A

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.600
plus the probability
of the other set.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.960
And since probabilities are
non-negative, this expression

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.860
here is at least as large as the
probability of A. And this

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.710
concludes the proof of
the property that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.640
we wanted to show.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.978
Indeed, the probability of A is
less than or equal to the

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:12.770
probability of B.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.200
The next property we will
show is the following.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.960
It allows us to write the
probability of the union of

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.040
two sets for the case now, where
the two sets are not

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.520
necessarily disjoint.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.460
So the picture is as follows.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:40.440
We have our two sets, A
and B. These sets are

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.370
not necessarily disjoint.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.950
And we want to say something
about the probability of the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.880
union of A and B.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.770
Now the union of A and B
consists of three pieces.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.440
One piece is this one here.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.100
And that piece consists of those
elements of A that do

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.080
not belong to B. So they
belong to B complement.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.340
This set has a certain
probability, let's call it

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.840
little a and indicate
it on this diagram.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.410
So a is the probability
of this piece.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.300
Another piece is this one
here, which is the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.329
intersection of A and B. It has
a certain probability that

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.370
we denote by little b.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.510
This is the probability
of A intersection B.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.730
And finally, there's another
piece, which is out here.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.950
And that piece has a certain
probability c.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.280
It is the probability
of that set.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.010
And what is that set?

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.030
That set is the following.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.850
It's that part of B that
consists of elements that do

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.520
not belong in A. So it's
B intersection with the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.470
complement of A.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.250
Now let's express the two sides
of this equality here in

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.280
terms of little a, little b, and
little c, and see whether

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.190
we get the same thing.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.800
So the probability of A union B.
A union B consists of these

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.000
three pieces that have
probabilities little a, little

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.810
b, and little c, respectively.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.710
And by the additivity axiom, the
probability of the union

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.000
of A and B is the sum
of the probabilities

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.200
of these three pieces.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.480
Let's look now at the right hand
side of that equation and

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.800
see whether we get
the same thing.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.070
The probability of A plus the
probability of B, minus the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.150
probability of A intersection
B is equal to the following.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.480
A consists of two pieces that
have probabilities little a

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.540
and little b.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.240
The set B consists of two pieces
that have probabilities

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.765
little b and little c.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.800
And then we subtract the
probability of the

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.960
intersection, which is b.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.740
And we notice that we can
cancel here one b

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.210
with another b.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:23.290
And what we are left with
is a plus b plus c.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.210
So this checks.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.470
And indeed we have this
equality here.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.330
We have verified that
it is true.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.720
One particular consequence of
the equality that we derived

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.140
is the following.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:48.409
Since this term here is always
non-negative, this means that

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.390
the probability of A union B is
always less than or equal

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.430
to the probability of A plus
the probability of B. This

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.760
inequality here is quite useful
whenever we want to

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.610
argue that a certain
probability is

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.850
smaller than something.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.460
And it has a name.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.255
It's called the union bound.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.650
We finally consider one last
consequence of our axioms.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.530
And namely, we are going to
derive an expression, a way of

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.470
calculating the probability of
the union of three sets, not

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.830
necessarily disjoint.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.890
So we have our sample space.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.652
And within the sample space
there are three sets-- set A,

00:06:37.652 --> 00:06:46.630
set B, and set C.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.170
We are going to use a set
theoretic relation.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.840
We are going to express the
union of these three sets as

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.370
the union of three
disjoint pieces.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.900
What are these disjoint
pieces?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.123
One piece is the set A itself.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:19.500
The second piece is going to
be that part of B which is

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:26.740
outside A. So this is the
intersection of B with the

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.860
complement of A.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:38.590
The third piece is going to be
whatever is left in order to

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.400
form the union of
the three sets.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.980
What is left is that part of C
that does not belong to A and

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:53.020
that does not belong to B. So
that part is C intersection

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:58.170
with A complement and
B complement.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.380
Now this set here, of course,
is the same as that set

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.230
because intersection of two sets
is the same no matter in

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.430
which order we take
the two sets.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.410
And similarly, the set that we
have here is the same one that

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.900
appears in that expression.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.840
Now we notice that these three
pieces, the red, the blue, and

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.560
the green, are disjoint
from each other.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:25.820
So by the additivity axiom, the
probability of this union

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:31.080
here is going to be the sum
of the probabilities

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.200
of the three pieces.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.470
And that's exactly
the expression

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.720
the we have up here.
