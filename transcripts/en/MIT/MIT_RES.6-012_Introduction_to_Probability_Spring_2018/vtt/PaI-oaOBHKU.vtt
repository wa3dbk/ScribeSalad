00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.490
We have already worked through
some examples in which X was a

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.220
random variable with a given
PDF, and we considered the

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.490
problem of finding the PDF of Y
for the case where Y was the

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.120
function x cubed or the function
of the form a/X. What

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.540
both of these examples have
in common is that Y is a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.680
monotonic function of X.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.200
In this case, Y is increasing
with X. In this case, Y was

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.970
decreasing with X. It turns out
that there is a general

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.160
formula that gives us the PDF of
Y in terms of the PDF of X

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.330
in the special case where
we're dealing

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.530
with a monotonic function.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.510
So, let us assume that g is a
strictly increasing function.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.560
And what that means is that,
if x is a number or smaller

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.890
than some other number x prime,
the value of g of x is

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.560
going to be smaller than
the value of g x prime.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.900
So, when you increase the
argument of the function, the

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.470
function increases.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.110
To keep things simple, we will
also assume that the function

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.120
g is smooth, in particular that
it is differentiable.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.600
Then we have a diagram
such as this one.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.330
Here is x, and y is given
by a function of x.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.590
It's a smooth function, and
that function keeps

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.710
increasing.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.979
Now, because of the assumptions
we have made on g,

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.570
we have an interesting
situation.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.450
Given a value of x, a
corresponding value of y will

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.550
be determined according
to the function g.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.450
But we can also go
the other way.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.630
If I tell you a value of y, then
you can specify for me

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.100
one and only one value of x
that gives rise to this

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.600
particular y.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.550
So, the function g takes us from
x's to y's, but you can

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.020
also go back the opposite way
from y's to values of x.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.030
And the mapping that takes us
from y's to x's, this is the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.820
inverse of the function g.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.310
And we give a name to that
inverse function,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.150
and we call it h.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.900
So, h of y is the value
of x that produces a

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.720
specific value y.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.079
Let us now move on with the
program of finding the PDF of

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.650
Y. We will follow the usual
two step procedure.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:50.390
And the first step is to
find the CDF of Y.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.380
So we fix some little y,
And we want to find the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.810
probability that the random
variable y takes a value in

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.500
this range.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.960
When does this happen?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.530
For Y to take a value in this
range, it must be the case

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.780
that X takes a value
in this range here.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.690
Values of X smaller than this
particular number result in

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.130
values of Y that are less
than or equal to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.730
this particular number.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.230
So, we can rewrite the event
of interest in terms of the

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.270
random variable X and
write it as follows.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:39.590
We need to have x less than
or equal to h of little y.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.470
But this is just the CDF of
X evaluated at h of y.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.710
We now carry out to the second
step of our program.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.600
We take derivatives of both
sides and we find that the PDF

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.329
of Y is equal to the derivative
of the right hand

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.540
side, the derivative of
the CDF is a PDF.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.760
And then the chain rule tells
us that we also need to take

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.412
the derivative of the term
inside here with respect to

00:04:11.412 --> 00:04:12.662
its argument.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.440
And this is a general formula
for the PDF of a strictly

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.670
increasing function of a random
variable X. How about

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.070
the case of a decreasing
function?

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.510
So, let us assume that g now
is a strictly decreasing

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.659
function of X.

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.020
So, we might have a plot
for g that looks

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.350
something like this.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.250
What happens in this case?

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.305
We can start doing a calculation
of this kind.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.060
But now, how can we rewrite
this event?

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.790
The random variable Y will
take a value less than or

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.310
equal to this number little y.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.370
When does this happen?

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.420
When the value of g of
x is less than y.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.100
And that happens for
x's in this range.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.690
So, this is the set of x's for
which is the value of g of x

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.650
is less than or equal to this
particular number y.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.260
So the event of interest in that
case is the event that X

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:48.200
is larger than or equal to h
of y, which is 1 minus the

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:55.880
probability that X is
less than h of y.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.330
Because X is a continuous random
variable, we can change

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.460
this inequality to one
that allows the

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.540
possibility of equality.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.790
And so this is 1 minus the CDF
of X evaluated at h of y.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.270
Now we take the derivatives of
both sides and we find the PDF

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.960
or Y being equal to, there's
a minus sign here, then the

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.180
derivative of the CDF,
which is the PDF.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.250
And finally, the derivative
of the function h.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.970
Now in this case, g is a
decreasing function of x.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.240
So when x goes down,
y goes up.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.510
When x goes up, y goes down.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.920
This means that when y
goes up, x goes down.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.350
So it means that the inverse
function h is going to be also

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.795
monotonically decreasing.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.030
Since it is decreasing, it
means that the slope, the

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.220
derivative of the function
h is going to

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.200
be either 0 or negative.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.150
And so minus a negative value
gives us the absolute value of

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.300
that number.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:32.820
So we can rewrite this by
removing this minus sign here,

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:38.250
and putting an absolute
value in this place.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.650
Of course, in the case where g
is an increasing function,

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.740
when x goes up, y goes up.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.500
This means that when y
goes up, x goes up.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.550
So h in that case would have
been an increasing function,

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.060
so this number here would have
been a non-negative number,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.800
and so it would be the same
as the absolute value.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.485
So using these absolute values,
we obtain formulas

00:08:02.485 --> 00:08:06.420
that are exactly the same in
both cases of increasing and

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.950
decreasing functions, and so our
final conclusion is that

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:16.574
in either case, the PDF of Y is
given in terms of the PDF

00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:21.770
of X times the derivative of
this inverse function.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.180
Let us now apply the formula
that we have in our hands for

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.990
the monotonic case to a
particular example, where y is

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.440
the square of X, and where
X is uniform on the

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.679
interval 0 to 1.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:45.350
So the function g, in our case,
the function g is the

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.600
square function.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.910
Now, you could argue here that
this function is not

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.000
monotonic, so how can we
apply our results?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.540
On the other hand, the random
variable X takes values on the

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:07.240
interval from 0 to 1, and
therefore the form of the

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.000
function g outside that range
does not concern us.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.060
Over the range of values of
interest, the function g is a

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.750
monotonic function.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.060
So, what is the correspondence?

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.100
y is going to be equal
to x squared.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.840
That's the g of x function.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.460
And when that happens, we have
the relation that x is going

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.350
to be the square root of y.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:44.250
This tells us that the inverse
function, h of y, which tells

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.200
us what is the particular x
associated with a given y, the

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.510
inverse function takes the
form square root of y.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.190
So now we can go ahead
and use the formula.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:03.080
The density at some particular
little y where that little y,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:08.150
belongs to the range of values
of interest, x things values

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:14.380
between 0 and 1, so y also takes
values between 0 and 1.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.540
So over that range, the density
of Y is the density of

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:28.300
X, which is uniform, therefore
it is equal to 1, times the

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.360
derivative of the square
root function.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.130
And the derivative of the square
root function is 1 over

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.250
2 times the square root of y.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.290
As you can see, the amount of
calculations involved here are

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.580
rather simpler compared to what
we would have to do if we

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.440
were to go through our
two step program

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.130
and work with CDFs.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.950
All that you need to do is
essentially to identify the

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:03.890
inverse function that given a y
produces x's, and write down

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.140
the corresponding derivative.
