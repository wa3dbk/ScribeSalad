00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.760
Before we get going
with our discussion

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.800
of inference
methods, it is worth

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.550
looking at the big picture
for some perspective.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.680
So far, we have
concentrated on ways

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.860
to analyze probability models.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.230
This part of the picture.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.190
If our model has been
selected in a careful way,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.730
then it should also be
relevant to the real world

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.000
and help us make
predictions or decisions.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.480
But how do we know
that this is the case?

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.450
This is why we need to look
at data that are generated

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.010
by the real world, and then use
these to come up with a model.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.760
This is what the field of
inference and statistics

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.230
is all about.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.950
This field has undergone
a radical transformation

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.670
in recent years.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.490
I will exaggerate a
little, but in the past,

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.480
a statistician might
be called to look

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.360
at problems such as this one.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.000
You're given data
on a few patients,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.200
and you need to figure out
whether a certain treatment is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.850
effective or not.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.510
But today, a statistician
lives in a dreamland.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.370
There are tons of data that
are generated everywhere.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.010
These allow us to build quite
detailed large models involving

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.100
thousands of parameters.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.890
And we do have the computational
power to do all that.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.700
In this landscape,
the opportunities

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.030
for a statistician are endless.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.130
So let me give you a small
representative sample.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.960
In a somewhat
traditional setting,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.670
one designs a data
collection method,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.310
and then uses these data to
make a simple prediction.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.200
This is the case, for
example, in polling.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.479
Where the purpose is to predict
the outcome of an election.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.330
Another field is
marketing and advertising,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.220
where the situation
is somewhat similar.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.729
Except now, we want
to make predictions

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.229
not for a population
as a whole, but

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.220
for each individual consumer.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.260
And a particular
application has to do

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.350
with so-called
recommendation systems.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.400
You collect ratings that
people give to movies, as

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.550
in a famous competition that
was announced by Netflix.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.600
So you have data for
every movie and the people

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.250
who have watched them.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.840
You make a note of
what rating that person

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.530
gave to a particular movie.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.880
And now after you collect huge
amounts of data of this kind,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.240
you try to use this
information to guess

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.280
whether, for example,
this person is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.640
interested in this
particular movie or not.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.060
This is a quite
difficult problem.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.030
A quite complicated one.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.870
And it gave the
community an opportunity

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.760
to develop fancier and fancier
combinations of methods

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.870
in order to come up
with good predictions

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.060
of unknown entries
in this table.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.770
Another field is,
of course, finance.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.960
The markets are truly uncertain.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.090
And there are quite
complete historical data.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.210
Lots of them.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.670
How do we use these data
to make predictions?

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.650
Coming now to the
natural sciences,

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.010
a revolution has been taking
place in the life sciences.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.220
There are tons of genomic data
to be processed to find out

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.810
what combination of genes
causes what disease.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.870
Or we may want to
find out the details

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.100
of the chemical reactions
inside a living cell.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.880
And there is an upcoming
new frontier, neuroscience,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.110
where there will be vast amounts
of data that will be generated.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.420
These will consist of
brain measurements.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.290
Of measurements of what
each neuron is doing.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.710
And hopefully, these
will lead us one day

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.870
to finding out what the brain
really does and how it works.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.430
In the sciences,
the list is endless.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.240
It goes on and on.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.070
In modeling climate
and the environment,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.690
scientists are using a
huge models these days.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.610
Which they try to calibrate
using lots of available data.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.640
And in physics as
well, scientists

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.820
to use fancy inference
methods trying to find

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.959
needles in a haystack.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.120
Like rare particles
or remote planets.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.680
Finally, engineering is
a fight against noise.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.110
Engineers try to
make devices that

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.800
will work in uncertain
environments.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.510
The field of signal
processing is a prime example

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.050
where the generic
question is to recover

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.850
the content of a signal.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.260
For example, the content
of a radio transmission

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.550
when a signal is received after
it gets corrupted by noise.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.800
I could go on and on for hours
generating lists of this kind,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.620
but we have to stop somewhere.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.500
The bottom line is that the
opportunities and the needs

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.960
are vast.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.750
For this reason, we will look
into the core methodologies

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.560
that come into play.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.720
Fortunately for us, the
fundamental concepts

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.790
and approaches turn out
to be the same independent

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.220
of the particular application.
