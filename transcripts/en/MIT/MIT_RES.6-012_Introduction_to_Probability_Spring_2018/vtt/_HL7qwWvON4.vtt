00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.070
Let us now introduce the linear
least mean squares formulation.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.960
The setting is
the usual one-- we

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.250
have an unknown random variable
and another random variable,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.830
which is our observation.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.320
We're given enough information
so that we can, for example,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060
calculate the joint distribution
of these two random variables.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.530
What we would like to
do in the least squares

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.460
methodology is to come up
with an estimator, such

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.210
that the mean squared
error of this estimator

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.890
is as small as possible.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.960
And we have seen the general
solution to this problem.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.010
If we consider
arbitrary estimators,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.510
it turns out that the
best possible estimator,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.815
the best possible function g,
is this particular function

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:45.110
of the observations.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.390
Our estimator is a conditional
expectation of Theta, given X.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.200
Now, let us look at an example
that we considered earlier.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.770
Suppose that X and Theta
have a joint PDF, which

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.110
is uniform over this
particular region.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.440
We did consider
this example and we

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.960
found that the
optimal estimator was

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.300
a function that had
this particular shape.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.580
So this blue curve
here corresponds

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.510
to the function, which is
the conditional expectation

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.980
of Theta, given the
value of the observation

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.690
that we have obtained.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.990
We notice that this
function is nonlinear,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.990
but it is only mildly nonlinear.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.030
The fact that it is nonlinear
is a little bit of a nuisance.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.320
It makes it somewhat of
a complicated function.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.660
Wouldn't it be nicer if our
estimator had turned out

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.590
to be a linear function of
the data, such as this one?

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.479
It would have been nicer,
but, unfortunately,

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.200
that's not the case.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.900
By what if we impose
it as a constraint,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.530
that we will only
look at estimators

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.670
that are linear
functions of the data.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.680
What does that mean?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.280
Mathematically
speaking, it means

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.150
that we will only
consider estimators

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.009
that depend linearly
on the data X.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.400
Now, a and b here
are some parameters

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.430
that are for us to choose.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.760
If I choose a and
b differently, I'm

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.360
going to get a different
red curve here.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.900
Which one is the best red curve?

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.055
Well, we need a criterion.

00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:31.770
But let us stick to our mean
squared error criterion.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.590
And in that case, we're led
to the following formulation.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.370
We want to find
choices for a and b.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.700
That is, we want to choose
a particular red line,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.870
so that the resulting
estimation error, the resulting

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.890
mean squared estimation error,
is as small as possible.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.420
So what we have here
is a random variable.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.260
Here is the value
that's going to be

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.490
given to us by our estimator.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.060
And we look at the
associated error,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.260
square it, and take
the expectation.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.030
So this is the linear least
mean squares formulation.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.980
We're looking for
an estimator, which

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.120
is a linear function
of the data.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.010
And we want to choose the
best possible linear function.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.630
How does it compare
to the earlier problem

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.870
of picking the best estimator?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.040
Here we were considering
an arbitrary function g

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.620
and we were trying to find
the best possible function

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.650
of the data, which
would be our estimator.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.060
So this was really
an optimization

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.490
over all possible functions.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.960
Here we only have an
optimization with respect

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.370
to two numbers.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.079
So at least mathematically, this
should be a simpler problem.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.610
And we will see that it
has a simple solution.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.300
Before going on to
the solution, however,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.520
let me make one comment
that in some cases,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.290
the linear least
squares estimation

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.850
problem is relatively
easy to solve.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.450
And these are the cases where
the conditional expectation

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.020
turns out to be
linear in the data.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.460
This is the best
possible estimator.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.660
If it happens to be
linear, it's at least

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.029
as good as any other
linear estimator,

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:25.750
so it's also going to be the
optimal linear estimator.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.350
That is, if the optimal
solution turns out

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.040
to be already linear, by
imposing the extra constraint

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.970
of sticking to linear
estimators is not

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.870
going to make any difference.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.360
But for the general
case, in general,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.340
this is not going
to be the case.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.890
The conditional
expectation may well

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.820
turn out to be a nonlinear
function of the data,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.390
as in this example.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.960
And in those cases, the linear
least mean squares estimator

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.760
is going to turn
out to be different.
