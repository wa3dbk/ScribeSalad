00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.940
In this segment, we introduce
the subject of least

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.690
mean squares estimation.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.370
But as a warm-up, we will
start with a very simple

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.860
special case.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.330
Suppose that we have
some random variable

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.800
that we wish to estimate and
that we have the probability

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.500
distribution of this random
variable-- a probability

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.440
mass function if it's discrete
or a probability density

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.310
function if it's continuous.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.060
As a concrete instance, suppose
that our random variable

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.050
is uniformly distributed
over a certain interval.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.320
We would like to estimate
this random variable.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.660
We're interested in
a point estimate.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.780
However, we look at
the very special case

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.450
where there are no
observations available.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.580
All that we have is this
probability distribution.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.150
How do we estimate
this random variable?

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.340
Well, we can use the
rules that we have already

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.530
developed, for
example, the maximum

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.079
a posteriori probability
rule, what would it do?

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.995
In this case, since there
are no observations,

00:00:55.995 --> 00:01:00.530
the posterior distribution of
Theta is the same as the prior.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.280
There are no observations
that could change the prior.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.540
So we need to find a point
at which this distribution is

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.710
highest.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.170
Well, because this
distribution is flat,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.920
the MAP rule does not
give us a unique answer.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.840
Any value of theta inside
the interval from 4 to 10

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.880
would be an acceptable answer.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.100
So any particular estimate in
this interval would be fine.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.900
So this rule is not
particularly helpful.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.450
How about a different estimator?

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.180
We have seen the conditional
expectation estimator.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.840
Once more, in our case, since
we do not have any observations,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.920
the conditional expectation is
the same as the expectation.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.000
And for this
particular example, it

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.780
would give us the midpoint
of the distribution, namely

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.270
an estimate equal to 7.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.750
Now, this rule was inconclusive.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.000
This rule gave us a number.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.510
How can we choose and
decide that one of these

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.560
is the right estimate?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.650
We can do that if we introduce a
specific performance criterion.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.100
What is it that we wish
from our estimators?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.110
And the particular
criterion, the one

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.460
that will we be focusing on,
is the mean squared error.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.840
If you come up with
a certain estimate,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.170
you look at how far is your
estimate from the true value

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.040
that you're trying to estimate,
take the square of that,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.360
and average it.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.850
And this leads us
to a formulation

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.010
whereby we will try to find
an estimate theta hat that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.850
minimizes this
mean squared error

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.230
over all possible estimates.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.400
Let us now look at
this formulation

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.300
and see how we can solve it.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.650
This is a function of a
single variable theta hat.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.630
And we can try to minimize it
using conventional methods.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.820
To carry out this
minimization, let

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.100
us first expand this
expectation into a sum of terms.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.220
We have the expected
value of the square

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.940
of the random variable,
then a cross term minus 2

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.360
the expected value of
Theta times theta hat.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.010
However, theta hat is a number
that we're trying to choose.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.250
It's not random.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.780
Therefore, we can pull it
outside the expectation.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.079
And similarly, the last term,
the expected value of theta hat

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.970
squared is just theta
hat squared itself.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.610
This is what we
want to minimize.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.280
How do we minimize it?

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.340
We take the derivative
with respect to theta hat

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.710
and set it to 0.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:47.480
And this gives us minus 2
the expected value of Theta

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.450
plus twice theta hat equal to 0.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.770
And when we solve
this, we find is

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.180
that theta hat, the
optimal estimate

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.250
is equal to the
expected value of Theta.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.250
So this is the answer to
our optimization problem.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.460
The optimal estimate, according
to the least squares criterion,

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.709
is the expected value
of the random variable.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.690
Now, it's interesting to
derive this result, also,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.390
in a second way.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.530
Since it is a quite important
and fundamental result,

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.465
let us see whether there is a
different way of establishing

00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:33.370
it that stays closer to the
probabilistic world rather

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.700
than the calculus world.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.050
So let us look at this
criterion that we have here.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.180
The expected value of the
square of a random variable

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:52.540
is always equal to the variance
of that random variable

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:00.115
plus the expected value of
that random variable squared.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.600
This is what we're
trying to minimize.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.190
Now, theta hat is a constant.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.960
The variance of a random
variable plus or minus

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.380
a constant is the
same as the variance

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.020
of that random variable.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.160
And there is nothing that
we can do about this term.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.680
So what we're trying
to do is, essentially,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.900
just try to minimize this term
with respect to theta hat.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.980
Now, here we have the
square of something.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.810
The way to minimize this is to
try to make this quantity as

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.490
small as possible,
make it 0 if we can.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.430
Well, we can make it 0 if we set
theta hat equal to the expected

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.400
value of Theta.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.640
So this term here is minimized.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.150
When theta hat is equal to
the expected value of Theta,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.480
it is minimized because
this is a choice that

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.620
will make this term equal to 0.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.080
So this was a second
derivation of why

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.440
this is the optimal
estimate of Theta.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.670
Once we adopt this
particular estimate,

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.650
the mean squared
error is going to be

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.680
equal to this, because
this is our theta hat.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.980
And, of course, we recognize
that this is the variance.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.790
So the variance of Theta
is the least possible value

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.120
of the mean squared
error that we

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.500
can obtain using any
particular estimate.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.250
And this is our
final conclusion.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.230
And in the next segment, we
will exploit the conclusions

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.720
that we found here
and apply them

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.150
to a more general situation.
