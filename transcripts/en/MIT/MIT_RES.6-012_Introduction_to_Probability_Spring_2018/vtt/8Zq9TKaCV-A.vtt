00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.710
As we have already discussed,
we can estimate an unknown

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.710
mean of a certain random
variable by generating several

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.970
independent samples of that
random variable and taking

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.210
their average.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.030
And this procedure is well
justified, because of the weak

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.320
law of large numbers, which
tells us that this estimator

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.730
converges when n goes to
infinity, in probability, to

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.120
the true mean.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.610
Now we can apply this
idea more generally.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.550
Suppose we want to estimate
the expected value of a

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.830
function of a random variable
X. Now g of X is itself a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.770
random variable.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.340
So if we have samples
of g of X, we can

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.880
use the same procedure.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.130
How do we do that?

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.000
We generate independent samples
of X, and these give

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.250
us independent samples of g of
X. We use those independent

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.260
samples, we average them, and
by the weak law of large

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.730
numbers, this quantity, as
n goes to infinity, will

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.200
converge in probability to the
expected value of g of X.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.960
We already used an idea of this
form when we tried to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.810
estimate an unknown variance.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.820
A variance is defined
as an expectation.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.550
And now we can generate samples
of X, many independent

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.990
samples, calculate
this quantity,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.520
and take the average.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.150
However, we might not know the
mean of the distribution.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.539
So instead of the true mean,
we use an estimated mean,

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.630
which is estimated the usual
way using a sample average.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.360
So when n is large, this
estimated mean is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.380
close to the true mean.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.160
So using the estimated mean
here will not make a

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.940
substantial difference.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.840
And then we have essentially
independent

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.350
samples of this quantity.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.400
And by averaging them, we obtain
an estimate of the

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.350
variance, which asymptotically,
as n goes to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.080
infinity, will be equal
to the true variance.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.780
Now we can push this
idea even further.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.410
Suppose we wish to estimate
a covariance.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.310
What's a natural way
of doing this?

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.870
We can generate independent
samples of the pair of the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.680
random variables X and Y, so
this will be a typical

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.900
independent sample, and replace
the expected value by

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.540
a sample average.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.290
That is, we take our i-th
sample, i-th pair, and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.660
calculate this quantity, which
looks very much like the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.190
quantity in here except that
we're using the estimated

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.050
means in place of
the true means.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.610
We obtain these quantities and
average n of them, again using

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.320
the weak law of large numbers.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.620
One can argue that this estimate
will converge to the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.220
true value of the covariance
as n goes to infinity.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.050
And once we have estimates of a
covariance and of variance,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.740
then we can use that to
estimate correlation

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.990
coefficients.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.960
Look at this formula, which
is the definition of the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.820
correlation coefficient.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.340
If we just replace all
quantities involved here by

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.700
corresponding estimates, this
gives us an estimate of the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.579
correlation coefficient.

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.550
All of these ways of forming
estimates can be shown.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.750
We are omitting the details of
the argument, but hopefully

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.230
you get the idea by now.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.510
All of these quantities are
consistent estimators.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.570
That is, when the sample size
goes to infinity, they

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.230
approach the correct values of
what we're trying to estimate.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.440
So this is just an opening of
what else a statistician might

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.850
be interested in.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.350
And if you're wondering what's
the further agenda after this

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.390
point, it would be something
like the following.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.020
Typically, a statistician might
to want to say as much

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.940
as possible about
the probability

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.150
distribution of an estimator.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.540
For example, we have here an
estimate of a covariance.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.660
This estimate is going to be a
random variable because it is

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.840
determined by random
quantities.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.580
What is the probability
distribution of this quantity?

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.050
Can we describe it
approximately?

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.760
What is the mean squared error

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.089
associated with this estimator?

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.079
And if you wish to construct
confidence intervals how

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.120
would you do it?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.910
These are all topics that
statisticians have studied in

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.510
depth, and you could see more
about these topics if you were

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.860
to take a further class on
statistics and inference.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.450
But we will not go any deeper
in this course.
