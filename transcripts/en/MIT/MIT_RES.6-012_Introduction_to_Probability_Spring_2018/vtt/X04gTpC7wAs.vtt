00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.020
We have defined the conditional
expectation of a

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.590
random variable given another
as an abstract object, which

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.370
is itself a random variable.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.320
Let us now do something
analogous with the notion of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.400
[the]

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.030
conditional variance.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.860
Let us start with the definition
of the variance,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.810
which is the following.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.940
We look at the deviation of the
random variable from its

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.060
mean, square it, then take the
average of that quantity.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.580
If we live in a conditional
universe where we are told the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.270
value of some other random
variable, capital Y, then

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.000
inside that conditional universe
the variance becomes

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.240
the following.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.700
It is defined the same way.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.670
Well, in the conditional
universe, this is the expected

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.890
value of X.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.410
So this quantity here is the
deviation of X from its

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.530
expected value in that
conditional universe.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.390
We square this quantity, we find
the squared deviation,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.380
and we look at the
expected value of

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.690
that squared deviation.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.770
But because we live in a
conditional universe, of

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.280
course, this expectation has to
be a conditional one given

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.010
the information that
we have available.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.539
So this is nothing but the
ordinary variance, but it's

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.000
the variance of the conditional
distribution of

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.320
the random variable, capital
X. This is an

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.460
equality between numbers.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.450
If I tell you the value of
little y, the conditional

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.430
variance is defined
by this particular

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.970
quantity, which is a number.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.660
Now, we proceed in the same way
as we proceeded for the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.550
case where we defined the
conditional expectation as a

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.960
random variable.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.910
Namely, we think of this
quantity as a function of

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.280
little y, and that function can
be now used to define a

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.420
random variable.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.000
And that random variable, which
would denote this way,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.240
this is the random variable
which takes this specific

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.740
value when capital Y happens
to be equal to little y.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.820
Once we know the value of
capital Y, then this quantity

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.780
takes a specific value.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.610
But before we know the value
of capital Y, then this

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.980
quantity is not known.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.560
It's random.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.960
It's a random variable.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.060
Let us look at an example to
make this more concrete.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.970
Suppose that Y is a
random variable.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.329
We draw that random variable.

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.079
And we're told that conditioned
on the value of

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.990
that random variable, X is going
to be uniform on this

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.890
particular interval
from 0 to Y.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.840
So if I tell you that capital
Y takes on a specific

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.710
numerical value, then the random
variable X is uniform

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.565
on the interval from
0 to little y.

00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:57.710
A random variable that's uniform
on an interval of

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.910
length little y has a variance
that we know what it is.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.260
It's y squared over 12.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.280
So this is an equality
between numbers.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.350
For any specific value of
little y, this is the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.640
numerical value of the
conditional variance.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.590
Let us now change this equality
between numbers into

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.840
an abstract equality between
random variables.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.230
The random variable, variance
of X given Y, is a random

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.920
variable that takes this
value whenever

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.950
capital Y is little y.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.510
But that's the same as
this random variable.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.430
This is a random variable that
takes this value whenever

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.020
capital Y happens to be
equal to little y.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.640
So we have defined the
abstract concept of a

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.140
conditional variance, similar
to the case of conditional

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.300
expectations.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.270
For conditional expectations,
we had the law of iterated

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.400
expectations.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.030
That tells us that the
expected value of the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.450
conditional expectation is the
unconditional expectation.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.520
Is it true that the expected
value of the conditional

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.560
variance is going to
be the same as the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.580
unconditional variance?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.290
Unfortunately, no.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.390
Things are a little
more complicated.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.900
The unconditional variance is
equal to the expected value of

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.079
the conditional variance, but
there is an extra term, that

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.920
is, the variance of the
conditional expectation.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.570
The entries here in red are
all random variables.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.320
So the conditional variance has
been defined as a random

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.080
variable, so it has an
expectation of its own.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.850
The conditional expectation, as
we have already discussed,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.700
is also a random variable, so it
has a variance of its own.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.030
And by adding those terms, we
get the total variance of the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.110
random variable X.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.010
So what we will do next will
be first to prove this

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.750
equality, and then give a number
of examples that are

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.040
going to give us some intuition
about what these

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.920
terms mean and why this
equality makes sense.
