00:00:00.292 --> 00:00:01.750
PROFESSOR: In this
segment, we will

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.000
look at the famous
example, which

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.530
was posed by Comte de Buffon--

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.720
a French naturalist--
back in the 18th century.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.750
And it marks the
beginning of a subject

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.280
that is known as the subject
of geometric probability.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.600
The problem is pretty simple.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.990
We have the infinite
plane, and we

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.830
draw lines that are
parallel to each other.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.190
And they're spaced
apart d units.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.790
So this distance here is d.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.270
And the same for
all the other lines.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.110
We take a needle that has
a certain length-- l--

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.290
and we throw it at
random on the plane.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.890
So the needle might
fall this way, so

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.220
that it doesn't cross any line,
or it might fall this way,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.880
so that it ends up
crossing one of the lines.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.620
If the needle is long enough,
it might actually even end up

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.870
crossing two of the lines.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.830
But we will make the assumption
that the length of the needle

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.350
is less than the distance
between the two--

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.620
between two adjacent
lines, so that we're

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.720
going to have either
this configuration,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.130
or that configuration.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.240
So in this setting, we're
interested in the question

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.720
of how likely is it that the
needle is going to intersect

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.070
one of the lines if the needle
is thrown completely at random?

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.670
We will answer this question,
and we will proceed as follows.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.510
First, we need to
model the experiment--

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.450
the probabilistic
experiment-- mathematically.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.930
That is, we need to define
an appropriate sample space,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.780
define some relevant
random variables,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.240
choose an appropriate
probability law,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.740
identify the event of
interest, and then calculate.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.100
Let us see what it takes to
describe a typical outcome

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.670
of the experiment.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.240
Suppose that the needle fell
this way, so that the nearest

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.790
line is the one above.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.650
And let us mark here the
center of the needle.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.340
One quantity of interest
is this vertical distance

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.920
between the needle
and the nearest line.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.265
Let us call this quantity x.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.820
We're using here a
lowercase x, because we're

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.990
dealing with a numerical value
in one particular outcome

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.560
of the experiment.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.490
But we think of this x
as being the realization

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.830
of a certain random
variable that we

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.560
will denote by capital X.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.740
What else does it take
to describe the needle?

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.990
Suppose that the
needle had fallen

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.140
somewhere so that it is at
the same vertical distance

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.340
from the nearest
line, but it has

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.910
an orientation of this kind.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.390
This orientation
compared to that one

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.220
should make a difference.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.340
Because when it falls
that way, it's more likely

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.050
that it's going to cut the next
line as opposed to this case.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.660
So the angle that the needle is
making with the parallel lines

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.500
should also be relevant.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.950
So let us give a name to
that particular angle.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.660
So let's extend that line until
it crosses one of the lines.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.720
And let us give a name to
this angle, and call it theta.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.850
So if I tell you
x and theta, you

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.840
know how far away the needle
is from the nearest line,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.510
and at what angle it is.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.240
It looks like these are
two useful variables

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.520
to describe the outcome
of the experiment, so let

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.620
us try working with these.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.610
So our model is going to involve
two random variables defined

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.690
the way we discussed
it just now.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.340
What is the range of
these random variables?

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.570
Since we took x to be the
distance from the nearest line,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.300
and the lines are
d units apart, this

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.250
means that x is going to
be somewhere between 0

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.260
and d over 2.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.500
How about theta?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.640
So the needle makes two angles
with the part of the line.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.790
It's this angle, and
the complimentary one.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.150
Which one do we take?

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.940
Well, we use a
convention that theta

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.690
is defined as the acute
angle that the direction

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.210
of the needle is
making with the lines,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.740
so that theta will vary over
a range from 0 to pi over 2.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.630
And our sample space
for the experiments

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.370
who will be the set of
all pairs of x and theta,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.220
that satisfy these
two conditions.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.820
These will be the
possible x's and thetas.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.060
Having defined the
sample space, next we

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.240
need to define a
probability law.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.960
At this point, we do not want to
make any arbitrary assumptions.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.970
We only have the words
completely at random to go by.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.310
But what do these words mean?

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.080
We will interpret them to mean
that there are no preferred x

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.660
values, so that all x
values are- in some sense--

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.950
equally likely.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.800
So we're going to assume that
x is a uniform random variable.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.780
Since it is uniform,
it's going to be

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.640
a constant over this range.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.280
And in order to integrate
to 1, that constant

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.620
will have to be 2 over d.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.180
And we understand that the PDF
of x is 0 outside that range.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.280
Similarly for theta,
we do not want

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.560
to assume that some
orientations are more

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.090
likely than other orientations.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.320
So we will again assume
a uniform probability

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.630
distribution.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.850
And therefore, that PDF
must be equal to 2 over pi

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.460
for theta's over this
particular range.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.750
So far, we have specified
the marginal PDFs of each one

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.710
of the two random variables.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.800
How about the adjoined PDF?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.540
In order to have
a complete model,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.540
we need to have a
joint PDF in our hands.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.620
Here, we're going to make the
assumption that x and theta are

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.820
independent of each other.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.510
And in that case,
the joint PDF is

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.460
determined by just taking the
product of the marginal PDFs.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.120
So the joint PDF is
going to be equal to 4

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.110
divided by pi times d.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.700
By this point, we
have completely

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.740
specified a probabilistic model.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.370
We have made some assumptions,
which you might even

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.990
consider arbitrary.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.860
But these assumptions
are a reasonable attempt

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.350
at capturing the idea
that the needle is

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.840
thrown completely at random.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.170
This completes the
subjective part--

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.270
the modeling part.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.440
The next step is much
more streamlined.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.050
There's not going
to be any choices.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.700
We just need to consider
the event of interest,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.140
express it in terms of
the random variables

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.610
that we have in our hands, and
then use the probability model

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.950
that we have to
calculate the probability

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.000
of this particular event.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.920
So let us identify
the event of interest.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:39.040
When will the needle
intersect the nearest line?

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.010
This will depend
on the following.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:48.190
We can look at the vertical
extent of the needle.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.770
By vertical extent,
I mean the following.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.700
Let's see how far
the needle goes

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.680
in the vertical direction,
which is the length

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.860
of this green segment here.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.520
In this example, the
vertical extent of the needle

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.740
is less than the distance
from the next line.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.840
And we do not have
an intersection.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.390
If the figure was
something like this,

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:27.700
the vertical extent of the
needle would have been that,

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.770
but x would have been
just this little segment.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.669
The vertical extent is
bigger than x and the needle

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.559
intersects the line.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:42.070
So we have an
intersection if and only

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.500
if the vertical extent--

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.950
which is this vertical
green segment--

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.520
is larger than the distance x.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.120
Or equivalently, if x is less
than the vertical extent.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:02.650
So we will have an
intersection if x is less than

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.850
or equal to the vertical
extent of the needle.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.210
Now, how big is this
vertical extent?

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.400
Let's use some
trigonometry here.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.530
This angle here is theta, so
this angle here is also theta.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.840
Here, we have a right
triangle and the hypotenuse

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.330
of this triangle is l over 2.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.100
This angle is theta, therefore
this vertical segment

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:41.880
is equal to l over
2 times sine theta.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.820
So this is the
geometrical condition

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.380
that describes the event
that the needle intersects

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.820
the nearest line.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.190
And all we need to do
now is to calculate

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.700
the probability of this event.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.930
So here is what we have so far.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.990
This is the picture that
we had before, but drawn

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.120
in a somewhat nicer way.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.020
This is the joint PDF
that we decided upon.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.270
And we wish to calculate
the probability

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.460
of this particular event--

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:20.460
that x is less than or equal
to l over 2 sine theta.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.400
How do we calculate
the probability

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.740
of an event that has to do
with two random variables?

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:34.980
What we do is we
take the joint PDF--

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.390
which in our case
is four over pi d--

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:49.140
and integrate it over the set
of x's and theta's for which

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.180
the PDF is non-zero.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.380
So it's only going to be over
x's and theta's in those ranges

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.920
and also, only for
those x theta pairs

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.540
for which the event occurs.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.840
So what are these pairs?

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.410
This event can occur
with any choice of theta.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:16.050
So theta is free to vary
from 0 up to pi over 2.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.610
How about x?

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:22.380
For this event to
occur, x can be

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.970
anything that is non-negative
as long as it is less than

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.490
or equal to this number.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.220
So the upper limit
of this integration

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:38.630
is going to be l over
2 times sine theta.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.710
And all we need to do now is to
evaluate this double integral.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.560
Let's start with
the inner integral.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.440
Because we're just
integrating a constant,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:56.520
the inner integral
evaluates to the quantity

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.920
that we're integrating--
the constant that we're

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.580
integrating-- which is 4
times pi d times the length

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.430
of the interval over
which we're integrating,

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.855
which is l over 2 sine theta.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.860
And now we need to carry
out the outer integral.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.490
Let us pull out the constants,
which is this 4 with this 2

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.290
give us a 2.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:27.220
We have 2l over pi d.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.280
And then the integral from 0
to pi over 2 of sine theta.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.500
Now the integral of sine
theta is minus cosine theta.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.250
And we need to evaluate
this at 0 and pi over 2.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.660
This turns out to be equal to 1.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:47.400
So the final result
is 2 l over pi d.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.890
And this is the final
answer to the problem

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.710
that we have been considering.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.700
And now, a curious thought.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:03.310
Suppose that you do not
know what the number pi is

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.950
and all you have
in your hands is

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:11.500
your floor, lines drawn on
your floor, and the needle.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.320
And you do know the length
between adjacent lines

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.490
on your floor.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.140
And you do know your
length of your needle.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.070
How can you figure
out the number pi?

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:25.120
Take your needle, throw it
at random a million times,

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.080
and count the frequency with
which the needle ends up

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.730
crossing the line.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.230
If you believe
that probabilities

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.200
can be interpreted
as frequencies,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.250
the frequency that you observe
gives you a good estimate

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.600
of this probability.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.560
So it gives you a good estimate
of this particular number.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.800
And if you know the length of
your needle and of the distance

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.530
between the different
lines, you can

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:55.660
use the estimate of that number
to determine the value of pi.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.530
This is a so-called
Monte Carlo method,

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.430
which uses simulation to
evaluate experimentally

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.690
the value, in this case,
of the constant pi.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:12.250
Of course, for pi, we have much
better ways of calculating it.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.660
But there are many applications
in engineering and in physics

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.430
where certain quantities
are hard to calculate,

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.960
but they can be calculated
using a trick of this kind

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.700
by simulation.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.990
Here's a typical situation.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.500
Consider the unit cube.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.810
And for simplicity,
I'm only taking

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.710
a cube in two dimensions.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.710
But in general, think
of the unit cube

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:40.390
in n dimensions, which is an
object that has unit volume.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:46.590
Inside that unit cube, there
is a complicated subset

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:51.000
which is described maybe by
some very complicated formulas.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.920
And you want to
calculate the volume

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.070
of this complicated subset.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.630
The description of the
subset is so complicated

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.280
that using integration,
multiple integrals, and calculus

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.290
is practically impossible.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.700
What can you do?

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.080
What you can do is to start
throwing at random points

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.330
inside that unit cube.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.470
So you throw points.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.640
Some fault inside.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.070
Some fall outside.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.070
You count the frequency
with which the points

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.520
happen to be inside your set.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.620
And as long as you're
throwing the points uniformly

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.150
over the cube, then
the probability

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:39.970
of your complicated set is going
to be the volume of that set.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.190
You estimate the
probability by counting

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:46.930
the frequency with which
you get points in that set.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.830
And so, by using these
observed frequencies,

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:55.210
you can estimate the
volume of a set--

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.670
something that might
be very difficult to do

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.100
through other numerical methods.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.840
It turns out that these days,
physicists and many engineers

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.885
use methods of this
kind quite often

00:16:07.885 --> 00:16:11.610
and in many important
applications.
