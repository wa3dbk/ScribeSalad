00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.780
We will now discuss De Morgan's
laws that are some

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.109
very useful relations between
sets and their complements.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.500
One of the De Morgan's
laws takes this form.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.360
If we take the intersection of
two sets and then take the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.500
complement of this intersection,
what we obtain

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.070
is the union of the complements
of the two sets.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.840
Pictorially, here is
the situation.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.680
We have our universal set.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.210
Inside that set, we have a set,
S, which is this one.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.340
And we have another set,
T, which is this one.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.840
Let us look at this side.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.950
The complement of S is this
part of the diagram.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.950
The complement of T is this
part of the diagram.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.450
What is left?

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.680
What is left is just this region
here, which is the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.740
intersection of S with T. So
anything that does not belong

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.010
here belongs to the
intersection.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.950
This means that the complement
of the intersection is

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.570
everything out there,
which is the set.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.180
If you're not convinced by this
pictorial proof, let us

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.470
go through an argument that
is a little more formal.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.360
What does it take for
an element to belong

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.870
to the first set?

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.729
In order to belong to that
set, x belongs to the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.539
complement of S intersection T.
This is the same as saying

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.020
that x does not belong to
the intersection [of]

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.450
S with T.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.370
What does that mean?

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.500
Since it is not in the
intersection, this is the same

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.940
as saying that x does not belong
to S or x does not

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.640
belong to T. But this is the
same as saying that x belongs

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.580
to the complement of S or x
belongs to the complement of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.650
T. And this is equivalent to
saying that x belongs to the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.310
union of the complement of S
with the complement of T.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.610
So this establishes this
first De Morgan's law.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.350
There's another De Morgan's law,
which is obtained from

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.110
this one by a syntactic
substitution.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.450
We're going to play the
following trick.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.520
Wherever we see an S, we're
going to replace it by S

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.410
complement.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.290
And wherever we see an S
complement, we will replace it

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.620
with an S.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.440
And similarly, whenever we see
a T, we'll replace it by T

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.150
complement.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.470
And when we see a T complement,
we will replace it

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.770
by T. So doing this syntactic
substitution, what we obtain

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.100
is S complement intersection
with T complement--

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.280
everything gets complemented--

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.200
is the same as S union T.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.560
Now, let us take complements
of both sides.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.760
The complement of a complement
is the set itself.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.690
So we obtain this.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.880
And now, we take the complement
of the other side,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.970
which is this one.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.640
And this is the second
De Morgan's law.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.930
It tells us that the complement
of a union is the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.270
same as the intersection
of the complements.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.010
We derived it from the first De
Morgan's law by a syntactic

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.980
substitution.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.630
If you're not convinced, it
would be useful for you to go

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.040
through an argument of this kind
to show that something is

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.400
an element of this set if and
only if it is an element of

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.870
that set as well.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.000
Finally, it turns out that De
Morgan's laws are valid when

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.530
we take unions or
intersections of

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.480
more than two sets.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.390
There is a more general form.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.390
And the general form
is as follows--

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.370
an analogy with this one.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.089
If we have a collection of sets,
Sn, perhaps an infinite

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.160
collection, we take the
intersection of those sets and

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.580
then the complement, what that
is is the union of the

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.350
complements.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.540
So this is analygous
to this law.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.840
And this law extends to this
one: if we have the union of

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.455
certain sets and we take the
complement of the union, what

00:04:36.455 --> 00:04:41.220
we obtain is the intersection
of the complements.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.409
We will have many occasions
to use De Morgan's laws.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.370
They're actually very useful.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.230
They allow us, in general, to
go back and forth between

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.560
unions and intersections.
