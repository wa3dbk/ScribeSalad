00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.380
By this point, we have
discussed pretty much

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.180
everything that is to be said
about individual discrete

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.870
random variables.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.190
Now let us move to the case
where we're dealing with

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.940
multiple discrete random
variables simultaneously, and

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.420
talk about their distribution.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.990
As we will see, their
distribution is characterized

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.080
by a so-called joint PMF.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.660
So suppose that we have a
probabilistic model, and on

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.860
that model we have defined
two random variables--

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.240
X and Y. And that we
have available

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.030
their individual PMFs.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.120
These PMFs tell us about one
random variable at the time.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.440
This tells us about X, this
tells us about Y. But they do

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.430
not give us any information
about how the two random

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.220
variables are related
to each other.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.670
For example, if you wish to
answer this question, whether

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.810
the numerical values that the
two random variables happen to

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.150
be equal, and what is the
probability of that event, you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.060
will not be able to answer this
question if you only know

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.280
the two individual PMFs.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.830
In order to be able to answer
a question of this type, we

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.530
will need information that tells
us what values of X tend

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.039
to occur together with what
values of Y. And this

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.810
information is captured in
the so-called joint PMF.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.520
So the joint PMF is nothing but
a piece of notation for an

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.980
object that's familiar.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.570
This is the probability that
when we carry out the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.039
experiment we happen to see
random variable X take on a

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.610
value, little x.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.440
And simultaneously see that
random variable Y takes on a

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.170
value, little y.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.490
This quantity we indicate
it with this notation.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.720
The letter little p
stands for a PMF.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.650
The subscripts tell us which
random variables

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.080
we're talking about.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.289
And finally, this is a function
of two arguments.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.790
Depending on what pair (x,y)
we're interested in, we're

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.240
going to get a different
numerical value for this

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.810
probability.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.870
As an example of a joint PMF
in which the two random

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.650
variables take values in a
finite set, we might be given

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.840
a table of this form.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.850
Using this table, we can answer
questions such as the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.420
following--

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.180
what is the probability that the
random variables X and Y

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.670
simultaneously take the values,
let us say, 1 and 3?

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.360
Then we look up in this table,
and we identify that it's this

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.010
probability, X takes the
value of 1, and Y takes

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.900
the value of 3.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.050
And according to this table,
the answer would be 2/20.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.370
Now, something to notice
about joint PMFs.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.400
When you add over all possible
pairs, x and y, this exhausts

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.380
all the possibilities.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.980
And therefore, these
probabilities should add to 1.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.750
In terms of this table, all of
the entries that we have here

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.510
should add to 1.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.000
Now, once we have in our hands
the joint PMF, we can use it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.690
to find the individual PMFs of
the random variables X and Y.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.690
And these individual PMFs are
called the marginal PMFs.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.770
How do we find them?

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.460
Well, the joint PMF tells us
everything there is to be

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.990
known about the two random
variables, so it should

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.579
contain enough information
for us to

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.450
answer any kind of question.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.540
So for example, if we wish to
find the probability that the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.660
random variable X takes the
value of 4, we look at all

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.300
possible outcomes in which X
is equal to 4, and add the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.170
probabilities of
these outcomes.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.790
So in this case, it would
be 1/20 plus 2/20.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.850
So what we're doing is that if
we're interested in a specific

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.790
value of X, the probability
that X takes on a specific

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.870
value, we consider all possible
pairs associated with

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.610
that fixed x.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.190
That is, we're considering one
column of the PMF, and we're

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.720
adding the corresponding
probabilities.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.670
So to find this entry here,
let's say px(3), what we need

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.010
is to add these terms
on that column.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.720
Similarly, we can find the PMF
of the random variable Y.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.220
So for example, the probability
that the random

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:53.360
variable Y takes on a value of,
let's say, 2, can be found

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.290
as follows.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.860
You look at the probabilities
of all pairs associated with

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.080
this specific y, and you
add over the x's.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.550
So we fix Y to have a value of
2, and we add over all pairs

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.610
in this row.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:18.560
So in this example, it would be
1/20 plus 3/20, plus 1/20.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.460
Finally, notice that we are able
to answer the question

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.090
that got us motivated
in the first place.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.620
To find the probability that the
two random variables take

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.860
equal values, we look at all the
outcomes for which the two

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.380
random variables indeed take
the same numerical values.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.830
And we see that it is this event
in this diagram, and the

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.390
probability of that event
is going to be 2/20.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.180
So in general, once we have
available the joint PMF of two

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.520
random variables, we will be
able to answer any questions

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.210
regarding probabilities of
events that have to do with

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.210
these two random variables.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.460
How about more than two
random variables?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.140
It's just a matter
of notation.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.380
For example, we can define the
joint PMF of three random

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.670
variables, and you can use the
same idea for the joint PMF,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.340
let's say, of five, or 10,
or n random variables.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.960
Let's just look at the
notation for three.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.890
There is a well-defined
probability that when we carry

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.060
out the experiment X, Y and Z
as random variables take on

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.730
certain specific values.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.010
So we look at the probability of
that particular triple, and

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.470
we indicate that probability
with this notation.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.450
Once more, the sub-scripts tell
us which random variables

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.790
we're talking about.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.300
And the PMF, of course, is going
to be a function of this

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.680
triple, little x, little y,
little z, because each triple

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.390
in general should have a
different probability.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.010
Of course, probabilities
must always add to 1.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.940
So when we consider all triples
and we add their

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.290
corresponding probabilities,
we should get 1.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.370
And finally, once we have the
joint PMF, we can again

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.270
recover the marginal PMF.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.690
For example, to find the
probability that the random

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.810
variable takes on a specific
value, little x, we consider

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.960
all possible triples in which
the random variable indeed

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.040
takes that value, little x.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.180
And then we sum over all the
possible y's and z's that

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.810
could go together with
this particular x.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.800
In the same spirit, to find the
probability that these two

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.030
random variables take on two
specific values, we consider

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.620
all the possible z's that could
go together with this

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.000
(x,y) pair.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.330
So this way we're ranging over
all outcomes in which X and Y

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.080
take on these specific values.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.150
But Z is free to take any value,
and so we consider all

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.480
those possible values of Z
and sum the corresponding

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.730
probabilities.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.980
Finally, we can talk
about functions of

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.840
multiple random variables.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.550
Suppose that we have two random
variables, x and y, and

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.650
that we define a function
of them.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.780
So this function is, of course,
a random variable.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.260
And we can find the PMF of this
random variable if we

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.350
know the joint PMF of X and Y.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.880
So the PMF, which is the
probability that the random

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.510
variable takes on a specific
numerical value, that's the

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.789
probability that the function of
X and Y takes on a specific

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.289
numerical value.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:42.120
And we can find this probability
by adding the

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.625
probabilities of all
(x,y) pairs.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.360
Which (x,y) pairs?

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:01.890
Those (x,y) pairs for which the
value of Z would be equal

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:07.450
to this particular number,
little z, that we care about.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:12.380
So we collect essentially all
possible outcomes that make

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.680
this event to happen, and we add
the probabilities of all

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.390
those outcomes.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.590
Finally, similarly to the case
where we have a single random

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:28.480
variable and function of it, we
now can talk about expected

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.925
values of functions of two
random variables, and there is

00:09:31.925 --> 00:09:35.830
an expected value rule that
parallels the expected value

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.840
rule that we had developed
for the case of a

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.770
function of this form.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.020
The form that the expected value
rule takes is similar,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.430
and it's quite natural.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.230
The interpretation
is as follows.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.160
With this probability,
a specific

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.740
(x,y) pair will occur.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.840
And when that occurs, the value
of our random variable

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.370
is a certain number.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.000
And the combination of these
two terms gives us a

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.110
contribution to the
expected value.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.290
Now, we consider all possible
(x,y) pairs that may occur,

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.310
and we sum over all
these (x,y) pairs.
