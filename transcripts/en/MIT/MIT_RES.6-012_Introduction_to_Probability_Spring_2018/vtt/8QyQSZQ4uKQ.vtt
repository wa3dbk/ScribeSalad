00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.790
Let's do a little
warm-up now before moving

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.230
to the central topic
of today's lecture

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.450
on how to apply these transition
probabilities in order

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.450
to calculate some
more interesting path

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.470
behaviors of Markov chains.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.200
So suppose that you are given
the following Markov chain,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.210
and you are asked to calculate
the probability that starting

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.570
in state 1, you go successively
to state 2, then state 6,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.950
and then 7.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.810
So this is really what
we are asked here.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.120
You start at 1, then
you go to 2, 6, and 7.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.460
So how to calculate
such a probability?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.675
Well, we can use a version
of the multiplicative rule

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:46.390
we have introduced before.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.660
And so what is the specific
format of that rule

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.580
that I'm going to use here?

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.300
You have three events like that,
B, C, D. They are conditioned

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.965
on A. And I will say that this
is the probability of B given

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:11.130
A, times the probability of
C given A intersection B,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.190
times the probability of D given
A intersection B intersection

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.130
C. So this is a version of
the multiplicative rule.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.080
And this is what we're going
to use here, so let's do it.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.370
This is going to be
equals to the probability

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.479
that X1 equals 2 given X0
equals 1, times the probability

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.090
that X2 equals 6
given X0 equals 1,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.810
and X1 equals 2
times the probability

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:57.310
that X3 equals 7 times
X0 equals 1, X1 equals 2,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.080
and then X2 equals 6.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.070
So multiplication rule.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.020
Now here, this is p12.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.690
And here, we are using
the Markov property.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.250
What it says here is,
what is the probability

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.350
that I will be in state 6, given
that I was in 1 and then 2.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.530
And we know that having
the entire trajectory

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.710
doesn't matter, it's
just the last step.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.140
So it's essentially
times, this one is p26.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.930
And for the same reason, this
one is nothing else than p67.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.490
The important message
here is that to find

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.210
the probability of a specific
trajectory like this one,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.050
you just need to multiply
the transition probabilities

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.770
that you find along
the trajectory.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.610
So this is what we have here.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.730
Now suppose that you want
to find the probability

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.490
that in four times
steps, you find yourself

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.570
in a specific
state say, 7, given

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.410
that you started in a
specific initial state say, 2.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.140
This is really
what we want here.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.240
You're here, and then you
end up here after four steps.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.910
So how do you calculate that?

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.430
Well, one way is to use our
recurrence formula for rij

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.810
that we have described before.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.010
Another, for small
examples like this one,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.070
when the number of times
steps in the future

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.920
is small-- in that
case four-- one

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.070
can perhaps use a brute
force calculation.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.020
So what is a brute
force calculation?

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.630
Well, you try to enumerate
all possible trajectories,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.390
and then you sum all
their probabilities.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.820
So in that case, I think
we have three trajectories,

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.810
but I'm not so sure, so
let's try to enumerate them.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.510
So you start here,
and one possibility

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.240
in a one-step transition
is to go to 6.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.220
Then from 6 you go to 7,
then from 7 you go back to 6.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.630
And then from 6 you
again go to 7, all right?

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.050
So that, if we look and use
the rule that we have developed

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.940
before, it would
be the probability

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:24.820
of going to 6 times p67
times p76 and times p67.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.820
So this is one way of doing it.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.350
What would be another path?

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.780
Well, from 2,
instead of going to 6

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.940
you could go to 1
in one transition.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.392
Then you go back to 2, then
we go to 6, and then right up

00:04:47.392 --> 00:04:48.159
to 7.

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:53.700
So essentially here, what
we have is plus p21 times

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.173
p12 times p26 times p67.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.710
And what is the
third way to do that?

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.630
So there is a third path.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.060
You're starting from here, yes?

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.810
You go here in one step.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.410
Here you do a jump on
itself, and another jump,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.980
and then you go to 7.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:32.570
So in that case, you would
have plus p26 times p66 times

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.870
p66 times p67.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.270
So here we have the entire
solution, all right?

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.490
So this is what is
called, by brute force.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.930
Now of course, if
instead of 4, here,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.390
you had something like 200,
the number of trajectories

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.880
would grow exponentially
with this number of steps.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.230
And this is not
practical anymore.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.490
Using the recursion
formula would

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.380
have been a much
better approach.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.700
And in some sense would have
a much better complexity.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.550
Essentially, a linear
growth as a function of time

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.580
steps in the future.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.685
More precisely, for a chain
with a state space of m,

00:06:19.685 --> 00:06:24.140
at each time steps you need
to update all our rij's.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.970
So for each pair of
ij, so each of these

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.740
would take about m squared.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.440
And so the total
computational complexity

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:39.630
would grow about n times m
squared as a function of n.
