00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.710
One particular series that shows
up in many applications,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.900
examples, or problems is
the geometric series.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.590
[In] the geometric series, we
are given a certain number,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.130
alpha, and we want to sum all
the powers of alpha, starting

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.660
from the 0th power, which is
equal to 1, the first power,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.690
and so on, and this gives
us an infinite series.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.030
It's the sum of alpha
to the i where i

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.490
ranges from 0 to infinity.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.610
Now, for this series to
converge, we need subsequent

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.910
terms, the different terms in
the series, to become smaller

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.900
and smaller.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.280
And for this reason, we're going
to make the assumption

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.430
that the number alpha is less
than 1 in magnitude, which

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.100
implies that consecutive
terms go to zero.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.740
Let us introduce
some notation.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.620
Let us denote the infinite sum
by s, and we're going to use

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.700
that notation shortly.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.280
One way of evaluating this
series is to start from an

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.870
algebraic identity, namely
the following.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.180
Let us take 1 minus alpha and
multiply it by the terms in

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.220
the series, but going only up
to the term alpha to the n.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.780
So it's a finite series.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.190
We do this multiplication, we
get a bunch of terms, we do

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.230
the cancellations, and what is
left at the end is 1 minus

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.450
alpha to the power n plus 1.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.970
What we do next is we take the
limit as n goes to infinity.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.759
On the left hand side, we have
the term 1 minus alpha, and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.600
then the limit of this finite
series is by definition the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.789
infinite series, which
we're denoting by s.

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.250
On the right hand side,
we have the term 1.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.870
How about this term?

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.950
Since alpha is less than 1 in
magnitude, this converges to 0

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.830
as alpha goes to infinity,
so that term disappears.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.090
We can now solve this relation,
and we obtain that s

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.530
is equal to 1 over 1 minus
alpha, and this is the formula

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.450
for the infinite geometric
series.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.220
There's another way of deriving
the same result,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.770
which is interesting, so let
us go through it as well.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.680
The infinite geometric series
has one first term and then

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.620
the remaining terms, which is
a sum for i going from 1 to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.860
infinity of alpha to the i.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.200
Now, we can take a factor of
alpha out of this infinite sum

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.680
and write it as 1 plus alpha,
the sum of alpha to the i, but

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.180
because we took out one factor
of alpha, here, we're going to

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.400
have smaller powers.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.720
So now the sum starts from 0
and goes up to infinity.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.220
Now, this is just 1 plus alpha
times s because here, we have

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.920
the infinite geometric series.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.620
Therefore, if we subtract alpha
s from both sides of

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.590
this equality, we get s times
1 minus alpha equal to 1.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.120
And now by moving 1 minus alpha
to the denominator, we

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.770
get again the same expression.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.510
So this is an alternative way
of deriving the same result.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.690
However, there's one
word of caution.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.990
In this step, we subtracted
alpha s from both

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.230
sides of the equation.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.170
And in order to do that, this
is only possible if we take

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.240
for granted that s is
a finite number.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.990
So this is taken for granted
in order to carry out this

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.280
derivation.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.050
This is to be contrasted with
the first derivation, in which

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.690
we didn't have to make
any such assumption.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.340
So strictly speaking, for this
derivation here to be correct,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.890
we need to have some independent
way of verifying

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.200
that s is less than infinity.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.720
But other than that, it's an
interesting algebraic trick.
