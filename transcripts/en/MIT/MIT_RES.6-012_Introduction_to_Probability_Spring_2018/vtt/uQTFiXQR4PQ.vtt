00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.240
We will now consider a very
practical application of the

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.060
weak law of large numbers,
and the calculations

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.670
associated with it.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.970
The application has to
do with polling.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.200
There's a certain referendum
that's going to take place.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.940
We're close enough to the day
of the referendum so that

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.270
voters have made up their minds,
and there is a fraction

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.300
p of the population that
represents the voters that are

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.780
going to vote yes.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.920
But the referendum has not yet
taken place, and you want to

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.990
find out, to predict or estimate
what p actually is.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.280
What you do is that you go
ahead, and you select at

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.750
random a number of people
out of the population.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.690
And for each person, you record
their answer, whether

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.810
they intend to vote yes,
or whether they

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.120
intend to vote no.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.630
When we say that the people are
randomly selected, what we

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.890
mean is that we choose them
uniformly from the population.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.110
And since there's a fraction p
that will vote yes, this means

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.210
that this random variable will
be 1 with probability p, and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.860
therefore, the expected value
of Xi is equal to p.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.680
In addition, we assume that
we select those people

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.930
independently.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.789
Now note that if we select
people independently, there's

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.289
always a chance that the first
person polled will be the same

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.530
as the second person polled,
something that we do not

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.140
really want to happen.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.729
However, if we assume that the
population is very large, or

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.360
even idealize the situation by
assuming that the population

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
is infinite, then this is never
going to happen, and

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.620
this will not be a concern.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.820
So how do we proceed?

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.350
We look at the results
that we got from the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.720
people that we polled.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.420
We count how many said yes,
divide by n, and this gives us

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.310
the fraction of yeses in the
sample that we have obtained.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.380
And this is a pretty reasonable
estimate for the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.920
unknown fraction p, the fraction
of yeses in the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.770
overall population.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.260
Now perhaps your boss has asked
you to find out the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.120
exact value of p.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.310
What should your response be?

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.490
Well, there is no way to
calculate p exactly on the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.170
basis of a finite
and random poll.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.090
Therefore, there is going
to be some error in our

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.320
estimation of p.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.030
Then, perhaps your boss comes
back and says, OK, then try to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.970
give me an estimate of p
which is very accurate.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.030
I would like you to come up
with an estimate which is

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.250
correct within one
percentage point.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.710
Can you do this for me?

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.370
Your answer might be, OK, let me
try polling 10,000 people,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.080
and see if I can guarantee for
you such a small error.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.050
But after you think about the
situation a little more, you

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.350
realize that there is no way of
guaranteeing such a small

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.820
error with certainty.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.329
What if your unlucky, and the
people that you poll happen to

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.870
be not representative of
the true population?

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.070
So you come back to your boss
and you say, I cannot

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.460
guarantee with certainty that
the error is going to be

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.460
small, but perhaps I can
guarantee for you that the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.420
error that I get is small
with high probability.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.610
Or alternatively, I'm going to
guarantee for you that the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.890
probability that we get an error
that's bigger than that

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.070
is very small.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.750
So how small is it
going to be?

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.000
Let's try to derive a bound on
this probability of an error

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.560
larger than one percentage
point.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.250
Using the calculations that we
carried out when we derived

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.450
the weak law of large numbers,
we know that this probability

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.200
of a large error is bounded
above by this quantity.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.040
What is this quantity?

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.650
Sigma squared is the variance
of the random variable that

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.580
we're sampling.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.450
And since this is Bernoulli,
this variance is p times 1

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.090
minus p, and then we divide by
n, which in our case is 10 to

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.960
the fourth times epsilon
squared.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.340
Epsilon is 10 to the minus
2, so here we have 10

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.570
to the minus 4.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.620
OK, but now, what is
this quantity?

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.620
This quantity depends on p, and
we do not know what p is.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.420
However, if you take this
expression, and plot it as a

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.580
function of p, what you obtain
is a plot of this type.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.030
And the maximum happens when p
is equal to 1/2, in which case

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.970
we get a value of 1/4.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.060
That is, the variance of the
Bernoulli is, at most, 1/4.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.970
And therefore, we obtain this
bound here where the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.710
denominator terms have
disappeared because they're

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.250
equal to 1.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.710
So you tell your boss, if I
sample 10,000 people, then the

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.590
probability of an error more
than the one percentage point

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.860
is going to be less than 25%.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.600
At which point, your boss might
reply and say, well, a

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.659
probability of a large error
of 25% is too big.

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.580
This is unacceptable.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.850
I would like you to have a
probability of error that's

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.170
less than 5%.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.260
So suppose now that we want to
change this, and make it only

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.700
a 5% error--

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.909
5% or less.

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:55.240
How are you going to proceed?

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.870
Well, you have this quantity
here, this upper bound, which

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.720
we know to be less than or
equal to 1/4 divided by n

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.960
times epsilon squared, which
is, in our case, 10

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.850
to the minus 4.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:17.020
We would like this quantity to
be less than or equal to 5%,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.420
which is 5/10 to the
second power.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.380
And after you solve this
inequality, you find that this

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.180
is equivalent to taking
n larger than or equal

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.790
to 10 to the sixth.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.010
And then the five together
with that four gives us a

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.960
denominator of 20.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.860
And this number is
equal to 50,000.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.560
So at this point, you can go
back to your boss and tell

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.200
them that one way of
guaranteeing that the

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.909
probability of a large error is
less than or equal to 5% is

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:58.850
to take n equal to 50,000.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:05.260
So 50,000 will suffice to
achieve the desired specs.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.880
Notice that the desired specs
have two parameters.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.140
One is the accuracy that you
want, and the other is the

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.870
confidence with which
the accuracy

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.040
is going to be achieved.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.420
Now 50,000 is a pretty
large number.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.890
If you notice the results of
polls, the way that they are

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.690
presented in newspapers, they
usually tell you that there's

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.570
an accuracy of plus or minus
three percentage points, not

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.380
one percentage point.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.250
That helps things a little.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.670
It means that you can
do with a somewhat

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.060
smaller sample size.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.440
And then, there's
another effect.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.790
Our calculation here was based
on this inequality, which is

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.390
the Chebyshev inequality.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.650
But the Chebyshev inequality
is not that accurate.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.120
It turns out that if we use
more accurate estimates of

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.620
this probability, we will find
that actually much smaller

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.910
values of n will be enough
for our purposes.
