00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.610
We now develop a methodology for
finding the PDF of the sum

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.760
of two independent random
variables, when these random

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.710
variables are continuous
with known PDFs.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.780
So in that case, Z will
also be continuous and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.530
so will have a PDF.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.430
The development is quite
analogous to the one for the

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.340
discrete case.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.100
And in the discrete
case, we obtained

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.090
this convolution formula.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.980
This convolution formula
corresponds to a summation

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.050
over all ways that a certain
sum can be realized.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.520
In this picture, these are all
the ways that the sum of 3 can

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.930
be realized.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.400
In the continuous case, the
different ways that the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.340
constant sum can be realized
corresponds to a line.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.370
So this is a line in which X
plus Y is equal to a constant.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.890
And we need to somehow add over
all the possible ways

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.330
that the sum can be obtained,
add over all the

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.850
points on this line.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.970
Now, when we're summing over all
the points of the line we

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.480
really need to employ
an integral.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.220
And this leads to the following

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.050
guess for the formula.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.840
Instead of having a summation,
we will have an integral.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.120
And the integral is over all the
X, Y pairs whose sum is a

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.510
constant number, little z.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.860
So we have here the
family recipe--

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.235
that sums are replaced by
integrals and PMFs are

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:31.870
replaced by PDFs.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.030
So this formula is entirely
plausible.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.250
And it is called the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.140
continuous convolution formula.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.750
What we want to do next is to
actually justify this formula

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.770
more rigorously.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.890
We will use the following
trick.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.310
We will first condition on the
random variable X, taking on a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.850
specific value.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.080
If we do this conditioning,
then the random variable Z

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:06.110
becomes little x plus Y. And
to make the argument more

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.070
transparent, we're going to look
first at the special case

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.120
where little x is let's
say, the number 3.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.400
In which case our random
variable Z is

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.300
equal to Y plus 3.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.990
Let us now calculate the
conditional PDF of Z in a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.020
universe in which we are told
that the random variable X

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.300
takes on the value of 3.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.440
Now, given that X takes on the
value of 3, the random

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.570
variable Z is the same as the
random variable Y plus 3.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.270
And now we have the conditional
PDF of y plus 3

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.360
given X.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.120
However, we have assumed that
X and Y are independent.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.180
So the conditional PDF is going
to be the same as the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.400
unconditional PDF of Y plus 3.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.720
And we obtain this expression.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.030
Now, what is this?

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.410
We know the PDF of Y. But now
we want the PDF of Y plus 3,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.550
which is a simple version of a
linear function of a single

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.940
random variable Y. For a linear
function of this form,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.070
we have already derived
a formula.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.530
In the notation we have used
in the past, if we have a

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.610
random variable X, and we add
the constant to it, the PDF of

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.240
the new random variable is the
PDF of X but shifted by an

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.230
amount equal to b
to the right.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.370
And that's what the shifting
corresponds to mathematically.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.930
Now, let's us apply this
formula to the case

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.400
that we have here.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.440
We need to keep track of
the different symbols.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.700
So capital Y corresponds to X,
b corresponds to 3, little x

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.780
corresponds to Z. And by using
these correspondences, what we

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.329
obtain is f sub Y of this
argument, which is Z in our

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.100
case minus b, which
is 3 in our case.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.990
And this is the final form for
the conditional density of Z

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.530
given that X takes
a specific value.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.140
It's nothing more than the
density of Y, but shifted by 3

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.100
units to the right.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.840
Let us now generalize this.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.830
Instead of using X equal to 3,
let us use a general number.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.390
And this gives us the more
general formula, that the

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.090
conditional PDF of Z given that
X takes on a specific

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.460
value is equal to--

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.600
just use little x here
instead of 3.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.110
It takes this form.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.510
So we do have now in our hands
a formula for the conditional

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.850
density of Z given X.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.040
Since we have the conditional,
and we also know the PDF of X,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.520
we can use the multiplication
rule to find the joint PDF of

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.710
X and Z. By the multiplication
rule, it is the marginal PDF

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.130
of X times the conditional PDF
of Z given X, which in our

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.530
case takes this particular
form.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.830
And now that we have the joint
PDF in our hands, we can use

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.420
another familiar formula
that takes us from the

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.060
joint to the marginal.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.010
It would take the joint PDF and
integrate with respect to

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.690
one argument, we obtain the
marginal PDF of the other

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.370
random variable.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.860
Using this specific form that
we have for the joint PDF in

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.320
this formula, we have finally
obtained this expression.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.120
This is the integral of the
joint PDF of X with Z

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.370
integrated over all xs.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.910
And this proves this convolution
formula.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.350
In terms of the mechanics of
carrying out the calculation

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.500
of the convolution, the
mechanics are exactly the same

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.180
as in the discrete case.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.090
If you want to solve a problem
graphically, what you will do

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.300
is to take the PDF of Y, flip
it horizontally, and then

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.070
shift it by an amount of little
z, cross multiply

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.760
terms, and integrate them out.
