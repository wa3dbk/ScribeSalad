00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.380
In this segment, we consider
the sum of independent Poisson

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.120
random variables, and we
establish a remarkable fact,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.710
namely that the sum
is also Poisson.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.120
This is a fact that
we can establish

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.630
by using the
convolution formula.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.380
The PMF of the sum of
independent random variables

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.980
is the convolution
of their PMFs.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.700
So we can take two Poisson
PMFs, convolve them, carry out

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.490
the algebra, and find
out that in the end,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.130
you obtain again a Poisson PMF.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.440
However, such a derivation
is completely unintuitive,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.520
and does not give
you any insight.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.540
Instead, we will
derive this fact

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.500
by using our
intuition about what

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.660
Poisson random variables
really represent.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.650
We will work with
a Poisson process

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.870
of rate lambda equal to 1.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.700
But let us remind ourselves
of the general Poisson PMF

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.060
if we have a more
general rate lambda.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.260
This is the PMF of
the number of arrivals

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.790
in a Poisson process with
rate lambda during a time

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.840
interval of length tau.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.890
And this Poisson PMF has a
mean equal to lambda tau.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.510
And you can think of
lambda tau as being

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.480
the parameter of
this Poisson PMF.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.550
So we say that this is a
Poisson PMF with parameter

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.510
equal to lambda times tau.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.400
Now, let us consider two
consecutive time intervals

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.979
in this processes that
have length mu and nu.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.370
And let us consider
the numbers of arrivals

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.729
during each one of
these intervals.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.930
So we have M arrivals
here and N arrivals there.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.289
Of course, M and N
are random variables.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.710
What kind of random
variables are they?

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.070
Well, the number of arrivals in
the Poisson process of rate 1,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.330
over a period of
duration mu is going

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.050
to have a Poisson PMF in
which lambda is one, tau,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.480
the time interval
is equal to mu,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.270
so it's going to be a Poisson
random variable with parameter,

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.120
or mean, equal to mu.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.560
Similarly for N, it's going to
be a Poisson random variable

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.160
with parameter equal to nu.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.940
Are these two random
variables independent?

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.250
Of course they are.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.550
In a Poisson
process, the numbers

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.170
of arrivals in
disjoint time intervals

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.020
are independent
random variables.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.200
What kind of random
variable is their sum?

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.650
Their sum is the total
number of arrivals

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.680
during an interval
of length mu plus nu,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.750
and therefore this is a
Poisson random variable

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.440
with mean equal to mu plus nu.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.340
So, what do we have here?

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.040
We have the sum of two
independent Poisson random

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.760
variables, and that
sum turns out also

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.660
to be a Poisson random variable.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.740
More generally, if
somebody gives you

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.940
two independent Poisson
random variables,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.680
you can always think of
them as representing numbers

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.480
of arrivals in disjoint
time intervals,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.100
and therefore by
following this argument,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.980
their sum is going to be
a Poisson random variable.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.130
And this is the conclusion
that we wanted to establish.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.380
It's a remarkable fact.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.550
It's similar to the fact
that we had established

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.420
for normal random variables.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.100
The sum of independent
normal random variables

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.760
is also normal, so Poisson
and normal distributions

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.250
are special in this respect.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.100
This is a property that most
other distributions do not

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.220
have, with very few exceptions.
