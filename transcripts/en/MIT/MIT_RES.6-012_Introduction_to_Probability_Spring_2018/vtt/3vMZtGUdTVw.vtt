00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.680
In this video, we're
going to establish

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.400
a nice property of
the Poisson process.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.860
Here is our setting.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.920
We have a Poisson process
with arrival rate, lambda,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.360
and so arrivals keep coming.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.530
And we watch this process
until a certain random time, T.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.770
So T is this time here.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.190
Now, T is an exponential random
variable with some parameter,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.800
and T is independent from
the Poisson arrival process.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.350
What we're interested
in is the number

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.240
of arrivals that happened
during this time.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.270
How can we answer this question?

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.250
There are two ways.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.810
One is using mathematical
manipulations.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.190
The other is using intuition.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.750
Let's see what it
would take if we wanted

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.760
to solve the problem
using formulas.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.770
So let's call N-T, with capital
T, the number of arrivals

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.800
until time T in our
Poisson process.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.490
And we wish to find the
distribution of N-T. So we

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.690
want to calculate, for
example, the probability

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.455
that N-T is equal to
a specific number, k.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.330
Now, we do not know very much
about this random variable,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.170
but we do know the probability
of the random variable, N-T,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.130
If we have a deterministic time.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.490
So perhaps we can
condition by fixing

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.450
the value of the random
variable, capital T-- that

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.350
is, to condition on
that random variable,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.530
taking on a specific value.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.220
What happens in this case?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.520
Well, if I tell you that
capital T is equal to little t,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.729
this probability is going to
be the same as the probability

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.570
that N with little t is equal
to k, where N with little t

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.040
is the number of arrivals
until time, little t.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.770
But the number of arrivals,
until a certain time,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.730
is a Poisson random variable.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.949
So we do know what
this probability is.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.470
It is lambda to the k, e
to the [minus] lambda t,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.180
divided by k factorial.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.670
Now, if we have this
conditional probability, how can

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.150
we get the unconditional
probability?

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.540
This is done by using the
total probability theorem.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.260
We consider all possible
values of little t, which

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.440
are all the numbers
from 0 to infinity.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.070
We weigh each possible
value of little t

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.130
according to the corresponding
PDF of the random variable, T.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.900
And we have this equality.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.640
We know what this term is.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.565
It is this expression.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.320
And the density of
capital T, since it

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.260
is an exponential variable,
the density takes this form.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.550
And so, in order to
find the distribution

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.640
of the random
variable, N capital T,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.230
all that we need to do is
to calculate this integral.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.090
But this is a rather
messy integral.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.410
So let us try to
see if we can find

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.250
a shortcut to this problem.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.570
So here is what we have.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.960
We have a Poisson process.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.770
Let's call it the
first Poisson process,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.470
that has a certain rate, lambda.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.620
And this Poisson process has
arrivals at various times.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.340
And then we have a random
variable, capital T,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.860
which is exponential.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.460
How should we think about an
exponential random variable?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.970
We can think of an
exponential random variable

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.560
as being the first arrival
in some Poisson process.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.120
So let us put down a second
Poisson process with rate mu.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.480
Since we have assumed
that capital T is

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.530
independent from the
red Poisson process,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.920
we can just assume
that this blue Poisson

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.925
process is independent
from the first.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:23.020
Now, let us merge
the two processes.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.070
And we're going to form
a merged process that

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.660
records an arrival at
those times at which either

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.650
of the two processes
have an arrival.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.040
This is the time of interest.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.320
And the random variable
that we're interested in

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.430
is the number of red
arrivals until that time.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.010
That random variable we call
N capital T. The discussion

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.800
will be a little simpler if we
define another random variable,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.500
K, which is N capital T plus 1.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.360
So K is the number of
arrivals in the merged process

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.760
until this time.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.320
That is, we take those
arrivals of the red process,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.660
and we also include
that arrival here.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.240
So if the number of
arrivals that we got here

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:26.290
was N capital T, here we have
arrivals 1, 2, and so on.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.930
And this is arrival number
K. So K is a random variable,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.260
and we want to find what it is.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.230
So what are we asking?

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.000
What is K?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:53.580
K is the number of arrivals
in the merged process

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.320
until you get an arrival
in the merged process which

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.195
is coming from the blue process.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.460
And now, here is how we can
think of this situation.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:29.335
Think of each arrival in the
merged process as a trial.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.130
Each one of these
arrivals is coming

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.950
either from the red process
or from the blue process.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:49.710
Let us call it a success if it
comes from the blue process.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:08.000
So in that case, K is
the number of trials

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.935
until we have a success.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.930
K is the number of arrivals
in the merged process

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.910
until we have a
successful arrival,

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.290
meaning one that came
out of the blue process.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.070
So what do we know
about those trials?

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.270
What are their
statistical properties?

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.830
First, what is the
probability of success?

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.050
The probability of
success is the probability

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.060
that when you get an arrival
in the merged process,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.580
it is coming from
the blue process.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.460
And as we have seen, given an
arrival in the merged process,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.450
there is probability
that it's coming

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.150
from this particular
process that's

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.050
proportional to the arrival
rate of that particular process.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.420
And it is equal, as
we have discussed

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.560
before, it is equal to this.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.890
In addition, we have
discussed that when

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.720
you look at the merged
process, and you

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.390
ask, what was the
origin of that arrival,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.540
and you ask, what was the
origin of that arrival,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.750
the answers to
these two questions

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.360
are independent of each other.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.470
In other words, the
origin of this arrival

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.060
is statistically
independent from the origin

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.710
of that arrival.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:35.924
So this means that these
trials are independent.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.560
So what we're looking
at is a random variable,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.330
which is the number of trials
until the first success,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.070
in a sequence of
independent trials,

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.090
where each trial has
a success probability

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.800
equal to that value.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.065
And we know what
that distribution is.

00:08:59.065 --> 00:09:04.000
It is a geometric with
this particular parameter.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.900
This gives us the
probability distribution

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.970
of the random variable, K, and
once you have the PMF of K,

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.890
you just shift it by
1 to the left in order

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.380
to get the probability
distribution, the PMF,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.960
of the random
variable, N capital T.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.770
And so this is the
answer to this problem.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:28.520
The number of arrivals during an
exponentially distributed time

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.030
interval [has] a
geometric distribution

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.640
that's shifted by 1 to the left.
