00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.930
In this segment we
develop some consequences

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.890
of the independence
assumption that we

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.140
have made on the trials that
constitute a Bernoulli process.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.440
These properties will
be pretty intuitive,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.260
but they play an important role.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.960
They're helpful in
solving problems,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.990
and they're also quite
helpful in understanding

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.010
the continuous time version of
the Bernoulli process, namely

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.640
the Poisson process that
we will be studying later.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.130
So here's the story.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.010
We start with a
Bernoulli processes

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.460
with some parameter p.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.250
The process starts.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.480
A friend of yours
watches the processes,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.830
and they observe the results
of the different trials,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.000
let's say for five time steps.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.790
And at this time,
right after time five,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.400
they call you into
the room, and you

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.680
start watching the
rest of the process.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.980
What will you see?

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.340
The first random variable
that you will see

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.090
is the result of whatever
happens in this time

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.420
slot, which is the sixth
slot of the original process.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.030
The second random
variable that you will see

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.590
is the result of the
seventh random variable

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.570
in the original
process, and so on.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.570
So the process
that you get to see

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.660
is the process
Yi, where i ranges

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.580
over the non-negative integers.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.460
What properties does
this process have?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.090
Because of the assumption
that the different trials are

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.020
independent, this means
that the first five trials

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.130
are independent from the trials
that happen after time five.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.890
So one property is
that the process

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.550
is Yi is independent
of whatever happens

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.200
in the past, which
is X1 up to X5.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.910
Second, the random variable
that you see, X6, X7, and so on,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.699
are independent Bernoulli random
variables with parameter p.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.370
So the random variables
Yi constitute also

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.110
a Bernoulli process
with parameter p.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.310
So the process that
you get to see,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.490
which is the sequence of
trials after time five,

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.560
is identical, probabilistically,
to a Bernoulli process

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.920
with parameter p
like the process Xi.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.910
So it's as if a Bernoulli
process was just

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.960
starting fresh at
this particular time.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.530
And because of this,
we say that the process

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.510
has a fresh-start property
after a certain time.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.850
In this example, we used
5 as the certain time,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.850
but instead of 5, we could
have any particular integer

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.230
little n, in which case
our process Y1 starts

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.060
with Xn plus 1, continues
with Xn plus 2 and so on.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.260
And here, instead of X5,
we would have written Xn.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.570
So after a deterministic
time n, what you see

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.980
is the same as if we had
a Bernoulli process that

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.930
was starting fresh at
this particular time,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.180
and which is also
independent from whatever

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.890
happened in the past.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.010
Let us now complicate
the story a little bit.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.220
Suppose that your friend
watches the Bernoulli process,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.450
and they keep watching
it until a success is

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.940
observed for the first time.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.220
Right at that time, they
call you into the room,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.880
and you started watching
the rest of the process.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.460
This is the length
of time that we

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.350
have called T1, the number of
trials until the first success.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.060
So what is it that
you will be watching?

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.200
The first random variable
that you will see

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.010
is what happens
in slot T1 plus 1.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.160
The second random
variable that you will see

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:18.350
is what happened in slot
T1 plus 2, and so on.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.589
And this defines,
again, a process,

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.430
the sequence of the
Yi's This is what

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.730
you will see starting
from this particular time.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.810
What kind of process is it?

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.360
Well, these trials
happened in the past.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.370
We know what they were.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.680
But no matter what they
were, the future trials

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.350
will still be
independent of the past,

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.100
and each one of the
trials will have

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.340
probability p of
being a success.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.550
So the properties
that we have, again,

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.870
is that the trials
that you see are

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.830
independent of the
past, which in this case

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.940
is everything from
x1 up to time xT1.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.200
And what you see is
a Bernoulli process.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.460
We describe the
situation by saying

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.390
that the process starts
fresh after time T1.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.950
And by this, again,
we mean that if you

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.960
start watching the process right
after T1, what you will see

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.470
will be a Bernoulli
process which

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.540
is independent from whatever
happened in the past.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.840
Having just argued
that the process starts

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.940
fresh at the time T1
of the first success,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.290
we can now ask why whether
such a property is also true

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.690
more generally.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.780
That is, if we start watching
the process at some random time

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.200
n, will the process
start fresh at that time?

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.050
Let us look at some
additional examples.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.080
Suppose that capital N is the
time of the third success.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.670
So your friend watches
the Bernoulli process,

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.360
and each time, they say,
did the third success occur?

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.280
Not yet.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.200
Not yet.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.560
Not yet.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.840
Not yet.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.530
Yes, the third
success just occurred.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.350
And at that time, they
call you into the room

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.920
and you start to watching what
happens from that time on.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.060
What will you be seeing?

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.860
After that time, there will be
independent Bernoulli trials

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.340
that take place.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.360
And these refer to the future
of the process, looking at [it]

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.990
from this particular
point in time.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.750
And the future is
independent from whatever

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.170
happened in the past.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.720
So what you actually see is,
indeed, a fresh Bernoulli

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.040
process that starts
here and which

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.190
is independent from the
random variables that

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.430
occurred in the past.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.810
Let us look at another example.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.310
Let capital N be the first time
that three successes in a row

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.290
have been recorded.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.890
So your friend, again,
watches the process.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.420
And they ask each time, did
we see three success in a row?

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.660
Not yet.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.710
Not yet.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.780
Not yet.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.910
Not yet.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.470
Not yet.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.160
Yes.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.030
I just saw three
successes in a row.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.740
And now your friend
calls you in,

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.810
and you start
watching the process

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.410
from this point in time.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.840
By the same argument
as before, whatever

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.020
happens in the future is going
to be Bernoulli trials that

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.990
are independent from the
past, so you will, again,

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.440
have a fresh-start property
starting from this time.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.820
So in both cases,
formally, what we have

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.470
is that the process that you get
to observe starting after time

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.620
capital N, after the time
that you're called and asked

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.830
to start watching,
what you will see

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.460
is going to be a sequence of
independent Bernoulli trials,

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.490
that is, a Bernoulli process.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.420
And this sequence
of future trials

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.110
is independent from
whatever happened

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.470
in the past of the process.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.800
What both of these
examples have in common

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.280
is that the random variable
N, the time at which you're

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.270
called in, is
causally determined

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.360
from the history of the process.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.050
What does that mean?

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.430
It means that somebody
is watching the process,

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.240
and at each point in time, based
on what they have seen so far,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.510
they decide whether
to call you in or not.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.250
What would be an example
of a non-causal time N?

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.370
Here it is.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:49.090
N could be the time just before
the first occurrence of 1,

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.120
1, 1.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.100
So in this example here, you
would be called into the room

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.750
and start watching at this time.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.750
So your friend somehow knows
that a sequence of 1,1, 1

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.750
is going to occur and calls
you just before it happens.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.960
How could that be?

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.470
Well, imagine that the
Bernoulli process actually

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.410
was run yesterday.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.090
It was recorded in a movie.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.404
Your friend has seen
the movie, so knows

00:09:20.404 --> 00:09:21.820
everything that's
going to happen.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.670
And so, when the movie
is replayed today,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.570
your friend can call you in
at this time and tell you,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.540
you know, something very
interesting is about happen.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.290
Come in and start watching.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.170
Now, what will you be watching?

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:42.740
What you will watch will
be 1, 1, 1, with certainty.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.190
You're certain that the first
three trials that you will see

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.580
will be 1's.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.830
And, well, the subsequent
one's will be random.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.690
But since you know that the
first three trials will be 1,

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.880
this means that
statistically, they're

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.510
not described by the statistics
of a Bernoulli process.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.910
In a Bernoulli
process, each trial

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.220
has a probability of being 1
and the probability of being 0.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.360
But since, in your case,
you're certain to watch

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.120
1's in the beginning, this
means that the random variables

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.060
that you see do not conform to
the description of a Bernoulli

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.290
process.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:26.100
So this is an example in which
N is not causally determined.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.540
And in this example,
you do not to get

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.790
to see a Bernoulli process.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.220
We do not have the
fresh-start property.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.720
What happened here is
more generally true.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.830
We do have a fresh-start
property, but not always.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.210
We have it under the assumption
that the time at which you're

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.040
asked to start
watching is determined

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.500
from the past history of the
process in some causal manner.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.160
This is a general fact that
can be established rigorously.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.450
However we will not go through a
formal mathematical derivation.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.160
The formal argument for
the most general case

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.610
involves somewhat tedious
symbol manipulations

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.860
that do not provide
any additional insight.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.440
However, the intuition
behind this result

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.150
should be fairly clear,
and we will use it freely

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.533
whenever we need it.
