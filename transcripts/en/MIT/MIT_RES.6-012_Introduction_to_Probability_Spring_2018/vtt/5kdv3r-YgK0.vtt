00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.990
Here is an example of a problem
related to the Bernoulli

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.590
process, which can be
tricky, but is actually

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.010
easy to answer if
one makes good use

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.270
of the fresh-start property.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.910
Here is the setting.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.700
Time is discrete,
divided into slots.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.010
We have a server that
receives tasks to process.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.070
Tasks received gets processed
in the same time slot.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.640
So slots are divided
into busy ones--

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.290
those are the slots during
which a task gets processed.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.080
And idle slots--
these are the slots

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.080
during which there is
no task to be processed.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.230
We assume that the
process of job arrivals

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.260
is described by a
Bernoulli process

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.070
with some known parameter p.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.820
So, during each slot
there is probability, p,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.750
that a job is present,
and different slots

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.010
are independent of each other.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.270
We're interested in the first
busy period of the server.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.319
The first busy period
starts at the first slot

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.070
during which there
is a job present.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.990
And the busy period
extends until just

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.050
before the next idle slot.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.250
For an example, it
could be the case

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.750
that the first slot
is busy, in which case

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.110
the busy period
starts right here.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.340
And the busy periods,
in this example,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.360
extends for three time units.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.509
It ends just before
the next idle slot.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.910
It could also be the case
that the first slot is idle.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.240
In that case, the
busy period starts

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.940
with the first busy
slot that shows up.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.180
It's this slot in this example.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.229
And extends until just
before the first idle slot

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.550
that we observe.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.509
So in this example,
the busy period

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.539
extends for four time steps.

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.860
What is the length of
the first busy period?

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.200
Well, the length of
the first busy period

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.320
is a random variable.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.680
So what we mean by
this question is,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.820
what is the distribution
of this random variable?

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.210
Here's how we go about it.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.950
The process starts, we wait
until a first busy slot

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.390
appears.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.630
This is a random time, which
is actually the first arrival

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.880
time.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.710
And at that time, by
our earlier discussion,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.590
the process will start fresh.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.690
Starting from this next the
slot here and going on forward,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.320
what we have is a
Bernoulli process.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.810
And at each slot, there's
probability p that it is busy,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.610
and probability 1 minus
p that it is idle.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.570
Now, what is this slot here?

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.360
This is the first idle slot
in this Bernoulli process

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.990
that starts fresh at
this particular time.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.790
At each time step there
is probability 1 minus p

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.120
that the slot is idle.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.440
Think now of idle
slots as successes.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.860
How long does it take
until the first success?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.690
We know that this is a geometric
random variable with parameter

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.170
equal to the
probability of success.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.079
Since we're thinking of the
idle slot as being a success,

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.160
the parameter, in this case,
is going to be 1 minus p.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.370
So, the length of
this blue interval

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.790
that starts at this
slot and extends

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.790
until the first idle slot
has a geometric distribution

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.130
with parameter 1 minus p.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.900
But now notice that the
length of this blue interval

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.680
is exactly the same as the
length of this red interval.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.460
The red interval is just the
same as the blue interval,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.410
but shifted by 1, but
their lengths are the same.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.460
And the length of
the red interval

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.030
is the length of the
first busy period.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.040
So we conclude that the
first busy period is also

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.100
a geometric random variable
with parameter 1 minus p.
