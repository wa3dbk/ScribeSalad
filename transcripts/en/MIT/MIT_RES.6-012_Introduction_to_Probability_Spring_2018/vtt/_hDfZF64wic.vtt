00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.390
In this lecture
sequence, we introduced

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.700
quite a few new
concepts and went

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.090
through a fair
number of examples.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.930
So for this reason,
it is useful now

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.860
to just take stock and summarize
the key ideas and concepts.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.650
The starting point in a
Bayesian inference problem

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.580
is the following.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.510
There's an unknown
parameter, Theta,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.050
and we're given a
prior distribution

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.510
for that parameter.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.690
We're also given a model
for the observations, X,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.240
in terms of a
distribution that depends

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.140
on the unknown parameter, Theta.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.610
The inference problem
is as follows.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.590
We will be given the value
of the random variable X.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.690
And then we want to find
the posterior distribution

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.060
of Theta, that is, given this
particular value of X, what

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.420
is the conditional
distribution of Theta?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.210
In the case where
Theta is discrete,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.060
this will be in terms of a PMF.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.630
If Theta is continuous,
this would be a PDF.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.550
We find the posterior
distribution

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.760
by using an appropriate
version of the Bayes rule.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.010
And here we have four different
combinations or four choices,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.460
depending on which variables
are discrete or continuous.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.780
This is a complete solution
to the Bayesian inference

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.610
problem-- a posterior
distribution.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.640
But if we want to come up with
a single guess of what Theta is,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.860
then we use a
so-called estimator.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.289
What an estimator does is that
it calculates a certain value

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.830
as a function of
the observed data.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.380
So g describes the way that
the data are processed.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.110
Because X is random,
the estimator

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.710
itself will be a
random variable.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.979
But once we obtain a specific
value of our random variable

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.860
and we apply this
particular estimator,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.490
then we get the realized
value of the estimator.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.740
So we apply g now
to the lowercase x,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.940
and this gives us an estimate,
which is actually a number.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.200
We have seen two particular
ways of constructing

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.210
estimates or estimators.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.038
One of them is the maximum a
posteriori probability rule

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:17.210
in which we choose an estimate
that maximizes the posterior

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.520
distribution.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.590
So in the case where
Theta is discrete,

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.500
this finds the value
of theta, which

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.280
is the most likely one
given our observation.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.560
And similarly, in
the continuous case,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.360
it finds a value
of theta at which

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.460
the conditional PDF of
Theta would be largest.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.000
Another estimator
is the one that we

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.140
call the LMS or least mean
squares estimator, which

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.390
calculates the
conditional expectation

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.880
of the unknown parameter,
given the observations

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.160
that we have obtained.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.150
Finally, we may be
interested in evaluating

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.110
the performance of
a given estimator.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.260
For hypotheses-testing
problems we're

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.910
interested in the
probability of error.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.820
And we have the conditional
probability of error.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.730
Given the data that
I have just observed

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.420
and given that I'm using
a specific estimator,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.560
what is the probability
that I make a mistake?

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.800
And then there's the overall
evaluation of the estimator--

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.720
how well does it
do on the average

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.710
before I know what
X is going to be?

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.200
And this is just the
probability that I

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.250
will be making an
incorrect decision.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.250
For estimation problems,
on the other hand,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.800
we're interested in the
distance between our estimates

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.829
from the true value of Theta.

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.780
And this leads us to the
following conditional mean

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.270
squared error, given
that we have already

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.740
obtained an observation.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.400
And we come up
with an estimator.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.890
In particular, the value of
the estimator at this time

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.230
would be completely determined
by the data that we obtained.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.460
But Theta, the unknown
parameter remains random.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.790
And there's going to be
a certain squared error.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.270
We find the
conditional expectation

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.130
of this squared error in this
particular situation, where

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.910
we have obtained a specific
value of the random variable,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.930
capital X. On the
other hand, if we're

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.390
looking at the estimator
more generally,

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.990
how well it does on
the average, then

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.640
we look at the unconditional
mean squared error,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.540
and this gives us an overall
performance evaluation.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.020
How do we calculate these
performance measures?

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.670
Here, we live in a
conditional universe.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.570
And in a Bayesian estimation
problem at some point

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.050
we do calculate the posterior
distribution of Theta,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.480
given the measurements.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.020
So these calculations
involved here

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.490
consist of just an
integration or summation

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.050
using the conditional
distribution.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.270
For example, here we would
integrate this quantity

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.920
using the conditional
density of Theta,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.250
given the particular value
that we have obtained.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.000
If we want to now calculate
the unconditional performance,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.860
then we would have to
use the total probability

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.625
or expectation theorem.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.880
And in that case, we can average
over all the possible values

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.410
of X to find the overall error.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.560
So all of the calculations
involve tools and equations

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.790
that we have seen and that
we have used in the past,

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.400
so it is just a matter
of connecting those tools

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.900
with the specific new concepts
that we have introduced here.
