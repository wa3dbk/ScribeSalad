00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.480
Let us now look at an example.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.300
Consider a piecewise constant
PDF of the form

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.000
shown in this diagram.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.740
Suppose that we condition on the
event that x lies between

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.130
a plus b over 2, which
is here, and b.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.440
So we're conditioning
on x lying in this

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.950
particular red interval.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.490
What is the conditional PDF?

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.050
The conditional PDF is going
to be 0 outside of the

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.200
interval on which we
are conditioning.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.010
So the conditional PDF is 0 in
this range, and also, it is 0

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.260
in this range.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.420
Within the range of values of
x that are allowed given the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.270
conditioning information, the
conditional PDF must retain

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.590
the same shape as the
unconditional one.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.580
And the unconditional one is
constant in that range.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.880
So the conditional PDF will
also be a constant.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.789
Because in this case the length
of this interval is

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.050
half of the distance
between b minus a--

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.510
so the length of this interval
is b minus a over 2--

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.870
in order for the area under this
curve to be equal to 1,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.370
it means that the height of this
curve has to be equal to

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.750
2 over b minus a.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.789
The conditional expectation in
this example is just the

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.970
ordinary expectation
but applied to

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.470
the conditional model.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.860
Since the conditional PDF is
uniform, the conditional

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.500
expectation will be the midpoint
of the range of this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.970
conditional PDF.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.810
And in this case, the midpoint
is 1/2 the left end of the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.870
interval, which is a plus b over
2 plus 1/2 the right end

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.260
point of the interval,
which is b.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:24.390
And so this evaluates to 1/4
times a plus 3/4 times b.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.079
We can also calculate the
expected value of X squared in

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.860
the conditional model using
the expected value rule.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.400
According to the expected value
rule, it's going to be

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.090
an integral of the conditional
PDF, which is 2 over b minus a

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.650
multiplied by x squared.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.390
And this integral runs over
the range where the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.240
conditional PDF is actually
non-zero.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.880
So it's an integral that
ranges from a plus b

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.950
over 2 up to b.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.920
And this an integral which is
not too hard to evaluate, and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.650
there's no point in carrying out
the evaluation to the end.
