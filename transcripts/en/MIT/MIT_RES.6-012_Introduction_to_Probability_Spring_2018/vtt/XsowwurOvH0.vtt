00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.370
As a warm-up, just to see how to
use steady-state probabilities,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.680
let us look at our
familiar example.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.830
This is a two-state
Markov chain,

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.330
and we did write down the
complete balance equations

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.059
for this chain, and found the
steady-state probabilities

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.320
before.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.160
Notice that we can find these
by using the trick which

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.760
we introduced for birth
and death processes.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.190
You cut the chain
along this line,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.060
and argue that the frequency
of transition of this type

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.820
has to be the same as the
frequency of transition

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.030
of this type.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.340
So if you have pi 1
here and pi 2 here,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.690
what it means is pi 1
times 0.5, which represent

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.090
the frequency of these
kind of transitions,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.910
has to be equal
to pi 2 times 0.2,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.760
which is this kind of
transition, plus pi 1

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.940
plus pi 2, the
normalization equation.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.770
And by solving the
system of equations,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.190
you obtain the same thing
as what we obtained before,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.940
which is the steady-state
probabilities of state 1

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.680
and of state 2.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.470
Let us now try to calculate
some related quantities.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.230
Suppose that you
start at state 1,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.039
and you want to calculate
this particular probability.

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.610
So you start at
state 1, and you want

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.770
to know what is the
probability that next time you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.750
will be in state 1, and 100
times step later, you are still

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.344
in state 1.

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:34.759
Now, the conditional
probabilities

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.470
of two things happening is
the conditional probability

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.820
of the first one
happening, x1 equals

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.820
1, given x0 equals 1, and given
that the first one happens,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.990
the probability that the second
one happened-- x100 equals 1,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.440
given x1 equals 1,
and x0 equals 1.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.520
So what is this?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.090
This first one is the transition
probability from state 1

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.270
to state 1, p 1 1.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.350
How about the
second probability?

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.169
Because of the Markov property,
that information is irrelevant,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:16.340
and so that probability
is r 1 1 in 99 steps.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.730
Now, 99 is possibly
a big number,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.300
and so we approximate
this quantity,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.590
and we are going to use the
steady-state probability

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.310
of state 1 for doing that.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.440
And that gives us an
approximation, p 1 1,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.530
times pi of 1, which, then,
is 0.5 times 2 over 7.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.660
Now, how about this expression?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.530
Given that you start
in state 1, what

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.850
is the probability that at
time step 100, you are in 1,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.960
and time step 101 you are in 2.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.570
By doing the same
technique gives

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.560
the conditional probability
of the first thing happening,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.450
and then, given that
thing happening,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.450
the probability that
the second one happen.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.360
x101 equals 2, given x100
equals 1, and x0 equals 1.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.260
And again, here what we
have is r 1 1 of 100,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.120
and times-- again,
the Markov property

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.829
tells us that we can
forget about this one--

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.070
and this is the probability
transition from 1 to 2, pi 1 2.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.010
And again, here, if n
equals 100 is large enough,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.510
we can approximate that
by pi 1 times p 1 2.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.410
And this, then, 2 over
7 times 0.5 again.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.150
Finally, let's calculate
this third expression, where,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.390
again, we start at state
1, and now we are asking,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.370
what is probability that after
time step 100, you are in 1,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.720
and 100 steps later,
you are again in 1?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.230
We use the same trick as
before, this probability

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.074
that the first thing
happened, and given that,

00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:10.865
the probability of the
second one happened.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.170
Again, this is r 1 1
of 100, and this one,

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.970
for the same reason as before,
we can forget this term.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:38.304
From 100 to 200, you have
100 time steps, r 1 1 of 100.

00:04:38.304 --> 00:04:39.845
And 100 is big
enough, so we're going

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:43.590
to approximate both
by the same values,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.420
and we get pi 1 square,
which is 2 over 7 square.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.690
Now, in this calculation,
we assume that n equals 99,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.430
or n equals 100 were
big enough-- big

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.040
enough so that the
limit has taken effect.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.970
But how do we know that
our approximation is good?

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.030
In other words, is n equals
99 or 100 large enough?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.000
Well, this has something
to do with the mixing time

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.320
scale of our Markov chain,
and by mixing time scale,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.040
I mean, how long does it
take for the initial states

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.490
to be forgotten?

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.539
So how can you see that here?

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.080
Well, you can first
try a simulation.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.900
So using any of your
favorite software, simulate.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.800
If you calculate, and you
look at, as a function of n,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.980
and you draw r 1 1 of n,
at n equals 0, this is 1.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.316
n equals 1, then you
have 5, et cetera.

00:05:54.316 --> 00:05:59.070
At 1, this is going to be
p 1 1, and p 1 1 was 0.5,

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.920
so already it's here.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.660
So initially it was here, here.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.620
And 2 over 7, so this is 0.5.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.650
2 over 7 is here.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.140
And what we know is that
when n goes to infinity,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.570
these things goes to 2 over 7.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.870
And if you simulate, you will
see that it goes very fast.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.140
So with you, I'm
just joining points,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.170
and we will see that
n equals 5 already.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.670
You are very, very
close to 2 over 7.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.990
So you have really an
exponential decrease here.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.570
In fact, if you look at
the simulation result,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.170
and you look at n
equals 5 already,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.690
here you have two
correct decimal already.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:56.090
And for n equals 10, it's
correct up to five decimals.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.840
Or, if you do not want to
have simulation, but simply

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.504
think in terms of order
of magnitude-- so here

00:07:06.504 --> 00:07:07.920
it would be another
approach would

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.600
be order of magnitude
type of argument--

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.180
and in order to do
that, starting here,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.490
on average, how many trials,
or how many time steps

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.130
would it take in order for you
to observe such a transition

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.690
here?

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.640
Well, you use the
geometric, random variable,

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.620
and this is the amount
of time, on average,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.850
until you have success.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.980
And it is 1 over the
probability here,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.220
so it takes an average two time
steps to go from here to here.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.020
And to go from here to
here, it takes, on average,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.000
1 over 0.2, which is
about five time steps.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.150
So as an order of
magnitude, given

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.750
you started here in state
1, after, on average,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.700
about 10 iterations, there
will be some randomness.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.350
There is a high
likelihood, on average,

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.290
that you will go
there and come here.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.250
And then if you do
n equals 100, which

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.730
is 10 times that, in terms
of order of magnitude,

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.810
it looks like n is large enough.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.630
So that would be a back to
the envelope calculation.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.060
Now, this kind of calculation
is useful in general, not just

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.680
here.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.830
So for example,
let's do it again.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.240
Assume that instead of 0.5 here,
the probability that you had

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.450
was 0.999.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:31.460
And maybe here, instead
of 0.8, it was 0.998.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.400
Now, in order to observe
such a transition,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.760
it will take, on average,
since this number here

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.140
would become 0.001,
it would take,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.080
on average, about
1,000 time steps

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.720
in order to observe
one such transition.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.010
So if you look at time
steps of that order,

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.980
it will not be enough if
your chain were of this type.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.840
After n equals
100, the likelihood

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.160
would be that you
will still be here,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.180
so the initial state, or
the initial condition,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.820
would matter still.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.920
So you would take about
1,000 to get there,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.240
and then here it
would have 0.002.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.920
That means that, on
average, from here you

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.510
would take about 500
iterations before you observe

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.780
that for the first time, so
the same order of magnitude.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.560
So in order to get
enough randomness here,

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.960
a good rule would be to
multiply this 1,000 by 10.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.420
So maybe with n
equals 10,000, you

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.000
would feel confident enough,
in that specific case,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.290
in order to use this
kind of approximation

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.240
that we have used here.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.930
And finally, for
those interested,

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.330
you can study that by theory.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.660
And here there is
an entire field

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.220
that try to study how fast
a Markov chain converges

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.220
to steady state, and the
so-called mixing time.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.420
And it turns out that
for these Markov chain,

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.360
you can say that the
convergence, or the rate

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.770
of convergence,
is of the order c

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:05.940
at the power n, where c is a
number that is between 0 and 1.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.070
And the closer c is to 1, the
slower the convergence is.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:15.320
And the closer c is to 0, the
faster the convergence is.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.920
And for example, here,
for our initial case,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.780
the c was 0.3, so that
was the first case

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.490
for the second chain.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.980
With these kind of
probabilities, 0.99 and 0.998,

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.850
the c would be 0.997.
