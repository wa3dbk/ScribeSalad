00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.510
The definition of
the Poisson process

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.270
gives us information
about the probability

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.480
that we get k arrivals during
an interval of length delta

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.570
when delta is a
very small number.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.760
How can we find the
probability of k arrivals

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.590
during an interval of
some general length tau,

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.630
where tau is no
longer a small number?

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.700
In particular, we're interested
in the random variable denoted

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.350
N sub tau, which stands
for the number of arrivals

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.660
during an interval
of length tau.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.940
And we wish to find the PMF
of this random variable,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.230
the probability that N
sub tau is equal to k,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.190
and which is what we
have been denoting

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.250
by this particular notation
in the context of the Poisson

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.360
process.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.910
Now if, instead of
the Poisson model,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.250
we had for the
Bernoulli process model,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.830
we would know the answer.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.860
S, the number of successes, or
number of arrivals in n slots,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.780
has a PMF which is given
by the binomial formula.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.900
Can we somehow use what we know
about the Bernoulli process

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.150
to find the answer for
the Poisson process?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.430
The answer is yes, and it
involves a limiting argument

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.160
of the following kind.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.670
We take the interval
from 0 to t and divide it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.230
into a very large number of
intervals, so many of them,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.740
where each one of the intervals
has a length of delta,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.180
where delta is a small number.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.560
And to push the analogy
with the Bernoulli process,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.100
we will be calling those
little intervals as slots.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.960
Now during each slot, we may
get zero arrivals, one arrival,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.110
but there's also the
possibility that there

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.979
may be two arrivals, or
even more than two arrivals,

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.400
happening during
one of the slots.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.060
Because of this, the
picture that we have here

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.850
is not quite the same as
for the Bernoulli process

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.360
because in the Bernoulli
process, each one of the slots

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.350
will get only 0 or 1.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.840
So the source of the discrepancy
between the two models

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.220
is that here, a slot may
obtain two or more arrivals.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.250
But how likely is this?

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.110
Let us look at the probability
that some slot, that

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.070
is, any one of the slots,
contains two or more arrivals.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.770
That is, we're dealing with
the union of the events

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.445
that slot i has two
or more arrivals.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.250
This event is the
union of these events

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.810
and, therefore, the probability
of this event is less than

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.870
or equal than the sum
of the probabilities

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.829
of the constituents events.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.030
This is an inequality
that we have

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.730
seen at some point in the past.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.872
And we're calling it
to the union bound.

00:02:54.872 --> 00:02:57.350
Now what is this summation?

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.800
i ranges over the
different slots.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.100
And we have tau
over delta slots,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.260
so there's so many terms
that are being summed.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.100
Now, during any particular
slot, the probability

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.520
of two or more arrivals is of
order delta squared, according

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.880
to the definition of
the Poisson process.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.800
And this quantity
converges to 0 when

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.240
we let delta become
smaller and smaller.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.230
So this means that the
discrepancy between the Poisson

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.030
and the Bernoulli model, which
was due to the possibility

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.910
that we might get two or
more arrivals during one

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.120
of those slots, this
discrepancy is something

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.380
that happens with
negligible probability.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.610
In other words, the
probability that we

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:53.270
get k arrivals in
the Poisson model

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.540
is approximately the
same as the probability

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.620
that k slots have an arrival.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.820
Since we're neglecting
the possibility

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.860
that some slot has
two or more arrivals,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.959
this means that the number of
arrivals in the Poisson model

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.330
will be the same as the number
of slots that get an arrival.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.750
This approximate equality
becomes more and more exact

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.930
as we let delta go to zero.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.510
But now what is this quantity?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.100
The probability that k
slots have an arrival

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.140
is something that
we can calculate

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.750
using the binomial
probabilities.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.370
Each one of the slots
has a certain probability

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.290
of having an arrival.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.030
And different slots are
independent of each other

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.659
by the defining properties
of the Poisson process.

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.700
Therefore, this approximation
that we have developed

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.360
satisfies the properties
of the Bernoulli process.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.440
We have a certain probability
that each slot gets an arrival.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.180
And we have independence
across slots.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.540
This means that we can
use now the PMF that's

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.110
associated with
the Bernoulli model

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.180
to calculate this quantity
and then take the limit,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.020
as delta goes to 0, to
obtain a formula for the PMF

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.800
for the Poisson process.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.800
In more detail, what
we have is the number

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.040
of arrivals, which
is approximately

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.970
the same as the number of slots
that have an arrival, obeys

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.430
a binomial distribution
in the limit as delta

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.850
goes to 0-- a binomial
distribution in which

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.210
the probability of arrival
during each one of the slots

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.900
is approximately lambda
delta and the number of slots

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.480
goes to infinity.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.705
And this happens in a way so
that the product of the two,

00:05:57.705 --> 00:06:01.660
n times p, is equal
to-- this term times

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.770
this term gives us
a lambda times tau.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.120
This term times
this term gives us

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.250
something that's order of delta.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.130
So it's negligible.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.560
So we have this
equality, and so this

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.210
is approximately lambda
tau with the approximation

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.310
becoming more and more exact
as we let delta go to zero.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.130
So all we need to do is to take
the formula for the Bernoulli

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.280
process.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.510
Use these values of p
and n and take the limit.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.659
But this is a problem that
we have already encountered

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.230
and have analyzed.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.810
If we let n go to
infinity, p goes to 0

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.030
so that their product
stays constant,

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.040
we have shown that the
binomial PMF converges

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.710
to the so-called Poisson
PMF that takes this form.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.960
Notice one small
difference-- n times

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.450
p here is equal to lambda,
whereas here, n times

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.780
p is equal to lambda t.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.240
This means that we need
to apply this formula,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.210
but with lambda
replaced by lambda t,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.090
and this gives us
the final answer.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.320
This is the probability of k
arrivals during a time interval

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.060
of lenght t in the
Poisson process.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:22.410
And this is a so-called Poisson
PMF with parameter lambda tau.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.780
To summarize, our strategy
was to argue that the Poisson

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.870
process is increasingly
accurately described

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.860
by a Bernoulli process
if we discretize

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.740
time in a very fine
discretization.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.350
And the approximation
becomes exact in the limit

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.840
when the discretization
is very fine.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.040
So we took the corresponding
binomial formula

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.980
for the Bernoulli process
and took the limit

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.290
to that's associated
with the parameters

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.580
that we would obtain if we have
a very fine discretization.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.567
And this gave us
the final formula.
