00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.590
In the discrete case, we saw
that we could recover the PMF

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.370
of X and the PMF of Y
from the joint PMF.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.580
Indeed, the joint PMF is
supposed to contain a complete

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.740
probabilistic description of
the two random variables.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.070
It is their probability law, and
any quantity of interest

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.280
can be computed if we
know the joint.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.120
Things are similar in the
continuous setting.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.730
You can easily guess
the formula through

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.900
the standard recipe.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.550
Replace sums by integrals,
and replace PMFs by PDFs.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.230
But a proof of this formula
is actually instructive.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.550
So let us start by first
finding the CDF of X.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.640
The CDF of X is, by definition,
the probability

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.470
that the random variable X takes
a value less than or

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.120
equal to a certain
number little x.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.540
And this is the probability of
a particular set that we can

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.450
visualize on the two
dimensional plane.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.510
If here is the value of little
x, then we're talking about

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.020
the set of all pairs x, y, for
which the x component is less

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.530
than or equal to a
certain number.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.220
So we need to integrate over
this two-dimensional set the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.700
joint density.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.640
So it will be a double integral
of the joint density

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.940
over this particular
two-dimensional set.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.509
Now, since we've used the
symbol x here to mean

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.700
something specific, let us use
different symbols for the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.280
dummy variables that we will
use in the integration.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.180
And we need to integrate with
respect to the two variables,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.380
let's say with respect to
t and with respect to s.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.320
The variable t can
be anything.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.190
So it ranges from minus
infinity to infinity.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.720
But the variable s, the first
argument, ranges from minus

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.670
infinity up to this
point, which is x.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.530
Think of this double integral as
an integral with respect to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.380
the variable s of this
complicated function inside

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.900
the brackets.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.130
Now, to find the density of
X, all we need to do is to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:45.450
differentiate the CDF of X. And
when we have an integral

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.220
of this kind and we
differentiate with respect to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.560
the upper limit of the
integration, what we are left

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.630
with is the integrand.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.020
That is this expression here.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.550
It is an integral with respect
to the second variable.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.910
And it's an integral over the
entire space, from minus

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.765
infinity to plus infinity.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.360
Here is an example.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.060
The simplest kind of a joint
PDF is a PDF of that is

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:26.670
constant on a certain set, S,
and is 0 outside that set.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.020
So the overall probability, one
unit of probability, is

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.010
spread uniformly
over that set.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.680
Because the total volume under
the joint PDF must be equal to

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.790
1, the height of the PDF must
be equal to 1 over the area.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.690
To calculate the probability of
a certain set A, we want to

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.700
ask how much volume is sitting
on top of that set.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.310
And because in this case, the
PDF is constant, we need to

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.060
take the height of the PDF
times the relevant area.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.760
What is the relevant area?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.570
Well, actually, the PDF is 0
outside the set S. So the

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.510
relevant area is only this
part here, which is the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.050
intersection of the
two sets, S and A.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.810
So the total volume sitting on
top of this little set is

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.860
going to be the base, the area
of the base, which is the area

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.159
of A intersection S times
the height of the

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.170
PDF at those places.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.020
Now, the height of the PDF is 1
over the area of S. So this

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.510
is the formula for calculating
the probability of a certain

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:57.590
set, A.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.530
Let's now look at a
specific example.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.050
Suppose that we have a uniform
PDF over this particular set,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.500
S. This set has an area
that is equal to 4.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.500
It consists of four units
rectangles arranged next to

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.470
each other.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.490
So the height of the joint
PDF in this example

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.140
is going to be 1/4.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.790
It is one 1/4 on that set, but
of course, it's going to be 0

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.910
outside that set.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.460
We can now find the marginal
PDF at some particular x.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.490
So we can fix a particular
value of x,

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.060
let's say this one.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.070
To find the value of the
marginal PDF, we need to

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.550
integrate over y along
that particular line.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.380
And the integral is going to
have a contribution only on

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.900
that segment.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.320
On that segment, the value
of the joint PDF is 1/4.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.600
And we're integrating over
an interval that

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.650
has a length of one.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.230
So the integral is going
to be equal to 1/4.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.760
But if x is somewhere around
here, as we integrate over

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.640
that line, we integrate the
value of 1/4, the value of the

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.190
PDF, over an interval that
has a length equal to 3.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.780
And so the result turns
out to be 3/4.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.220
There's a similar calculation
for the marginal PDF of y.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.010
For any particular value of
little y, to find the marginal

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:44.460
PDF, we integrate along this
line the joint PDF.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.659
The joint PDF is 0 out here.

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:52.030
It's nonzero only on
that interval.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.690
And on that interval, it
has a value of 1/4.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.909
And the interval has a length of
1, so the integral is going

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:02.190
to end up equal to 1/4.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.250
But if we were to take a line
somewhere here, we integrate

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.460
the value of 1/4 over an
interval of length 2.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.060
And so the result
would be 1/2.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.880
So we have recovered from the
joint PDF the marginal PDF of

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.730
X and also the marginal
PDF of Y.
