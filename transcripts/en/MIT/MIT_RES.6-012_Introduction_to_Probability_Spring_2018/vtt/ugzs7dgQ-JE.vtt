00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.310
As promised, we will now start
developing generalizations of

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.840
the different calculations that
we carried out in the

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.000
context of the radar example.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.920
The first kind of calculation
that we carried out goes under

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.380
the name of the multiplication
rule.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.129
And it goes as follows.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.650
Our starting point is the
definition of conditional

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.950
probabilities.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.470
The conditional probability of
A given another event, B, is

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.720
the probability that both events
have occurred divided

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.590
by the probability of the
conditioning event.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.940
We now take the denominator term
and send it to the other

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.850
side of this equality to obtain
this relation, which we

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.650
can interpret as follows.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.760
The probability that two events
occur is equal to the

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.450
probability that a first event
occurs, event B in this case,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.940
times the conditional
probability that the second

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.360
event, event A, occurs, given
that event B has occurred.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.310
Now, out of the two events, A
and B, we're of course free to

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.320
choose which one we call the
first event and which one we

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.810
call the second event.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.100
So the probability of the two
events happening is also equal

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.840
to an expression of this form,
the probability that A occurs

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.380
times the conditional
probability that B occurs,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.600
given that A has occurred.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.789
We used this formula in the
context of a tree diagram.

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.000
And we used it to calculate the
probability of a leaf of

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.480
this tree by multiplying the
probability of taking this

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.820
branch, the probability that A
occurs, times the conditional

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.400
probability of taking this
branch, the probability that

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.180
event B also occurs given that
event A has occurred.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.810
How do we generalize
this calculation?

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.570
Consider a situation in which
the experiment has an

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.680
additional third stage that has
to do with another event,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.400
C, that may or may not occur.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.020
For example, if we have arrived
here, A and B have

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.110
both occurred.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.080
And then C also occurs, then we
reach this particular leaf

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.199
of the tree.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.220
Or there could be
other scenarios.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.910
For example, it could be the
case that A did not occur.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.510
Then event B occurred, and
finally, event C did not

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.880
occur, in which case we end up
at this particular leaf.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.370
What is the probability of
this scenario happening?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.590
Let us try to do a calculation
similar to the one that we

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.990
used for the case
of two events.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.220
However, we need to deal
here with three events.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.010
What should we do?

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.400
Well, we look at the
intersection of these three

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.890
events and think of it as the
intersection of a composite

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.390
event, A complement intersection
B, then

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.230
intersected with the
event C complement.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.280
Clearly, you can form the
intersection of three events

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.370
by first taking the intersection
of two of them

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.900
and then intersecting
with a third.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.420
After we group things this way,
we're dealing with the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.140
probability of two events
happening, this composite

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.730
event and this ordinary event.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.230
And the probability of two
events happening is equal to

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.630
the probability that the first
event happens, and then the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.070
probability that the second
event happens, given that the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.665
first one has happened.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.310
Can we simplify this
even further?

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.900
Yes.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.780
The first term is
the probability

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.400
of two events happening.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.130
So it can be simplified further
as the probability

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.740
that A complement occurs times
the conditional probability

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.310
that B occurs, given that A
complement has occurred.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.810
And then we carry over
the last term

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.660
exactly the way it is.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.400
The conclusion is that we can
calculate the probability of

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.190
this leaf by multiplying the
probability of the first

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.649
branch times the conditional
probability of the second

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:24.070
branch, given that the first
branch was taken, and then

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.710
finally multiply with the
probability of the third

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.480
branch, which is the probability
that C complement

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.110
occurs, given that A
complement and B

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.250
have already occurred.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.192
In other words, we can calculate
the probability of a

00:04:41.192 --> 00:04:45.800
leaf by just multiplying the
probabilities of the different

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.909
branches involved and where we
use conditional probabilities

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.970
for the intermediate branches.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.490
At this point, you can use your
imagination to see that

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.950
such a formula should also be
valid for the case of more

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.610
than three events.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.950
The probability that a bunch of
events all occur should be

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.180
the probability of the first
event times a number of

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.390
factors, each corresponding
to a branch in a

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.500
tree of this kind.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:25.220
In particular, the probability
that events A1, A2, up to An

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.520
all occur is going to be the
probability that the first

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.880
event occurs times a product of
conditional probabilities

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.380
that the i-th event occurs,
given that all of the previous

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.165
events have already occurred.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.980
And we obtain a term of this
kind for every event, Ai,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:02.860
after the first one, so this
product ranges from 2 up to n.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.730
And this is the most general
version of the multiplication

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.970
rule and allows you to calculate
the probability of

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.590
several events happening by
multiplying probabilities and

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.840
conditional probabilities.
