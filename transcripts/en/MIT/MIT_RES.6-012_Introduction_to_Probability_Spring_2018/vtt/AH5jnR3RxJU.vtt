00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.680
This is a rather theoretical
exercise that has two purposes.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.970
One is to verify that the notion
of convergence in probability

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.730
is quite natural and
that it has properties

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.880
similar to the notion of
convergence of sequences.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.860
And the second purpose is to
get a little bit of practice

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.390
with the formal definition of
convergence in probability.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.150
So what is the statement saying?

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.840
It says that if we have a
sequence of random variables

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.540
that converges to a
certain number, a,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.730
and this basically means
that when n is large,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.450
the distribution is highly
concentrated around a.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.712
And if we have another
sequence of random variables

00:00:42.712 --> 00:00:44.170
that converges to
a certain number,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.460
b, which means that the
probability distribution of Yn

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.390
is heavily
concentrated around b.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.510
In that case, then the
probability distribution

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.370
of the sum of the
two random variables

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.880
is heavily concentrated in
the vicinity of a plus b.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.290
So what are we saying?

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.810
If Xn is very close to
a with high probability

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.370
and Yn is very close to
b with high probability,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.140
then the sum will also
be close to a plus b

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.860
with high probability.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.070
This is the intuitive
content of the statement.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.510
Now we want to
establish this formally.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.860
Before establishing
this statement,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.340
however, it will
be a good practice

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.100
to verify a property
of this type

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.700
for the ordinary convergence
of sequences of numbers, not

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.210
random variables.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.060
So let us do that.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.350
What we want to show is that
if a sequence of numbers, an,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.990
converges to some number a,
and another sequence converges

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.300
to some number b,
we want to show that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.490
in that case, an plus bn
converges to the sum of a plus

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.460
b, and we want to
do this formally.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.960
So let us start with the
definition of convergence.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.440
What does it mean that
an converges to a?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:24.590
It means that if I fix
some positive epsilon,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:36.329
then there exists some
number or some time

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:45.670
such that if we consider
some n bigger than n0,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.850
then an is close
to a in the sense

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.070
that this difference
is less than epsilon.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.800
Now this is true for
any positive epsilon,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.550
so if instead of epsilon,
I take epsilon over 2,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.940
this would also be true.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.090
Eventually, after some time,
we will have the property

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.150
that an minus a is less
than epsilon over 2.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.460
Similarly, if bn
converges to b, then

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:34.630
we will have the property that
there exists some time-- let's

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:42.570
call it n0 prime-- such
that if n is bigger

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.980
than that particular time,
then bn minus b is going

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.880
to be less than epsilon over 2.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.090
So after time n0 and
after time n0 prime,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.790
these two inequalities
will be true.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.710
So if we wait long enough so
that both of these inequalities

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.790
are true, that
is, if n is bigger

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:19.339
than the maximum
of n0 and n0 prime,

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.320
then we will have the following.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:32.170
We will have that an
plus bn minus a minus b

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.870
which, by an
elementary inequality,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:42.750
is less than or equal to
an minus a plus bn minus b.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.420
Where is this
inequality coming from?

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.190
This is a general inequality
about absolute values.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.630
If I give you two numbers,
the absolute value of x plus y

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.560
is always less than or equal to
the sum of the absolute values.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.710
So we're using this
inequality where

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.680
x is an minus a and
y is bn minus b.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.520
So we have this inequality,
but when time is big enough,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.520
an minus a is less
than epsilon over 2.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.420
bn minus b is also less
than epsilon over 2.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.850
And putting everything
together, this is epsilon.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.680
So what have we shown?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.160
That if an converges
to a and bn converges

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.500
to b, so that all
these relations hold,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.460
then if time n is
large enough, then

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.820
the difference between
this number and that number

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.830
is going to be
less than epsilon.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.460
And this is true for
every positive epsilon,

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.560
but that's just the
definition of convergence

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.550
of this quantity
to that quantity.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.010
And this is the proof of
this elementary relation

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.625
about convergence of numbers.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.210
Now let us turn to convergence
of random variables.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.320
We fix some epsilon
that's positive.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.410
In order to show
convergence in probability,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:27.270
we want to look
at this difference

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.090
and look at the probability
that this difference is

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.680
bigger than epsilon
in magnitude.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.590
And we want to show that
this quantity converges to 0.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.470
If it does, then we
will have established

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.030
convergence in probability
because that's just

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.770
the definition.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.640
Now, this is the event that
the sum of the random variables

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.460
is close to a plus
b, and we want

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.860
to use the fact that xn is
close to a and yn is close to b.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.320
So this is the event
that-- let's write it

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.990
in a somewhat different way--
is the probability of the event

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:20.460
that xn minus a
plus yn minus b is

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.220
bigger than epsilon
in magnitude.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.950
Now, for a sum of two
numbers to be bigger

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.570
than epsilon in
magnitude, it has

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.409
to be the case that
either one of them

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:44.430
is larger than epsilon
over 2 or the other number

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.840
is bigger in magnitude
than epsilon over 2.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.670
So if this event happens,
this event must also happen.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.720
This means that this event
is a subset of this event.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.980
This is a smaller one.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.450
If this happens, then
this one happens.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.630
So since it's a
smaller event, it

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.470
means that its
probability is less than

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.560
or equal to the
probability of that event.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.740
Now we use the union bound.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.860
The probability that
something happens

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.180
or something else is
happening is less than

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.683
or equal to the sum of
their probabilities.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:41.110
And now, since Xn converges
to a in probability,

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:47.560
then by definition, we know that
this quantity converges to 0

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.070
as n goes to infinity.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:58.640
Similarly, since Yn converges
to b in probability,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.910
this quantity converges to
0 as n goes to infinity.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.900
This is a sequence of
numbers that converges to 0.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:12.470
This is another sequence of
numbers that converges to 0.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:18.880
Therefore, the sum of these two
sequences also converges to 0.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.290
In essence, here we're applying
what we established earlier

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.260
about convergence of numbers.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.830
If a sequence converges to 0
and another sequence converges

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.780
to 0, then the sum
of these sequences

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.890
also converges to 0
as n goes to infinity.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.440
But this is exactly what
we need to show in order

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.030
to establish convergence in
probability of Xn plus Yn.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.890
We have shown that if I
fix any epsilon, positive,

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.920
no matter how small,
the probability

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.860
that I am more
than epsilon away,

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.080
the probability that Xn plus
Yn is more than epsilon away

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.240
from the supposed
target or the limit,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.210
this probability must go to 0.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.060
And that's exactly what
we established here,

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.680
and this completes
the derivation.
