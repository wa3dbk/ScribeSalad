00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.690
In this sequence of segments,
we review some mathematical

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.770
background that will be
useful at various

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.390
places in this course.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.860
Most of what is covered, with
the exception of the last

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.870
segment, is material that you
may have seen before.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.800
But this could still be an
opportunity to refresh some of

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.130
these concepts.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.860
I should say that
this is intended

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.830
to be just a refresher.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.605
Our coverage is not going to
be complete in any sense.

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:30.630
What we will talk about is
sets, various definitions

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.560
related to sets, and some basic
properties, including De

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.750
Morgan's laws.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.180
We will talk about what a
sequence is and what it means

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.030
for a sequence to converge
to something.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.900
We will talk about
infinite series.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.310
And as an example, we will look
at the geometric series.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.470
Then we will talk about some
subtleties that arise when you

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.520
have sums of terms that are
indexed with multiple indices.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.670
And finally, probably the most
sophisticated part, will be a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.340
discussion of countable versus
uncountable sets.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.640
Countable sets are like
the integers.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.250
Uncountable sets are
like the real line.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.010
And they're fundamentally
different.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.490
And this fundamental difference
reflects itself

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.300
into fundamentally different
probabilistic models--

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.650
models that involve discrete
experiments and outcomes

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.350
versus models that involve
continuous outcomes.
