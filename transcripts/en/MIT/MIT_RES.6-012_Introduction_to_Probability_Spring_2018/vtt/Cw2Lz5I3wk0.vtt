00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.850
The central limit theorem is
absolutely remarkable.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.020
It is a very deep result,
and highly

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.860
nontrivial and non intuitive.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.030
There's no apparent reason why
this random variable here, a

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.200
standardized version of the
sum of random variables,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.070
should have an approximately
normal distribution.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.420
Furthermore, it is very useful,
and one key reason is

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.290
that it is universal.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.259
It doesn't matter what the
distribution of the X's is.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.840
No matter what the distribution
is, still in the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.010
limit, this standardized version
of the sum is going to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.790
behave like a normal
random variable.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.620
And if we wish to apply it to
particular examples or models,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.690
the only thing that we need to
know about the distribution of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.550
the X's are the corresponding
means and variances, as we're

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.200
going to see in multiple
examples.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.990
When we apply it, it turns out
to be very accurate, and it is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.810
also a very nice computational
shortcut.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.300
Even if we knew, in detail, the
distribution of the X's,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.000
in order to calculate the
distribution of Sn, we would

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.230
have to take the distribution
of the X's and convolve it

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.370
with itself n times, something
that can be

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.210
computationally tedious.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.050
Whereas the computations that
are involved, when we use the

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.210
central limit theorem, are
very, very simple, as the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.729
examples that will be coming
up will show to us.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.160
Finally, at the philosophical
level, the central limit

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.620
theorem justifies why models
involving normal random

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.210
variables are very natural.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.630
Whenever you have a phenomenon
or an object that's affected

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.130
by multiple noise sources, and
if these noise sources are

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.300
independent, then the overall
effect of those noise sources

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.330
is going to be well-modeled by a
normal random variable, even

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.800
if the distribution of each one
of these noise sources is

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.630
very different from
being normal.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.290
And this is a reason why, in
many, many applications in

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.340
many different fields, normal
random variables provide very

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.740
useful and accurate models.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.329
Since the central limit theorem
is so useful and

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.210
important, it is worth making
sure that we understand

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.360
exactly what it says and to
make a few comments on its

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.329
mathematical content.

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.020
What it says is the following.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.630
We take the sum of independent
identically distributed random

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.790
variables, we form this
standardized version of the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.880
sum, where we subtracted the
mean and divide by the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.420
standard deviation of the sum,
and then what it tells us is

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.730
that the CDF of this random
variable, Zn, converges to the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.329
normal CDF.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.550
So what we have is a statement
about CDFs.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.370
It does not yet tell us
anything specific

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.200
about PDFs or PMFs.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.670
So for example, if Sn and the
X's are all continuous random

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.300
variable, so Zn is also
continuous, you might wonder

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.320
whether the PDF of Zn converges
to a normal PDF.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.810
It turns out that there are
results of this kind that

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.410
assert convergence of the PDF,
or even PMF, of this random

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.350
variable to a normal
PDF, in some sense.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.110
But these results generally need
a few more mathematical

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.670
assumptions for the results
to be valid.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.720
Nevertheless, when we show
pictures of various examples,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.930
we will do this by showing
pictures of PDFs and PMFs

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.710
because these are easier
to visualize.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.080
Now since the result is so
general and so important, it

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.400
might be worth understanding
to what extent it can be

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.190
generalized to other contexts.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.270
Our main two assumptions are
that the random variables are

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.180
independent and identically
distributed.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.470
Can we remove those
assumptions?

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.630
There are versions of the
central limit theorem that

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.010
apply to the case where the
Xi's are not identically

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.550
distributed.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.410
One just needs to make certain
assumptions on the means and

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.910
to the variances of the Xi's.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.240
Some conditions will
be needed.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.680
Also, the assumption of
independence does not need to

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.570
be literally true.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.482
There are versions of the
central limit theorem that are

00:04:39.482 --> 00:04:43.480
valid when we have just
weak dependence.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.920
That is, nearby X's may be
dependent, but if you compare

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.420
X5 with X of 1 million, then
these two random variables are

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.170
essentially independent.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.460
In those cases, we can still
apply a suitable version of

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.510
the central limit theorem.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.710
And finally, you may
be curious how

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.230
this result is proved.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.970
One way of proving it, which is
the way it was originally

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.270
established a long time ago,
for the special case of

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.080
Bernoulli random variables X,
in which case S is binomial.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.780
The way it was established was
by carrying out algebraic

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.250
manipulations on the
binomial formulas.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.910
But this was a derivation that
would not generalize.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.060
For the general case, the
proof is obtained using

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.990
so-called transform methods,
which is a topic that we're

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.730
not covering, but it
goes as follows.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.415
We consider this function of the
random variable Zn, where

00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:51.150
s is some parameter, and we
show that this expectation

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.620
converges to the corresponding
expectation if you have the

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.440
standard normal Z in
the place of Zn.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.870
And this is true for all s, or
at least for all s in some

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.480
rich enough set.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.310
And then, one appeals to some
deep mathematical results that

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.990
tell you that if this kind of
expectation converges to that

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.750
expectation, then the CDF of Zn
must also converge to the

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.300
CDF of Z. But this is a proof
that involves various steps

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.550
and appeals to some deep results
from other fields of

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.030
mathematics.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.100
And finally, there is
the practical side.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.780
What exactly does it say
and how do we use it?

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.420
Since the CDF of Zn can be
approximated by the CDF of a

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.600
standard normal, this means that
in practice, we can treat

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.880
the random variable Zn just as
if it were a standard normal.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.710
But now, we notice that
Sn is obtained as a

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.040
linear function of Zn.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.170
Namely, the definition of Zn
gives us this formula.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.160
So, Sn is a linear
function of Zn.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.300
If we pretend that Zn is normal,
and since linear

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.530
functions of normal random
variables are normal, this

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.150
means that we will also pretend
that Sn is normal.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.610
So in practice, the way to
carry out calculations is

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.500
often to just pretend that Sn is
normal with the appropriate

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.290
mean and variance.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.010
These are the correct means and
variance of Sn, and that's

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.390
the only information that we
need in order to apply it.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.120
If we know mu and sigma squared,
and using the normal

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.690
approximation, then we have an
approximate distribution for

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.350
Sn, and we can go ahead.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.040
Now in practice, can we use the
central limit theorem when

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.050
n is moderate?

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.300
For example, if n is 30,
can you apply the

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.000
central limit theorem?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.220
This is a relation that's true
in the limit of very large n.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.550
How large should n be?

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.610
It turns out that the central
limit theorem gives us very

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:14.100
good approximations even when n
has moderately small values.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.700
Now, these approximations
sometimes will be better and

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.680
sometimes worse.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.560
It helps if the distribution
of the X's that you're

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.170
starting with has some common
one features with the normal

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.310
distribution.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.700
If the X's are already normal,
then S will be normal and

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.360
there's no approximation
involved.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.000
If the X's are close to normal,
then for fairly small

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.960
values of n, S will be very
well modeled by a normal

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.350
random variable.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.050
Now, what does it mean that the
distribution of the X's

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.960
looks a little bit like
the normal one?

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.750
It helps if the distribution is
symmetric around its mean,

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.910
and it also helps if it is
unimodal, in the sense that it

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.290
has a single peak rather
than multiple peaks.
