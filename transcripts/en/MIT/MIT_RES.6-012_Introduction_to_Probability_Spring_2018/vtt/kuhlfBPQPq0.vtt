00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.590
In this segment, we will discuss
what a sequence is and

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.480
what it means for a sequence
to converge.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.580
So a sequence is nothing but
some collection of elements

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.650
that are coming out of some set,
and that collection of

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.690
elements is indexed by
the natural numbers.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.530
We often use the notation, and
we say that we have a sequence

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.510
ai, or sometimes we use the
notation that we have a

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.830
sequence of this kind to
emphasize the fact that it's a

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.780
sequence and not just
a single number.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.260
And what we mean by this is that
we have i, an index that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.470
runs over the natural numbers,
which is the set of positive

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:57.110
integers, and each ai is
an element of some set.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.460
In many cases, the set is going
to be just the real

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.890
line, in which case we're
dealing with a sequence of

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.099
real numbers.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.030
But it is also possible that
the set over which our

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.000
sequence takes values is
Euclidean space n-dimensional

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.710
space, in which case
we're dealing with

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.230
a sequence of vectors.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.300
But it also could be any
other kind of set.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.410
Now, the definition that
I gave you may

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.950
still be a little vague.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.460
You may wonder how a
mathematician would define

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.170
formally a sequence.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.830
Formally, what a sequence is,
is just a function that, to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.700
any natural number, associates
an element of S. In

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.920
particular, if we evaluate the
function f at some argument i,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.570
this gives us the ith element
of the sequence.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.590
So that's what a sequence is.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.780
Now, about sequences, we
typically care whether a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.500
sequence converges to some
number a, and we often use

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.360
this notation.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.940
But to make it more precise,
you also add

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.630
this notation here.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.520
And we read this as saying
that as i converges to

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.460
infinity, the sequence
ai converges to a

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.360
certain number a.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.380
A more formal mathematical
notation would be the limit as

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.470
i goes to infinity of ai is
equal to a certain number, a.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.370
But what exactly
does this mean?

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.329
What does it mean for a
sequence to converge?

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.550
What is the formal definition?

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.180
It is as follows.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.050
Let us plot the sequence
as a function of i.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.220
So this is the i-axis, and here
we plot entries of ai.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.670
For a sequence to converge to a
certain number a, we need to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.820
the following to happen.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:06.070
If we draw a small band around
that number a, what we want is

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.440
that the elements of the
sequence, as i increases,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.140
eventually get inside
this band and stay

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.020
inside that band forever.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.579
Now, let us turn this into
a more precise statement.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.600
What we mean is the following.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.920
If I give you some positive
number epsilon, and I'm going

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.790
to use that positive number
epsilon to define a band

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.820
around the number a.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.810
So it's this band here.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.150
If I give you a positive number
epsilon, and therefore,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.890
this way, have defined a certain
band, there exists a

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.430
time after which the entries
will get the inside the band.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.390
In this picture, it would
be this time.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.175
So there exists a time--

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.470
let's call that time i0--

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:24.490
so i0 is here such that after
that time, what we have is

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.430
that the element of
the sequence is

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.560
within epsilon of a.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.130
So this is the formal definition
of convergence of a

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.120
sequence to a certain
number a.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.890
The definition may look
formidable and difficult to

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.230
parse, but what it
says in plain

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.980
English is pretty simple.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.150
No matter what kind of band
I take around my limit a,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.570
eventually, the sequence will
be inside this band and will

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.050
stay inside there.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.700
Convergence of sequences has
some very nice properties that

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.400
you're probably familiar with.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.580
For example, if I tell you
that a certain sequence

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.670
converges to a number a and
another sequence converges to

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:17.800
a number b, then we will have
that ai plus bi, which is a

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.650
new sequence--

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.340
the ith element of the sequence
is this sum--

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.010
will converge to a plus b.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.720
Or similarly, ai times bi, which
is another sequence,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.180
converges to a times b.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:41.880
And if, in addition, g is a
continuous function, then g of

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.840
ai will converge to g of a.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.890
So for example, if the ais
converge to a, then the

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.700
sequence ai squared is going
to converge to a squared.
