00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.430
We now want to introduce some
examples of random variables,

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.150
and we will start with
the simplest

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.740
conceivable random variable--

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.830
a random variable that takes
the values of 0 or 1, with

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.640
certain given probabilities.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.490
Such a random variable
is called a

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.570
Bernoulli random variable.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.910
And the distribution of this
random variable is determined

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.410
by this parameter p, which is
a given number that lies in

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.010
the interval between 0 and 1.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.689
Using PMF notation, we have
the probability of 0 being

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.820
equal to 1 minus p and the
probability of taking the

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.320
value 1 equal to p.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.150
If you wish to plot this
particular PMF, the plot is

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.490
rather simple.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.560
It consists of two bars,
one at 0 and one at 1.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.080
This one has a height
of p and this has a

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.640
height of 1 minus p.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.450
Bernoulli random variables show
up whenever you're trying

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.540
to model a situation where
you run a trial.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.620
And that trial can result in
two alternative outcomes,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.850
either success or failure, or
heads versus tails, and so on.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.650
Another situation where
Bernoulli random variables

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.170
show up is when we're making a
connection between events and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.850
random variables.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.230
Here's how this connection
is made.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.230
We have our sample
space, omega.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.990
And within that sample space,
we have a certain event, A.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.090
And outside of the event A, of
course, we have the complement

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.115
of A.

00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:43.979
Our random variable is defined
so that it takes a value of 1,

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.140
whenever the outcome of the
experiment lies in A. And it

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.190
takes a value of 0 whenever the
outcome of the experiment

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.500
lies outside the event A,
so that it lies in the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.140
complement.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.980
This random variable is called
the indicator random variable

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.630
of the event A. It is
equal to 1 if and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.990
only if event A occurs.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.500
And the PMF of that
random variable

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.790
can be found as follows.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.810
This is PMF notation.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.079
This is the equivalent
probabilistic notation.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.290
This is the probability that
the random variable

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.420
takes a value 1.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.850
Now the random variable takes
the value of 1 if and only if

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.030
event A occurs.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.320
And so what we have is that
our random variable, the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.010
indicator random variable, is
a Bernoulli random variable

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.310
with a parameter p equal to the
probability of the event

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.370
of interest.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.050
Indicator random variables are
very useful because they allow

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.710
us to translate a manipulation
of events to a manipulation of

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.780
random variables.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.610
And sometimes the algebra of
working with random variable

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.740
is easier than working with
events, as we will see in some

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.990
later examples.
