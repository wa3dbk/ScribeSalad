00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.160
In this lecture, we develop the
weak law of large numbers.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.060
Loosely speaking, the weak law
of large numbers says that if

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.950
we have a sequence of
independent random variables

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.670
with the same distribution,
then the average of these

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.940
random variables, which is
called the sample mean,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.560
approaches the expected value
of the distribution.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.380
In this sense, it reinforces
our interpretation of the

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.660
expected value as some kind
of overall average.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.550
The weak law of large
numbers is the

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.040
reason why polling works.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.360
By asking many people about the
value of some attribute,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.020
and by taking the average of
the responses, we can get a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.730
good estimate of the average
over the entire population.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.990
On the mathematical side, in
order to derive the weak law

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.160
of large numbers, we will first
need to develop some

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.600
inequalities, namely the
Markov and Chebyshev

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.150
inequalities.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.870
Both of them tell us something
about tail probabilities.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.140
Suppose that a is a number.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.400
Then it is reasonable to expect
that the probability

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.080
that the random variable exceeds
a will be small when a

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.660
is very large.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.320
But how small?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.000
The Markov and Chebyshev
inequalities give us some

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.710
answers to this question, based
only on knowledge of the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.780
mean and the variance
of the distribution.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.200
Finally, we will have to deal
with a technical issue.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.810
The weak law of large numbers
talks about the convergence of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.390
a random variable to a number.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.780
For this to make sense, we need
to define an appropriate

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.740
notion of convergence.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.910
We will introduce one such
notion that goes under the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.050
name of convergence
in probability.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.520
And we will see that in many
respects, it is similar to the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.740
common notion of convergence
of numbers.
