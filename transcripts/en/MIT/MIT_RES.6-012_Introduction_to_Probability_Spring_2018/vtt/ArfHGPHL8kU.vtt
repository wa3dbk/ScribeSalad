00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.940
In this lecture, we
introduce the

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.170
notion of a random variable.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.890
A random variable is, loosely
speaking, a numerical quantity

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.390
whose value is determined by the
outcome of a probabilistic

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.760
experiment.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.640
The weight of a randomly
selected

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.520
student is one example.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.750
After giving a general
definition, we will focus

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.820
exclusively on discrete
random variables.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.840
These are random variables that
take values in finite or

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.660
countably infinite sets.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.830
For example, random variables
that take

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.790
integer values are discrete.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.060
To any discrete random variable
we will associate a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.210
probability mass function, which
tells us the likelihood

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.540
of each possible value of
the random variable.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.360
Then we will go over a few
examples and introduce some

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.200
common types of random
variables.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.680
And finally we will introduce
a new concept- the expected

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.490
value of the random variable,
also called the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.519
expectation or mean.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.460
It is a weighted average of
the values of the random

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.990
variable, weighted according
to their respective

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.140
probabilities, and has an
intuitive interpretation as

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.310
the average value we expect to
see if we repeat the same

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.060
probabilistic experiment
independently a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.870
large number of times.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.700
Expected values play a central
role in probability theory.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.780
We will look into some
of their properties.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.390
And we will also calculate the
expected values of the example

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.090
random variables that we
will have introduced.
