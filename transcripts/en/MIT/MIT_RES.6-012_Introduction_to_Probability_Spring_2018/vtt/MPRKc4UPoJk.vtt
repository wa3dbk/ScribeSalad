00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.150
Conditional probabilities are
probabilities associated with

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.860
a revised model that takes into
account some additional

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.850
information about the outcome of
a probabilistic experiment.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.730
The question is how
to carry out this

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.930
revision of our model.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.390
We will give a mathematical
definition of conditional

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.730
probabilities, but first let us
motivate this definition by

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.480
examining a simple
concrete example.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.660
Consider a probability model
with 12 equally likely

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.180
possible outcomes, and so each
one of them has probability

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.430
equal to 1/12.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.940
We will focus on two particular
events, event A and

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.750
B, two subsets of the
sample space.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.800
Event A has five elements, so
its probability is 5/12, and

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.190
event B has six elements, so
it has probability 6/12.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.800
Suppose now that someone tells
you that event B has occurred,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.980
but tells you nothing more
about the outcome.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.770
How should the model change?

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.450
First, those outcomes that
are outside event B

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.390
are no longer possible.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.190
So we can either eliminate
them, as was done in this

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.220
picture, or we might keep them
in the picture but assign them

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.130
0 probability, so that
they cannot occur.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.570
How about the outcomes
inside the event B?

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.460
So we're told that one of
these has occurred.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.979
Now these 6 outcomes inside
the event B were equally

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.280
likely in the original model,
and there is no reason to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.500
change their relative
probabilities.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.479
So they should remain equally
likely in revised model as

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.530
well, so each one of them should
have now probability

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.710
1/6 since there's 6 of them.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.680
And this is our revised
model, the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.760
conditional probability law.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.740
0 probability to outcomes
outside B, and probability 1/6

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.120
to each one of the outcomes that
is inside the event B.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.790
Let us write now this
down mathematically.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.710
We will use this notation to
describe the conditional

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.280
probability of an event A given
that some other event B

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.500
is known to have occurred.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.540
We read this expression as
probability of A given B. So

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.760
what are these conditional
probabilities in our example?

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.829
So in the new model, where these
outcomes are equally

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.610
likely, we know that event
A can occur in

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.240
two different ways.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.829
Each one of them has
probability 1/6.

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.320
So the probability of
event A is 2/6 which

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.060
is the same as 1/3.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.350
How about event B. Well, B
consists of 6 possible

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.850
outcomes each with
probability 1/6.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.670
So event B in this revised model
should have probability

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.030
equal to 1.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.770
Of course, this is just
saying the obvious.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.150
Given that we already know
that B has occurred, the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.310
probability that B occurs
in this new model

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.920
should be equal to 1.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.010
How about now, if the sample
space does not consist of

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.340
equally likely outcomes, but
instead we're given the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.120
probabilities of different
pieces of the sample space, as

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.210
in this example.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.800
Notice here that the
probabilities are consistent

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.350
with what was used in the
original example.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.329
So this part of A that lies
outside B has probability

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.190
3/12, but in this case I'm
not telling you how that

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.780
probability is made up.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.780
I'm not telling you that
it consists of 3

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.990
equally likely outcomes.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.390
So all I'm telling you is that
the collective probability in

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.070
this region is 3/12.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.820
The total probability of A is,
again, 5/12 as before.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.930
The total probability of
B is 2 plus 4 equals

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.940
6/12, exactly as before.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.440
So it's a sort of similar
situation as before.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.160
How should we revise our
probabilities and create--

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.040
construct--

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.800
conditional probabilities
once we are told

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.430
that event B has occurred?

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.430
First, this relation
should remain true.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.780
Once we are told that B has
occurred, then B is certain to

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.340
occur, so it should
have conditional

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.280
probability equal to 1.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.600
How about the conditional
probability of A given that B

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.760
has occurred?

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.140
Well, we can reason
as follows.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.320
In the original model, and if
we just look inside event B,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.050
those outcomes that make event
A happen had a collective

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.340
probability which was 1/3 of the
total probability assigned

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.230
to B. So out of the overall
probability assigned to B, 1/3

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.210
of that probability corresponds
to outcomes in

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.840
which event A is happening.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.010
So therefore, if I tell you that
B has occurred, I should

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.710
assign probability equal
to 1/3 that event A is

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.159
also going to happen.

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.750
So that, given that B happened,
the conditional

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.440
probability of A given B
should be equal to 1/3.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.290
By now, we should be satisfied
that this approach is a

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.210
reasonable way of constructing
conditional probabilities.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.220
But now let us translate our
reasoning into a formula.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.450
So we wish to come up with a
formula that gives us the

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.890
conditional probability of an
event given another event.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.630
The particular formula that
captures our way of thinking,

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.540
as motivated before,
is the following.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.700
Out of the total probability
assigned to B--

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.290
which is this--

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:32.230
we ask the question, which
fraction of that probability

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:40.650
is assigned to outcomes under
which event A also happens?

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.890
So we are living inside event
B, but within that event, we

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.290
look at those outcomes for which
event A also happens.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.430
So this is the intersection of
A and B. And we ask, out of

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.040
the total probability of B,
what fraction of that

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.460
probability is allocated to that
intersection of A with B?

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.690
So this formula, this
definition, captures our

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.370
intuition of what we did
before to construct

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.530
conditional probabilities in
our particular example.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.510
Let us check that the definition
indeed does what

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.310
it's supposed to do.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.520
In this example, the
probability of the

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.750
intersection was 2/12 and the
total probability of B was

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:33.010
6/12, which gives us 1/3, which
is the answer that we

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:38.170
had gotten intuitively
a little earlier.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.430
At this point, let me also
make a comment that this

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.730
definition of conditional
probabilities makes sense only

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.230
if we do not attempt
to divide by zero.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.280
That this, only if the event B
on which we're conditioning,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.900
has positive probability.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:03.470
If B, if an event B has 0
probability, then conditional

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.350
probabilities given B will
be left undefined.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.440
And one final comment.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.880
This is a definition.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.310
It's not a theorem.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.690
What does that mean?

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.770
It means that there is no
question whether this equality

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.600
is correct or not.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.520
It's just a definition.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.010
There's no issue
of correctness.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:36.909
The earlier argument that we
gave was just a motivation of

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.110
the definition.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.610
We tried to figure out what the
definition should be if we

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.160
want to have a certain intuitive
and meaningful

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.165
interpretation of the
conditional probabilities.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.810
Let us now continue with
a simple example.
