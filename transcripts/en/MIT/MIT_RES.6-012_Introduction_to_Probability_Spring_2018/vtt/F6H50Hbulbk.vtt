00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.090
We now come to a very important
concept, the concept

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.010
of independence of
random variables.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.930
We are already familiar with the
notion of independence of

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.190
two events.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.940
We have the mathematical
definition, and the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.550
interpretation is that
conditional probabilities are

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.170
the same as unconditional
ones.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.770
Intuitively, when you are told
that B occurred, this does not

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.030
change your beliefs about A,
and so the conditional

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.290
probability of A is the same
as the unconditional

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.960
probability.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.000
We have a similar definition
of independence of a random

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.410
variable and an event A. The
mathematical definition is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.610
that event A and the event that
X takes on a specific

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.880
value, that these two events
are independent in the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.140
ordinary sense.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.280
So the probability of both of
these events happening is the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.930
product of their individual
probabilities.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.410
But we require this to be true
for all values of little x.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:13.440
Intuitively, if I tell you that
A occurred, this is not

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.600
going to change the distribution
of the random

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.850
variable x.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.730
This is one interpretation of
what independence means in

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.970
this context.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.570
And this has to be true for all
values of little x, that

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.390
is, when [the]

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.550
event occurs, the probabilities
of any

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.280
particular little x [are]

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.400
going to be the same as the
original unconditional

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.940
probabilities.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.020
We also have a symmetrical
interpretation.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.440
If I tell you the value of
X, then the conditional

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.140
probability of event A is
not going to change.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.860
It's going to be the same as the
unconditional probability.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.260
And again, this is going to be
the case for all values of X.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.780
So, no matter what they tell
you about X, your beliefs

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.820
about A are not going
to change.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.100
We can now move and define the
notion of independence of two

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.060
random variables.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.160
The mathematical definition is
that the event that X takes on

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.180
a value little x and the event
that Y takes on a value little

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.490
y, these two events are
independent, and this is true

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.610
for all possible values of
little x and little y.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.420
In PMF notation, this
relation here can be

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.020
written in this form.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.700
And basically, the joint PMF
factors out as a product of

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.440
the marginal PMFs of the
two random variables.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.890
Again, this relation has to be
true for all possible little x

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.630
and little y.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.990
What does independence mean?

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.880
When I tell you the value of y,
and no matter what value I

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.010
tell you, your beliefs about
X will not change.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.440
So that the conditional PMF of
X given Y is going to be the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.810
same as the unconditional PMF of
X. And this has to be true

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.575
for any values of the arguments
of these PMFs.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.190
There is also a symmetric
interpretation, which is that

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.930
the conditional PMF of Y given
X is going to be the same as

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.250
the unconditional PMF of Y.
We have the symmetric

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.710
interpretation because, as we
can see from this definition,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.230
X and Y have symmetric roles.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.310
Finally, we can define the
notion of independence of

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.880
multiple random variables
by a similar relation.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.020
Here, the definition is for
the case of three random

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.380
variables, but you can imagine
how the definition for any

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.150
finite number of random
variables will go.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.360
Namely, the joint PMF of all
the random variables can be

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.050
expressed as the product of the

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.510
corresponding marginal PMFs.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.380
What is the intuitive
interpretation of

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.270
independence here?

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.320
It means that information
about some of the random

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.900
variables will not change your
beliefs, the probabilities,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.980
about the remaining
random variables.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.600
Any conditional probabilities
and any conditional PMFs will

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.590
be the same as the unconditional
ones.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.530
In the real world, independence
models situations

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.110
where each of the random
variables is generated in a

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.960
decoupled manner, in a separate
probabilistic

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.940
experiment.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.970
And these probabilistic
experiments do not interact

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.500
with each other and have no
common sources of uncertainty.
