00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.850
Let us now take
stock and summarize

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.690
what we have done for these
two processes, the Bernoulli

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.520
and the Poisson process,
and their relation.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.350
The Poisson process
runs in continuous time,

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.070
whereas, for the
Bernoulli process,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.790
time is discrete and
is divided into slots.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.440
The Poisson process is defined
by a single parameter, lambda,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.220
which is the intensity
or arrival rate,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.350
and tells us the expected number
of arrivals per unit time.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.460
For the Bernoulli
process, we have, again,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.520
one basic parameter, which
is the probability of success

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.170
at any given trial,
or the probability

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.790
of an arrival during
each one of the slots.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.950
Based on our model, we were
interested in three kinds

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.470
of quantities.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.810
And we found the
distributions of them.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.620
The first quantity is
the number of arrivals

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.820
during a certain time interval.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.630
For the discrete case,
the number of arrivals

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.730
has a binomial distribution,
whereas for the one Poisson

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.740
case, the distribution is that
of a Poisson random variable.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.880
Then we looked at the time
until the first arrival,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.000
or the time between
consecutive arrivals.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.820
For the Bernoulli process,
that distribution is geometric.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.180
For the Poisson process, that
distribution is exponential.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.630
Note that in this
instance, we're

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.500
dealing with a discrete
random variable,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.060
but, here, with a
continuous random variable.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.970
And then, as a
generalization, we

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.570
could find the time until a kth
arrival, which, in the Poisson

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.090
case, is given by an
Erlang distribution.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.140
And for the Bernoulli
case, we developed

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.500
one particular formula.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.220
And that formula
is actually known

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.420
under the name of the
Pascal distribution.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.060
All of these results,
for the Poisson case,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.530
were obtained because we used
an approximation argument.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.960
That is, we had the results
for the Bernoulli case.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.360
But then we argued that
the Poisson process

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.850
is a limiting case of
the Bernoulli process

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.080
in which we take time, divide
it into a large number of slots,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.870
during each one of
the slots, however,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.560
we have a small
probability of an arrival.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.970
And this is done in a way so
that the product of these two

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.500
numbers stays a constant.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.590
By using a finer and
finer discretization,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.990
we could approach the
Poisson process arbitrarily

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.250
close by a Bernoulli process.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.360
And then we used the
Bernoulli formulas

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.130
in which we took the limit
as delta was going to zero.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.740
And this gave us the result
for the Poisson case.
