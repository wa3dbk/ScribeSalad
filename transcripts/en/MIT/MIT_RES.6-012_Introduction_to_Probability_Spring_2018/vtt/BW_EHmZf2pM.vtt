00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.660
In this video, we
continue our exploration

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.650
of quantities of
interest associated

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.740
with the short-term
behavior of Markov chain.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.060
This time, we suppose that we
have a Markov chain composed

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.700
of a single recurrent
class, such as this one.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.160
Here, we have our
recurrent class.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.830
And these are transient states.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.770
We also assume that
we're interested

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.820
in a specific recurrent
state-- let's say 9.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.170
So this is my state s.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.620
And we will assume that
the Markov chain starts

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.120
from a given initial
state, state i,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.470
and assume that i is 1.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.280
Now the question we ask is,
given that you started in 1,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.070
how long is it going to take
to reach 9 for the first time?

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.840
We know this is a
recurrent class,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.950
so we know that the
Markov chain eventually

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.610
will come to that class
and circulate here.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.950
So you know that the Markov
chain will get to that state 9.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.880
You are interested
in knowing when

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.819
it does so for the first time.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.740
Of course, we don't
know for sure.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.810
This is random.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.420
It is a random variable.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.640
And let's try to calculate
the expected value

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.220
of this random variable.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.230
More precisely, this is
what we would like to do.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.090
We would like to find the
mean first passage time from i

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.080
to s, from any starting state i.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.440
Here, we're going to
illustrate that with 1.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.030
And mathematically, this
is what we have here.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.440
So here again, what you have
is that the Markov chain

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.890
started in state i, at time 0.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.950
And now you are looking
at this set here.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.620
And the set records
all the time n such

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.570
that your Markov chain, Xn,
is in the state s of interest.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.630
So out of this set, you're
looking at the minimum, n,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.030
that verifies that.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.520
So this is going to
be a random variable.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.100
And you take the
expected value of that.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.920
And this is what we call the
mean first passage time from i

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.230
to s.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.040
Again, this is the
expected number of steps

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.200
in order to get from i
to s for the first time.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.830
So how do we go about
calculating such a quantity?

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.590
Well, let us think a little bit.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.700
We are looking at
the event that you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.200
will visit 9 from 1
for the first time.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.930
What happened
after visiting 9 is

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.420
of no relevance in
our calculation.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.510
In other words, our calculation
will never involve this arc

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.200
and will not involve
this arc either.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.079
Because in order
for the Markov chain

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.680
to traverse this
arc or this one,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.980
it would have to visit 9 first.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.740
So what it means is that we
can forget about this arc,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.860
and we can forget about
this arc-- in a sense,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.890
that they don't matter
in the calculation

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.550
of the mean first
passage time to s.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.230
Now, removing
these arcs entirely

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.290
means that you would
have to increase

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.050
the probability of that self
transition from 0.2 to 1.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.500
So what do you get?

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.660
Well, you get this
following graph.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.980
We have removed
these arcs, and we

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.210
have increased the
probability 0.2 here to 1.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.860
And again, we have
argued that calculating

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.420
the mean first passage time
from i to s in this graph

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.270
is the same as doing the
same thing for this graph.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.610
But here, we have a
very special structure.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.030
We have only one recurrent
state left, which is state 9.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.920
And that state is
an absorbing state.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.390
All the other
state-- this one was

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.960
transient, transient, transient.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.280
This one becomes
a transient state.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.490
And this one is also a transient
state in this new transition

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.150
probability diagram.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.630
So we get a situation where
we have one single absorbing

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.750
state, and we are
interested in calculating

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.790
the probability starting from
i to reach that absorbing state

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.140
and also the number
of steps it takes

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.140
to do that, which is what we
did in the previous video.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.030
So let us repeat what
we had seen before.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.010
So this is going to be the
unique solution to this system.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.820
t of s equals 0, of course.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.900
Since you start from
s, you are in s.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.180
And so the amount of time
it takes to get to s is 0.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.390
And otherwise, for all the
other states that are not s,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.100
this is the resulting system
of equation that we have.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.190
And the unique
solution of this system

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.080
gives you the result of finding
the expected amount of time

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.100
to go to the absorbing state s.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.290
So using this
simple trick, we've

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.960
been able to use the
previous calculation

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.610
to calculate something else.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.380
Let us consider a
related question, which

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.490
we called the mean
recurrence time of s.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.220
Here, let's go back
to the original graph.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.480
And this is our state s.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.440
And now the question
is the following--

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.210
given that you are in s,
what is the amount of time

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.540
it will take for
the Markov chain

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.080
to return to s for
the first time?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.740
So for this question, the
Markov chain is currently in 9.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.320
And you ask yourself,
how long is it

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.620
going to take, once you
leave 9, to return to 9?

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.730
Here again, we
don't know for sure.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.000
It's a random variable.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.810
And we are interested
in the expectation

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.900
of that random variable--
in other words,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.100
in the expected number of
steps it takes in order

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.310
to get back to 9
once you are in 9.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.380
And this is what we mean by
the mean recurrence time of s.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.780
And mathematically,
this is what it is.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.650
It is almost the same formula
as the one that you had here,

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.750
except that here you
have n greater than/equal

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.960
to 1 as opposed to n
greater than/equal to 0.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.130
It simply means that you're not
interested in the first time

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.560
that you're in s,
because you start from s.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.590
So you want to have n
greater than or equal to 1. n

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.600
equals 0 would not work.
ts star would have been 0.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.540
So how would you
solve that problem?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.750
Well, here again, you use the
same trick that we used before.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.990
And think in terms of tree.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.440
Let's look at the
Markov chain in state 9.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.940
What can happen next?

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:32.034
From 9, it can go to
3 or it can go to 5.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.740
Or it can jump on itself.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.710
So this is with a
probability 0.2.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.130
This is with a probability 0.2.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.820
And this is with a
probability of 0.6.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.640
And now, after you
make one transmission--

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.680
so let's-- you are in 3 now--
what is the time to get to 9?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.600
Well, it's exactly
t3-- where the t

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.930
is, the solution here
of that previous system.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.170
What about from 5?

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.890
t5.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.560
And what about from 9?

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.470
Well, t9.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.120
And t9 was 0.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.310
So from that tree,
what you have is

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:33.330
t9 star will be 0.2 times t3
plus 0.6 times t5 plus 0.2

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.420
times t9 plus, of
course, 1, because you

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.640
have done one transition.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:46.380
Where, again, this value of
t3, t5, and t9 are the ones

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.030
corresponding to
this solution here.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.990
So of course, t9 is 0.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.040
So what we have shown
here, that in general,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.380
this is actually
what you would have.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.850
And this is exactly what
we have written here.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:09.100
ts star is 1 plus the summation
of psj of t of j, where t of j

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.900
is the solution to this system.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.750
So again, you started from 9.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.140
You have to do a
transition first.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.640
You can do a transition
unto yourself.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.190
You can go to 3 or
you can go to 6.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.520
After that transition,
which stands for the number

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.180
1 here, what happens
is you're trying

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.560
to find the solution
to this system, which

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.419
is the mean first passage time,
from the current state where

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.990
you are, to 9.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.340
And then when you put
these two things together,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.209
you get the mean
recurrence time of 9.
