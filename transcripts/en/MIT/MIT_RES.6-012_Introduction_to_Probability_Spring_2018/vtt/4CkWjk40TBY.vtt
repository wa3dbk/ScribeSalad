00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.610
Let's now go through
another example,

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.770
which will be a little
more challenging.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.040
We're going to revisit
an old problem.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.535
We have a coin that has
an unknown bias, Theta.

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:15.700
And we have a prior
distribution on this Theta.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.960
We fix some positive
integer, n, we flip a coin

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.750
n times, that has
this unknown bias.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.180
And we record the
number of heads.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.090
On the basis of the number of
heads that have been observed,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.850
we wish to estimate the
bias, Theta, of the coin.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.360
To make things more
concrete, we're

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.080
going to assume a prior
distribution on Theta that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.120
is uniform on the unit interval.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.500
Now, this is a problem we
have considered before.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.800
We have calculated the expected
value of Theta given X.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.310
And we did find that
the expected value takes

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.920
this particular form.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.800
Now, notice that this is
a linear function of X.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.180
And if it turns out the
least mean squares estimator

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.010
is a linear function
of X, then we're

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.580
guaranteed, since
this is the best,

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.020
that this is also the
best within the class

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.620
of linear estimators.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.120
So we immediately
have the conclusion

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.220
that the linear
least mean squares

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.900
estimator is this
particular function of X.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.350
So there's not much left to do.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.700
On the other hand,
just for practice,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.030
let us derive this answer
directly from the formulas

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.330
that we have for the linear
least mean squares estimator,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.910
and see whether we're going
to get the same answer.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.930
So we want to use this formula.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.259
And in order to apply this
formula, all that we have to do

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.979
is to calculate these expected
values, this variance,

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.110
and this covariance.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.539
So now let's move on to this
particular calculational

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.030
exercise.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.190
Let's start by
writing down what we

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.759
know about the random variables
involved in this problem.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.180
About Theta, we know
that it is uniform.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.470
And so it has a mean of
1/2 and a variance of 1/12.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.460
About X, what we know
is the following.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.760
If you fix the bias of
the coin, then the number

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.400
of heads you're going
to obtain in n flips

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.670
has a binomial distribution,
with parameters n and Theta.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.740
But of course, Theta itself
is a random variable.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.220
So for this reason, this is
a conditional distribution.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.440
But within the
conditional universe,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.460
we know the mean and the
variance of a binomial,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.079
and they are as follows.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.000
The mean of a binomial is n
times the bias of the coin.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.910
But because we're talking
about the conditional universe,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.960
this is a conditional
expectation.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.010
And it's a random
variable, because it's

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.350
affected by the value of
the random variable Theta.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.180
And similarly, for
the variance, it's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.880
the usual formula for the
variance of a binomial,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.780
except that now the bias
itself is a random variable.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.250
So now let's continue with the
calculation of the quantities

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.060
that we need for the
formula for our estimator.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.120
Let's start with the
expected value of X.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.050
Since we know the
conditional expectation of X,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.460
we can use the law of
iterated expectations.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.650
The unconditional expectation
is the expected value

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.200
of the conditional expectation,
which is n times Theta.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.480
And since the mean of Theta
is 1/2, we obtain n/2.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.250
Let us now continue with the
calculation of the variance.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.720
There are different ways
that we can calculate it.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.850
One could be the law
of total variance.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.620
But we will take the
alternative approach,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.010
which is to use the general
formula for the variance,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.140
that the variance is
equal to the expected

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.740
value of the square
of a random variable,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.900
minus the square of
the expected value.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.970
We know the expected value of X.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.870
So all that's left
is to calculate

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.540
the expected value of X squared.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.480
How are we going calculate it?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.110
Well, we know the conditional
distribution of X.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.800
So it should be
easy to calculate

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.820
the conditional
expectation of X squared

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.190
in the conditional
universe, and then

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.120
use the law of
iterated expectations

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.460
to obtain the
unconditional expectation.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.740
So now, we need to calculate
this conditional expectation

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.330
here.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.230
How do we do it?

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.780
The expected value of a
square of a random variable

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.370
is always equal to the variance
of that random variable

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.800
plus the square of
the expected value.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.530
We're going to
use this property,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.340
but we're going to use it
in the conditional universe.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.580
So in the conditional
universe, this

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.900
is going to be equal
to the variance,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.670
in the conditional universe,
which is n times Theta times 1

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:04.020
minus Theta, plus the square
of the expected value of X,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.300
but the expected value in the
conditional universe, which

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.050
is this quantity--
n times Theta.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.210
So we obtain another term--
n squared, Theta squared.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.330
So now we can go back to
our previous calculation,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.430
and right here,
the expected value

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.690
of this expression,
which is n times Theta.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.930
And then we have some
Theta squared terms.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.570
One is n squared.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.159
The other is a minus n.

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:46.880
So we obtain plus n squared
minus n Theta squared.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.409
The expected value
of n times Theta

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.700
is n times the expected
value of Theta, which is 1/2.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.715
So we obtain a factor of n/2.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.270
But then we have this
additional term here.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.120
We need the expected
value of Theta squared.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.180
What is it?

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.760
Well, since we know the mean
and the variance of Theta,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.470
we can calculate the expected
value of Theta squared.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:26.410
It is equal to the variance
plus the square of the mean.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.630
And this evaluates to 1/3.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.880
So from here, we're
going to obtain

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:41.540
plus n squared minus
n divided by 3.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.450
And you can rewrite this
term in a different way

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:52.380
by collecting first the
n terms, n/2 minus n/3.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.815
This gives us n/6.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.540
And then there's
the n squared term,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.170
which is n squared over 3.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.590
Now that we found the
expected value of X squared,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.260
we can go back to
this calculation.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:17.850
We have n/6 plus
n squared over 3

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.970
minus the square of the
expected value of X,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.600
which is this expression here.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.480
So we obtain minus
n squared over 4.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.130
1/3 minus 1/4-- that makes 1/12.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:42.170
So we obtain n/6 plus
n squared over 12.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:49.270
Or another way of writing this
is n times n plus 2 over 12.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.840
And this completes
the calculation

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.470
of the variance of X.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.290
The last quantity that's
left for us to calculate

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.080
is the covariance
of Theta with X.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.640
We're going to calculate it
using the alternative formula

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.320
for the covariance, which is
the expectation of the product

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.206
minus the product
of the expectations.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.300
We have the expectations,
but we do not

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.540
have the expectation
of the product.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.950
So we need to calculate it.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.160
Once more, it's going
to be the same trick.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.800
We're going to
condition on Theta,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.070
and then use the law of
iterated expectations.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.350
So the law of
iterated expectations,

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.789
when you condition on
Theta, takes this form.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.230
And to continue
here, we need to find

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.220
this conditional
expectation in the inside.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.030
This conditional
expectation-- what is it?

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.630
If I give you Theta,
then you know Theta.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.470
It is becoming now a constant.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.410
There's nothing
random to it, so it

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.600
can be pulled outside
the expectation.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.780
And we obtain Theta times the
conditional expectation of X.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.740
We know what the conditional
expectation of X is.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.070
It's n times Theta.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.330
So from here, we obtain overall,
a term n times Theta squared.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.940
So now we can go back here.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.780
We have the expected value.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.890
And the term in the
inside-- we just found it.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.390
It's n times Theta squared.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.750
And since the expected
value of Theta squared

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.695
is 1/3, from here,
we obtain n/3.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.040
And now we can go back,
finally, to the calculation

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.330
of the covariance.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:43.160
It's going to be n/3, minus
the expected value of Theta,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.350
which is 1/2, times the expected
value of X, which is n/2.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.310
So it's minus n over four.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.330
And this evaluates to n/12.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.240
So we have succeeded in
calculating all the quantities

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.830
that are needed in the
formula for the linear least

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.045
mean squares estimator.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.540
We can now take those values
that we have just found

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.620
and substitute them
into this formula.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.650
And after a little bit of
algebra and moving terms

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.820
around, everything simplifies
to this expression.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.670
Just to verify that
this makes sense,

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.122
what is the
coefficient next to X?

00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:30.820
It's the covariance
divided by the variance.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.320
n/12 divided by
this expression--

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.050
this n cancels that n.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.410
This 12 cancels that 12.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.460
We're left with an n plus
2 in the denominator.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.520
And indeed, the coefficient
that multiplies X

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.960
is the term n plus 2
in the denominator.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.280
And you can similarly verify
that the constant term as well

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.870
is the correct one.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.400
So of course, this answer is
what we had found in the past

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.160
to be the optimal,
the least mean squares

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.310
estimator of X. As we discussed
earlier, when this is linear

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.970
in X, it has to be the same as
the linear least mean squares

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.050
estimator.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.530
So this answer is
not a surprise,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.930
but it was an interesting
and perhaps useful

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.440
exercise to go through the
details of this calculation

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.030
to see what it
takes to figure out

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.360
the different terms
in this formula.
