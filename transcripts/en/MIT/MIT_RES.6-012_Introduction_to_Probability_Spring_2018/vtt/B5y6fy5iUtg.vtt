00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.740
Suppose I look at the registry
of residents of my town and

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.950
pick a person at random.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.860
What is the probability
that this person is

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.260
under 18 years of age?

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.620
The answer is about 25%.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.880
Suppose now that I tell you that
this person is married.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.990
Will you give the same answer?

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.220
Of course not.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.040
The probability of being
less than 18 years

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.120
old is now much smaller.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.830
What happened here?

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.680
We started with some initial
probabilities that reflect

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.780
what we know or believe
about the world.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.320
But we then acquired
some additional

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.140
knowledge, some new evidence--

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.160
for example, about this person's
family situation.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.030
This new knowledge should cause
our beliefs to change,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.430
and the original probabilities
must be replaced with new

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.320
probabilities that take into
account the new information.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.430
These revised probabilities are
what we call conditional

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.660
probabilities.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.060
And this is the subject
of this lecture.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.420
We will start with a formal
definition of conditional

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.289
probabilities together with
the motivation behind this

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.050
particular definition.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.515
We will then proceed to develop
three tools that rely

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:17.410
on conditional probabilities,
including the Bayes rule,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.900
which provides a systematic
way for incorporating new

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.050
evidence into a probability
model.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.450
The three tools that we
introduce in this lecture

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.250
involve very simple and
elementary mathematical

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.270
formulas, yet they encapsulate
some very powerful ideas.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.140
It is not an exaggeration to
say that much of this class

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.539
will revolve around the repeated
application of

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.690
variations of these three
tools to increasingly

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.759
complicated situations.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.080
In particular, the Bayes rule
is the foundation for the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.560
field of inference.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.039
It is a guide on how to
process data and make

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.950
inferences about unobserved
quantities or phenomena.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.580
As such, it is a tool that is
used all the time, all over

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.830
science and engineering.
