00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.820
We now set out to study
the Poisson process, which

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.195
is a continuous time version
of the Bernoulli process.

00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:10.230
In the Bernoulli process,
time is divided into slots.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.730
And during each
one of the slots,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.610
we may either have an
arrival or no arrival.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.030
In the Poisson process,
time is continuous.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.950
And we may get
arrivals at any time.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.790
We want to define
the Poisson process

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.980
by introducing some assumptions
that in some ways parallel

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.320
the assumptions that we made
for the Bernoulli process.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.180
What where those assumptions?

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.280
The first one we made was the
assumption of independence--

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.310
namely that what happens
in different slots

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.890
are independent.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.890
Similarly, for the
Poisson process,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.880
we will make the following
independence assumption.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.825
If we consider two intervals,
two time intervals that

00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:51.790
are disjoint, and look at
the random variable that

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.260
stands for the
number of arrivals

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.410
during this interval
and that interval,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.590
we will assume that these
two random variables

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.010
are independent.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.520
But even more than
that, if we take

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.030
any collection of
disjoint time intervals,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.955
and we look at the
associated random variables,

00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:10.440
the associated
numbers of arrivals,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.600
that collection
will also consist

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.270
of independent random variables.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.350
The second assumption for
the Bernoulli processes

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.860
was one of time homogeneity,
namely at each slot,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.050
we had the same
probability of an arrival.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.440
We want to make a similar
assumption for the Poisson

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.240
process, and it's going
to be the following.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.000
The probability that
we have k arrivals

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.930
during an interval of
a certain duration tau

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.420
is going to be the
same no matter where

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.130
that interval sits.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.350
So if this is an interval
that has a certain duration,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.960
and this is an interval
that has the same duration,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.020
the probability of three
arrivals in this interval

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.539
is going to be the same as
the probability of three

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.759
arrivals in that interval.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.200
And therefore, since
this probability does not

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.380
depend on where
the interval sits,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.090
that probability
will be fully defined

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.510
by the number of arrivals
that we're interested in

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.420
and the length of
the interval as

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.650
opposed to the location
of the interval.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.520
So we will be using
this notation here

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.240
to indicate this probability.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.710
In this notation, we think
of tau as a constant.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.640
And then, P of k corresponds
to probabilities.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.530
In particular, if
you add over all k's

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.630
the various probabilities,
what you should get

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.800
would be a value
of 1, because this

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.500
exhausts all the possibilities.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.500
And k here ranges
from 0 to infinity,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.829
because we allow an arbitrarily
large number of arrivals

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.370
during a given time interval.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.190
Now, with this
assumption in place,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.110
it would still be
possible to have

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.310
arrivals that happen
simultaneously,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.620
multiple arrivals at
the same time point.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.550
In order to avoid
this situation,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.990
we introduce one more assumption
which is the following.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.590
It talks about the
number of arrivals

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.950
during a time interval that
has a small length delta.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.440
During a small time
interval, there

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.170
is negligible probability of
having more than one arrival.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.680
We will either have
one or zero arrivals.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.210
And the probability
of one arrival

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.790
is a certain number,
lambda times delta.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.540
It's proportional to delta.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.690
So if the interval becomes
smaller and smaller,

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.250
that probability also goes to 0.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.400
But it goes to 0 at a rate
proportional to delta.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.980
So you can think of lambda
as probability per unit time.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.730
These are the units of lambda.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.680
Now here, I'm writing
an approximate equality.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.810
What does that mean?

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.720
It means that these are
not exact expressions.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.620
But they are exact within
a second order term.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.550
And a second order
term is a term

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.980
that's negligible compared
to the first order term

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.860
when delta is small.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.470
More precisely,
mathematically, what we mean

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.890
is that a second order term
compared to a first order term

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.800
goes to 0 as delta goes to 0.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.150
Finally, let me
reiterate that lambda

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.590
should be interpreted
as an arrival rate.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.960
It is a probability
per unit time.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.815
The bigger lambda is, the
bigger the probability

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:43.520
is that we get an arrival
during a small time interval.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.560
If we double lambda, then
we double the probability

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.090
that we have an arrival
during a small time interval.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.040
And so we expect to have about
twice as many arrivals, hence

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.550
the interpretation
as an arrival rate.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.880
We will see shortly that
this is also justified

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.030
because lambda shows up in
expressions for the expected

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.480
number of arrivals
during a time interval.
