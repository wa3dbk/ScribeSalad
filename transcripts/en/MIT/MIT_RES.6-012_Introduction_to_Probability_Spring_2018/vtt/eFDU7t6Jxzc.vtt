00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.750
Let us now consider an
application of what we have

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.010
done so far.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.770
Let X be a normal random
variable with

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.120
given mean and variance.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.000
This means that the PDF of X
takes the familiar form.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.170
We consider random variable Y,
which is a linear function of

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.290
X. And to avoid trivialities,
we assume that a is

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.150
different than zero.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.030
We will just use the
formula that we

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.320
have already developed.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.110
So we have that the density of
Y is equal to 1 over the

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.820
absolute value of a.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:46.730
And then we have the density of
X, but evaluated at x equal

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.250
to this expression.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.290
So this expression will
go in the place

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.520
of x in this formula.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.590
And we have y minus b over a
minus mu squared divided by 2

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.210
sigma squared.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.220
And now we collect these
constant terms here.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.430
And then in the exponent, we
multiply by a squared the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.125
numerator and the denominator,
which gives us this form here.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.280
We recognize that this is
again, a normal PDF.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.800
It's a function of y.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.060
We have a random variable
Y. This is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.210
the mean of the normal.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.060
And this is the variance
of that normal.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.820
So the conclusion is that the
random variable Y is normal

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.650
with mean equal to
b plus a mu.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.050
And with variance a squared,
sigma squared.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.340
The fact that this is the mean
and this is the variance of Y

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.130
is not surprising.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.980
This is how means and variances
behave when you form

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.240
linear functions.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.470
The interesting part is that
the random variable Y is

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.410
actually normal.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.190
Intuitively, what happened here
is that we started with a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.829
normal bell shaped curve.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.280
A bell shaped PDF for X. We
scale it vertically and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.360
horizontally, and then shift
it horizontally by b.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.420
As we do these operations, the
PDF still remains bell shaped.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.760
And so the final PDF is again
a bell shaped normal PDF.
