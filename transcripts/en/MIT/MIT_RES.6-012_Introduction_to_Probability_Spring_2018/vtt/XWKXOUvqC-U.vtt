00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.380
We will now study
what happens when

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.520
we merge independent
Poisson processes.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.920
The story as well as
the final conclusion

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.750
is going to be similar to
what happened for the case

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.720
where we merged independent
Bernoulli processes.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.880
In particular, we will see that
the merged process will also

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.310
be Poisson.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.100
What is the story?

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.690
Suppose that you
have two light bulbs.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.830
One of them is red and
flashes at random times that

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.920
are described according
to a Poisson process

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.260
with a certain rate, lambda1.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.960
The other light bulb is green,
flashes also as a Poisson

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.040
process with a certain rate.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.700
Furthermore, we assume
that the two light bulbs

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.410
are independent of each other.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.600
If you're color blind so that
the only thing that you see

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.540
is flashes but without being
able to tell the color,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.740
what kind of process
are you going to see?

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.530
Well, you will see a
Poisson process also,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.140
and at this point,
you can probably

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.410
guess what the
arrival rate is going

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.239
to be for this Poisson process.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.790
It should be the sum
of these two arrival

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.950
rates of the processes
that you started with.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.120
So this will be our
final conclusion,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.880
but we want to verify
that this is indeed

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.789
the correct conclusion.

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.000
So let us look at the
situation in some more detail.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.130
We have the two processes, two
arrival processes-- the red one

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.200
and the green one--
and the merged process

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.080
is formed by recording an
arrival at any time where

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.970
either of the two
processes that you

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.990
started with records an arrival.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.530
Let us now look at
the time interval

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.180
and think about the number of
arrivals in the merged process

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.220
during this time interval.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.850
What is that the number?

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.870
That number is equal to
the number of arrivals

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.060
that you have in the
first process plus

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.590
the number of arrivals that
you have in the second process.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.260
Let's call those numbers N1 and
N2 so that what we have here

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.960
is N1 plus N2.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.880
Now, N1 is a Poisson
random variable

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.930
because this is a
Poisson process.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.380
Similarly, N2 is a
Poisson random variable.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.270
We assume that these two
processes are independent.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.800
Therefore, N1 plus N2 is the
sum of independent Poisson

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.010
random variables, and
therefore, N1 plus N2

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.190
is also a Poisson
random variable.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.380
This is reassuring.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.960
It's a good piece of evidence
that the blue process

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.400
is a Poisson process,
but this is not enough.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.280
To argue that it is
a Poisson process,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.030
we need to check the defining
properties of a Poisson

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.220
process.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.430
One defining property is
the independence property.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.950
If we take disjoint intervals,
the number of arrivals

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.810
here is independent, or
should be independent,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.240
from the number
of arrivals there.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.700
The argument here is exactly the
same as for the Bernoulli case,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.970
so we will not go
through it in any detail.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.980
We just notice that whatever
happens during that time

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.270
has to do with whatever happens
during those times in the two

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.260
processes that we started with.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.900
And similarly, what
happens in these times

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.530
has to do with what happens
in these two processes

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.930
during those times.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.890
Because for each one of the two
processes that we start with,

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.560
we have the Poisson assumption
so that this interval

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.480
is independent from that
interval in the sense

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.610
that arrivals here and
arrivals there are independent.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.880
So because of this, whatever
happens during those

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.790
times has nothing
to do with whatever

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.340
happens in those times,
so number of arrivals

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.480
here is independent from the
number of arrivals there.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.340
The other property
that we need to check

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.530
is that the probability
of recording an arrival

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.880
during a small time
interval of length delta,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.800
that this probability
has the right scaling

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.560
properties, that it
is linear in delta,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.630
in the length of this interval,
and that the probability of two

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.700
or more arrivals
here is negligible.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.370
To see what happens during a
typical interval in the merged

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.040
process, we need
to consider what

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.160
is going to happen during
that typical interval

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.050
in the other two
processes and consider

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.520
all the possible combinations.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.370
During a little
interval, the red process

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.530
is going to have zero arrivals
with this probability,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.380
one arrival with
this probability,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.290
and two or more arrivals
with this probability, which

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.650
is negligible.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.159
Actually here, we're ignoring
terms of order delta squared.

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.920
These are the
correct expressions

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.180
if we only focus on terms that
are either constants or linear

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.000
in delta.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.290
We are ignoring terms
that are of order delta

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.900
square or higher.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.760
And similarly for
the green process,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.510
we have these probabilities
for the number of arrivals

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.570
that may happen during
a small interval.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.750
For the merged process, we will
have zero arrivals if and only

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.180
if we have zero arrivals
in the red process

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.190
and zero arrivals in
the green process.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.570
The probability of these
two events happening,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.760
because we assume that the two
processes that we started with

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.250
are independent, is
going to be the product

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.130
of the probabilities of zero
arrivals in one process times

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.480
zero arrivals in
the other process.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.550
We multiply those two
terms, and if we throw away

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.500
the term delta squared,
which is negligible,

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.570
we see that this event is going
to happen with probability 1

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.170
minus lambda1 plus
lambda2 times delta.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.180
What's the probability
that we get one arrival?

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.310
This is an event that
can happen in two ways.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.910
We could have one arrival
in the red process

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.060
and zero arrivals in
the green process,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.340
and this combination happens
with this probability.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.040
Alternatively, we could have
one arrival in the green process

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.573
and zero arrivals
in the red process.

00:06:18.573 --> 00:06:23.000
This is this event and it
happens with this probability.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.600
Having one arrival
in the blue process

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.060
can happen either
this way or that way,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.990
so the probability
of one arrival

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.860
will be the sum of
these two probabilities.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.800
And if we throw
away terms that are

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.670
order of delta squared,
what we're left with

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:47.220
is just lambda1 plus
lambda2 times delta.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.570
Finally, there's the possibility
that the blue process

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.820
is going to have two
or more arrivals.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.720
This happens if we have one
red and one green arrival,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.710
which happens with
this probability,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.470
or if anyone of the processes
has two or more arrivals, which

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.170
would be terms here, here, and
these would be the scenarios.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.470
But we notice that each
one of these scenarios

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.090
has probability that's
order of delta squared.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.130
This term also has probability
of order delta squared,

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.870
so overall, the possibility
that the blue process has

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.750
two or more arrivals-- this is
something that has probability

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.530
that's of order delta squared.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.310
So during a typical
small interval,

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.150
there is probability
proportional

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.250
to the length of the interval
of having one arrival,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.590
and lambda1 plus lambda2 is the
factor of this proportionality,

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.855
and the remaining probability
is assigned to the event

00:07:54.855 --> 00:07:56.770
that there are zero arrivals.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.810
There's essentially
negligible probability

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.820
of having two or more
arrivals, but this

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.070
together with the
independence assumption

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.440
is exactly what comes in the
definition of a Poisson process

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.230
with an arrival rate
equal to this number.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.080
And so we have established
that the merged process

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.540
is a Poisson process
whose rate is

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.040
the sum of the rates of the
processes that we started from.
