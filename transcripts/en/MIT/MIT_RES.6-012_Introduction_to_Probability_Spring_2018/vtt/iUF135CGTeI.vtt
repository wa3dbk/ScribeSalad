00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.640
In this video, let us look at
a second quantity of interest

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.210
that has to do with
absorbing states.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.910
Now that we know
how to calculate

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.140
the probability of getting
to a given absorbing state,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.110
we would like to know how long
it would take to get to it.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.120
Let us first deal
with that question

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.950
when we have only
one absorbing state.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.900
Let us consider the
following Markov chain, which

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.870
is a little simpler
than the one that we

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.370
had in the previous video.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.740
We have transient states.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.850
One, two, and three
are transient states.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.780
And we have one
recurrent state, four.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.930
And that recurrent state
four is an absorbing state,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.630
because once you get to
it you stay there forever.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.720
So in this simple example, the
absorption probability to four

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.420
is trivially one.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.170
No matter where you start,
with probability one

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.460
you're guaranteed that
eventually you will reach four.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.990
But the question of
interest is to know

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.590
how long would it
take to get to four.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.710
In other words, how
many transitions

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.460
would you have to do
until you reach four?

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.200
Of course we don't know.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.250
It is a random variable.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.900
In fact, it's more than
one random variable.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.320
It would depend probably
on where you started.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.410
Starting from two,
one, or three, or four,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.020
would lead to different
random variables.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.270
We are going to be
interested in looking

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.330
at their expectation,
or the expected value

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.970
of these random variables.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.050
More precisely, let us define
exactly what we want to do,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.990
which is to find the expected
number of transitions--

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.210
that we're going to
call him Mu of i--

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.450
until reaching four, which
is our absorbing state,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.170
given that the initial state
is i, one of these four states.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.970
First as a warm up, let's
do some quick calculation.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.509
If you didn't have this
part here, and instead

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.140
we were looking just
at this portion here.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.750
Make this one
disappear like this,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.960
and replace it by a
loop of probability 0.8.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.170
So now if you start from state
two, with probability 0.2

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.820
you will go to four,
or with probability 0.8

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.880
you will remain in two.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.940
And now you ask yourself,
what is the number

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.540
of trials you have to
do until you reach four?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.400
Well we know what it is.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.780
This is a geometric
random variable

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.400
with the probability
of success, which

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.430
is a success being
going to four, of 0.2.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.050
So the expected number of
trials, starting from two,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.040
that you will have to go
through until you reach four,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.790
will be 1 over this probability.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:55.090
So 1/0.2, which is 5.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.770
Now that we have done
this quick calculation,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.090
it should be clear that if we
go back to the previous Markov

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.070
chain that we had here,
the expected time, Mu 2,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.050
would probably be bigger than 5.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.380
Since from two, not only
you have the probability

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.070
of going to four,
but you might have

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.800
some chance of traveling there.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.890
So probably the number of
times until you reach four

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.840
would be bigger than 5.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.530
Let's see.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.912
Well, first of all, if you
start at four, the expected

00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:26.620
number of transitions
until reaching four

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.140
would obviously be zero.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.070
So here, for i equals
4, you indeed get zero.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.510
What about for the others?

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.650
Well again, this is what
we would like to calculate.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.270
How are we going to do that?

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.040
Well, the argument
is going to be

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.880
of the same nature as the
one that we used before.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.160
We are going to think
in terms of tree,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.980
and consider possible options
starting from a given state.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.160
So let's do this
calculation from two.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.150
So you are in two, and we're
going to build that tree here.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.920
So you are in state two.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.990
What could happen next?

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.580
Well, you can either
transition to four

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.390
with the probability 0.2.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.510
Or with probability
0.8, you end up in one.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.770
And you have done
one transition here.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.140
So plus one transition.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.120
So you are interested
in calculating Mu 2.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.750
After one transition you either
end up in four, in that case

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.712
you stop, you're done.

00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:28.090
In other words the
resulting value

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.470
here would be Mu 4,
which we know is 0.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.330
Or you are in one.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.409
And now, given that
you are in one,

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:41.030
you want to find the expected
number of transitions

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.909
until reaching four, which
is exactly defined here.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.570
So here what you have is Mu 1.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.000
And now you can use the
total expectation theorem

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.270
to put all of these
things together.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.700
What it means is
that Mu 2 will be 1,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.360
and you have one transition.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.540
And then after you do that
transition with probability

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.070
0.2, you know that you're
going to be in four.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.470
And the expected
value then will be

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.440
Mu 4 plus 0.8, which
is the probability that

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.470
end up in state one.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.990
And conditional on that, the
remaining expected iterations

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.610
until reaching
four will be Mu 1.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.330
Now this one is of course
0, so what you end up with

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.340
is 1 plus 0.8 Mu 1.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.065
So you get a relation
between Mu 2 and Mu 1.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.800
Now you can do the same
thing if you start from one

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.260
or start from three.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.880
So let's do it again from one.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.100
So you're interested in one.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.740
After one transition, so
plus one, what happened?

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.680
Well, with the probability
0.6, you end up in two.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.260
And with the probability
0.4, you end up in three.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.610
And from three, if you
start in state three,

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.890
after one transition
what happened?

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:19.620
Well, with the probability 0.5
you would end up in state one.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.210
And then the expected number
of transitions from state one

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.540
until reaching
four will be Mu 1.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:33.110
Or with probability
0.5, you end up in two.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.030
So again here, if you
look at these three here,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.030
this is a system
of three equations,

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.190
three linear equations
with three unknowns.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.170
It has a unique solution.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.690
I will let you do
the calculation,

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.080
let me give you the result.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:55.177
What you obtain is
Mu 1 will be 110/8.

00:06:55.177 --> 00:06:56.760
And the reason I'm
writing it this way

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.620
is so that we can compare them.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:05.030
Mu 2 will be 96/8, which is 12.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.876
And Mu 3 is 111/8.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.500
So here again, a
quick sanity check,

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.670
the number that we get here, 12,
is indeed bigger than the five

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.810
that we have obtained when
we restricted ourselves

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.240
to this set.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.540
So we do have Mu
2 greater than 5.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.530
Now as the relative value
between Mu 1, Mu 2, and Mu 3,

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.630
it sort of makes sense.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.430
Mu 2, the state two, is
the one closest to four,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.540
it is the one actually
linked to four.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.460
So in some sense,
the expected number

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.090
of transitions to
reach four will always

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.909
be the smallest one, because
starting from the other states,

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:51.310
you will have to go to
two before going to four.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.630
And in general, if you
have a general Markov chain

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.270
with transient states
and one absorbing state,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.630
and you're asking yourself,
what is the expected time

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.750
to absorption to that
unique absorbing state,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.310
it will be the unique solution
from the system of equations

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.570
given here.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.230
Where the pij are the transition
probabilities of your Markov

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.530
chain.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.320
Now we have seen how to
solve this problem when

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.020
we have one unique
absorbing state.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.370
What happens if you have more
than one absorbing state?

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.680
Like for example, in this case.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.940
Well, first of
all, a quick note.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.140
You realize here that you have
one, two, and three, three

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.490
transition states.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.469
And indeed here, you have
four as an absorbing state,

00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:43.740
it's a recurrent state,
and once you get to it

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.700
you stay there forever.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.500
And five is also a recurrent
state, and once you get to five

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.100
you stay there forever.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.710
So four and five are
both absorbing states.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.010
And in a previous
video, we had seen

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.420
how to calculate the probability
of ending up in four,

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.520
as opposed to ending up in five.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.060
What we know is that the
probability of ending up

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.880
in four plus the probability
of ending up in five will be 1.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.940
But since the probability of
ending up in four is not 1,

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.050
trying to find the
expected number of steps

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.410
until you reach
four specifically

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.330
does not make much sense.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.290
That expectation of that random
variable is a random variable,

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.160
but that expectation
will be infinity.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.130
Why?

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.590
Because there is a
positive probability

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.980
that you will end up in five.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.930
And if you end up in
five, once you get there,

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.560
the number of steps to go
to four will be infinity.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.520
So it makes more sense
to think about what

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.830
is the expected time
to any absorbing state.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.205
So to either four or five.

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:49.280
Now If you're interested
in that quantity,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.730
one trick in order to solve
that problem using the technique

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:57.920
that we have seen so far, is to
combine four and five into one

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.780
mega state, call
it whatever, six.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.280
Right?

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.530
And six is a combination
of four and five.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.320
It's a big absorbing state.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.710
And once you're in
six, you stay in six.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.240
And now you just have
to define exactly what

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.970
is the probability of
transition from one, two,

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.450
and three, to that mega state.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.160
Well here from two, you
had, originally, two arcs.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.610
You're going to combine
these two into one arc,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.530
and you're going to sum
these probabilities.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.130
So you had 0.3 and 0.2.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.130
You put in here 0.5.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:41.470
And on this arc you had only one
arc, so you maintain that arc.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.390
And you have that
probability that you had,

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.930
which I believe was 0.2.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.710
Now you go back, if you
look at the situation now,

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.940
it's very close to the
one that we have here.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.500
All right?

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.400
See this four that you
have here is the six.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.604
Now of course, you have
another arc here like that,

00:11:01.604 --> 00:11:02.270
but that's fine.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:07.070
You can stay add the arc
here and put it as 0.2.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.720
And then you reduce
this one to 0.3

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.270
to make it square with here.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.610
But the idea on how to solve
that is identical to this one.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.570
You would have to change
a little bit of this,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.800
but this is the same technique.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.420
So in the end, we
have seen a technique

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.320
to find the expected time
to absorptions whenever

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.574
you have absorbing states
in a given Markov chain.
