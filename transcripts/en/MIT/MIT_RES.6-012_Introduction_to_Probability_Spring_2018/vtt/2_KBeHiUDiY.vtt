00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.990
We now move to a new topic--

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.500
conditioning.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.610
Every probabilistic concept or
probabilistic fact has a

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.080
conditional counterpart.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.960
As we have seen before, we can
start with a probabilistic

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.380
model and some initial
probabilities.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.170
But then if we are told that
the certain event has

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.620
occurred, we can revise our
model and consider conditional

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.560
probabilities that take into
account the available

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.310
information.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.430
But as a consequence, the
probabilities associated with

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.530
any given random variable will
also have to be revised.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.930
So a PMF will have to be changed
to a conditional PMF.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.050
Let us see what is involved.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.450
Consider a random variable X
with some given PMF, whose

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.420
values, of course, sum
to 1, as must be true

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.330
for any valid PMF.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.650
We are then told that a certain

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.450
event, A, has occurred.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.130
In that case, the event
that X is equal to--

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.880
little x--

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.380
will now have a conditional
probability of this form.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.700
We will use this notation here
to denote the conditional

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.920
probability that the random
variable takes the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.560
value little x.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.710
Notice that the subscripts are
used to indicate what we're

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.880
talking about.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.900
In this case, we are talking
about the random variable X in

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.420
a model where event A is
known to have occurred.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.860
Of course, for this conditional
probability to be

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.950
well defined, we will have to
assume that the probability of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.295
A is positive.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.190
This conditional PMF is like an
ordinary PMF, except that

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.880
it applies to a new or revised
conditional model.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.200
As such, its entries
must also sum to 1.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.630
Now the random variable X has
a certain mean, expected

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.180
value, which is defined
the usual way.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.930
In the conditional model, the
random variable X will also

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.220
have a mean.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.340
It is called the conditional
mean or the conditional

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.700
expectation.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.980
And it is defined the same way
as in the original case,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.079
except that now the calculation
involves the

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.770
conditional probabilities,
or the conditional PMF.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.860
Finally, as we discussed some
time ago, a conditional

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.300
probability model is just
another probability model,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.860
except that it applies
to a new situation.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.250
So any fact about probability
models--

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.470
any theorem that we derive--

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.060
must remain true in the
conditional model as well.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.380
As an example, the expected
value rule will have to remain

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.530
true in the conditional model,
except that, of course, in the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.450
conditional model, we will have
to use the conditional

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.380
probabilities instead of the
original probabilities.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.860
So to summarize, conditional
models and conditional PMFs

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.910
are just like ordinary models
and ordinary PMFs, except that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.610
probabilities are replaced
throughout by conditional

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.410
probabilities.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.930
Let us now look at an example.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.630
Consider a random variable,
which in this case, is

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.510
uniform, takes values
from 1 up to 4.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.070
So each one of the possible
values has

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.930
probability 1 over 4.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.700
For this random variable, we
can calculate the expected

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.100
value, which by symmetry is
going to be the midpoint.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.690
So it is equal to 2 and 1/2.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.380
We can also calculate
the variance.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.870
And here we can apply
the formula that we

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.350
have derived earlier--

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.940
1/2 times b minus a times
b minus a plus 2.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.150
And in this case, it's 1 over 12
times b minus a is 4 minus

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.980
1, which is 3.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.750
And the next term is 5.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.970
And after we simplify,
this is 5 over 4.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.110
Suppose that now somebody tells
us that event A has

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.270
occurred, where event A is that
the random variable X

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.610
takes values in the
range 2, 3, 4.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.730
What happens now?

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.930
What is the conditional PMF?

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.960
In the conditional model, we are
told that the value of 1

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.940
did not occur, so this
probability is going to be 0.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.450
The other three values
are still possible.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.740
What are their conditional
probabilities?

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.490
Well, these three values had
equal probabilities in the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.810
original model, so they should
have equal probabilities in

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.970
the conditional model as well.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.150
And in order for probabilities
to sum to 1, of course, these

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.780
probabilities will
have to be 1/3.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.710
So this is the conditional PMF
of our random variable, given

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.660
this new or additional
information about the outcome.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.440
The expected value of the
random variable X in the

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.750
conditional universe--

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.110
that is, the conditional
expectation--

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.590
is just the ordinary expectation
but applied to the

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.970
conditional model.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.800
In this conditional model, by
symmetry, the expected value

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.170
will have to be 3, the midpoint
of the distribution.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.130
And we can also calculate the
conditional variance.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.190
This is a notation that we have
not yet defined, but at

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.840
this point, it should
be self-explanatory.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.970
It is just the variance of
X but calculated in the

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.770
conditional model using
conditional probabilities.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.140
We can calculate this variance
using once more the formula

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.790
for the variance of a uniform
distribution, but we can also

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.040
do it directly.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.420
So the variance is the expected
value of the squared

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.290
distance from the mean.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.100
So with probability 1/3, our
random variable will take a

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.800
value of 4, which is one unit
apart from the mean, or more

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.220
explicitly, we have this term.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.830
With probability 1/3,
our random variable

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.850
takes a value of 3.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.170
And with probability 1/3, our
random variable takes the

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.420
value of 2.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.570
This term is 0.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.380
This is 1 times 1/3.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.960
From here we get another
1 times 1/3.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.900
So adding up, we obtain that
the variance is 2/3.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.880
Notice that the variance in
the conditional model is

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.890
smaller than the variance that
we had in the original model.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.770
And this makes sense.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.670
In the conditional model, there
is less uncertainty than

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.340
there used to be in the
original model.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.710
And this translates into a
reduction in the variance.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.750
To conclude, there is nothing
really different when we deal

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.740
with conditional PMFs,
conditional expectations, and

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.050
conditional variances.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.770
They are just like the ordinary
PMFs, expectations,

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.650
and variances, except that we
have to use the conditional

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.500
probabilities throughout
instead of the original

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.750
probabilities.
