00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:01.376
All right.

00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:03.720
So, as we've seen in
the previous clip,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.460
another way that initial
conditions may matter

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.030
is if a chain has a
periodic structure.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.450
There are many ways of
defining periodicity.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.130
Some of them are more
mathematical than others.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.880
Let us consider one of the most
intuitive ways of doing that.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.610
So here is the definition.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.460
The states in a
recurrent class are

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.720
periodic if they can be
lumped together, or grouped,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.756
into several subgroups so that
all transitions from one group

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:36.500
lead to the next group.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.780
So what does that really mean?

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.320
Let us try to parse out this by
looking at the given example.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.130
So here we would
have a situation,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.790
a structure of a diagram,
in which d is equal to 2.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.540
Whenever you are at a given
time in a state in that group,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.570
in the next transition
you will go to that group.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.410
And if you are in that group,
at the next transition,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.789
you will go to that group.

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.180
So in some sense,
there is periodicity,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.680
and there is somewhat of
a deterministic behavior,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.860
according to this transition.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.000
But there is also
some randomness left.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.490
We can be in any of these
states within that sub-group.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.640
But one thing that
is for sure is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.730
that whenever, at
a given time, you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.530
are into one of
these states, here,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.750
in that group, if
the Markov chain has

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.710
this specific structure,
in the next transition

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.180
you will transition to
one of the states, here.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.190
And the next transition
after, you will go back here.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.720
So essentially, if
your Markov chain

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.420
started in one of these states
here, at time n equals zero,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.860
then at time n equals
1, it would be here.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.020
And then at time n equals
2, it would be here.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.050
Times them into 3, and
so on and so forth.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.759
So every time you would
have an even number,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.850
then you are guaranteed
that the Markov chain will

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.700
be in one of these states, here.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.150
Clearly, with this
kind of structure,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.890
it is impossible to have
convergence of the steady state

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.040
probabilities.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.750
This is another
example where you

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.530
would have a structure
of a diagram in which you

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.400
have a period of 3, here.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.800
So in that case
here, d equals 3.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.310
So here again, if you are in
one of these states at a given

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.970
time, then at the next time
the following transition

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.660
will guarantee to bring
you in that group.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.450
And during the next transition
you will go to that group.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.890
And then again,
here, and again you

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.560
have this kind of behavior
in a very systematic way.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.640
So if you started here
at time n equals 0,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.590
you would be in that group,
here, at times n equals 1.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.200
And you would be
here at n equals 2.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.670
And again, n equals 3 here, n
equals 4, n equals 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.910
And you see the pattern.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.980
If you look at any
time in the future,

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.760
if the time is of the form
3 times k for any k greater

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.800
than or equal to 0,
you're guaranteed

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.030
that your chain will be
in one of these states.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.950
Otherwise, it will
be here, or here.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.850
So here again, you do
not have convergence

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.500
of the steady states,
because if you

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.690
are told that you started in
one of the states here, then

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.950
you know that whenever
you have a time that

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.360
is the form 3k plus
1 you will be here.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.940
And so the probability
of being here would be 0.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.010
All right, so we have been able
to explain a little bit what

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.550
a periodic state is,
using this definition.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.540
Now given a Markov
chain, how can we

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.390
tell whether a Markov
chain is periodic or not?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.380
There are, in fact,
systematic ways

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.870
of doing it mathematically.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.940
But usually within the types of
examples we see in this class--

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.100
most of them, these
will be easy to see-- we

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.160
just eyeball the chain and we
tell whether it is periodic

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.959
or not.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.110
So let us see if it is that easy
to do, and consider that chain,

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.200
here.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.810
OK, so let's see.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.260
Is this chain periodic or not?

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.140
I will give you a couple of
seconds to think about it.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.360
Now I'm going to
help a little bit.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.140
I'll just decide that
this one will be red,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.680
this one will be red,
this one will be red,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.726
and this one will be red.

00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:47.100
Now I'm asking
the same question.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.180
What do you think?

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.040
Well, from the
structure it is clear

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.159
that this Markov
chain is periodic

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.850
and has a period of d equals 2.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.060
In some sense, the
red state, here,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.870
could be one of these groups.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.560
These are the red ones.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.780
And the white, here,
would be those, here.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.720
And it is clear, if you
look at this diagram,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.370
that whenever you are in a red
state, at the next transition

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.270
you are guaranteed to
be in a white state.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.770
From this one, you
will be in white.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.620
From this one, you
will be in the white.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.010
From this one , as well.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.800
And from this one, as well.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.820
And whenever you are in a white
state, this one, this one,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.350
this one, or this one,
at the next period

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.800
you are guaranteed
to be in a red state.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.080
So this tells you
that sometimes it

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.159
is not that easy to
eyeball and decide

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.860
if the Markov chain
is periodic or not.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.110
If you have, for example,
lots of, lots of states,

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.870
you might have some trouble
doing this exercise.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.240
On the other hand, something
very useful to know.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.270
Sometimes, it's extremely easy
to tell that the chain is not

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.330
periodic, even if you
have a lot of states.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.390
What is that case?

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.810
Well, look at this case,
here, and suppose for a moment

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.720
that you have a self
transition here.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.640
Well in that case, you
would have a transition

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.920
from a white state
to a white state.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.650
And you're not guaranteed
anymore that from a white state

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.260
you would go to a red state.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.940
In that sense, as soon as
you have a self transition,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.210
the Markov chain is aperiodic.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.220
It cannot be periodic.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.620
So whenever you have
a self transition,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.850
this implies that the
chain is not periodic.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.590
And usually that's the
simplest and easiest way

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.340
that we can tell,
most of the time,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.961
that the chain is not periodic.
