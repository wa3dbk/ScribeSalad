00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.140
In this segment, we make a
connection between the

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.870
correlation coefficient and
some fairly realistic real

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.470
world situations.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.100
The bottom line will be that
the presence or absence of

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.250
correlations can make
a huge difference.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.310
Suppose that you run an
investment company that

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.870
invests in real estate, and
you have 100 million of

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.020
capital that you
want to invest.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.090
Now you have learned or believe
that it helps to

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.290
diversify, to not put all of
your eggs in the same basket.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.770
And for that reason, you're
going to invest some of your

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.850
money into different states.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.050
You will be investing in 10
different states, and in each

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.290
state, you will invest 10
million so that your total

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.010
investment is spread between
those 10 states.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.110
For each state, you have a model
that tells you that the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.190
return on your investment,
that is your profit--

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.730
It's, of course, random, but you
expect it to be 1 million

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.380
on the average, that is, in
terms of the expected value,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.000
but there's also a fair amount
of randomness, and so the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.480
standard deviation is 1.3.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.260
Now, if you look at one state
in isolation, it would be a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.650
pretty risky investment because
the standard deviation

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.150
is comparable to the mean.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.780
It's not an unlikely event to
have a return that's one

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.150
standard deviation
below the mean.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.900
And if that happens, your
return is going to be

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.230
negative, and you're
losing money.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.930
But then you argue that
you're investing in

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.320
10 different states.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.120
Yes, you might lose money in
some of them, but overall, you

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.060
would expect to have a pretty
high confidence that you will

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.130
end up having a positive
return.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.970
Is this correct or not?

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.210
Let us do some calculations.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.200
We will look at the variance
of your total return.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.840
The variance of the sum of
random variables is given by

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.490
the formula that we
have developed.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.920
It's the sum of the variances.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.160
But then you also have a bunch
of covariance terms that have

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.430
to do with the relation of the
different random variables.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.170
Now, you make the assumption
that the different states are

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.240
different markets--

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.950
one doesn't affect the other--

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.230
so that the Xi's are
uncorrelated.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.079
In that case, in this variance
formula, the covariance terms

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.250
are all 0, and they disappear
and you're left with the sum

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.230
of 10 variance terms.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.110
Now, each one of these variances
is equal to the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.815
square of the standard
deviation.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.360
And we have a variance
of 16.9.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.350
You then take the square root to
find the standard deviation

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.640
and the square root of
this number is 4.1.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:06.240
Now, your expected return is
equal to 10, which is 2 and

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.380
1/2 standard deviations.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.380
You will only lose money if
the outcome is 2 and 1/2

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.890
standard deviations
below the mean.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.810
And that's a fairly unlikely
outcome, and so in this

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.810
situation you feel very
confident that you will have a

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.070
positive profit.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.310
Suppose, however, that your
assumption is wrong, and that

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.400
actually the different Xi's are

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.760
correlated with each other.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.480
And suppose that the
correlation is

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.650
pretty high, 0.9.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.400
Essentially, this means that the
real estate market in one

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.050
state is strongly related to the
behavior of the market in

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.270
another state.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.860
And that could be, perhaps,
because the markets in

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.880
different states are affected by
some more global phenomenon

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.270
that operates on a
national level.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:06.580
So in this case, the covariance
of Xi with Xj is

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.340
going to be the correlation
coefficient times the standard

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.190
deviation of Xi times the
standard deviation of Xj,

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:24.790
which is 0.9 times
1.3 times 1.3.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:32.840
And so the co-variance
turns out to be 1.52.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:41.970
And in that case, the variance
of the sum, using this formula

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.159
here, is going to be equal to 10
times the variance that you

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:53.140
have in each state, which is 1.3
squared, plus you have a

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.340
bunch of terms here.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.650
How many terms?

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.960
There's 90 of them, and
each one of these

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.520
terms is equal to 1.52.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.610
And the variance turns
out to be 154.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.510
Now you take the square root
of that, and you find a

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.010
standard deviation of 12.4.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.860
Now, your expected profit
is 10, but the standard

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.240
deviation is 12.4.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.540
And if you happen to be one
standard deviation below the

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.840
expectation, which is something
that has a sizable

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.890
probability of occurring,
then your profit

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.090
is going to be negative.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.030
So in the uncorrelated case,
you're pretty certain that you

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.530
will have a positive profit,
but if the correlations

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.060
actually turn out to be
significant, then you're

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.120
facing a very risky situation.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.740
To some extent, this is similar
to what happened

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.970
during the great financial
crisis.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.740
That is, many investment
companies thought that they

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.180
were secure by diversifying and
by investing in different

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.360
housing markets in different
states, but then when the

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.180
economy moved as a whole, it
turned out that there were

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.980
high correlations between the
different states, and so the

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.250
unthinkable, that is large
losses, actually did occur.
