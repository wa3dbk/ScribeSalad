00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.320
Let us now examine
what conditional

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.780
probabilities are good for.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.910
We have already discussed that
they are used to revise a

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.210
model when we get new
information, but there is

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.570
another way in which
they arise.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.480
We can use conditional
probabilities to build a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.160
multi-stage model of a
probabilistic experiment.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.030
We will illustrate this through
an example involving

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.480
the detection of an object
up in the sky by a radar.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.030
We will keep our example
very simple.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.910
On the other hand, it turns
out to have all the basic

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.370
elements of a real-world
model.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.260
So, we are looking up in the
sky, and either there's an

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.420
airplane flying up
there or not.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.020
Let us call Event A the event
that an airplane is indeed

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.460
flying up there, and we have
two possibilities.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.980
Either Event A occurs, or the
complement of A occurs, in

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.650
which case nothing is
flying up there.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.010
At this point, we can also
assign some probabilities to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.930
these two possibilities.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.490
Let us say that through prior
experience, perhaps, or some

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.840
other knowledge, we know that
the probability that something

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.830
is indeed flying up there is
5% and with probability 95%

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.360
nothing is flying.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.890
Now, we also have a radar that
looks up there, and there are

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.200
two things that can happen.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.340
Either something registers
on the radar

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.590
screen or nothing registers.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.970
Of course, if it's a good radar,
probably Event B will

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.440
tend to go together with Event
A. But it's also possible that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.930
the radar will make
some mistakes.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.000
And so we have various
possibilities.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.180
If there's a plane up there,
it's possible that the radar

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.350
will detect it, in which case
Event B will also happen.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.110
But it's also conceivable that
the radar will not detect it,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.240
in which case we have
a so-called miss.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.555
And so a plane is flying up
there, but the radar missed

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:15.080
it, did not detect it.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.000
Another possibility is that
nothing is flying up there,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.090
but the radar does detect
something, and this is a

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.829
situation that's called
a false alarm.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.770
Finally, there's the possibility
that nothing is

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.210
flying up there, and the radar
did not see anything either.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.760
Now, let us focus on this
particular situation.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.950
Suppose that Event
A has occurred.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.550
So we are living inside this
particular universe.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.829
In this universe, there are two
possibilities, and we can

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.360
assign probabilities to these
two possibilities.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.920
So let's say that if something
is flying up there, our radar

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.930
will find it with probability
99%, but will also miss it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.220
with probability 1%.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.700
What's the meaning of
this number, 99%?

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.450
Well, this is a probability that
applies to a situation

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.870
where an airplane is up there.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.950
So it is really a conditional
probability.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.010
It's the conditional probability
that we will

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.970
detect something, the radar will
detect the plane, given

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.060
that the plane is already
flying up there.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.560
And similarly, this 1% can be
thought of as the conditional

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.930
probability that the complement
of B occurs, so the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.060
radar doesn't see anything,
given that there is a plane up

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.310
in the sky.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.310
We can assign similar
probabilities

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.910
under the other scenario.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.670
If there is no plane, there is
a probability that there will

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.050
be a false alarm, and there is
a probability that the radar

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.030
will not see anything.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.600
Those four numbers here
are, in essence, the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.830
specs of our radar.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.720
They describe how the radar
behaves in a world in which an

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.760
airplane has been placed in
the sky, and some other

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.860
numbers that describe how the
radar behaves in a world where

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.200
nothing is flying
up in the sky.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.620
So we have described various
probabilistic properties of

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.460
our model, but is it
a complete model?

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.980
Can we calculate anything that
we might wish to calculate?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.450
Let us look at this question.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.320
Can we calculate the
probability that

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.020
both A and B occur?

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.790
It's this particular
scenario here.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.810
How can we calculate it?

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.200
Well, let us remember the
definition of conditional

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.090
probabilities.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.370
The conditional probability of
an event given another event

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.340
is the probability of their
intersection divided by the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.860
probability of the conditioning
event.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.480
But this doesn't quite help us
because if we try to calculate

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.180
the numerator, we do not have
the value of the probability

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.610
of A given B. We have the value
of the probability of B

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.540
given A. What can we do?

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.980
Well, we notice that we can
use this definition of

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.360
conditional probabilities,
but use it in the reverse

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.720
direction, interchanging the
roles of A and B. If we

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.290
interchange the roles of A and
B, our definition leads to the

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.880
following expression.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.710
The conditional probability of
B given A is the probability

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.300
that both events occur divided
by the probability, again, of

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.330
the conditioning event.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.070
Therefore, the probability that
A and B occur is equal to

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.880
the probability that A occurs
times the conditional

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.240
probability that B occurs
given that A occurred.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.290
And in our example, this is
0.05 times the conditional

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:19.000
probability that B occurs,
which is 0.99.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.400
So we can calculate the
probability of this particular

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.930
event by multiplying
probabilities and conditional

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.000
probabilities along the path
in this tree diagram that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.640
leads us here.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.510
And we can do the same for any
other leaf in this diagram.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.560
So for example, the probability
that this happens

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.040
is going to be the probability
of this event times the

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.190
conditional probability of
B complement given that A

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.020
complement has occurred.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.480
How about a different
question?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.570
What is the probability, the
total probability, that the

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.450
radar sees something?

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.060
Let us try to identify
this event.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.050
The radar can see something
under two scenarios.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.070
There's the scenario where there
is a plane up in the sky

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.080
and the radar sees it.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.600
And there's another scenario
where nothing is up in the

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.930
sky, but the radar thinks
that it sees something.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:31.170
So these two possibilities
together make up the event B.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.990
And so to calculate the
probability of B, we need to

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.130
add the probabilities
of these two events.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.000
For the first event, we
already calculated it.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.350
It's 0.05 times 0.90.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.780
For the second possibility,
we need to do a similar

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.480
calculation.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.820
The probability that this occurs
is equal to 0.95 times

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:05.900
the conditional probability of B
occurring under the scenario

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:14.680
where A complement has occurred,
and this is 0.1.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.220
If we add those two numbers
together, the answer turns out

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:26.850
to be 0.1445.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.840
Finally, a last question, which
is perhaps the most

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.950
interesting one.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.320
Suppose that the radar
registered something.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.150
What is the probability
that there is an

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.960
airplane out there?

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.460
How do we do this calculation?

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.040
Well, we can start from the
definition of the conditional

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.860
probability of A given B, and
note that we already have in

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.880
our hands both the numerator
and the denominator.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:08.780
So the numerator is this number,
0.05 times 0.99, and

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:15.920
the denominator is 0.1445, and
we can use our calculators to

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.800
see that the answer is
approximately 0.34.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.650
So there is a 34% probability
that an airplane is there

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:33.330
given that the radar
has seen or thinks

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.530
that it sees something.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:42.220
So the numerical value of this
answer is somewhat interesting

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.100
because it's pretty small.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.100
Even though we have a very good
radar that tells us the

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:54.320
right thing 99% of the time
under one scenario and 90%

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.630
under the other scenario.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.370
Despite that, given that the
radar has seen something, this

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:07.000
is not really convincing or
compelling evidence that there

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.890
is an airplane up there.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.600
The probability that there's an
airplane up there is only

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.590
34% in a situation where
the radar thinks

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.830
that it has seen something.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:26.310
So in the next few segments, we
are going to revisit these

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:31.601
three calculations and see
how they can generalize.

00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:37.640
In fact, a large part of what is
to happen in the remainder

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.430
of this class will
be elaboration

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.770
on these three ideas.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.960
They are three types of
calculations that will show up

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.460
over and over, of course, in
more complicated forms, but

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.970
the basic ideas are essentially
captured in this

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.220
simple example.
