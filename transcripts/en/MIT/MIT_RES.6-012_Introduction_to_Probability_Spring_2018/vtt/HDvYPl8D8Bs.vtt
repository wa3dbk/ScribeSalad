00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.520
In this lecture, we discuss
the simplest nontrivial

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.220
stochastic process, the
Bernoulli process.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.670
Time is divided into slots.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.230
At each slot, we have
an independent trial

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.910
such as a coin flip.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.070
And each trial results
in heads or tails.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.780
Or in different language, each
trial may or may not result in

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.020
an arrival or a success.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.830
Pretty much everything we
will do will be a simple

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.590
application of skills that
we already have.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.270
For example, we already know
that the number of arrivals in

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.720
n time slots is described
by the binomial PMF.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.340
We will then discuss some
consequences of the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.140
independence of the
different trials.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.190
Basically, the process
has no memory.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.630
Whatever happens in the future
is not affected by whatever

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.620
happened in the past.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.170
By exploiting this property, we
will find the distribution

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.725
of the time of the first arrival
and more generally of

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:04.739
the time of the kth arrival.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.150
We will also find the
distribution of the time

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.410
between consecutive arrivals.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.440
Next, we will take two
independent Bernoulli

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.930
processes, let's say arrivals of
men and arrivals of women,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.280
and merge them to get an overall
arrival process.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.690
We will see that the
merged process is

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.300
also a Bernoulli process.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.260
We will also look at the reverse
operation, namely,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.539
splitting a Bernoulli process
into two separate processes.

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.590
Finally, we will look at a
particular asymptotic regime

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.729
in which we have a large number
of time slots but a

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.120
very small probability of an
arrival during each time slot.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.950
We will carry out some algebraic
manipulations.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.509
And we will see that the
binomial PMF for the number of

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.080
arrivals can be well
approximated by the so-called

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.330
Poisson PMF.
