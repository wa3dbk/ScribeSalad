00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.320
In this lecture, we will deal
with a single topic.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.910
How to find the distribution,
that is, the PMF or PDF of a

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.880
random variable that is defined
as a function of one

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.740
or more other random variables
with known distributions.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.720
Why is this useful?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.120
Quite often, we construct a
model by first defining some

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.230
basic random variables.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.340
These random variables usually
have simple distributions and

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.130
often they are independent.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.780
But we may be interested in the
distribution of some more

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.510
complicated random variables
that are defined in terms of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.740
our basic random variables.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.430
In this lecture, we will develop
systematic methods for

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.430
the task at hand.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.830
After going through a warm-up,
the case of discrete random

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.460
variables, we will see that
there is a general, very

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.750
systematic 2-step procedure
that relies on cumulative

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.990
distribution functions.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.970
We will pay special attention
to the easier case where we

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.450
have a linear function of a
single random variable.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.370
We will also see that when
the function involved is

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.650
monotonic, we can bypass CDFs
and jump directly to a formula

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.430
that is easy to apply.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.070
We will also see an example
involving a function of two

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.700
random variables.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.440
In such examples, the
calculations may be more

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.650
complicated but the basic
approach based on CDFs is

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.840
really the same.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.160
Let me close with
a final comment.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.620
Finding the distribution of the
function g of X is indeed

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.970
possible, but we should only do
it when we really need it.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.440
If all we care about is the
expected value of g of X we

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.570
can just use the expected
value rule.
