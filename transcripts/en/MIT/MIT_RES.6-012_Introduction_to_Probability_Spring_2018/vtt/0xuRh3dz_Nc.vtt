00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.650
PROFESSOR: In this segment,
we will discuss a little bit

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.000
the union bound and then discuss
a counterpart, which is known

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.220
as the Bonferroni inequality.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.320
Let us start with a story.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.130
Suppose that we have a number
of students in some class.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.190
And we have a set of
students that are smart,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.690
let's call that set a1.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.310
So this is the set
of smart students.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.540
And we have a set of
students that are beautiful.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.880
And let's call that set a2.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.040
So a2 is the set of
beautiful students.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.540
If I tell you that the set
of smart students is small,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.960
and the set of beautiful
students are small,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.730
then you can probably
conclude that there

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.880
are very few students that
are either smart or beautiful.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.410
What does this have to
do with probability?

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.260
Well, when we say
very few are smart,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.140
we might mean that if I
pick a student at random,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.200
there is only a
small probability

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.810
that I pick a smart
student, and similarly

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.980
for beautiful students.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.910
Can we make this
statement more precise?

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.350
Indeed we can.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.800
We have the union
bound that tells us

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.980
that the probability that
I pick a student that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.900
is either smart or
beautiful is less than

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.240
or equal to the
probability of being

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.920
a smart student plus the
probability of picking

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.330
a beautiful student.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.910
So, if this probability is
small and that probability is 1,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.340
then this probability
will also be small,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.030
which means that there is only
a small number of students that

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.760
are either smart or beautiful.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.670
Now let us try to turn the
statement around its head.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.440
Suppose that most of
the students are smart

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.840
and most of the
students are beautiful.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.979
So in this case, I'm
telling you that these

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.640
sets a1 and a2 are big.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.390
Now, if the set
a1 is big, then it

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.260
means that this set here,
the complement of a1,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.960
is a small set.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.380
And if I tell you that
the set a2 is big,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.430
then it means that
this set here,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.010
which is a complement
of a2, is also small.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.610
So everything outside
here is a small set, which

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.610
means that whatever
is left, which

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.100
is the intersection of a1
and a2, should be a big set.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.820
So we should be able to
conclude that, in this case,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.910
most of the students
belong to the intersection.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.530
So they're both
smart and beautiful.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.550
How can we turn this into
a mathematical statement?

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.240
It's the following inequality
that we will prove shortly.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.490
But what it says is that the
probability of the intersection

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.610
is larger than or
equal to something.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.350
And if this probability
is close to 1,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.660
which says that most of
the students are smart,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.970
and this probability
is close to 1, which

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.190
says that more
students are beautiful,

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.070
then this difference
here is going

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.900
to be close to 1 plus
1 minus 1, which is 1.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.870
Therefore, the probability
of the intersection

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.320
is going to be larger than or
equal to some number that's

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.620
close to 1.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.150
So this one will also be close
to 1, which is the conclusion

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.660
that indeed most students
fall in this intersection

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.880
and they're both
smart and beautiful.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.980
So what we will do next will
be to derive this inequality

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.600
and actually generalize it.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.800
So here is the relation
that we wish to establish.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.620
We want to show that the
probability of a certain event

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.310
is bigger than something.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.900
How do we show that?

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.190
One way is to show that the
probability of the complement

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.320
of this event, namely
this event here,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.240
we want to show that this
event has small probability.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.130
Now what is this event?

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.010
Here we can use
DeMorgan's laws, which

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.790
tell us that this event
is the same as this one.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.610
That is, the complement
of an intersection

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.700
is the union of the complements.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.180
Since these two sets or
events are identical,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.040
it means that their
probabilities will also

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.880
be equal.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.250
And next we will
use the union bound

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.730
to write this probability
as being less than

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.560
or equal to the sum of the
probabilities of the two events

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.345
whose union we are taking.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.640
Now we're getting close,
except that here we

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.400
have complements all
over, whereas up here we

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.960
do not have any complements.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.380
What can we do?

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.820
Well, the probability of
a complement of an event

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.070
is the same as 1 minus the
probability of that event.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.380
And we do the same thing for
the terms that we have here.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.670
This probability
here is equal to 1

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.150
minus the probability of a1.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.910
And this probability
here is equal to 1

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.200
minus the probability of a2.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.880
And now if we take
this inequality,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.730
cancel this term with that term,
and then moved terms around,

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.090
what we have is
exactly this relation

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.130
that we wanted to prove.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.580
It turns out that
this inequality

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.320
has a generalization to
the case where we take

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.770
the intersection of n events.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.610
And this has, again, the
same intuitive content.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.900
Suppose that each one of
these events a1 up to a(n)

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.580
is almost certain to occur.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.300
That is, it has a
probability close to 1.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.890
In that case, this term
will be close to n.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.790
We subtract n minus 1, so this
term on the right hand side

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.350
will be close to 1.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.860
Therefore, the probability
of the intersection

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.670
will be larger than or equal
to something that's close to 1.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.040
So this is big.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.430
Essentially what it's saying
is that we have big sets

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.980
and we take their
intersection, then

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.950
that intersection will
also be big in terms

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.380
of having large probability.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.300
How do we prove this relation?

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.430
Exactly the same
way as it was proved

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.530
for the case of two sets.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.070
Namely, instead of
looking at this event,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.360
we look at the
complement of this event.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.760
And we use DeMorgan's laws
to write this complement

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.430
as the union of the complements.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.600
These two are the
same sets or events,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.040
so they have the
same probability.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.430
And then we use the
union bound to write this

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.630
as being less than or equal
to the probabilities of all

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.370
of those sets.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.570
Now this is equal to 1
minus the probability

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.860
of the intersection.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:22.760
This side here is equal to 1
minus the probability of a1.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.080
This is one term.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.450
We get n such
terms, the last one

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.920
being 1 minus the
probability of a(n).

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.530
And we still have an
inequality going this way.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.049
We collect those 1s
that we have here.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:45.130
There's n of them,
and one here, so we're

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.450
left with n minus 1 terms
that are equal to 1.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.610
And this gives
rise to this term.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.360
We have all the probabilities
of the various events

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.340
that appear with the same sign.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.480
This gives rise to this term.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.550
And finally, this term here
will correspond to that term.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.040
Namely, if we started
with this inequality

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.350
and just rearrange
a few terms, we

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.620
obtain this inequality up here.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.990
So these Bonferroni inequalities
are a nice illustration

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.930
of how one can combine
DeMorgan's laws, set

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.320
theoretical operations,
and the union bound

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.960
in order to obtain some
interesting relations

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.500
between probabilities.
