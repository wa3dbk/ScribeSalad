00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.230
We have already seen
an example in which we

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.350
have two events
that are independent

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.810
but become dependent
in a conditional model.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.850
So that [independence] and
conditional independence

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.150
is not the same.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.250
We will now see another example
in which a similar situation is

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.130
obtained.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.600
The example is as follows.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.470
We have two possible
coins, coin A and coin B.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.240
This is the model
of the world given

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.740
that coin A has been chosen.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.800
So this is a
conditional model given

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.010
that we have in
our hands coin A.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.210
In this conditional model, the
probability of heads is 0.9.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.900
And, moreover, the
probability of heads

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.670
is 0.9 in the second
toss no matter

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.240
what happened in the first
toss and so on as we continue.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.930
So given a particular
coin, we assume

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.600
that we have independent tosses.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.860
This is another way
of saying that we're

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.310
assuming conditional
independence.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.580
Within this conditional model,
coin flips are independent.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.670
And the same
assumption is made in

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.740
the other possible
conditional universe.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.140
This is a universe in which
we're dealing with coin B.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.000
Once more, we
have, conditionally

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.650
independent tosses.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.900
And this time, the probability
of heads at each toss is 0.1.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.680
Suppose now that we choose
one of the two coins.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.509
Each coin is chosen with
the same probability, 0.5.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.259
So we're equally likely
to obtain this coin--

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.539
and then start flipping
it over and over--

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.850
or that coin-- and start
flipping it over and over.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.170
The question we
will try to answer

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.560
is whether the coin
tosses are independent.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.740
And by this, we
mean a question that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.950
refers to the overall model.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.330
In this general model, are
the different coin tosses

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.290
independent?

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.680
Where you do not know ahead of
time which coin is going to be.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.700
We can approach this
question by trying

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.160
to compare conditional and
unconditional probabilities.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.930
That's what
independence is about.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.090
Independence is about certain
conditional probabilities

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.660
being the same as the
unconditional probabilities.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.140
So this here, this
comparison here

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.610
is essentially the question
of whether the 11th coin

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.720
toss is dependent or
independent from what

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.880
happened in the
first 10 coin tosses.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.390
Let us calculate
these probabilities.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.490
For this one, we use the
total probability theorem.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.320
There's a certain probability
that we have coin A,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.700
and then we have the probability
of heads in the 11th toss given

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.290
that it was coin A. There's
also a certain probablility

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.670
that it's coin B and then
a conditional probability

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.030
that we obtain heads
given that it was coin B.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.090
We use the numbers that
are given in this example.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.470
We have 0.5 probability of
obtaining a particular coin,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.440
0.9 probability of heads
for coin A, 0.5 probability

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.020
that it's coin B, and
0.1 probability of heads

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.706
if it is indeed coin B.

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:41.820
We do the arithmetic,
and we find

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.780
that the answer is 0.5,
which makes perfect sense.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.440
We have coins with
different biases,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.130
but the average bias is 0.5.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.020
If we do not know which
coin it's going to be,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.690
the average bias
is going to be 0.5.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.570
So the probability of heads
in any particular toss

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.580
is 0.5 if we do not
know which coin it is.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.180
Suppose now that
someone told you

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.170
that the first 10
tosses were heads.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.090
Will this affect your
beliefs about what's

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.370
going to happen
in the 11th toss?

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.010
We can calculate
this quantity using

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.019
the definition of
conditional probabilities,

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.280
or the Bayes' rule, but let
us instead think intuitively.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.220
If it is coin B, the
events of 10 heads in a row

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.530
is extremely unlikely.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.250
So if I see 10
heads in a row, then

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.120
I should conclude that there
is almost certainty that I'm

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.350
dealing with coin A.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.760
So the information
that I'm given

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.860
tells me that I'm extremely
likely to be dealing with coin

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.690
A. So we might as well condition
on this equivalent information

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.180
that it is coin A
that I'm dealing with.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.160
But if it is coin A, then
the probability of heads

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.710
is going to be equal to 0.9.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.550
So the conditional
probability is

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.450
quite different from the
unconditional probability.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.430
And therefore, information
on the first 10 tosses

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.570
affects my beliefs
about what's going

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.990
to happen in the [11th] toss.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.530
And therefore, we do
not have independence

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.710
between the different tosses.
