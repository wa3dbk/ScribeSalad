00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.200
Let us now consider
a simple example.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.460
Let random variables X and Y
be described by a joint PMF

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.820
which is the one shown
in this table.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.990
Question--

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.190
are X and Y independent?

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.910
We can try to answer this
question by using the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.670
definition of independence.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.320
But it is actually more
instructive to proceed in a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.660
somewhat more intuitive way.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.320
We look at this table, and we
observe that the value of one

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.000
is possible for X. In
particular, the probability

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.950
that X takes the value of one,
this is the marginal

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.690
probability, this can be found
by adding the probabilities of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.580
all of the outcomes in this
column, which, in this case,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.710
is 3 over 20.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.560
Suppose now that somebody tells
you the value of Y. For

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.430
example, I tell you that Y
happens to be equal to one, in

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.100
which case you are transported
into this universe.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.110
In this universe, the
conditional probability that X

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.510
takes a value of one, given that
Y takes a value of one,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.100
what is it?

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.800
In this universe, there's
zero probability

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.070
associated to this outcome.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.660
So this probability
is zero, which is

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.010
different than 3 over 20.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.789
And since these two numbers are
different, this means that

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.720
information from Y changes our
beliefs about what's going to

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.600
happen to X. And so, we do
not have independence.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.009
So again, intuitively, in the
beginning, we thought that X

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.380
equal to one was possible.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.360
But information given by Y,
namely that Y is equal to one,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.360
tells us that, actually, X
equals to one is impossible.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.700
Information about Y changed our
beliefs about X, so X and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.990
Y are dependent.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.510
Now, when we first introduced
the notion of independence

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.310
some time ago, we also
introduced the notion of

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.620
conditional independence.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.500
And we said that conditional
independence is the same as

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.940
ordinary independence, except
that it would be applied to a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.880
conditional universe.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.480
Something similar can be done
for the case of random

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.960
variables as well.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.030
So suppose, for example, that
someone tells us that the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.680
outcome of the experiment
was such that it belongs

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.250
to this blue set.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.960
This is the set where X is less
than or equal to 2, and Y

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.250
is larger than or
equal to three.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.420
So we're given this information,
and this is now

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.050
our new conditional model.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.600
The question is, within this
new conditional model are

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.079
random variables X and
Y independent?

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.440
Let's just right down the
conditional model, where I'm

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.610
only showing the four possible
outcomes that are allowed in

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.850
the conditional model.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.810
All the others, of course, will
have zero probability in

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.540
the conditional model.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.110
So in the conditional model,
probabilities will keep the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.260
same proportions as in the
unconditional model--

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
and the proportions
are 1, 2, 2, 4--

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.990
but then they need to be scaled,
or normalized, so that

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.810
they add to 1.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.030
And to make them add to 1, we
need to divide them all by 9.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.520
In this conditional model, this
is the joint PMF of the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.400
two random variables X and Y.
Let us find the marginal PMFs.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.020
To find the marginal PMF
of X, we add the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.300
entries in this column.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.829
And we get here 1/3,
and here 2/3.

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.829
And to find the marginal
PMF of y, we add the

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.110
entries in this [row]

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.090
to find 2/3.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.940
And we adds the entries
in that [row]

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.020
to find 1/3.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.000
So this is the marginal
PMF of x.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.900
That's the marginal PMF of Y.
And now we notice that this

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.670
entry of the joint PMF
is 1/3 times 1/3, the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.300
product of the marginals.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.560
This entry is the product of 1/3
times 2/3, the product of

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.070
the marginals, and so on for
the remaining entries.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.670
So each entry of the joint PMF
is equal to the product of the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.680
corresponding entries of
the marginal PMFs.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.670
And this is the definition
of independence.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.670
So in this conditional blue
universe, we do have

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.210
independence.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.909
And the way that this was
established was to check that

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.940
the joint PMF factors as a
product of marginal PMFs.
