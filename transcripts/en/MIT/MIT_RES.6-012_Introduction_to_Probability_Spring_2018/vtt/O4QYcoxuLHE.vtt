00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.290
In this segment, we start
a discussion of multiple

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.710
continuous random variables.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.760
Here are some objects that we're
already familiar with.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.090
But exactly as in the discrete
case, if we are dealing with

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.930
two random variables, it is
not enough to know their

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.250
individual PDFs.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.230
We also need to model the
relation between the two

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.780
random variables, and this is
done through a joint PDF,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.800
which is the continuous analog
of the joint PMF.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.180
We will use this notation to
indicate joint PDFs where we

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.650
use f to indicate that we're
dealing with a density.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.520
So what remains to be done is to
actually define this object

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.800
and see how we use it.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.440
Let us start by recalling that
joint PMFs were defined in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.910
terms of the probability that
the pair of random variables X

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.350
and Y take certain specific
values little x and little y.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.970
Regarding joint PDFs, we start
by saying that it has to be

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.050
non-negative.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.880
However, a more precise
interpretation in terms of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.490
probabilities has to
wait a little bit.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.270
Joint PDFs will be used to
calculate probabilities.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.300
And this will be done
in analogy with

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.740
the discrete setting.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.820
In the discrete setting, the
probability that the pair of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.660
random variables falls inside a
certain set is just the sum

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.390
of the probabilities of all of
the possible pairs inside that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.310
particular set.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.880
For the continuous case,
we introduce

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.990
an analogous formula.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.120
We use the joint density instead
of the joint PMF.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.700
And instead of having a
summation, we now integrate.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.450
As in the discrete setting,
we have one total unit of

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.700
probability.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.090
The joint PDF tells us how this
unit of probability is

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.460
spread over the entire
continuous

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.360
two-dimensional plane.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.080
And we use it, we use the joint
PDF, to calculate the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.180
probability of a certain set
by finding the volume under

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.270
the joint PDF that lies
on top of that set.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.490
This is what this integral
really represents.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.170
We integrate over a particular
two-dimensional set, and we

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.510
take this value that
we integrate.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.360
And we can think of this as the
height of an object that's

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.400
sitting on top of that set.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.990
Now, this relation here, this
calculation of probabilities,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.140
is not something that we
are supposed to prove.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.160
This is, rather, the
definition of

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.450
what a joint PDF does.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.920
A legitimate joint PDF is any
function of two variables,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.820
which is non-negative and
which integrates to 1.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.670
And we will say that two random
variables are jointly

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.420
continuous if there is a
legitimate joint PDF that can

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.890
be used to calculate the
associated probabilities

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.710
through this particular
formula.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.770
So we have really an indirect
definition.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.290
Instead of defining the joint
PDF as a probability, we

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.610
actually define it indirectly by
saying what it does, how it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.220
will be used to calculate
probabilities.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.780
A picture will be
helpful here.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.200
Here's a plot of a possible
joint PDF.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.000
These are the x and y-axes.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.990
And the function being plotted
is the joint PDF of these two

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.580
random variables.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.730
This joint PDF is higher at
some places and lower at

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.800
others, indicating that certain
regions of the x,y

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.480
plane are more likely
than others.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.630
The joint PDF determines the
probability of a set B by

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.470
integrating over that set B.
Let's say it's this set.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.940
Integrating the PDF
over that set.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.190
Pictorially, what this means is
that we look at the volume

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.790
that sits on top of that set,
but below the PDF, below the

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.780
joint PDF, and so we obtain some
three-dimensional object

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.100
of this kind.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.940
And this integral corresponds
to actually finding this

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.740
volume here, the volume that
sits on top of the set B but

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.060
which is below the joint PDF.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.410
Let us now develop some
additional understanding of

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.680
joint PDFs.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:12.430
As we just discussed, for any
given set B, we can integrate

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.890
the joint PDF over that set.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.770
And this will give us
the probability of

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.120
that particular set.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.460
Of particular interest is the
case where we're dealing with

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.420
a set which is a rectangle, in
which case the situation is a

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.750
little simpler.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.380
So suppose that we have
a rectangle where the

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.460
x-coordinate ranges from A to B
and the y-coordinate ranges

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.420
from some C to some D. Then, the
double integral over this

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.520
particular rectangle can be
written in a form where we

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.620
first integrate with respect to
one of the variables that

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.950
ranges from A to B. And then, we
integrate over all possible

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.480
values of y as they
range from C to D.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.270
Of particular interest is the
special case where we're

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.290
dealing with a small rectangle
such as this one.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.990
A rectangle with sizes equal to
some delta where delta is a

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.000
small number.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.920
In that case, the double
integral, which is the volume

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.810
on top of that rectangle,
is simpler to evaluate.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.010
It is equal to the value of
the function that we're

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.640
integrating at some point in the
rectangle --- let's take

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.940
that corner ---

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.640
times the area of that little
rectangle, which is equal to

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.390
delta square.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.820
So we have an interpretation of
the joint PDF in terms of

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.820
probabilities of small
rectangles.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.140
Joint PDFs are not
probabilities.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.560
But rather, they are probability
densities.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.020
They tell us the probability
per unit area.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.190
And one more important
comment.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.450
For the case of a single
continuous random variable, we

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.750
know that any single point
has 0 probability.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.620
This is again, true for the case
of two jointly continuous

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.440
random variables.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.460
But more is true.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.350
If you take a set B
that has 0 area.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.890
For example, a certain curve.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:34.890
Suppose that this curve is the
entire set B. Then, the volume

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:40.320
under the joint PDF that's
sitting on top of that curve

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.570
is going to be equal to 0.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.460
So 0 area sets have
0 probability.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.930
And this is one of the
characteristic features of

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.590
jointly continuous
random variables.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.920
Now, let's think of a particular
situation.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:04.160
Suppose that X is a continuous
random variable, and let Y be

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.160
another random variable, which
is identically equal to X.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.730
Since X is a continuous random
variable, Y is also a

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.690
continuous random variable.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.480
However, in this situation, we
are certain that the outcome

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.890
of the experiment is going
to fall on the line

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.080
where x equals y.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.910
All the probability lies
on top of a line, and

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.140
a line has 0 area.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.840
So we have positive probability
on the set of 0

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.159
area, which contradicts what
we discussed before.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.100
Well, this simply means that
X and Y are not jointly

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.230
continuous.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.420
Each one of them is continuous,
but together

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.840
they're not jointly
continuous.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.230
Essentially, joint continuity
is something more than

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:56.370
requiring each random variable
to be continuous by itself.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:01.010
For joint continuity, we want
the probability to be really

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.820
spread over two dimensions.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.630
Probability is not allowed
to be concentrated on a

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.140
one-dimensional set.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.850
On the other hand, in this
example, the probability is

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.450
concentrated on a
one-dimensional set.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.220
And we do not have
joint continuity.
