00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.950
We will now go through
a derivation of the

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.790
law of total variance.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.500
This particular derivation
is not insightful.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.380
It will not really give you any
intuition as to why the

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.580
law of total variance
is correct.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.270
On the other hand, it involves
some interesting manipulations

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.630
that will be useful to be able
to follow, and understand the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.870
kinds of objects that they're
being moved around, and why

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.560
each step is valid.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.400
Our derivation relies on the
standard formula that we have

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.610
on how to calculate variances.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.630
And our first step is to apply
this formula to the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.170
conditional variance.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.170
Now, the conditional variance is
like an ordinary variance,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.630
except that it is calculated
in a conditional universe.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.400
So we apply this formula, except
that the expectation of

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.520
X squared is the expectation
calculated in

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.240
the conditional universe.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.880
And similarly, for the next term
it is the square of the

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.460
expected value of X. But it's
the expected value of X as

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.360
calculated in the conditional
universe.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.430
So this is an equality
between numbers.

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.060
What does it translate to?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.450
This has been defined as a
random variable that takes

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.400
this value when capital Y
is equal to little y.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.070
What is the random variable
that takes this value when

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.500
capital Y is little y?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.740
Well, this random variable here
is a random variable that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.390
takes this value when capital
Y is equal to little y.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.580
And this random variable here
is a random variable that

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.910
takes this numerical value
when capital Y is

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.350
equal to little y.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.290
So to summarize, this is the
random variable that takes

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.430
this numerical value
when capital Y is

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130
equal to little y.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.630
And this is a random variable
that takes this value when

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.300
capital Y is equal
to little y.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.520
This expression, the left hand
side is equal to the right

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.010
hand side for all y's.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.350
And therefore, this random
variable and that random

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.140
variable always take the same
numerical values no matter

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.560
what y happens to be.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.220
So these are identical
random variables.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.940
And so we have this equality
between random variables.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.000
The next step as we're working
towards calculating this first

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.310
term here in the law of total
variance is to take the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.720
expectation of this
expression.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.079
What is it?

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.460
We take the expectation
of the first term.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.740
It's the expectation of a
conditional expectation.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.780
And according to the law of
iterated expectations, it is

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.460
the same as the unconditional
expectation.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.272
And then we have the expected
value of the next term.

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:12.110
Next, we want to make some
progress towards calculating

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.280
this second quantity in the
law of total variance.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.329
And the way to calculate it is
to just apply this general

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.810
property of variances to the
special case where X gets

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.160
replaced by the expected
value of X given Y.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.520
So the first term will be the
expected value of our random

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.910
variable squared.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.170
Our random variable is the
expected value of X given Y.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.490
And the second term involves
the expected value of the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.530
random variable whose variance
we're considering.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.110
So it's the expected value
of this random variable.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.115
So it's the expected value of
the conditional expectation.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.010
And everything gets squared.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.520
What is this term?

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.570
By the law of iterated
expectations, the expected

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.550
value of a conditional
expectation is the same as the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.990
unconditional expectation.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.319
So this last term here
is of this form.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.290
What we will do next is to take
this expression here and

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.990
that expression here, and
add them together.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.180
When we add them, we notice that
this term and that term

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.260
are the same.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.850
So they cancel out.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.490
And we're left with the expected
value of X squared

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.420
minus the square of the
expected value.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.159
But we know that this is the
same as the variance of X. So

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.600
we have proved that the sum of
these two terms, which are the

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.170
two terms up here, give
us the variance of X.
