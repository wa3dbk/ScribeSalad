00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.870
Let us now discuss an
interesting fact about

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.360
independence that should enhance
our understanding.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.810
Suppose that events A and
B are independent.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.620
Intuitively, if I tell you that
A occurred, this does not

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.810
change your beliefs as to the
likelihood that B will occur.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.955
But in that case, this should
not change your beliefs as to

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:26.870
the likelihood that
B will not occur.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.900
So A should be independent
of B complement.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.110
In other words, the occurrence
of A tells you nothing about

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.140
B, and therefore tells
you nothing about

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.370
B complement either.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.300
This was an intuitive argument
that if A and B are

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.590
independent, then A and
B complement are also

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.990
independent.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.210
But let us now verify
this intuition

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.180
through a formal proof.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.320
The formal proof goes
as follows.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.430
We have the two events, A and
B. And event A can be broken

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.930
down into two pieces.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.400
One piece is the intersection
of A with B. So that's the

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.880
first piece.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.470
And the second piece is the part
of A which is outside B.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.370
And that piece is A intersection
with the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.800
complement of B. So these are
the two pieces that together

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.720
comprise event A.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.120
Now, these two pieces are
disjoint from each other.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.610
And therefore, by the additivity
axiom, the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.259
probability of A is equal
to the probability of A

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.120
intersection B plus the
probability of A intersection

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.539
with B complement.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.060
Using independence, the first
term becomes probability of A

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.540
times probability of B. And we
leave the second term as is.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.478
Now let us move this term
to the other side.

00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:14.190
And we obtain that the
probability of A intersection

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.120
with B complement is the
probability of A minus the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.820
probability of A times the
probability of B. We factor

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.790
out the term probability of A,
and we are left with 1 minus

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.420
probability of B. And then we
recognize that 1 minus the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.750
probability of B is the same
as the probability of B

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.200
complement.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.920
So we proved that the
probability of A and B

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.010
complement occurring together
is the product of their

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.829
individual probabilities.

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.230
And that's exactly the
definition of A being

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.140
independent from B complement.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.980
And this concludes
the formal proof.
