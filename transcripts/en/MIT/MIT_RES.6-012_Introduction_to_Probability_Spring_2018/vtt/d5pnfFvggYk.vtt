00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.510
Mathematically speaking, the
Chebyshev inequality is just a

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.230
simple application of the
Markov inequality.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.820
However, it contains a somewhat
different message.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.650
Consider a random variable
that has a

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.180
certain mean and variance.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.720
What the Chebyshev inequality
says is that if the variance

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.000
is small, then the random
variable is unlikely to fall

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.790
too far off from the mean.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.680
If the variance is small, we
have little randomness.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.510
And so X cannot be too
far from the mean.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.080
In more precise terms, we have
the following inequality.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.640
The probability that the
distance from the mean is

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.440
larger than or equal to a
certain number is, at most,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.040
the variance divided by the
square of that number.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.250
So if the variance is small, the
probability of falling far

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.730
from the mean is also
going to be small.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.290
And if the number c is large, so
that we're talking about a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.150
large distance from the mean,
then the probability of this

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.900
event happening falls
off at a rate at

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.940
least 1 over c squared.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.050
By the way, I should add here
that c is assumed to be a

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.730
positive number.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.070
If c was negative, then the
probability that we're looking

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.840
at would be equal to 1 anyway.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.490
And there isn't any point in
trying obtain a bound for it.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.440
To prove the Chebyshev
inequality, we will apply the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.310
Markov equality as follows.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:39.190
The probability of interest is
the same as the probability

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.250
that the square of this quantity
is larger than or

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.430
equal to the square of c.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.259
But now, here we have a
non-negative random variable.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.310
And we can apply the Markov
inequality with X replaced by

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.700
this random variable and with
a replaced by c squared.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.550
So this gives us the expected
value of the random variable

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.919
of interest divided
by c squared.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.980
But we recognize that the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.280
numerator is just the variance.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.200
And this is the Chebyshev
inequality that we claimed.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.640
As an application of the
Chebyshev inequality, let us

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.810
look at the probability of this
event that the distance

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.410
from the mean is at least k
standard deviations, where k

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.710
is some positive number.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.820
Using the Chebyshev inequality
with c replaced by k times

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.000
sigma, we obtain sigma squared
over c squared, which in our

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.530
case is k squared times
sigma squared,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.760
which is 1 over k squared.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.720
So what this is saying is that
if you take, for example, k

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.400
equal to 3, the probability that
you fall three standard

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.090
deviations away from the mean
or more, that probability is

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.590
going to be less than or
equal to 1 over 9.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.920
And this is true no matter
what kind of

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.400
distribution you have.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.010
Let us now revisit our earlier
example, where X is an

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.860
exponential random variable.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.320
And we're interested in the
probability that the random

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.400
variable takes a value larger
than or equal to a.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.100
The Markov inequality gave
us a bound of 1 over a.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.700
And as we recall, the exact
answer to this probability was

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.780
e to the minus a.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.340
Let us see what we can get
using the Chebyshev

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.440
inequality.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.660
Now, our random variable
has a mean of 1.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.860
Let us assume that a is bigger
than 1, so that we're

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.460
considering an event that we
fall far away from the mean by

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.030
a distance of at least
a minus 1.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.700
That is we write the probability
that X is larger

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.690
than or equal to a as the
probability that the distance

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.750
of X from the mean is larger
than or equal to a minus 1.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.350
And now, this event is smaller
than the event that the

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.450
absolute value of X minus 1
is larger than a minus 1.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.530
This is because if this event is
true, then that event will

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.950
also be true.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.200
And now, we can apply the
Chebyshev inequality.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.680
Here we have the distance
of X from the mean.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.100
So the Chebyshev inequality
applied to the random variable

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.690
X will have up here
the variance of X,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.040
which is equal to 1.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.250
And in the denominator, we will
have a minus 1 squared.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.030
Notice that if a is a large
number, this quantity here

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.060
behaves like 1 over a squared,
which falls off much faster

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.660
than 1 over a.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.080
So at least for large a's, the
Chebyshev bound is going to

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.630
give us a smaller bound and,
therefore, more informative

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.630
than what we obtained from
the Markov inequality.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.100
In most cases, the Chebyshev
inequality is, indeed,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.770
stronger and more informative
than the Markov inequality.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.280
And one of the reasons is that
it exploits more information

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.720
about the distribution of the
random variable X. That is it

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.159
uses knowledge, not just
about the mean

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.490
of the random variable.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.450
But it also uses some
information about the variance

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.700
of the random variable.
