00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.270
In this final
lecture, we will first

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.700
review the various properties
of a nice Markov chain, which

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.550
ensures steady state behavior,
and go over some of the notions

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.090
in more detail
with some examples.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.540
Providing some insights on
how good an approximation

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.750
we have when we use
steady state probabilities

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.880
to characterize the behavior
of a Markov chain, which

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.520
has run for a long time, but
not an infinite amount of time.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.170
We will then consider
a classical application

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.420
of Markov chains, which has to
do with the design of a phone

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.710
system.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.130
This is a famous problem, which
was posed, analyzed, and solved

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.290
by a Danish engineer
by the name Erlang.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.090
It was more than 100
years ago when phones just

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.300
started to exist,
but we will see

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.580
that this methodology
remains relevant to design

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.220
similar systems
in today's world.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.150
We will then make
use of all what

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.620
we have learned so far
in order to calculate

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.140
some interesting short
term behaviors of Markov

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.130
chains having more than
one recurrent classes.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.430
We will introduce the
notion of absorbing states,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.990
and we will show
how to calculate

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.950
the probability of ending
up in such a state,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.690
as well as related quantities
such as the expected time it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.600
takes to do so.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.010
As a classical
example, we will look

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.310
at the gambler
continuously playing

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.855
a simple game of
chance, say a lottery,

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:27.730
until he either accumulates
a given amount of money

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.870
or loses all his money.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.280
Both of these states
are absorbing.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.120
What are their
corresponding probabilities?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.090
After this lecture, you will be
able to answer such questions.
