00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.820
So now we can come
to the central topic

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.200
of our lecture, which describes
the conditions under which

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.030
a Markov chain
reaches steady state.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.230
The question that we
are asking, and which

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.960
we motivated in the
previous lecture

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.350
by looking at an example with a
simple, two-state Markov chain

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.930
is the following-- we are
asking whether the probability

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.880
of being in state j at time n,
given that you started at time

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.610
0 in state i, converges
to some constant, pi of j.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.119
In fact, that question
consists of two parts.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.170
Do we have convergence?

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.570
And is it independent of i?

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.730
We have seen an example where
it is not always the case.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.690
For example, in
this Markov chain,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.210
you have two recurrent classes.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.160
This is one current class here.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.380
And then there's a second
recurrent class here.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.760
And we know that if
we are interested

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.380
in the long-time probability of
being in that state, assuming

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.920
that you started in one
of these states here,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.920
the probability will
be 0 to be here.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.379
But if you started in
one of these two states,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.100
the probability
would be positive.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.800
So clearly here, the
initial conditions

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.039
will matter whenever you have
two or more recurrent classes.

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.110
So what would happen if you
have only one recurrent class?

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.960
So let's remove this one and
consider this situation here,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.826
where you have only
one recurrent class.

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:25.200
In that case, what
we have seen--

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.039
this is still not sufficient.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.080
Indeed, if you look at
this recurrent class

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.980
and you are interested
in 9 and assume

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.620
that you started at
9, then at time 1,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.990
you will be either here or here.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.180
And at time 2, you will
be back at 9 for sure.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.420
And in general, for time n even,
the probability will be one,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.930
and for time n odd,
it will be zero.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.280
So that specific n-step
transition probability

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.770
in that situation here
will never converge.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.180
It will keep oscillating
between 0 and 1.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.100
So the issue here is that we
had a periodic recurrent class,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.910
and the period in
that case was 2.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.440
So let us consider now
the final case where

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.790
you have only one
recurrent class.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.120
And that recurrent
class is not periodic.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.700
And how do we realize that
this is not periodic here?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.430
Well, we have a self
transition here.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.150
So now that we have
one recurrent class,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.770
and this recurrent class is
aperiodic, the question is--

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.820
do you have this kind
of convergence here?

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.200
And it turns out-- and this is
the big theory of Markov chains

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.310
under the name of the
steady-state convergence

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.320
theorem-- that indeed, yes.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.250
The rij's do converge to a
steady-state limit, which

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.130
we call a steady-state
probability as

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.440
long as these two
conditions are satisfied.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.000
So in summary, not only
these two conditions

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.060
are necessary, like we had
seen with our counter example,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.050
but they are sufficient.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.260
We're not going to
prove this theorem here.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.810
It's a little bit complicated.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.940
But what is the intuitive
idea behind this theorem?

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.800
Well, let us think
intuitively as

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.520
to why the initial
state does not matter,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.900
when the chain has
a single recurrent

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.460
class and no periodic states.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.520
The technique is
pretty classical.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.560
The idea is the
following-- think

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.820
about two independent
copies of that Markov chain,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.910
starting at two different
initial conditions.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.590
So for example, think
about a red copy.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.730
And the red copy would
initially start at state 2.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.537
And then at each unit of time
will jump to the next state,

00:03:34.537 --> 00:03:36.870
according to the transition
probabilities of this Markov

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.530
chain.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.210
So for example, so this is
at time 0, which was here.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.079
Time 1 might come here.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:53.000
Time 2, 3, 4, 5 and so forth.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.220
So this is one copy
of the Markov chain.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.910
So think about another
copy, the blue copy.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.090
And assume that the blue
copy started here at time 0.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.980
And again, independently
of the other,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.010
but during the
same unit of time,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.600
it will jump from state
to state according

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.350
to the transition
probabilities again.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.300
So think that maybe
this one will go here.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.040
Then will go here.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.660
Times 2, 3 will be here,
4 here, maybe 5 here.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.670
And so forth.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.530
Now look at these two
independent copies.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.580
There will be a time and in that
case, for our little example

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.450
here, is the time 4,
where for the first time

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.780
they collide, in
the sense that they

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.490
jump to the same state
at the same time.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.220
So at time 4, both
of them are here.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.409
Now, think a little bit
about the future evolution

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.659
of these two independent copies,
given that they are in state 4

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:50.300
now.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.640
And here we are using
the Markov property

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.970
to say that the future
evolution of the blue copy

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.310
is independent of
the previous path.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.640
Given that you are in state 4,
the fact that you started in 1

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.150
does not matter for the future
evolution of that blue copy.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.450
And for the red copy,
given that you are in 4,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.890
the fact that you
started in 2 does not

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.230
matter to characterize
the future evolutions

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.780
of that red copy.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.390
So in some sense,
probabilistically speaking,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.370
these two copies cannot be
distinguished for their future

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.190
evolutions, given that
they both are at state 4.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.680
So this means that the initial
conditions for these two

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.090
copies, given that these two
copies met at a given state,

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.680
at a given time--
probabilistically speaking,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.780
nothing can differentiate
them in the future because

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.350
of the Markov property.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.920
That's essentially the
high-level idea of this proof.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.610
Now, the key thing
here mathematically

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.280
is to prove that whenever
you have a Markov chain that

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.909
has a single recurrent class and
this single recurrent class is

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.040
not periodic, and you start
from any initial conditions,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.690
the two copies will
eventually meet in a given

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.580
state at a given time
with probability 1.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.080
OK.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.530
So now let's assume
that the theorem holds.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.480
That means that
yes, indeed, we have

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.390
proved the existence of these
steady-state probabilities.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.840
The question is now
how to calculate them.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.100
Well, the way to do it is to
start from our key recursion

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.190
that we had for the m-state
transition probabilities.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.000
So where we assume
here that we have m

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.210
states, and we are
going to take the limits

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.030
on both sides of this equality.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.060
So when n goes to infinity,
we know that rij of n

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.110
will go to pi of j.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.400
And here, when n
goes to infinity,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.140
in some sense n minus 1
also goes to infinity.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.960
And so rik of n minus
1 should go to pi of k.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.330
And so we are using
that property.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.740
And again, we take the
limit as n goes to infinity.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.210
And we say that rij of
n converges to here.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.720
Now, the limit on
this side-- you

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.310
have a limit of a finite sum.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.630
You can exchange the
summation and the limit.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.970
And so you take
the limit inside.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:22.110
The limit of rik of n minus
1, when n goes to infinity,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.120
goes to pi of k.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.170
And then you have
the resulting term.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.410
And so from that,
taking the limit

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.010
again as n goes to
infinity on both sides,

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.000
you end up with this
equation here for j.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.850
Now, you can do that for any
of the j of your Markov chain.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:47.150
So you have m states, so you
end up having m equations.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:53.850
And you have m
unknowns, the m pi j's.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.580
So this is a system of m
equations with m unknowns.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.240
Unfortunately, this
system is singular

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.010
and it has multiple solutions.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.430
And one way to see that
is the solution pi j

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.190
equals 0 for all j is a
valid solution to the system.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.590
Zero equals zero.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.600
So clearly this is
not very informative.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.380
So maybe we need
one more condition

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.320
to get a uniquely solvable
system of linear equations.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.090
It turns out that the
system of equations

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.820
has a unique solution if you
impose an additional condition,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.690
which is pretty natural,
which means that the pi

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.880
j's are actually probabilities.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.260
They should all sum to 1.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.909
In other words, in
the future, if you

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.159
ask yourself what is the
probability of being in state

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.980
j, and you get pi
of j, the summation

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.400
of all of the possible
states have to be 1.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.340
If you consider that additional
equation, plus that system

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.660
here, so if you consider
this extended system,

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.820
then you can show that
this has a unique solution.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.950
And this unique solution
cannot be this one.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.160
And so in conclusion,
we can find

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.730
the steady-state probabilities
of the Markov chain

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.660
by just solving these
linear equations, which

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.170
should be numerically a
straightforward procedure.
