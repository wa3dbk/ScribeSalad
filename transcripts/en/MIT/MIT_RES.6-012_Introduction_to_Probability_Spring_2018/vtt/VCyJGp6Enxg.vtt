00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.000
So let us start
with our example.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.890
Suppose that you go
to a supermarket,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.160
and start observing
customers arriving

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.990
and leaving from a
given checkout counter.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.570
Assume that there
are two customers

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.120
in the queue when you arrive.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.930
For simplicity, assume also the
customers come one at a time,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.350
that there is a single queue,
and that the customer in front

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.400
of the queue is the one
getting served by the clerk.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.940
So what events of interest
could happen then?

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.420
A new customer could join the
queue, which is an arrival.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.520
Or the customer
currently being served

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.270
is done, and leaves-- departure.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.540
Or both events could happen.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.140
Now for making our
model more precise,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.440
we need to specify the processes
of the customer arrivals

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.710
and departures.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.690
And for that, let's use
some simple discrete time

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.610
stochastic processes, which
we have introduced before.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.900
So as usual, we first divide
time into discrete time steps,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.150
say in seconds.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.840
Here n equals 0 would correspond
to the time when you arrived.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.720
For arrivals, let's assume
that customers arrive according

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.039
to a Bernoulli process
with parameter p.

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.470
And at that time,
steps here, there

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.812
is an arrival, perhaps
this customer here.

00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:24.800
At 6, there is another customer.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.170
So during each time
interval, independently

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.470
of what happened in the
past, with probability p

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.530
a new customer arrives.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.640
And with probability 1
minus p, no one comes.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.050
It may be useful to think
about the following imaginary

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.539
experiment.

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.170
Imagine that during
each time interval,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.390
nature independently
flips a biased coin, which

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.205
has a probability p of resulting
in Heads, and 1 minus p

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:47.500
in Tails.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.890
And whenever Heads
is the result,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.289
then a new customer
joins the queue.

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.920
So in our example here, here
you obtain Tails, Heads, Tails,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.160
Tails, Tails, Heads,
Tails, et cetera.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.320
From the lecture on
Bernoulli process,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.400
remember that this implies
that the time duration-- that

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.320
means the number of
time steps between two

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.860
consecutive arrivals-- follows
a geometric random variable

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.520
with parameter p.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.600
So here in our example,
that time duration of 4

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.320
is the result of a geometric
random variable with parameter

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.390
p.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.390
So again, once in the queue,
customers wait their turn

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.260
until they start being
served by the clerk.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.420
And typically, when a
customer starts to check out,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.430
the number of times
steps it takes

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.920
to go through the entire process
will depend on many factors,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.450
such as the total number
of items selected,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.920
the speed or the mood of the
clerk, and so on, so forth.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.800
We will model this
variation by assuming

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.210
that the service
duration of any customer

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.170
is the outcome of
a random variable.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.760
In particular, we will
assume that the number

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.660
of time steps it takes for
any customer to check out

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.730
is a geometric random variable
with a constant parameter q.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.990
That is, the same q
for each customer.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.840
So you might have
a departure here.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.070
That's correspond to
that customer here.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.530
And another departure at
time step 6 correspond

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.770
to that customer.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.370
It may be useful,
again, to think

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.650
about another
imaginary experiment

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.970
to represent this
service duration.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.760
Imagine the following.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.490
At the time a
customer in the queue

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.840
becomes the one to be
served, that customer

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.630
starts flipping a
biased coin, which

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.970
has a probability q
of resulting in Heads.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.660
And it does so independently
during each successive time

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.470
steps, until Heads appear
for the first time, which

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.370
then indicates that the
checkout service is done,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.100
and that the customer can leave.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.730
So here in our example, you
arrive at that time here.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.760
And this customer
was being served.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.660
And during that time
step, the customer

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.930
flips a coin resulting in
Tails, Tails, Tails, Heads.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.160
That customer now leaves.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.660
The next customer
start being served.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.310
At that time, flips
a coin-- Tails,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.620
Heads-- then that
customer leaves again.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.900
Finally, we will also assume
that the processes modeling

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.100
these arrivals and departures
are independent of each other.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.640
Now let us go back to
our made up experiment,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:51.420
and assume that you
have arrived at 6:45 PM.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.409
Consider the following question.

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.230
What is the probability that
you observe a customer leaving

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.320
the checkout counter
during the first time step?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.990
In our example, since there
were at least one customer

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.530
in the queue, that
probability is then simply q.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.540
However, if that queue had
been empty when you arrive,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.500
then that probability
would have been 0.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.430
Another question, would the
queue be empty at 6:50 PM?

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.010
That means 5 minutes later.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.700
Well, it's hard to tell.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.610
If the initial
length of the queue

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.560
had been huge when
you arrive at 6:45 PM,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.960
then the probability that it
will be empty 5 minutes later

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.250
would be very
small, much smaller

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.360
than the probability in that
case, with two customers

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.710
initially, or in that case
with an initial empty queue.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.280
From these questions
and answers,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.790
it looks like knowing
the number of customers

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.050
in the queue at
any point in time

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.210
not only provides a good
description of the system

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.280
at that time, but it
does seem to capture

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.460
the critical information we need
in order to answer questions

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.290
about the future
evolution of the system.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.080
So let us define the
state of our system

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.910
as the number of customers in
the queue at each time step n,

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.270
and see what we can do.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.420
So here, in our example,
initially we had 2 customers.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:35.018
Then, time step 1,
still 2 customers.

00:06:35.018 --> 00:06:39.330
Time step 2, we have 1 arrival.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.090
So we have 3 customers.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.230
Time step 3 still 3.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.860
4, 3 minus 1.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.540
We have a departure, equals 2.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.409
So 5 will still be 2.

00:06:58.374 --> 00:07:05.740
Time step 6, we have an
arrival and a departure.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.800
So we have 2.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.050
And so on and so forth.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.110
Assume now that there is limited
space in the supermarket,

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.270
and that no more than 10
customers can be in the queue

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.790
at any point in time.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.670
We can then give a
graphical representation

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.490
of all possible states for
our system, as follows.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.450
A system can be 11
different states,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.560
from an empty queue
with no customer,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.250
to a system at full
capacity with 10 customers.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.780
Let us now describe some
possible transitions

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.220
between these states,
from one step to the next.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.100
Suppose first that the
system is in state 2,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:55.760
and that one new customer
arrives and no one leaves.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.880
So you will transition
from 2 to 3.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.930
And this is what happened in
this example, from time step 1

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.490
to time step 2.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.930
Suppose now that
you are in state 3,

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.870
and that a customer
leaves, and no one arrives.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.600
Then you will
transition to state 2,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.700
like what happened
between time step 3 and 4.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.780
What else?

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.710
Well, you could also be in a
given state at one time step,

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.710
and stay in this same
state at the next step.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.400
How?

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.294
It can happen in two ways.

00:08:35.294 --> 00:08:38.630
If there are no arrivals and
no departure in the next step,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.000
and that was what happened
between time step 4 to 5

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.640
here, 4 to 5.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.810
Or there is 1 arrival
and 1 departure,

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.780
like what happened
between time step 5 and 6.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.820
A graphical representation
of all possible one-step

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.810
transitions can be done with
the help of arcs, such as here.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.390
In order to complete
our model, we

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.100
need to indicate the
probabilities associated

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.920
with these transitions.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.510
So again, assume that
you're currently in state 2,

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.150
with 2 customers in the queue.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.120
The probability of
next going to state 3

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.750
here, with 1 more
customer in the queue

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.560
is simply a
probability of having

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.590
1 arrival and no departures.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.310
On the other hand,
the probability

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:31.640
of being here, and going
in transition next here,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.340
correspond to 1
departure and no arrival.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.170
Finally, the system
can stay in state 2,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:47.350
like that, when there is
1 arrival and 1 departure,

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:53.580
or no arrivals
and no departures.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.260
These transition
probabilities would be similar

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:02.030
if the current
state were 1, 3, 9.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.550
For the two extreme states,
the transition probabilities

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.470
are a bit different.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.560
If you are in state
0, the queue is empty,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.280
and you can go to state 1
with 1 additional customer,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.940
with a probability p.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.210
Or there is no new
customer coming,

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.430
and you stay in state 0.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.480
And if the queue is
at maximum capacity,

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.880
either you stay at
maximum capacity

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.620
if there is no service, or
you go down to 9 customers

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.055
in a queue if you
have a departure.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.880
So one important fact.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.090
When you are in a given
state, for example state 2,

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.950
and you look at all possible
transitions, could go to 3,

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.780
could go to 1,
could remain in 2.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.510
If you sum all
the probabilities,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:06.390
p times 1 minus q
plus q times 1 minus p

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.200
plus this total probability
here, pq plus 1 minus p times

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:17.230
1 minus q, you will get
a total probability of 1.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:22.490
Similarly, if you look
at this probability here,

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.460
they sum to 1.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.840
And these
probabilities sum to 1.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:34.880
It's simply says that from
one time step to the next,

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.930
if you consider all possible
transition probabilities,

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.390
they all have to sum to 1.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:54.710
So in conclusion, this so-called
transition probability graph,

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.260
which is this
representation here,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.910
provides a complete
representation

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.230
of a discrete time
finite state Markov

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.030
chain model of our simple
supermarket checkout counter

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.580
example.
