00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.040
All of our examples so far have
involved functions, g of

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.050
x, that are monotonic in
X, at least over the

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.690
range of x's of interest.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.320
Let us now look at an example
that involves a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.760
non-monotonic function.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.800
We're going to consider the
square function, which has the

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.980
shape shown in this diagram.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.610
And we'll assume that X has a
general distribution so that

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.760
it can take both positive
and negative values.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.280
And so over the range of values
of X, the function that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.970
we're dealing with is
decreasing and then

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.030
increasing.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.000
So it is not monotonic.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.040
How can we find the
distribution of Y?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.600
As a warm-up, let's look
at the discrete case.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.100
And as an example of the
calculation, let us find the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.670
formula for the probability
that the random variable Y

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.550
takes a value of 9.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.070
This event can happen
in two ways.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.530
It can happen if X
is equal to 3.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.210
But it can also happen if x
is equal to negative 3.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.150
And these are the two and only
two ways that y can take a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.680
value of 9.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.900
We can generalize this
calculation.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.060
The probability that the random
variable y takes on a

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.720
specific value little y, this
probability can be found by

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.539
adding the probabilities of all
of the different x's that

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.729
lead to this particular value.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.150
Now, for X squared to be equal
to little y, we need to have X

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.610
to be equal either to the
positive square root of y or

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.039
to be equal to the negative
square root of y.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.750
And this is the general formula
for the PMF of the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.900
random variable Y. And it
involves two terms, because

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.790
any given value of little y can
happen in two ways, either

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.270
by having X equal to the
negative square root of y or

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.020
by having X be equal to the
positive square root of y.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.920
We have here a situation where
the function that we're

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.100
dealing with is not
invertible.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.510
For a given value of y, we
cannot find a single value of

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.829
x that will lead to that y.

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.910
But instead, we typically have
two values of x that lead to

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.350
that particular y, namely the
positive and the negative

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.430
square roots of y.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.000
So we cannot use the tools that
we used before in the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.870
monotonic case, where we dealt
with the inverse function.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.330
What we can do instead is to
proceed from first principles

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:11.860
and calculate the CDF of the
random variable Y. The CDF of

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.320
Y is the probability that the
random variable is less than

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.050
or equal to a certain number.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.690
And we're going to focus only on
the case where that certain

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.079
number is non-negative.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.900
If little y is negative, then we
know that this probability

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.170
is going to be 0, because the
random variable Y cannot take

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.840
negative values.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.790
Now, this is the probability
that the random variable X

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.980
squared is less than
or equal to y.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.960
So what we did here is to
express this event in terms of

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.900
the original random variable,
capital X, whose PDF is

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.050
presumably available.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.190
Now, this event is the same as
requiring the absolute value

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.160
of X to be less than or equal
to the square root of y.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.950
And this event, again, is the
same as having the random

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.620
variable X be between the
negative and the positive

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.980
square root of y.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.100
In terms of a picture, the
random variable capital Y

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.130
takes a value less than or
equal to this particular

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.990
little y if and only if the
random variable x falls inside

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.580
this range.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.770
Now, we want to express this
probability in terms of the

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.890
CDF of X. The probability that
we're looking at, the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.690
probability of this interval,
is equal to the probability

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.659
that x is less than or equal
to the square root of y.

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.000
This is the probability from
minus infinity up to the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.480
square root of y.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.540
But from this, we need to
subtract the probability of

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.690
this interval.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.910
And that would be the CDF of
the random variable x up to

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.770
the point [negative]

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.040
square root of y.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.010
So we now have an expression for
the CDF of Y in terms of

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.650
the CDF of X. At this point,
now we can take derivatives

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.300
and use the chain rule.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.570
The PDF of Y is going to be
equal to the derivative of

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.480
this expression.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.550
The derivative of the first
term, by the chain rule, is

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.080
the PDF of X, evaluated at the
square root of y times the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.120
derivative of this argument with
respect to y, which is 1

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.280
over 2 square root of y.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.770
And then we need the derivative
of the second term.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:02.230
We have a minus sign, then
the derivative of the CDF

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.070
which is the PDF.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.150
Evaluate it at minus
square root of y.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.230
And then the derivative of this
term with respect to y,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:18.450
which is minus 1 over two
square root of y.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.030
Now, we have a minus sign here
and a minus sign there.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.880
So the two cancel out.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.720
We can get rid of this minus 1
term and change this minus

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.020
into a plus.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.390
And this is the final
form of the answer.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.730
So we see that the PDF of Y
evaluated at a particular

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.520
point, which tells us
something about the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.620
probability that the random
variable takes values around

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.490
this point, has to do with the
probabilities that the random

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:58.796
variable X takes values around
here or around there.

00:06:58.796 --> 00:07:03.080
There are two contributions, and
this is because there are

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.340
two different ways that a value
of y may occur, either X

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.160
falling here or X
falling there.
