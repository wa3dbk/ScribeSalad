00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.000
The definition of the

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.660
conditional PDF is very simple.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.150
It is just this formula, which
is analogous to the one for

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.600
the discrete case.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.630
In all respects--

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.190
mathematical and intuitive--

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.420
it is very similar to
the conditional PMF.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.770
Even so, developing a solid
grasp of this concept does

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.080
take some further thinking,
so we will now make some

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.580
observations that should be
helpful in this respect.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.230
The first and obvious
observation is that the

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.360
conditional PDF is
non-negative.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.790
It's defined when the
denominator is positive, the

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.720
numerator is a non-negative
quantity, so it's always a

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.510
non-negative quantity.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.270
A more interesting observation
is that for any given value of

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.500
little y, the conditional
PDF looks like a slice

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.620
of the joint PDF.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.710
Indeed, if you fix the value
of little y, then the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.490
denominator in this definition
is a constant, and we have a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.470
function that varies with x the
same way that the joint

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.050
PDF varies with x.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.380
Pictorially, let us consider
this particular joint PDF, and

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.970
let this be the x-axis and
let that be the y-axis.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.810
If we fix a certain value of y,
if we condition on Y having

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.920
taken this particular value so
that our universe is now this

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.220
particular line, on that
universe the value of the

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.950
denominator in this definition
is a constant, and the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.290
conditional PDF is going to vary
according to the height

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.060
of the joint on that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.240
particular conditional universe.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.009
So the height of the joint, if
we trace it, is one of those

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.190
curves up here, and [then]

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.550
goes down.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.490
So it is really a slice taken
out of the joint PDF.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.660
If we condition on a different
y, we get a different slice of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.660
the joint PDF, and so on.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.190
Actually, the conditional
is not exactly

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.860
the same as the slice.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.200
We also have this term on the
denominator that serves as a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.660
scaling factor.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.300
It turns out that this scaling
factor is exactly what we need

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.510
for the conditional PDF, given
a specific value of little y,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.490
to integrate to 1.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.660
Indeed, if we fix little y and
take the integral over all

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.760
x's, using the definition, and
because this term is a

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.630
constant and does not involve
x, we only need to integrate

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.470
the numerator.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.190
And we recognize that the
numerator corresponds to our

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.140
earlier formula for the marginal
distribution--

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.690
the marginal PDF of Y. From
the joint, this is how we

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.440
recover the marginal PDF of Y.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.770
So the numerator turns out
to be the same as the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.440
denominator, and so
we get a ratio 1.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.400
Therefore, the conditional PDF
for a given value of the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.400
random variable Y behaves
in all respects

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.690
like an ordinary PDF.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.930
It is non-negative and
it integrates to 1.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.260
A last observation is that we
can take this definition and

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.360
move the denominator to the
other side to obtain this

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.380
formula, which has the
familiar form of the

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.200
multiplication rule.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.470
The probability of two events
happening is the probability

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.110
of the first times the
probability of the second

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.270
given the first, except that
here we're not really dealing

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.860
with probabilities, we're
dealing with densities.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.540
By symmetry, a similar formula
must also be true when we

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.320
interchange the roles of X
and Y. So, algebraically,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.440
everything is similar to what
we have seen for the case of

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.060
discrete random variables.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.690
It's the same form of the
multiplication rule, although

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.980
the interpretation is a bit
different because densities

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.230
are not probabilities.
