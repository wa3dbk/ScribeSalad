00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.540
We have seen two versions
of the Bayes rule--

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.250
one involving two discrete
random variables, and another

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.660
that involves two continuous
random variables.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.700
But there are many situations
in real life when one has to

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.310
deal simultaneously
with discrete and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.160
continuous random variables.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.170
For example, you may want to
recover a discrete digital

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.560
signal that was sent to you,
but the signal has been

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.220
corrupted by continuous noise so
that your observation is a

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.910
continuous random variable.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.800
So suppose that we have a
discrete random variable K,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.320
and another continuous random
variable, Y. In order to get a

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.730
variant of the Bayes rule that
applies to this situation, we

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.460
will proceed as in the
more standard cases.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.460
We will use the multiplication
rule twice to get two

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.880
alternative expressions
for the probability

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.120
of two events happening.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.740
We will equate those
expressions, and from these,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.570
derive a version of
the Bayes rule.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.250
So we will look at the
probability that the discrete

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.700
random variable takes on a
certain numerical value, and,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.120
simultaneously, the continuous
random variable takes a value

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.530
inside a certain
small interval.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.450
So here, delta is a positive
number, which we will take to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.830
be very small.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.730
And in fact, we will be
interested in the limiting

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.020
case as delta goes to 0.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.060
So now we use the multiplication
rule.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.380
The probability of two events is
equal to the probability of

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.350
the first event times the
conditional probability of the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.759
second event given that the
first event has occurred.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.030
But we know that we can use the
multiplication rule in any

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.390
order, so the probability of two
events happening can also

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.770
be written as the probability
that the second event occurs

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.400
times the conditional
probability that the first

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.050
event occurs, given that the
second event has occurred.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.100
So these two expressions
that we obtain from the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.540
multiplication rule
have to be equal.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.540
Let us rewrite those expressions
using PMF notation

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.630
and PDF notation.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.300
What do we have here?

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.690
The probability that a discrete
random variable takes

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.000
on a certain value--

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.910
that's just the PMF of this
random variable evaluated at a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.520
particular point.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.850
And what do we have here?

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.440
The probability that the
random variable, Y, a

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.370
continuous random variable,
takes values inside an

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.260
interval is always equal to
the PDF of that random

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.420
variable times the length
of this interval.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.420
And this is an approximate
equality.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.580
However, because here we're
talking about the probability

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.590
of being in a small interval
conditioned on a certain

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.870
event, we should be using
a conditional PDF.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.660
It's the conditional PDF
conditioned on the random

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.360
variable, capital K, and
conditioned on the specific

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.990
event that this discrete random
variable takes on a

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.920
certain value, little k.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.860
Let us do a similar notation
change for the second

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.930
expression.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.380
Here we have the probability--

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.210
the unconditional
probability--

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.340
that Y takes a value inside a
small interval, and when delta

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.460
is small, this is approximately
equal to the PDF

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.329
of the random variable Y times
the length of the interval.

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.490
And what do we have here?

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.590
The probability that a discrete
random variable takes

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.180
on a certain value, that just
corresponds to the PMF of that

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.500
the random variable.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.840
However, we're talking about a
conditional probability given

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.770
that a random variable Y takes
a value that's approximately

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.680
equal to a certain little y.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.860
So this is a notation that we
have not used before, but its

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.130
meaning should be unambiguous
at this point.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.710
But just by arguing by analogy
to what we have been doing all

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.200
along, it's a PMF of a discrete
random variable.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.560
But it is a conditional PMF.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.500
It describes to us the
probability distribution of

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.780
the discrete random variable K
when the random variable Y,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.050
which happens to be a continuous
one, takes on a

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.550
specific value.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.450
So we can cancel the deltas from
both sides, and we have

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.950
that this expression is
approximately equal to that

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.700
expression, and this approximate
equality is more

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.230
and more exact as we
send delta to 0.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.600
But delta has already
disappeared from here, so we

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.250
can set these two expressions
equal to each other.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.280
At this point, now, we can take
this term and move it to

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.220
the other side of the equality
so it will go to the

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.780
denominator.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.010
And we obtain this version
of the Bayes rule.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.540
It gives us the conditional
probability of a random

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.860
variable K given that a certain
continuous random

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.909
variable Y has taken on
a specific value.

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:43.659
So this version is useful if
we have a continuous noisy

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.820
observation, Y, on the basis of
which we're trying to say

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.070
something, to make inferences
about the discrete random

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.370
variable K. And in order to
apply the Bayes rule, we need

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.370
to know the unconditional
distribution of the random

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.770
variable K, and we also need to
have a model of the noisy

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.610
observation--

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.900
a model of that observation
under each possible

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.570
conditional universe.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.940
So for any possibility for the
random variable K, we need to

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.030
know the distribution of
the random variable Y.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.150
Or, alternatively, we can take
this term and send it to the

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.870
denominator of the other side,
and we get a different version

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.460
of the Bayes rule.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.210
This version of the Bayes rule
applies if we're trying to

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.500
make an inference about a
continuous random variable Y,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.140
given that we know the value
of a certain related

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:49.510
observation, K, of a random
variable, capital K.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.300
In both versions of the Bayes
rule, there's also a

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.240
denominator term which needs
to be evaluated.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.280
This term gets evaluated similar
to the cases that we

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.210
have considered earlier, and
they are determined by using a

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.800
suitable version of the total
probability theorem.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.440
This is a version of the total
probability theory that we

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.970
have already seen.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.800
We have a conditional density of
Y under different scenarios

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.900
for the random variable capital
K, and we get the

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.770
density of Y by considering the
conditional densities and

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.080
weighing them according to the
probabilities of the different

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.340
discrete scenarios.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.920
This version of the total
probability theorem is

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.450
something that we have not
proved so far, and we

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.990
have not seen it.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.950
On the other hand, it's
not hard to derive.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:53.110
If we fix the value of k, this
is a density, and therefore it

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.200
must integrate to 1.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.490
So the integral of this ratio,
with respect to y, has to be

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.850
equal to 1.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.990
Now, there's no y in the
denominator, so the integral

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.370
of the numerator divided by
the denominator has to be

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.580
equal to 1, which means that the
denominator must be equal

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.180
to the integral of the numerator
when we integrate

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.320
overall y's, and this
is just what this

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.500
expression is saying.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.130
So what we will do next will be
to consider one example for

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:31.030
each one of these two cases of
the Bayes rule that we have

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.280
just derived.
