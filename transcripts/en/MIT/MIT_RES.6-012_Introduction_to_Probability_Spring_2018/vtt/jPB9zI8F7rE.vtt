00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.530
Let us now give an example of a
continuous random variable--

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.320
the uniform random variable.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.880
It is patterned after the
discrete random variable.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.110
Similar to the discrete case,
we will have a range of

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.290
possible values.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.370
In the discrete case, these
values would be the integers

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.270
between a and b.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.820
In the continuous case, any real
number between a and b

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.370
will be possible.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.770
In the discrete case, these
values were equally likely.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.000
In the continuous case, at all
points, we have the same

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.660
height for the probability
density function.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.710
And as a consequence, if we take
two intervals that have

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.360
the same length, then these two
intervals will be assigned

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.060
the same probability.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.740
Intuitively, uniform random
variables model

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.270
the following situation.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.210
We know that the numerical value
of the random variable

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.310
will be between a and b.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.000
But we know nothing more.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.940
We have no reason to believe
that certain locations are

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.250
more likely than others.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.120
And in this sense, the uniform
random variable models a

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.700
situation of complete
ignorance.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.050
By the way, since probabilities
must add to 1,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.960
the area of this rectangle
must be equal to 1.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.260
And therefore, the height of
this rectangle has to be 1

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.190
over b minus a, so that
we have a height of 1

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.670
over b minus a.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.850
We have a length of b minus a.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.660
So the product of the
two, which is the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.430
area, is equal to 1.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.850
Finally, here's a more
general PDF, which

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.440
is piecewise constant.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.820
One thing to notice is that
this, in particular, tells us

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.670
that PDFs do not have to be
continuous functions.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.500
They can have discontinuities.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.660
Of course, for this to be a
legitimate PDF, the total area

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.280
under the curve, which is the
sum of the areas of the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.030
rectangles that we have here,
must be equal to 1.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.490
With a piecewise constant PDF,
we can calculate probabilities

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.260
of events fairly easy.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.850
For example, if you wish to find
the probability of this

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.130
particular interval, which is
going to be the area under the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.270
curve, that area really consists
of two pieces.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.070
We find the areas of these two
rectangles, add them up, and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.440
this gives us the total
probability of

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.240
this particular interval.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.670
So at this point, our
agenda, moving

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.170
forward, will be twofold.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.550
First, we will introduce
some interesting

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.810
continuous random variables.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.600
We just started with the
presentation of the uniform

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.020
random variable.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.910
And then, we will also go over
all of the concepts and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.490
results that we have developed
for discrete random variables

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.510
and develop them again for their
continuous counterparts.
