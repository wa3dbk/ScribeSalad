00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.465
In this brief segment,
we will discuss

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:07.970
an important application
of the convolution formula.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.360
Suppose that X is a normal
random variable with a given

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.300
mean and variance.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.950
So that the PDF of
X takes this form.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.140
And similarly, Y is normal
with a given mean and variance.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.020
So its PDF takes this form.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.800
We assume that X and
Y are independent.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.740
And we're interested in the
sum of the two random variables

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.410
X and Y. And we wish
to derive the PDF of Z.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.040
Of course, the PDF of Z is given
by the convolution formula.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.040
And now we plug in here, the
form for the density of X.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.250
And here, we plug the
form of the density of Y.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.950
Except that instead
of the argument Y,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.240
we need to put in the
argument z minus x.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.320
So we obtain this
form, where here we

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.690
have a z minus x instead of y.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.460
Now this is an integral that
looks pretty complicated.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.260
But it is not too hard to do.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.470
One just needs to be patient,
rearrange terms, collect terms.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.620
And the details of
the calculations

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.720
are not as interesting.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.240
So we will skip them for now.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.590
And I will just tell you
that the final answer

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.310
takes this form.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.450
What is this form?

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.130
Well, it's
exponential of minus z

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.870
minus something squared
divided by a constant.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.610
And we recognize
that this is the form

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.240
of a normal random variable.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.510
It's a normal random
variable whose mean

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.970
is given by this term
here, it's mu x plus mu y.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.750
And the variance of that
normal random variable

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.520
is that constant that appears
next to the factor of 2

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.130
in the denominator.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.320
So the sum of these two
normal random variables,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.850
these two independent
normal random variables,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.166
is also normal.

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:53.789
The fact that this
is the mean and this

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.190
is the variance of the sum,
of course, is not a surprise.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.490
What is important in this
result that we have here

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.800
is that the sum is
actually normal.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.600
Now, we carried
out this argument

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.590
for the case of the sum of
two normal random variables.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.630
But suppose that we
had the sum of three

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.860
independent normal
random variables,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.870
what can we say about it?

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.640
By the result that we just
discussed, this sum is normal.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.340
This is assumed to be normal.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.490
We assume that X, Y,
and W are independent.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.560
Therefore, this sum
is independent from W.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.980
So we're dealing
with the sum of two

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.140
independent normal
random variables again.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.430
So this sum here is going
to be normal as well.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.070
And we continue this
argument by induction,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.110
and conclude that
more generally,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.329
the sum of any finite number
of independent normal random

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.160
variables is normal.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.850
This is a very important,
but also useful fact.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.780
It means that when
we start working

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.050
with normal random
variables, very often

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.150
we stay within the realm
of normal random variables.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.890
We can form linear
functions of them,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.830
take linear
combinations of them,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.480
and still remain in the world
of normal random variables.
