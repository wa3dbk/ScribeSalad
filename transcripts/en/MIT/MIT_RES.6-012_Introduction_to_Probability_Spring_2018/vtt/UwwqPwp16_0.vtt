00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.010
So now that we have defined
what a Markov chain is,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.100
what can we do with it?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.770
Well, we usually
build models in order

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.650
to predict some
phenomenon of interest.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.540
In the case of a Markov
chain, there is randomness.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.470
And so it is natural
to think about making

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.880
probabilistic predictions.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.560
For example, going back again
to our checkout counter example,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.280
you have arrived at 6:45 PM.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.310
There are two
customers in a queue.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.020
And you want to predict
the number of customers

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.510
in the queue at 7:00 PM.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.230
Assuming time steps
are in seconds,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.030
that corresponds to
900 times steps later.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.190
There is no way to know exactly
where the system will be.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.270
But you may be able to give
probabilistic prediction.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.020
That is, to give the
probability for the system

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.860
to be in a given state
900 time steps later.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.280
Our main purpose will be to
calculate such probabilities.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.710
And notation will
be useful here.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.830
Suppose that the Markov
chain of interest

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.710
starts in a given state, i, and
that it runs for n transitions.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.440
Let us introduce the notation
rijn to represent the n step

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.230
transition probability
of ending in state j.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.600
This is the initial state, i.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.940
And this is the
definition, rij of n.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.530
First note that these
are probabilities.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.590
Given that you started
in i, after n steps,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.640
you will end up in some
state with probability 1.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:54.140
So the summation of all rij of
n for all possible states j,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.259
will be 1.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.710
And this is true for all
i, all initial state,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.940
and for any time step n.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.820
Also, because we have a
time invariant Markov chain,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.540
rijn is also given
by this formula

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.380
here for any
possible value of s.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.390
Going from here to
here, plus s, plus s.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.860
In other words, if currently you
are in state i at time steps s,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.829
and you're interested
in knowing what

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.570
is the probability of being
in state j at time n plus s,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.510
which mean n steps
later, you will still

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.546
have the same expression-- rijn.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.110
So how to calculate rijn.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.590
For some particular
n, this is easy.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.640
For example, for
rij of zero, that

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.580
means that there
are no transition,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:13.420
it will be either 1 if i
equal j, and zero otherwise.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.090
In one step, in other words,
when n equals 1, rij of 1

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.820
will be the
probability transition

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.490
given by the Markov chain.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.770
And that is true
for all i and all j.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:41.110
Now let us calculate rijn for
n greater than or equal to 2.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.730
We are going to apply the total
probably theorem, and break up

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.680
the calculation of that
quantity by considering

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.360
the different ways that the
event of interest can happen.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.870
Again, the event of interest
is to go from i, state i,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.580
to state j in n times steps.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.930
There are many ways for
that event to happen.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.030
Let's group these many
different ways, as follows.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.290
Let us consider the
first n minus 1 steps.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.160
And group together
all possible ways

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.960
of going from i to a
state k, a given state k,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.990
in n minus 1 steps.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.560
And this wiggle path here
represent all possible ways

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.230
of doing that.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.780
Using the definition
above, that probability

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.260
of going from i to
k in n minus 1 steps

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.370
will be rik of n minus 1.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.750
Now assuming that you
ended up in state k in n

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.909
minus 1 transitions,
the probability

00:04:54.909 --> 00:05:00.900
that you end up in state
j in the next transition

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.495
is simply the one-step
transition probability, pkj.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.280
So altogether, the probability
of going from state

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.380
i to state j in n steps,
and in being in state k

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:37.360
after n minus 1 steps is
simply rik n minus 1 times pkj.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.659
Note that state k can be
any of the finite number

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.050
of possible states
of our system.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.980
In summary, all
such paths can be

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.940
represented by the
following diagram.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.250
So again, from time
zero, you are in state i.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.160
And you want to be
at time n in state j.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.310
And you break down
all the possible ways

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.800
by first looking at what would
happen after step n minus 1.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.840
You can be in state 1, state
k, all the way to state m.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.190
We have calculated
these expression here.

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:22.060
This is what we have done here.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.140
This is for state 1 and state m.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.850
So the overall probability
of reaching node j

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.620
is obtained by an application of
the total probability theorem.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.380
It gives the following formula.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.320
So this is corresponding to
the total probability theorem.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.030
Here, this is the calculation
that we have done here.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.680
And we sum over all
possibilities for k.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.160
Where did we use the Markov
property in this calculation?

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.530
Well, the key step
here was when we

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.180
said that this
probability here was pkj.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.740
Going back to the
calculation that we had here,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:23.850
this was in fact the probability
of being in state j at times n,

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:34.570
given you started in state i,
and you were in state n minus 1

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.760
in k.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.060
And that probability being
equals to the probability of xn

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.620
equals j given the last time.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.580
That is due to Markov.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:00.180
And this is pkj.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.190
This is a recursion in
the following sense.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:09.020
Assume that you have
calculated rik n minus 1

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.340
for all possible values of i,
and all possible value of k.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.910
And you have stored all these
values, m square of them.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:26.350
For any pair, ij, you
can now calculate rijn

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.510
using that formula.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.830
And you can do it in,
essentially m multiplication,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.610
and m minus 1 additions.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.070
That is, in a number of steps
or number of elementary steps

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.270
proportional to m.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:47.660
You do this for all m square
pair of ij at the time step n.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.010
And then you repeat for
n plus 1, et cetera.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.940
So this is the essence
of the recursion.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.930
Here is a variation that
is another recursion

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.180
for computing rij of n.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.220
You start at i.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.020
And suppose that in
the one time step,

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.860
you find yourself in state k.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:16.760
The probability here is the
one-step transition, pik.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.956
And then, given that
you are in state k, what

00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:22.580
is the probability
that you will end up

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.510
in state j in n minus 1 step?

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.070
Will be, again,
looking at this formula

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:34.750
that we had here,
rkj of n minus 1.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:40.530
Again, you have to consider
all possible values for k here.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.580
And the application of the
total probability theorem

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.180
gives the following
alternative recursion.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:58.510
rij of n, is the sum
for all k equals 1 to m

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:07.490
of pik times rkj of n minus 1.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:16.580
These two recursions-- this one
and this one-- are different.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.760
They are both valid,
and could be useful,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.900
depending on the
specific questions

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.670
you may want to answer.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:30.330
Finally note, that if the
initial state is itself random,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.730
that is given by a random
distribution-- this

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:42.060
is the initial
distribution on the state,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.960
than the state probability
distribution after n steps

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.570
will be given by this formula.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.150
This is the state after n step.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.970
It's simply that.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.900
And this is, yet
again, an application

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.410
of the total
probability theorem.
