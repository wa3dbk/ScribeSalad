00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.900
We will now go through a very
simple example, in which we

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.830
just get to use the formulas
that we have available.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.210
The Poisson process is a pretty
good model of email arrivals

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.670
at least during a
limited part of the day.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.100
For example, during
daytime, emails

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.620
may be arriving as a Poisson
crosses with a certain rate.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.530
But then during
night time, they may

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.520
be arriving as a Poisson
process with a different rate.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.910
Nevertheless, the
assumption that we will make

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.190
is that, at least
for this problem,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.530
that emails arrive
as a Poisson process

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.610
with a fixed rate of
five messages per hour.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.530
What is the mean
and the variance

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.790
of the number of emails
received during a day?

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.800
Well, we have formulas for
the mean and the variance.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.370
And in this problem, we
have a lambda equal to 5,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.950
and tau consists of 24 hours.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.220
So the answer is 5 times 24.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.370
And this answer applies to both
of the mean and the variance,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.170
because for the Poisson random
variable, these are the same.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.630
What is the
probability that we get

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.980
one new message
in the next hour?

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.320
This has to do with the PMF
of the number of arrivals

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.690
during the next
hour, and that PMF

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.620
is given by the
Poisson probabilities.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.300
We're asking for the
probability of one new message,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.650
so that k is equal to
1, in the next hour,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.840
so that tau is equal to 1.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.550
So we're looking for
this expression here.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.330
And using also that
lambda is equal to 5,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.860
we enter those numbers
into this formula.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.190
And what we obtained is
5 times e to the minus 5.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.009
Finally, what is the
probability that during each

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.940
of the next three hours,
you'll obtain two messages.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.570
So this is an event
which is actually

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.970
the intersection
of three events,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.220
the event of two
messages in this hour,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.600
two messages in this hour,
and two messages in that hour.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.820
For the Poisson process, we
have assumed that different time

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.670
intervals are independent
of each other.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.580
So what we need to
do is to multiply

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.100
the probability of two
messages in this hour

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.260
with the probability of
two messages in that hour,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.500
and the probability of two
messages in that power.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.570
On the other hand, for
each one of the hours,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.700
the probability's
going to be the same,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.040
so it's enough to take the
probability of two messages

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.910
during this hour, which is in
our notation this quantity,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.220
and multiply it with
itself three times,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.210
so we get the third
power of this.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.570
Now this expression is
equal to the following.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.300
Lambda times tau is 5.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.350
k is equal to 2, so
we get 5 squared.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.140
Then we have an e
to the minus 5 term.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.580
And k is equal to 2,
so we're dividing by 2.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.930
And we take the
third power of this.
