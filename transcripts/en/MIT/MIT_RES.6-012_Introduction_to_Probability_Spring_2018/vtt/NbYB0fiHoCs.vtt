00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.400
We will now go through a
probability calculation for

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.750
the case where we have a
continuous sample space.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.820
We revisit our earlier example
in which we were throwing a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.840
dart into a square target,
the square target

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.010
being the unit square.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.970
And we were guaranteed that our
dart would fall somewhere

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.780
inside this set.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.090
So our sample space is the
unit square itself.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.670
We have a description of the
sample space, but we do not

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.140
yet have a probability law.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.340
We need to specify one.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.700
The choice of a probability
law could be arbitrary.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.620
It's up to us to choose how to
model a certain situation.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.780
And to keep things simple, we're
going to assume that our

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.030
probability law is a uniform
one, which means that the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.350
probability of any particular
subset of the sample space is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.040
going to be the area
of that subset.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.770
So if we have some subset lying
somewhere here and we

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.190
ask what is the probability that
we fall into that subset?

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.470
The probability is exactly
the area of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.010
that particular subset.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.860
Once more, this is an arbitrary
choice of a

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.000
probability law.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.140
There's nothing in our
assumptions so far that would

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.370
force us to make this
particular choice.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.300
And we just use it for the
purposes of this example.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.370
So now let us calculate
some probabilities.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.750
Let us look at this event.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.539
This is the event that the sum
of the two numbers that we get

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.440
in our experiment is less
than or equal to 1/2.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.090
It is always useful to work in
terms of a picture and to

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.259
depict that event in a picture
of the sample space.

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.640
So in terms of that sample
space, the points that make

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.900
this event to be true are just a
triangle that lies below the

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.940
line, where this is the line,
that's x plus y equals 1/2.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.860
Anything below that line, these
are the outcomes that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.978
make this event happen.

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:12.360
So we're trying to find the
probability of this red event.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.040
We have assumed that probability
is equal to area.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.310
Therefore, the probability we're
trying to calculate is

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.180
the area of a triangle.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.880
And the area of a triangle is
1/2 times the base of the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.220
triangle, which is 1/2 in our
case, times the height of the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.650
triangle, which is again
1/2 in our case.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.820
And the end result is 1/8.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.390
Let us now calculate another
probability.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.730
Now, this is an event
that consists of

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.240
only a single element.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.760
We take the point 0.5, 0.3,
which sits somewhere here.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.220
The event of interest is a set,
but that set consists of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.380
a single point.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.260
So we're asking for the
probability that our dart

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.470
falls exactly on top
of that point.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.210
What is it?

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.260
Well, it is the area
of a set that

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.750
consists of a single point.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.050
What is the area of
a single point?

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.910
It is 0.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.990
And similarly for any other
single point inside that

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.090
sample space that we might have
considered, the answer is

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.500
going to be 0.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.430
Let us now abstract from this
example, as well as the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.850
previous one, and note
the following.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.210
Probability calculations
involve a

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.050
sequence of four steps.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.000
Starting with a word description
of a problem, of a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.670
probabilistic experiment,
we first write

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.200
down the sample space.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.490
Then we specify a
probability law.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.270
Let me emphasize again here
that this step has some

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.030
arbitrariness in it.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.840
You can choose any probability
law you like, although for

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.480
your results to be useful
it would be good if your

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.350
probability law captures the
real-world phenomenon you're

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.090
trying to model.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.010
Typically you're interested in
calculating the probability of

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.170
some event.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.519
That event may be described in
some loose manner, so you need

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.720
to describe it mathematically.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.570
And if possible, it's always
good to describe it in terms

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.690
of a picture.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.300
Pictures are immensely
useful when going

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.350
through this process.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.970
And finally, the last step is to
go ahead and calculate the

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.890
probability of the event
of interest.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.690
Now, a probability law in
principle specifies the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.930
probability of every
event, and there's

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.860
nothing else to do.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.670
But quite often the probability
law will be given

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.540
in some implicit manner, for
example, by specifying the

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.390
probabilities of only
some of the events.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.310
In that case, you may have to
do some additional work to

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.010
find the probability of
the particular event

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.870
that you care about.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.840
This last step sometimes
will be easy.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.340
Sometimes it may
be complicated.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.820
But in either case, by following
this four-step

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.790
procedure and by being
systematic you will always be

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.530
able to come up with a single
correct answer.
