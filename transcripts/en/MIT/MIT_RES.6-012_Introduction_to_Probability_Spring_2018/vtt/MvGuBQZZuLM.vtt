00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.320
In this segment, we
go through an example

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.690
to get some practice with
Poisson process calculations.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.420
The example is as follows.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.610
You go fishing and fish
are caught according

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.020
to a Poisson process with
an arrival rate-- that

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.970
is the rate at which fish are
caught-- of 0.6 fish per hour.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.530
You will fish for two
hours no matter what.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.140
And if during
those two hours you

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.940
have caught at least
one fish, then you stop.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.280
As in this scenario, in which
you have caught three fish

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.380
during the first two
hours, and then you stop.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.640
Otherwise, you will continue
until you catch one fish.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.280
And at that time, you will stop.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.580
We will answer a few questions
and we will write down

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.100
the answers to these questions
in terms of the notation

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.850
that we have introduced.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.580
And here, for reference,
we have all of the formulas

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.570
that we have developed so far.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.240
The first question is,
what is the probability

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.269
that you get to fish
for more than two hours?

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.710
Well, you get to fish for more
than two hours if and only

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.490
if you didn't catch any fish
during the first two hours.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.289
So this is the
probability of catching

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.039
zero fish in the
first two hours.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.740
And we can use this formula.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.690
Substitute k equal
to 0, tau equal to 2,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.210
lambda equal to 0.6.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.150
Plug in the numbers and
obtain a numerical answer.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.229
We will not bother [with]
the numerical answers,

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.320
we will just be writing
down the expressions that

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.860
give us the answers.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.470
Now, in this question we could
have a different approach.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.020
You will fish for
more than two hours

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.350
if and only if there are no
arrivals during the first two

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.190
hours, which means
that the first arrival

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.229
in the Poisson process of
fishing happens after time 2.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.080
So we're talking about the event
that the first arrival, T1,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.440
is bigger than 2.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.320
And we're looking
into the probability

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.170
of this event, which is
the integral of the density

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.040
of the first arrival time.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.740
And the integral is
taken over the range

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.030
of values of interest--
larger than 2.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.329
That is, from 2 to infinity.

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.900
We know that this
density is exponential,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.840
so we can write down this
integral and evaluate it.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.090
So notice the difference
between these two approaches.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.490
Here we think in terms of
the random variables that

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.360
correspond to the
number of arrivals

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.670
during a certain time interval.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.560
Here we're reasoning in
terms of inter-arrival times.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.700
And more generally, for
Poisson process problems,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.760
an event of interest
sometimes can

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.720
be expressed in terms
of number of arrivals.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.710
Or sometimes it can
be expressed in terms

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.590
of arrival and
inter-arrival times.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.520
Or sometimes both
approaches are possible.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.850
But usually one of
the two approaches

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.380
will be simpler than the other.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.130
For example, here we
already have a formula,

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.520
whereas here we would need
to evaluate an integral.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.890
Here is now our next question,
which is a little bit more

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.570
complicated.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.079
What is the probability
that you get

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.270
to fish for more than
two hours, and also you

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.329
get to fish for less
than five hours?

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.360
This is the scenario,
again, that you

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.460
fish for more than two hours,
which means that no fish were

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.500
caught during the
first two hours.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.470
And then you continue fishing.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.310
And by time 5 you have
already caught your fish

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.180
and you have left.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.440
Now, it is convenient of
thinking about the Poisson

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.460
process as follows.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.130
Think about the Poisson
process of catching fish

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.950
at the rate of 0.6 per
hour as going on forever.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.490
So there's a fisherman
who fishes forever,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.020
except that this fisherman
at either this time,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.490
under this scenario, or at
that time, under this scenario,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.520
raises a flag and
says, OK, this is

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.600
the time I should be stopping.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.600
So even though the fisherman
will stop fishing at this time,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.860
we can imagine the Poisson
process keeps going on.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.490
With this way of
thinking, the fact

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.460
that you stopped fishing
before time 5 is the event

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.570
and that the number
of fish caught,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.100
or the number of Poisson
arrivals during the interval

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.560
from 2 to 5 is at least equal
to 1, larger than or equal to 1.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.310
So the event of interest
consists of the intersection

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.440
of two events, zero fish caught
during the first two hours--

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.880
which has this probability--
and at least one

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.020
arrival in the Poisson process
between times 2 and 5--

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.870
this is a time
interval of length 3.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.280
And having at least
one arrival is

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.450
1 minus the probability
of 0 arrivals

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.720
in a time interval of length 3.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.450
Notice that I'm multiplying
those two probabilities here.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.340
Why am I doing this?

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.740
In a Poisson process,
whatever happens

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.230
in disjoint time intervals
are independent events.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.010
So an event having to
do with this interval--

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.290
the event that no
fish were caught--

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.200
and the event that has to do
with this interval-- at least

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.540
one fish caught, at least
one arrival during this time

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.020
interval-- these two
events are independent.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.040
And this is why we can
multiply their probabilities.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.370
Now, let us think of the
alternative approach,

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.360
a different way of
describing this event using

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.760
arrival and inter-arrival times.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.710
What is this event?

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.140
This is the event that
no arrival happened

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.920
until this time, but an
arrival happened before time 5.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.580
So this is the event
that the first arrival

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.020
happens after time
2, but before time 5.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.810
And we're looking
at the probability

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.440
of this event, which we
can find by integrating

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.910
the PDF of the first
arrival time from 2 until 5.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.040
The next question is,
what is the probability

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.425
that we catch at least two fish?

00:06:34.425 --> 00:06:38.770
Under this scenario, we
catch one fish and we stop.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.490
Therefore, this scenario
must have materialized.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.430
The event of catching
at least two fish

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.170
is the scenario that
from time from 0 until 2,

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.170
we caught at least two fish.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.020
So we're talking
about the probability

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.090
of catching at least
two fish, which

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.540
is the probability of
catching k fish during a time

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:11.441
interval of length 2, where
k can be anything from 2

00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:11.940
to infinity.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.100
So this is the probability
that the number

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.800
of fish caught during
these two time units

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.830
is at least equal to 2.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.900
And an alternative way of
writing this expression

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.690
so that we do not have to
evaluate an infinite sum,

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.060
it is 1 minus the probability
of catching 0 fish,

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.385
and minus the probability
of catching 1 fish.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.790
If we were to write
this in terms of arrival

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:47.150
and inter-arrival times, we
will catch at least two fish

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.480
if and only if by the time we
stop-- which will be time 2--

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.760
we've had 2 arrivals, which
means that the second arrival

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.990
time happened before time 2.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.870
So we're looking
into the probability

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:08.010
that the second arrival time
happened before time 2, which

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.660
is the integral from
0 to 2 of the density

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.130
of the second arrival time.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.890
We have a formula
for this density

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.510
given by the Erlang PDF.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.090
So we could take this
expression, plug it in here,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.720
evaluate the integral,
and obtain the same answer

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.700
as we would have obtained here.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.750
Clearly, in this case as
well, this first approach

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.100
would be a simpler one because
these probabilities are already

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.280
available to us.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.010
The next question
is the following.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.080
Suppose that you already
fished for three hours.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.620
This is something
that can only happen

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.150
under the second scenario.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.860
So no fish have being
caught until time 2.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.650
You continue.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.380
No fish were caught
until time 3.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.460
And given that this
event has occurred,

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.070
what is the expected value
of the future fishing time?

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:08.710
The expected value until a fish
gets caught for the first time?

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.670
Well, the Poisson process
starts fresh at time 3,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.090
no matter what
happened in the past,

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.660
no matter what information
we're given in the past.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.870
Now you're sitting at time 3
and looking into the future.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.520
You have a fresh
starting Poisson process,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.730
as if this was the initial time.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.870
Starting from this time, the
time until the first arrival

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.550
is going to have an exponential
distribution with parameter

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.770
lambda, and the expected
value of this distribution

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.270
is equal to 1 over lambda.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.780
Finally, let's look at a
different type of question.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.010
What is the expected
value of the total time

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.510
that you get to fish?

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.470
Let us introduce
here some notation.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:01.070
Let us call the total
fishing time capital F.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.900
And the total fishing time
consists of two pieces.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.500
There's a time until
time 2 that you

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.300
will be fishing no matter what.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.660
And then there's going to
be the remaining fishing

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.610
time after time 2.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.880
So now let's look
at the expectation

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.870
of the remaining fishing
time after time 2.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.480
Here there are two scenarios.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.880
In the first scenario, you stop.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.440
In the second
scenario, you continue.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.830
And we will take into
account these two scenarios

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.780
by using the total
expectation theorem.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.600
The first scenario happens
with some probability.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.580
This is the probability that
you stop fishing at time 2.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.620
And in that case, your
remaining fishing time

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.980
is going to be equal
to 0 because you do not

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.510
continue under that scenario.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.710
But there's the other
scenario that you

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:06.870
get to fish for more
than 2 time units.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.840
And then we multiply
this term with

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.670
the conditional expectation
of the remaining fishing time,

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.060
given that you got to fish
for more than 2 times units.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.620
So what is this term?

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.510
The probability that you get
to fish for more than 2 time

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.610
units, this is the
probability that no fish

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.630
were caught during
the first time units.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.700
This is the probability
of the second scenario.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.660
And then we have this
conditional expectation.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.100
Given that you
didn't catch anything

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.750
and, therefore, you will
be continuing fishing,

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:51.090
what is the expected amount
of time-- F minus 2--

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.520
that you will be fishing?

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.890
Now the Poisson process
starts fresh at time 2.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.700
So looking into
the future, we're

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.650
faced with a Poisson
process and we're

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.550
asking for the expected time
until the first arrival.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:11.510
And this time has an expected
value equal to 1 over lambda.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.710
Our last question is
of a similar type.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.650
What is the expected number
of fish you're going to catch?

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:23.260
Once more, we will break
this into two pieces.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.510
Number of fish caught
during the first two hours,

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.780
and number of fish caught
during the remaining hours.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.480
During the first two
hours, the expected number

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.650
of fish that you catch
is given by this formula.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:46.650
It is equal to lambda tau--
and in our case lambda is 0.6

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:52.870
and tau is equal to 2-- plus
the expected number of fish

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.150
that are caught afterwards.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.060
What is this expected value?

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.520
Again, we think in terms of
the total expectation theorem.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.000
There's one scenario that
has a certain probability,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.390
and under that scenario
you do not catch any fish.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.070
So that doesn't give
us any contribution.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.840
Then there is this
scenario, the second one,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.220
that has this
probability of occurring.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.470
The probability of
catching no fish here,

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.280
so that the second
scenario materializes.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.720
And if that second
scenario materializes,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.480
how many fish are you going
to catch after time 2?

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.045
It's going to be one
fish with certainty.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.780
And this is the final
answer to this question.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.110
Notice that in answering
both of these questions

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:44.440
we used the divide and
conquer strategy twice.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.830
We first divided the time
horizon into two pieces

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.850
and dealt separately with
each one of the pieces.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.660
And then in order to deal
with this second piece--

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.740
the time after time
2-- we used divide

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.820
and conquer into the
two different scenarios

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.400
and using the total
expectation theorem.
