00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.330
So let us first review
the steady state

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.670
behavior of Markov chains.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.940
Consider again the
following example.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.430
This chain has some recurrent
states, some transient states,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.660
and a single recurrent class.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.640
So for example,
state 9 is recurrent.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.090
State 3 is recurrent.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.990
State 5 is recurrent.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.390
And why are they recurrent?

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.780
Because whenever you are in
9, no matter where you go,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.460
there's always a
way to come back.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.620
You can go to 3 and come
back, go 5 and come back.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.555
And actually, this
is a recurrent class.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.030
And this is a recurrent
class, because all

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.670
these recurrent states
communicate between each other.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.160
What about the other states--
well they are not recurrent.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.660
So for example, state 1--
and once you are here,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.600
there is a possibility
that you go there,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.810
and you will never come back.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.934
So it can not be recurrent.

00:00:57.934 --> 00:00:59.360
So it's transient.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.000
What about 4?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.050
4 also has the possibility
at one point to go there.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.060
And then from there, it
will never come back.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.160
So 4 is also transient.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.310
As for 2, no matter
where it goes, well,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.030
it's going to reach or
touch a transient state.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.960
So by definition, it
will be also transient.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.320
So they have three
transient states

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.680
and three recurrent states.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.610
Also, this recurrent
class is not periodic.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.780
So it's aperiodic.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.480
And why is it not periodic?

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.940
Well, here, there is
a simple way to tell.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.610
We have the existence of a
self-transition probability.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.490
And that's enough to show that
this recurrent class is not

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.810
periodic.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.690
So this is one of the
nicest possible Markov

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.900
chains in the sense that they
have the following property--

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.700
the probability that
you find yourself

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.050
at some particular state j.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.580
At time n, when n
is very large, it

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.310
converges to a
steady-state value

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.510
that we denote by pi of j.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.410
There are two aspects
to this property.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.320
First, the limit exists, so
the probability of state j

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.830
does not fluctuate.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.380
It settles to something
in the long run.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.110
And furthermore,
that probability

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.170
is not affected by i.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.500
Now, if we don't know where
the chain started, and we

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.010
want to know the unconditional
probability of being in state j

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.120
in the long run,
when n is large,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.180
then either we are given
an initial distribution

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.310
over the states,
or we can choose

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.610
any initial distribution.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.430
For example, we can assume that
all initial states are equally

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.650
likely-- or any other
type of distributions.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.660
And then you can condition
over all the initial states,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.590
use the total
probability theorem,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.970
and you're going to get the same
answer, pi of j, in the limit.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.870
Let's see how to do that.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.892
So this is the
summation of all i.

00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:05.890
So you condition
on that state i.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.340
So it's Rij of n times
the initial probability

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.040
distribution of your choosing.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.079
So this is the total
probability theorem.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.360
Now, in the limits,
when n goes to infinity,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.050
this goes to pi of
j, independent of i.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.290
So you can take this
expression, the limit,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.030
and take it out
of the summation.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.730
And then you have the summation
of-- probability of x0

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.470
equals 1.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.000
These are probabilities,
so they sum to 1.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.850
So in the end, you have
that converges to pi of j.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.460
So the conditional probability,
given the initial state,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.000
is in the limit, the same as
the unconditional probability

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.820
when n is large.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.030
And in that sense, it tells
us that x of n and x of 0

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.570
are approximately independent.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.180
They become independent in the
limit as n goes to infinity.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.620
So if the Markov chain
has run for a long time,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.610
and you are asked the question,
"Where is the chain now,"

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.060
then your answer should
be, I don't know.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.090
It's random.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.670
But it's going to
be in a particular j

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.590
with that particular
probability, pi of j.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.700
So in that sense, the
steady-state probabilities

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.420
are valuable information.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.730
So how do we compute them?

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.290
Well, for transient states,
like these, they are 0.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.520
So pi of 1 is 0.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.320
Pi of 2 is 0.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.820
And pi of 4 is 0.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.050
And why is that?

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.850
Well, if your initial state
were one of the states here,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.159
the probability of being in
here is 0, no matter what.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.750
But even if you
started here initially,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.180
in one of these states,
you might, for a while,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.960
fluctuate and turn
around like that.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.000
But eventually, after a
finite amount of time,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.170
you will go to that class
and never come back to 1.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.020
So in the long run,
the probability

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.110
of finding yourself
in state 1 will be 0.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.100
And this is the
same for 2 and 4.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.050
Now, how do we calculate these?

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.400
Well, for these states
in the recurrent class,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.210
we compute them by solving a
linear system of equations,

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.990
which are called the
balance equation-- these--

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.450
together with an
extra condition.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.700
The normalization
equation here has

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.560
to be satisfied, because
these are probabilities,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.420
and they have to sum up to 1.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.800
And we have seen that the
system of m plus 1 equation

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.120
provides a unique solution
to this kind of system

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.510
for the recurrent class.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.330
So you would apply that
to that recurrent class.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.520
And in that example,
you have three states,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.440
so you would choose m
equals 3 for that example.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.930
And you would solve the
system to get the pi j.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.720
Now, what if we had
multiple recurrent classes?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.520
Consider this chain.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.200
It is an expanded version
of the previous one

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.910
with additional states.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.550
Some of these are recurrent,
and one is transient.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.640
But now we have two
recurrent classes.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.650
And that was our 1
class, so class 1.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:42.180
And now we have a second
recurrent class, class 2.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.370
So what happens in
the long run, when

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.320
you have situations like that?

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.030
Well, in the long run,
if you start from here,

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.780
you're going stay here.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.620
And in some sense, the study
of that recurrent class

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.150
is the same as the study
of that recurrent class.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.950
And in order to find the
steady-state probabilities

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.360
of these states, assuming that
you started in one of these,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.380
will be exactly
the same as before.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:13.030
So you will use the same
system, with m equals 3 here.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.670
Now, if you had
started here instead,

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.830
again, this is a
recurrent class,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.670
and you have m
equals 2 states here.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.690
And in order to find what is
the steady-state probabilities

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.960
of these two states, you could
use the same kind of result

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.130
here, but you apply it with
m equals 2 in isolation.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.090
So you just concentrate on that.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.560
If, on the other hand, your
Markov chain started from here,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.880
for example, for that
specific example,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.630
you're guaranteed that the next
transition you'll end up here.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.040
And then you can do the
same thing as before.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.850
We still know that the
steady-state probability of 8

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.650
will be 0 and 0 and 0 and 0.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.750
Now, what would happen
if you started from here,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.590
from one of these states?

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.280
Well again, for a
while, you might

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.570
travel throughout
this system here.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.230
But eventually, you're going
to move away from that.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.100
And you will either go
through a transition going

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.180
into that recurrent
class via this transition

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.460
or via this transition.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.910
And once you're in there,
essentially, the chain

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.260
will remain there.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.580
And so you do the same
calculation as before.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.850
And if, on the other hand, you
transition away from that class

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.270
and arrived in this
recurrent class,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.800
then you would apply the
result that you had here.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.740
So in some sense, conditional
on the fact that you left

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.480
the states and you
arrived there--

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.179
in that conditional world, you
can isolate yourself and really

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.840
solve the problem for
that class-- and the same

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.190
from that class.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.580
Now, of course, this raises the
question, if I start from here,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.390
how do I know whether I'm
going to get here or here?

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.090
Well, we don't know.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.430
It's random.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.160
So we will be interested in
calculating the probabilities

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.840
that eventually you end
up here versus here.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.380
And this is
something that we are

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.158
going to do towards the
end of today's lecture.
