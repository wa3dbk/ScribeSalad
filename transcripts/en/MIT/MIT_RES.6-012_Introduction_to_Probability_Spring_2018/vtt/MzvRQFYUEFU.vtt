00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.070
By this time, we know how to
construct confidence intervals

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.380
when we try to estimate an
unknown mean of a certain

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.340
distribution using the sample
mean as our estimator.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.980
Or actually, these are
approximate confidence

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.850
intervals, because we are
using the approximation

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.740
suggested by the central
limit theorem.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.690
But what if we do not know the
value of sigma, the standard

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.790
deviation of the X's?

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.940
Then we have a few options.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.253
One option is to use an
upper bound on sigma.

00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:36.600
So we will be using a
value that's larger

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.326
than or equal to sigma.

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:42.180
And this is going to make our
interval somewhat larger.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.670
So this is a conservative
choice, but it is

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.890
definitely an option.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.330
For example, if we're dealing
with Bernoulli random

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.320
variables, we know that the
standard deviation is less

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.480
than or equal to 1/2, so we can
just plug-in the value of

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.840
1/2 at this point.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.220
Another option is to try
to estimate sigma.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.230
How do we estimate it?

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.740
We can perhaps use an ad hoc
estimate of sigma that fits to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.980
the particular situation
at hand.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.800
So for example, in the Bernoulli
case, we know that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.900
sigma is given by this formula,
where theta is the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.830
mean of the Bernoulli.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.490
And using this, and since we do
have an estimate of theta--

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.810
this is just the sample mean--

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.990
we can plug-in that particular
estimate.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.320
And that gives us an estimate
of the standard deviation.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.509
When n is large, this estimate
is going to be very close to

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.770
the true value.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.229
And so this estimate of the
standard deviation will also

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.090
be very close to
the true value.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.130
Both of these options were
discussed for special cases

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.780
where we have special structure
and we can derive an

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.030
upper bound, or there is
a natural estimate

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.810
that suggests itself.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.550
More generally, what
can we do?

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.680
One general option is to
use a generic way of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.190
estimating the variance.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.419
And here's how it goes.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.060
The variance is, by definition,
the expected value

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.290
of something, of this
expression.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.500
And we can estimate expected
values by taking several

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.150
samples of this quantity, and
taking the average of them.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.530
So if we have n pieces of data,
for each piece of data,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.900
we calculate this quantity,
divide by n.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.290
And by the weak law of large
numbers, this is the sample

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.100
mean of this particular
random variable.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.480
And it converges to
the expected value

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.250
of this random variable.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.590
So that's how we could estimate
the variance.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.470
But there is a catch.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.760
This expression here
involves the mean

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.280
of the random variable.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.640
And this is something
that we do not know.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.570
So what can we do?

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.630
Well, we have an estimate for
the mean, so we could just

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.750
plug in that estimate instead
of the true value.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.440
And this gives us this
alternative expression.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.590
Now, when n is very large, as n
increases, this sample mean

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.800
converges to the true mean.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.040
So this expression here would
become closer and closer to

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.500
this expression.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.700
Now, this expression converges
to sigma squared, and we

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.960
conclude from this that this
expression will also converge

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.460
to sigma squared.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.360
And so here we have a way of
estimating sigma squared from

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.840
the data, and by taking the
square root, we obtain an

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.120
estimate of sigma as well that
we can plug in in this

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.290
expression.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.420
And this gives us a complete
way of coming up with

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.880
confidence intervals when we
only have data available in

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.460
our hands, but do not know ahead
of time what sigma is.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.570
Some remarks.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.040
This procedure of constructing
confidence intervals involves

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.330
two separate approximations.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.620
One approximation has to do with
the fact that the sample

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.810
mean is approximately normal
according to the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.540
central limit theorem.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.500
And then there is a second
approximation that comes in in

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.930
using an estimate of sigma
instead of the

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.010
true value of sigma.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.350
Now, when we estimate sigma
instead of using the true

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.550
value, we're introducing
some additional

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.890
randomness in this procedure.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.460
And because of this randomness,
the confidence

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.900
intervals actually should
be a little larger.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.670
There is a systematic way of
doing that, and it involves

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.860
using the so-called
t-distribution tables.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.500
And those tables are going to
give us certain numbers that

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.310
are a little different from
what we have here.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.500
So instead of 1.96, we might
have a somewhat larger number.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.300
This correction is relevant
when n is a small number,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.050
let's say n smaller than 30.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.130
But for larger values of n, this
correction, where we use

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.860
t tables instead of normal
tables, is rather

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.060
insignificant and one doesn't
bother with it.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.910
In any case, we will not discuss
any further this

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.720
additional correction, but it
is useful to know that it is

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.450
something that the statisticians
will often do.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.990
Finally, one last remark.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.610
One will often see an
alternative way of estimating

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.870
the variance where instead of
this factor of 1/n, one uses a

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.840
factor of 1 over n minus 1.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.190
With this alternative form, it
turns out that this is an

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.990
unbiased estimator
of the variance.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.650
And that could be a reason for
preferring to use this

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.110
alternative form.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.080
On the other hand, when n is
large, whether we use n or n

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.410
minus 1 makes very little
difference.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.490
And this concludes
our discussion

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.740
of confidence intervals.
