00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.890
As an introduction to the main
topic of this lecture

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.520
sequence, let us go through a
simple example and on the way,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.830
review what we have
learned so far.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.670
The example that we're going
to consider involves three

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.660
tosses of a biased coin.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.150
It's a coin that results in
heads with probability p.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.350
We're going to make this
a little more precise.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.560
And the coin is biased in the
sense that this number p is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.250
not necessarily the
same as one half.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.130
We represent this particular
probabilistic experiment in

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.290
terms a tree that shows us the
different stages of the

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.570
experiment.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.710
Each particular branch
corresponds to a sequence of

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.710
possible results in the
different stages, and the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.500
leaves of this tree correspond
to the possible outcomes.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.030
The branches of this tree are
annotated by certain numbers,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.810
and these numbers are to be
interpreted appropriately as

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.360
probabilities or conditional
probabilities.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.190
So for example, this number
here is interpreted as the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.930
probability of heads in the
first toss, an event that we

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.140
denote as H1.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.800
This number here is to be
interpreted as a conditional

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.150
probability.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.760
It's the conditional probability
of obtaining heads

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.900
in the second toss given
that the first

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.230
toss resulted in heads.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.900
And finally, this number here
is to be interpreted as the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.650
conditional probability of heads
in the third toss, given

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.510
that the first toss resulted in
heads and the second toss

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.390
also resulted in heads.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.086
Let us now continue with
some calculations.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.070
First, we're going to practice
the multiplication rule, which

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.539
allows us to calculate
the probability

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.400
of a certain outcome.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.690
In this case, the outcome of
interest is tails followed by

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.990
heads followed by tails.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.070
So we're talking about this
particular outcome here.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.580
According to the multiplication
rule, to find

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.320
the probability of a particular
final outcome, we

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.590
multiply probabilities and
conditional probabilities

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.980
along the path that leads to
this particular outcome.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.790
So in this case, it's (1 minus
p) times p times (1 minus p).

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.280
Let us now calculate
the probability

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.210
of a certain event.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.760
The event of interest is the
event that we obtain exactly

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.579
one head in the three tosses.

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.200
This is an event that can
happen in multiple ways.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.280
Here is one possibility where
we have a single head.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.360
Here's another possibility.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.860
And here's a third one.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.740
These are the three possible
ways that we can have exactly

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.160
one head, depending
on where exactly

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.210
that single head appears.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.550
Is it in the first toss, in the
second, or in the third.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.520
To find the total probability of
this event, we need to add

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.950
the probability of the different
outcomes that

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.450
correspond to this event.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.490
The probability of this outcome
is p times (1 minus p)

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.420
squared, the probability of
this outcome is what we

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.180
calculated.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.490
It's, again, p times (1
minus p) squared.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.460
And the probability of the third
one is also p times 1

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.829
minus p squared.

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.290
So the answer is 3p times
(1 minus p) squared.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.390
Notice that each one of the 3
different ways that this event

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.620
can happen have the
same probability.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.270
So these 3 outcomes are
equally likely.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.390
Finally, let us calculate a
conditional probability.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.420
And this is essentially
the Bayes rule.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.250
Suppose that we were told that
there was exactly one head.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.590
So in particular, the blue
event has occurred.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.820
And we're interested in the
probability that the first

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.940
toss is heads, which
corresponds

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.080
to this event here.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.710
These are all the outcomes
in which the first

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.140
toss is equal to heads.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.350
So given that the blue event
happened, what is the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.710
probability that the green
event happens?

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.579
You can guess the answer,
that it should be 1/3.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.870
Why is that?

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.420
Each one of these blue
outcomes has the same

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.440
probability.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.250
So when you condition on the
blue outcome having happened,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.710
the conditional probability
of each one of

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.810
these should be 1/3.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.100
So given that the blue outcome
happened, there's probability

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.010
1/3 that this particular
one has happened.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.450
And this is the only one that
makes the green event happen.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.550
But let us see if we
can derive this

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.330
answer in a formal manner.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.740
Let's see if we're
going to get 1/3.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.520
We use the definition of
conditional probabilities.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.360
The conditional probability is
the ratio, first, of the

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.920
probability that both events
happen, divided by the

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.610
probability of the conditioning
event, which is

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.486
the probability of 1 head.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.620
Now, the probability of
both events happening.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.910
That we have exactly one head
and the first toss is heads.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.950
This is the intersection of the
blue event and the green

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.150
event which can happen only in
this particular outcome,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.360
namely the sequence heads,
tails, tails.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.230
And has probability p times
(1 minus p) squared.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.840
The denominator is something
that we have already

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.680
calculated.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.930
It's 3p times (1 minus
p) squared.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.855
And so the final answer is
1/3 as we had guessed.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.100
Let me now make a few comments
about this particular example.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.310
This particular example is
pretty special in the

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.400
following respect.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.375
We have that of the probability
of H2, heads in

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:09.610
the second toss, given that the
first one was heads, is

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.190
equal to p.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.100
And the same is true for the
conditional probability of

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:22.390
heads in the second toss given
that the first one was tails.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.540
In other words, our beliefs
about what may happen in the

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.130
second toss remain the same.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.690
There's a probability, p, of
obtaining heads no matter what

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.900
happened in the first toss.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.880
Telling you the result of the
first toss doesn't change your

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.450
beliefs about what may happen,
and with what probability, in

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.930
the second toss.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.470
And if you were to calculate the
unconditional probability

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:54.310
of heads in the second toss,
what you would get using the

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.370
total probability theorem
would be the following.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.450
It's probability of heads in
the first toss times the

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.330
probability of heads in the
second, given heads in the

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:10.710
first, plus the probability of
tails in the first toss times

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.900
the probability of heads in the
second toss, given tails

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.320
in the first.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.910
And if you do the algebra,
this turns out to

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.560
be equal to p again.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.660
So the unconditional probability
of heads in the

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.180
second toss turns out to be the
same as the conditional

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.500
probabilities.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.000
Again, knowing what happened
in the first toss doesn't

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.780
change your beliefs about the
second toss, which were

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.890
associated with this particular
probability, p.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.490
So what we're going to do next
is to generalize this special

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.190
situation by giving a definition
of independence of

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.920
events, and then discuss
various properties and

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.610
concepts associated
with independence.
