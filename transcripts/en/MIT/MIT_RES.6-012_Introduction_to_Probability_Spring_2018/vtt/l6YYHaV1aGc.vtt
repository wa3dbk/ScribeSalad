00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.180
Let us now illustrate, with an
example, the calculations of n

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.870
step transition probabilities
that we have just discussed.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.670
In this example, we are given
a two state Markov chain,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.510
and as part of the input,
the one step transition

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.900
probabilities between
these two states.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.070
So, given that you
are in state one,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.990
the probability that you will
next go to state two is 0.5,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.610
and the probability that you
will stay in state one is 0.5.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.780
And, given that you
are in state two,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.770
the probability that you will
next go to state one is 0.2,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.220
and the probability that you
will stay in state two is 0.8.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.480
Now, suppose that you
start in state one,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.240
and you would like to calculate
the probability of being

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.900
in state one after n
transitions, or after n steps.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:11.200
With our notation
here, this is r11 of n.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.130
That probability can
happen in two ways.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:24.360
After n minus 1 steps,
you end up in state one,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.150
and then for the
last transition,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:35.770
you stay in state one, or after
the first n minus 1 transition,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.270
you end up in
state two, and then

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.229
you transition
back to state one.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.500
Assuming that you start
again in state one,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.320
and you would like to calculate
the probability that you end up

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.009
in state two after n steps,
you could apply the same logic,

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.110
but these are probabilities.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.030
And given that you started
in state one, after n steps,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.030
you will either be in
state one or in state two.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.340
So r12 of n is simply
1 minus r11 of n.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.970
And this system
of two recursions

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.120
is enough to propagate
r11 of n and r12 of n

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.770
as a function of n.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.360
Let us do it and
fill the blanks here.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.160
As indicated before,
the case for n

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.550
equals 0 or n equals 1
are simple and do not

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.370
require the use of
the recursions here.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.380
So for example, for n equals
0, r11 of 0 will simply be 1,

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.610
and so as a result,
r12 of 0 will be 0.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.680
And again, r22 of 0 will be
1, and as a result, r21 of 0

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.900
will be 0.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.850
For n equals 1, these are the
simple one step transition

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.310
probabilities.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.450
So you have 0.5
here, and 0.5 here,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:29.680
and r21 here are 0.2 and 0.8.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.829
The next cases for n equals
2 become more interesting.

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:42.411
So, to reach n equals 2,
r11 of 2, two options again.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:46.360
You can go this way
with a probability 0.5,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:54.190
or you can go from that to
here with a probability 0.2.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.290
So here, we obtain total
probability of 0.25, here,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.660
a probability of 0.10,
and when you sum these two

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:12.910
probabilities, you obtain
0.35, which is r11 of 2.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:20.690
As a result, you get
0.65 for r12 of 2.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.110
Then you can follow the
same process for n equals 3,

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.790
n equals 4, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.910
I will not do it
here, but this would

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.680
be an interesting
exercise for you

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.700
to do the next
several steps, perhaps

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.230
within an Excel spreadsheet.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.200
But suppose that I tell you
the number for n equals 100

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.659
and I tell you that the
number that you obtain here

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.370
is about 2/7.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.790
So as a result, the numbers
that you are going to have here

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.783
is about 5/7.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.580
Let us then apply this
simple recursion in order

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.934
to find the values
here for n equals 101.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:30.360
r11 of 101 will be 2/7 times
0.5 plus 5/7 times 0.2.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:42.030
Will be 1/7 for the first one
plus 1/7 for the second one,

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.220
and so we obtain again 2/7.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.860
And if you do the
same calculation,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.100
you will end up with 5/7 here.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.610
This is an interesting fact.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.850
When the system
starts in state one,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.120
the probability that I
find myself in state one

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.360
after a long period
of time seems

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.130
to converge to a constant
value, in that case,

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.080
to the constant value of 2/7.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.330
Assume now that you want to do
the same calculation for r21

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.410
and r22.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.410
In other words, you
start in state two

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.820
and you are
interested in knowing

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.480
the evolution of these
r21 of n and r22 of n

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.680
as a function of n.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.350
Again, I will let you do
it, but I can tell you

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.030
that these
probabilities will also

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.550
seem to converge to a
constant, and in fact,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.680
will converge to something
that is exactly the same, 2/7

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:56.730
here and 5/7 here.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.870
This is a second
interesting fact.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.580
Irrespective of where we
started, either from state one

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.630
or from state two, the
probability of being in a state

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.480
one after a long
period of time seems

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.980
to converge to the
same constant, 2/7.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.800
So in some sense, for
that particular example,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.080
the importance of
the initial state

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.910
vanishes as time
goes by and does not

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.780
influence long
term probabilities

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.880
of being in any
of the two states.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.159
Note that this is not true
at the beginning starting

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:36.330
at state two.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.060
The picture, after
a few transitions,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.600
will look different than if
you had started from state one.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.930
So the initial state does tell
you something at the beginning,

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.909
but this vanishes
as time goes by.

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:54.040
We describe these
convergence properties

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.900
by saying that the
Markov chain eventually

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.940
enters a steady state.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.840
What does this really mean?

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.940
Does it mean that the
state of the Markov

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.660
chain itself becomes
steady and eventually stops

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.120
at a given place?

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:10.620
No.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.375
The state of the system
will keep jumping forever.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:22.720
What becomes steady are the
probabilities that describe Xn.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.920
After the Markov chain
enters steady state, then,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.560
at any time, if you take a
photo of the system and ask,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.460
what is the probability that
the chain will be in state one

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.030
on that picture, it will be 2/7.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:45.410
By the way, the steady
state of being in state two

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.430
is greater than the steady
state of being in state one.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.920
Does it make sense?

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.750
Yes.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.720
State two is a little bit
more sticky than state one

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.260
in the following sense.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.630
When you get to state
two, the probability

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.190
that you remain in
state two, which is 0.8,

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.000
is greater than the
corresponding probability

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.870
for state one, which is 0.5.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.680
So to conclude,
this Markov chain

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.330
has exhibited some nice
long term properties.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.640
Is this always the case
for any Markov chains?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.790
Let us see.
