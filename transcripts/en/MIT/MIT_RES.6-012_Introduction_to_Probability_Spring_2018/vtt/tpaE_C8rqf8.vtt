00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.430
We now continue with
our example and turn

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.270
to the performance
evaluation question.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.320
As you recall, we
have a Theta that

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.590
has a certain
prior distribution.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.420
We're given a model
for the observations.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.140
We came up with the joint
distribution for X and Theta,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.260
which was uniform on
this particular shape,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.710
and we found that the
least mean squares

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.100
estimator, namely the
conditional expectation

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.020
of Theta given any
particular value of X,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.360
is given by this particular
piecewise linear function.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.780
Now, let us look at the
performance of this estimator.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.970
We judge the performance given
any particular value of X

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.300
by looking at the corresponding
mean squared error, which

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.850
is the square of the distance
between the unknown parameter

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.070
and the estimate with
which we came up.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.640
And as we have discussed,
this is the same

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.860
as the variance of Theta but
in the conditional universe

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.123
where X has been observed.

00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:04.164
It's the variance of the
conditional distribution

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.820
of Theta.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.180
As we have discussed,
if I tell you

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.789
that X takes on this
particular value,

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.590
Theta is uniform
on this interval.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.510
Therefore, the conditional
variance of Theta

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.020
is the variance of a
uniform on an interval

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990
of this particular length.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.789
Now, we know that the
variance of a uniform

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:36.150
on an interval from a to b
is equal to b minus a squared

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.330
divided by 12.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.030
In this particular instance,
the interval has length 2.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.479
Therefore, we have 2
squared divided by 12.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.190
So the variance is equal to 1/3.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.490
This is what we get when
the picture is of this type.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.750
On the other hand, if X
falls in this range, then

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.350
this interval on which Theta
is now constrained to live,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.040
has a smaller length
and we're going

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.220
to get a different variance.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.400
So in order to keep track,
let us come up with a plot.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.440
When X is between 5 and 9, Theta
has a conditional distribution

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.140
which is uniform on an
interval of length 2

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.460
and a variance of 1/3.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.480
And therefore, the variance
is constant, takes this value.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.600
In the extreme case,
when X is equal to 3,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.250
then this interval has 0 length.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.410
In fact, we have
perfect certainty

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.900
about the value of Theta.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.740
If X is equal to 3, then we
know that Theta is equal to 4.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.000
There's no uncertainty.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.510
There's zero variance.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.190
What happens in between?

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.030
As we increase x
moving away from 3,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.500
the length of this interval
increases linearly with x.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.050
And this means that the
variance increases quadratically

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.050
with x, so we have a
quadratic that starts at 0

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.160
and rises to this value.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.310
And by a symmetric
argument, on the other side,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.580
we also get function,
which is 0 at 11,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.570
and which rises quadratically
as x gets reduced from 11 to 9.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.770
So this is a complete plot
of the conditional variance

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.565
of Theta as a function of
the particular observation

00:03:26.565 --> 00:03:29.079
that we have obtained.

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.160
We notice that some x's are
more favorable than others.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.280
An observation equal to
3 is extremely favorable

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.070
because it tells
us unambiguously

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.420
the value of Theta.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.760
But other choices of x,
other possible observations,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.190
will lead to more
uncertainty in Theta,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.970
and this is reflected
in this diagram.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.360
In case we are now interested in
the overall mean squared error,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.490
then we have to
calculate the average

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.470
of this conditional variance
where the average is taken over

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.630
all values of X.
This is going to be

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:19.910
an integral of the conditional
variance of Theta integrated

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.590
over all possibilities for x.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.410
But, of course, each
possibility of x

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.160
has to be weighted according to
the corresponding probability,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.970
or in this case, probability
density function of X.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.760
What is the PDF of X?

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.900
It is not a given
to us, but it is

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.510
something that can
be easily determined

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.860
from what we have already done.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.409
We know the joint
distribution of Theta and X,

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.830
and whenever we know the joint
we can also find the marginal.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.090
So once we find the
marginal PDF of X,

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.640
then we can plug it in,
multiply by this function

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.350
that we have already obtained,
carry out the integration,

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.550
and we will end up
with a numerical value.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.530
Since it is an average
of what we have here,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.250
it's going to end up being
some number between 0 and 1/3.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.950
It's the average of these
values, and closer to 1/3

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.600
rather than 0.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.930
And this would complete
the way that a performance

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.432
of a particular
estimator gets evaluated.
