00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.420
Let us now go
through an example.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.700
Suppose that we have an
unknown random variable

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.240
Theta that has a uniform
distribution between 4 and 10.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.850
We observe some
other random variable

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.790
X that's related
to Theta according

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.500
to the following model.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.120
This is the conditional
distribution of X given Theta.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.400
For any given value
of theta, X is

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.960
going to take values between
theta minus 1 and theta plus 1.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.760
And the conditional distribution
is uniform on that range.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.740
One way of thinking about this
particular observation model

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.220
is that what we observe
is the true value

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.120
of Theta plus some noise term.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.950
And this noise term is
uniform on the range

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.770
from minus 1 to plus 1.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.960
So given a value
of Theta, we may

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.460
observe anything, because
of noise, that's up to one

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.260
lower or one higher than
the true value of Theta.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.590
And if we take this description,
actually, this random variable

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.140
U has this distribution
no matter what Theta is.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.810
And therefore, U is
independent of Theta.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.970
But in any case, this particular
interpretation will not matter.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.640
Let us see how do we proceed.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.610
In Bayesian estimation,
the first step

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.880
is always to put our
hands on the posterior

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.710
distribution of Theta.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.430
And to find the
posterior, we can

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.289
start by first
finding the joint.

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.160
So let us look at
the x theta plane.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.630
That's where the joint
distribution is going to live.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.100
And our first step
will be to locate

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.420
those values of X and
Theta that are possible,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.020
given our description.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.600
From this model here, we
know that theta minus 1

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.270
is going to be less
than or equal to x.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.270
And x is going to be less
than or equal to theta plus 1.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.620
And we translate this
into two inequalities,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.350
namely that theta is less
than or equal to x plus 1,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.920
and from here, that
theta is larger

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.590
than or equal to x minus 1.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.340
So these are the
constraints that we

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.760
have on the possible
values of x and theta.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.340
So here we plot the line where
theta is equal to x plus one.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.079
And here we plot
the line on which

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.030
theta is equal to x minus 1.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.900
And these two inequalities
that we've got here

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.410
tell us that we need to live
somewhere in between those two

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.910
lines.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.850
In addition, we have
the fact that theta

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.130
lives between 4 and 10.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.300
And that places these
two limits as well.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.680
So to summarize, this
shape here is the set

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.750
off all possible x's and thetas.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.170
Outside this shape, the joint
PDF is going to be zero.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.930
What is it going
to be inside here?

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.370
Well, because the
prior is uniform,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.730
that is, it is constant, and
the model is also uniform,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.260
to obtain the joint
we multiply these two.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.360
And since they are
constant, we obtain

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.829
a joint that's also constant.

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:31.850
So the joint PDF is equal
to a constant over that set.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.560
We can easily calculate
the area of this set.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.810
It is 12.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.960
So the joint is equal to
1 over 12 inside this set.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.140
And of course, it's 0 elsewhere.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.960
So we have a uniform joint PDF.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.440
Now, let us look
at the posterior.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.930
If I tell you that X takes
on this specific value,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.290
this means that we now
live in this universe.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.810
And it means that all of
those thetas are possible.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.950
The posterior
distribution is going

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.800
to be a distribution
that tells us

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.700
the probabilities of
these different thetas.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.060
What kind of distribution is it?

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.649
Well, we know that the
conditional is just

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:19.870
a section out of the joint
but keeps, otherwise,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.190
the same shape.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.260
Since the joint is constant,
it's uniform over that set,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.260
it means that the posterior,
or the conditional,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.000
is also constant over that set.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.909
So the conclusion is that the
posterior distribution of Theta

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:41.230
is a uniform
distribution on this set.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.590
Given this knowledge, what is
the conditional expectation?

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.110
The conditional
expectation of a uniform

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.930
is just the midpoint
of that uniform.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.409
And so this is going to
be our estimate of Theta,

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:58.720
the conditional
expectation of Theta,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.610
given the observation
that we have obtained.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.460
And then a similar
argument applies no matter

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.890
what x we have obtained.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.130
For any given x, our
estimate is going

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.855
to be the midpoint of the
corresponding interval.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.380
So what kind of shape
do we get by doing this,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.870
by joining the mid-points?

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.530
It's going to be a straight
line over this region.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.880
It's also going to be a
straight line over this region

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.560
except that, because
of the change in shape,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.500
it's going to be a straight
line with a different slope.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.280
And similarly, in
this region, it's

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.740
also going to be a straight
line with a different slope.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.350
So what have we plotted here?

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.810
For any given
value of X, we have

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.790
plotted the corresponding
conditional expectation

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.960
of Theta given that value of
X. And as a function of x, this

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.050
gives us a certain curve.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.800
And this blue curve
that we have calculated

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.000
is a particular function of x.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.230
And we can think
of this function g

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.440
as being our estimator.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.310
So the way we're
going to be processing

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.620
the data will be that
whenever we obtain an x,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.650
we apply this
particular function g.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.711
And we come up with an estimate.
