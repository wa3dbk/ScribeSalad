00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.480
So we looked at the formal
definition of what it means

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.210
for a sequence to converge, but
as a practical matter, how

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.080
can we tell whether a given
sequence converges or not?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.309
There are two criteria that are
the most commonly used for

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.690
that purpose, and it's useful
to be aware of them.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.210
The first one deals with the
case where we have a sequence

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.500
of numbers that keep increasing,
or at least, they

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.380
do not go down.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.210
In that case, those numbers may
go up forever without any

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.180
bound, so if you look at any
particular value, there's

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.740
going to be a time at which
the sequence has

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.700
exceeded that value.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.350
In that case, we say
that the sequence

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.680
converges to infinity.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.810
But if this is not the case,
if it does not converge to

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.800
infinity, which means that
the entries of the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.180
sequence are bounded--

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.230
they do not grow arbitrarily
large--

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.360
then, in that case, it is
guaranteed that the sequence

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.760
will converge to a
certain number.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.180
This is not something that we
will attempt to prove, but it

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.900
is a useful fact to know.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.580
Another way of establishing
convergence is to derive some

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.060
bound on the distance or our
sequence from the number that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.440
we suspect to be the limit.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.039
If that distance becomes smaller
and smaller, if we can

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.550
manage to bound that distance
by a certain number and that

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.789
number goes down to 0, then it
is guaranteed that since this

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.900
distance goes down to 0,
that the sequence, ai,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.850
converges to a.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.400
And there's a variation of this
argument, which is the

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.330
so-called sandwich argument,
and it goes as follows.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.050
If we have a certain sequence
that converges to some number,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.090
a, and we have another sequence
that converges to

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.070
that same number, a, and our
sequence is somewhere

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.750
in-between, then our sequence
must also converge to that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.620
particular number, a.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.040
So these are the usual ways of
quickly saying something about

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.970
the convergence of a given
sequence, and we will be often

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.160
using this type of argument in
this class, but without making

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.190
a big fuss about them, or
without even referring to

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.990
these facts in an
explicit manner.
