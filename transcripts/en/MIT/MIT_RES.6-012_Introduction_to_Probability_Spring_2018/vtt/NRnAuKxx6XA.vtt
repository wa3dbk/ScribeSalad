00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.460
As a warm-up towards finding
the distribution of the

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.860
function of random variables,
let us start by considering

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.200
the discrete case.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.160
So let X be a discrete random
variable and let Y be defined

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.190
as a given function of X. We
know the PMF of X and wish to

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.130
find the PMF of Y. Here's
a simple example.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.800
The random variable X takes the
values 2, 3, 4, and 5 with

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.049
the probabilities given in the
figure, and Y is the function

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.870
indicated here.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.000
Then, for example, the
probability that Y takes a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.780
value of 4.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.500
This is also the value of the
PMF of Y evaluated at 4.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.610
This is simply the sum of the
probabilities of the possible

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.890
values of X that give
rise to a value of Y

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.870
that is equal to 4.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.670
Therefore, this expression is
equal to the probability that

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.100
X equals to 4 plus the
probability that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.560
X is equal to 5.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.140
Or, in PMF notation, we can
write it in this manner.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.990
And in this numerical example,
it would be 0.3 plus 0.4.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.890
More generally, for any given
value of little y, the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.520
probability that the random
variable capital Y takes this

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.280
particular value is the sum of
the probabilities of the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.150
little x that result in
that particular value.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.070
So the probability that the
random variable capital Y,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.100
which is the same as g of X,
takes on a specific value is

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.060
the sum of the probabilities
of all possible values of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.140
little x where we only consider
those values of

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.040
little x that give rise to the
specific value, little y, that

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.080
you're interested.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.728
Let us now look into the special
case where we have a

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:12.420
linear function of a discrete
random variable.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.060
Suppose that X is described by
the PMF shown in this diagram,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.500
and let us consider the random
variable Z, which is defined

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.950
as 2 times X. We would like
to plot the PMF of Z.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.540
First, let us note the values
that Z can take.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.340
When X is equal to minus
1, Z is going to be

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.960
equal to minus 2.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.280
When X is equal to 1, Z is
going to be equal to 2.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.870
And when X is equal to 2, Z
is going to be equal to 4.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.590
This event that X is equal
to minus 1 happens with

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.460
probability 2/6, and when that
event happens, Z will take a

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.980
value of minus 2.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.590
So this event happens with
probability 2/6.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.560
With probability 1/6, X takes a
value of 1 so that Z takes a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.320
value of 2.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.210
And this happens with
probability 1/6.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.830
6 And finally, this last
event here happens

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.810
with probability 3/6.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.930
We have thus found the PMF of Z.
Notice that it has the same

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.100
shape as the PMF of X, except
that it is stretched or scaled

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.300
horizontally by a factor of 2.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.020
Let us now consider the random
variable Y, defined as 2X plus

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.640
3, or what is the same
as Z plus 3.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.960
With probability 2/6, Z
is equal to minus 2.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.350
And in that case, Y is going
to be equal to plus 1.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.180
And this event happens
with probability 2/6.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.700
With probability 1/6, Z takes
a value of 2 so that Y it

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.510
takes a value of 5.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.390
And finally, with probability
3/6, Z takes a value of 4 so

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.860
that Y it takes a value of 7.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.990
What we see here is that the PMF
of Y has exactly the same

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.270
shape as the PMF of Z, except
that it is shifted to the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.530
right by 3.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.390
To summarize, in order to find
the PMF of a linear function

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.909
such as 2X plus 3, what we do
is that we first stretch the

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.070
PMF of X by a factor of
2 and then shift it

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.110
horizontally by 3.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.620
We can also describe the PMF
of Y through a formula.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.510
For any given value of little
y, the PMF is going to be

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.390
equal to the probability that
our random variable Y takes on

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.990
the specific value little y.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.140
Then we recall that Y has been
defined in our example to be

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.230
equal to 2X plus 3, so we're
looking at the probability of

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.940
this event.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.040
But this is the same as the
event that X takes a value

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:22.240
equal to y minus
3 divided by 2.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.170
And in PMF notation, we can
write it in this form.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.200
So what this is saying is that
the probability that Y takes

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.380
on a specific value is the same
as the probability that X

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.180
takes on some other
specific value.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.950
And that value here is that
value of X that would give

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.300
rise to this particular
value little y.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.680
Now, we can generalize the
calculation that we just did.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.540
And more generally, if we have
a linear function of a

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.220
discrete random variable X, the
PMF of the random variable

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.590
Y is given by this formula in
terms of the PMF of the random

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.460
variable X. The derivation
is the same.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.330
We use b instead the specific
number 3, and we have a

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.280
general constant a instead
of the 2 that

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.050
we had in this example.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.660
And this formula describes
exactly what we did

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.120
graphically in our
previous example.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.720
This factor of a here serves to
stretch the PMF by a factor

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:39.690
of a, and this term b here
serves to shift the PMF by b.
