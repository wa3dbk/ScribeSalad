00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.410
We now continue our discussion
of infinite series.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.350
Sometimes we have to deal with
series where the terms being

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.710
added are indexed by multiple
indices, as in

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.220
this example here.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.710
We're given numbers, aij,
and i ranges over all

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.390
the positive integers.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.910
j also ranges over all the
positive integers.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.250
So what does this
sum represent?

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.480
We can think of it as follows.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.330
We have here a two-dimensional
grid that corresponds to all

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.750
the pairs (i,j).

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.290
And in essence, each one of
those points corresponds to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.280
one of the terms that
we want to add.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.840
So we can sum the different
terms in some arbitrary order.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.430
Let's say we start from here.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.950
Take that term, add this term,
then add this term here, then

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.570
add this term, then the next
term, next term, and so on.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.640
And we can keep going that
way, adding the different

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.850
terms according to
some sequence.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.220
So essentially, what we're doing
here is we're taking

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.470
this two-dimensional grid and
arranging the terms associated

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.950
with that grid, in some
particular linear order.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.090
And we're summing those
terms in sequence.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.220
As long as this sum converges to
something as we keep adding

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.010
more and more terms, then
this double series

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.800
will be well defined.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.930
Notice, however, we can
add those terms in

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.100
many different orders.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.320
And in principle, those
different orders might give us

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.490
different kinds of results.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.979
On the other hand, as long as
the sum of the absolute values

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.090
of all the terms turns out to be
finite, then the particular

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.190
order in which we're adding the
different terms will turn

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.240
out that it doesn't matter.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.620
There's another way that we can
add the terms together,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.500
and this is the following.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.860
Let us consider fixing a
particular choice of i, and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.000
adding all of the terms that
are associated with this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.300
particular choice of i, as j
ranges from 1 to infinity.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.980
So what we're doing is we're
taking the summation from j

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.160
equal to 1 to infinity, while
keeping the value of i fixed.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.450
We do this for every
possible i.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.970
So for every possible i,
we're going to get

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.810
a particular number.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.360
And then we take the numbers
that we obtain for the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.170
different choices if i, so i
ranges from 1 to infinity.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.700
And we add all those
terms together.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.230
So this is one particular order,
one particular way of

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.720
doing the infinite summation.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.600
Now, why start with the
summation over j's while

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.090
keeping i fixed?

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.790
There's no reason for that.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.410
We could also carry out the
summation by fixing a

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.880
particular choice of j and
summing over all i's.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.500
So now it is i that ranges
from 1 to infinity.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.650
And we look at this
infinite sum.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.170
This is the infinite
sum of those terms.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.780
We obtain one such infinite
sum for every choice of j.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.720
And then we take that sum that
we obtain for any particular

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.880
choice of j, and add
over the different

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.860
possible values of j.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.510
So j goes from 1 to infinity.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.700
This is a different way of
carrying out the summation.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.490
And these are going to give us
the same result, and the same

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.610
result that we would also obtain
if we were to add the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.060
terms in this particular order,
as long as the double

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.020
series is well-defined, in
the following sense.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.030
If we have a guarantee that the
sum of the absolute values

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.970
of those numbers is finite, no
matter which way we add them,

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.110
then it turns out that we can
use any particular order to

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.810
add the terms in the series.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.750
We're going to get
the same result.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.540
And we can also carry out the
double summation by doing--

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.440
by adding over one
index at a time.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.540
A word of caution--

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.690
this condition is not
always satisfied.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.970
And in those cases, strange
things can happen.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.620
Suppose that the sequences we're
dealing with, the aij's,

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.110
take those particular values
indicated in this picture.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.450
And all the remaining terms, the
aij's associated with the

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.150
other dots, are all 0's.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.930
So all these terms out
there will be 0's.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.230
If we carry out the summation by
fixing a j and adding over

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:19.270
all i's, what we get here is 0,
and a 0, and a 0, and a 0.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.020
That's because in each row we
have a 1 and a minus 1, which

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.560
cancel out and give us 0's.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.960
So if we carry out the summation
in this manner, we

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.940
get a sum of 0's, which is 0.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.540
But if we carry out the
summation in this order, fix

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.380
an i, and then add over all j's,
the first term that we

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.270
get here is going to be 1,
because in this column, this

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.980
is the only non-zero number.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.510
And then in the remaining
columns, as we add the terms,

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.060
we're going to get 0's,
and 0's, and so on.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.970
And so if we carry out the
summation in this way, we

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.500
obtain a 1.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.010
So this is an example that shows
you that the order of

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.670
summation actually may matter.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.160
In this example, the sum of the
absolute values of all of

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.780
the terms that are involved is
infinity, because we have

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.780
infinitely many plus or minus
1's, so this condition here is

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.210
not satisfied in this example.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.110
Let us now consider the case
where we want to add the terms

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.800
of a double sequence, but over
a limited range of indices as

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.490
in this example, where we have
coefficients aij, which we

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.690
want to add, but only for those
i's and j's for which j

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.580
is less than or equal to i.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.420
Graphically, this means that we
only want to consider the

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.909
pairs shown in this picture.

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:04.470
So these points here correspond
to i,j pairs for

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.690
which i is equal to j.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.200
Terms on the right, or points
to the right, correspond to

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.400
i,j pairs for which i is
at least as large as j.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.550
We can carry out this summation
in two ways.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.740
One way is the following.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.720
We fix a value of i, and
we consider all of the

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.550
corresponding terms, that
correspond to different

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.640
choices of j.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.320
But we only go up to the point
where i is equal to j.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.230
This is the largest term.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.159
So what are we doing here?

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:46.960
We're taking the coefficients
aij, and we are adding over

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.360
all j's, starting from 1, which

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.840
corresponds to this term.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.560
And j goes up to the point where
it becomes equal to i.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.330
We do this for every
value of i.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.470
And so we get a number for the
sum of each one of the

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:10.650
columns, and then we add
those numbers together.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.350
So we're adding over all
i's, and i ranges

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.300
from 1 up to infinity.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.670
This is one way of carrying
out the summation.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.770
Alternatively, we could fix a
value of j, and consider doing

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.090
the summation over
all choices of i.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.039
So this corresponds to
the sum over all

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.169
choices of i, from where?

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:39.690
The smallest term, the first
term, happens when i is equal

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.780
to the value of j.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.610
And then we have larger choices
of i, numbers for

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.880
which i is bigger than the
corresponding value of j.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.460
And so i ranges from j all
the way to infinity.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.260
And this is the sum over one of
the rows in this diagram.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.140
We do this for every j.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.130
We get a result, and then
we need to add all

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.840
those results together.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:15.170
So we're summing for all j's
from 1 up to infinity.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:20.050
So these are two different ways
that we can evaluate this

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.550
series associated with
a double sequence.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.060
We can either add over all j's
first and then over i's, or we

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:33.960
can sum over all i's first,
and then over all j's.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.010
The two ways of approaching this
problem, this summation,

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.210
should give us the
same answer.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.210
And this is going to be, again,
subject to the usual

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.440
qualification.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.830
As long as the sum of the
absolute values of the terms

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.320
that we're trying to add
is less than infinity--

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.800
if this condition is true, then
the two ways of carrying

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.650
out the summation are equal, and
they're just two different

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:03.900
alternatives.
