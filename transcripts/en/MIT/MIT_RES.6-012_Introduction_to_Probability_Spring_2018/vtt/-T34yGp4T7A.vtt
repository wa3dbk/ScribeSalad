00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.350
This is an example,
or rather, a story,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.360
that's supposed to
give us some insight

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.400
and some intuition
about what the law

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.320
of iterated expectations
really means.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.870
Suppose that you work for
a forecasting company.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.329
And suppose that
you make forecasts

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.070
by calculating expected
values of the quantities

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.430
that you want to forecast.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.650
And of course, when you
calculate an expected value,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.880
you always use whatever
information you have.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.070
So here we have the
beginning of the year.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.910
And you're working
for a company that's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.160
trying to forecast the sales
during the month of February.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.450
That's a random
variable, capital

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.160
X. You're sitting in your office
in the beginning of the year.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.210
What is going to
be your forecast?

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.550
It's going to be the expected
value of the random variable X.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.220
So this is a forecast that you
make at this point in time.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.050
Now, time goes by,
and we're sitting now

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.590
in the beginning of February
or the end of January.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.270
At that time, you obtain
some new information,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.380
which is the value, little y,
of a random variable, capital

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.270
Y. What should your
new forecast be?

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.500
Well, once you have this
information in your hands,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.140
your new forecast should
be the expected value

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.150
of x, given the specific
available information

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.440
that you have.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.840
So this is the
revised forecast as

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.600
calculated at the
end of January.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.220
But if you're sitting here
in the beginning of the year

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.229
and you ask yourself, what
is the revised forecast going

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.220
to be, your answer
would be, I don't

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.670
know what it's going to be.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.660
It's random.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.880
It depends on what capital
Y would end up being.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.340
My revised forecast is a random
variable, the expected value

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.220
of X given Y, which will take
this particular numerical value

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.180
if it turns out the
random variable Y

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.880
takes a specific
value, little y.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.020
So this is the
forecast calculated

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.600
at this point in time.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.630
This is the forecast
viewed at the beginning

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.050
of the year, at which
time we do not know yet

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.130
the value of the
revised forecast.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.250
Now, what does the law
of iterated expectations

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.780
tell us in this case?

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.860
It tells us that the expected
value of the revised forecast

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.810
is the same as the
original forecast.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.600
What does this mean
in practical terms?

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.810
It means that given
today's forecast,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.160
the original
forecast, you do not

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.180
expect the next
forecast, the revised

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.110
one, to be higher or lower.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.930
It could be either
higher or lower.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.570
But on the average,
you expect the revision

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.710
of the forecast going
from this one to that one,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.680
the revised one, that
revision on the average,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.490
to be equal to 0.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.540
You do not expect forecasts
to be revised either upwards

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.970
or downwards on the average.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.980
Of course, this is not what
happens always in real life.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.430
So suppose that capital X, the
quantity you're forecasting,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.600
is the cost of some big project.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.430
And your original budget
or original forecast,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.090
expected value of X,
is what you expect

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.300
the cost of the project to be.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.430
Well, from experience
with real life,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.100
we kind of know that
budgets or cost estimates

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.790
tend to be revised upwards
more often than downwards.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.610
Does this real life
fact contradict

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.130
the law of iterated
expectations?

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.570
Well, not really.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.210
What is going on here is that
real life forecasts are not

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.880
really honestly calculated
expected values.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.650
But maybe they're calculated
with some implicit or hidden

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.520
biases so that the
forecasts that are given

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.580
are actually not
the expected values.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.070
So there's no contradiction
between this mathematical fact

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.140
and possible life experiences.
