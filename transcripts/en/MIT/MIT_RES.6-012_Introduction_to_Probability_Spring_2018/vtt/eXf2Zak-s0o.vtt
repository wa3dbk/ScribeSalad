00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.430
In this lecture, we start our
discussion of continuous

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.170
random variables.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.470
We will focus on the case of
a single continuous random

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.280
variable, and we'll describe
its distribution using a

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.380
so-called probability density
function, an object that will

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.290
replace the PMFs from
the discrete case.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.670
We will then proceed to define
the expectation and the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.640
variance of a continuous random
variable, and we'll see

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.610
that their basic properties
remain unchanged.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.330
There will be one
new concept--

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.350
the cumulative distribution
function, which will allow us

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.660
to describe, in a unified
manner, both discrete and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.280
continuous random variables,
even so-called mixed random

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.640
variables that have both
a discrete and

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.940
a continuous component.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.510
In the course of this lecture,
we will also introduce some of

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.420
the most common continuous
random variables--

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.129
uniform, exponential,
and normal.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.730
We will pay special attention to
the normal distribution and

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.680
the ways that we can calculate
the associated probabilities.
