00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.240
In this segment, we will
talk about sets.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.770
I'm pretty sure that most of
what I will say is material

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.540
that you have seen before.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.430
Nevertheless, it is useful to
do a review of some of the

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.640
concepts, the definitions, and
also of the notation that we

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.000
will be using.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.490
So what is a set?

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.530
A set is just a collection
of distinct elements.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.110
So we have some elements, and
we put them together.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.290
And this collection, we
call it the set S.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.000
More formally, how do
we specify a set?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.330
We could specify a set by
listing its elements, and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.360
putting them inside braces.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.190
So this is a set that consists
of four elements, the letters,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.090
a, b, c, d.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.990
Another set could be the set
of all real numbers.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.940
Notice a distinction here--

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.940
the first set is a finite set.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.060
It has a finite number of
elements, whereas the second

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.570
set is infinite.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.460
And in general, sets are
of these two kinds.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.820
Either they're finite,
or their infinite.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.210
A piece of notation now.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.710
We use this notation to indicate
that a certain object

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.840
x is an element of a set S. We
read that as x belongs to S.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.700
If x is not an element of S,
then we use this notation to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.229
indicate it, and we read it
as x does not belong to S.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.130
Now, one way of specifying
sets is as follows.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.160
We start with a bigger
set-- for example,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.070
the set of real numbers--

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.130
and we consider all of those
x's that belong to that big

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.030
set that have a certain
property.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.560
For example, that the cosine of
this number is, let's say,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.320
bigger than 1/2.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.150
This is a way of specifying
a set.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.670
We start with a big set, but
we then restrict to those

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.860
elements of that set that
satisfy a particular property.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.430
One set of particular interest
is the following.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.800
Sometimes in some context, we
want to fix a collection of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.740
all possible objects that we
might ever want to consider,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.410
and that collection
will be a set.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.000
We denote it usually by
omega, and we call it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.840
the universal set.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.040
So having fixed a universal
set, we will only consider

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.400
smaller sets that lie inside
that big universal set.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.520
And once we have a universal
set, we can talk about the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.590
collection of all objects, or
elements, that belong to our

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.010
universal set, but do not belong
to the set S. So that

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.170
would be everything
outside the set S.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.690
Everything outside the set S, we
denote it this way, and we

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.730
call it the complement of the
set S. And it is defined

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.330
formally as follows--

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.000
an element belongs to the
complement of S if x is an

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.640
element of our universal set,
and also x does not belong to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.590
S. Notice that if we take the
complement of the complement--

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.740
that is, anything that does not
belong to the green set--

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.000
we get back the red set.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.930
So what this is saying is that
the complement of the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.905
complement of a set
is the set itself.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.730
Another set of particular
interest is the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.320
so-called empty set.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.480
The empty set is a set that
contains no elements.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.480
In particular, if we take
the complement of

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.050
the universal set--

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.270
well, since the universal set
contains everything, there is

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.510
nothing in its complement, so
its complement is going to be

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.610
the empty set.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.270
Finally, one more piece
of notation.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.579
Suppose that we have two
sets, and one set is

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.180
bigger than the other.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.290
So S is the small set here,
and T is the bigger set.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.100
We denote this relation by
writing this expression, which

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.400
we read as follows--

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.120
S is a subset of the set T.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.300
And what that means is that if
x is an element of S, then

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.930
such an x must be also an
element of T. Note that when S

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.520
is a subset of T, there is also
the possibility that S is

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.540
equal to T. One word
of caution here--

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.960
the notation that we're using
here is the same as what in

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.000
some textbooks is written
this way--

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.230
that is, S is a subset of T, but
can also be equal to T. We

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.320
do not use this notation, but
that's how we understand it.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.970
That is, we allow for the
possibility that the subset is

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.080
equal to the larger set.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.560
Now when we have two sets, we
can talk about their union and

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.860
their intersection.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.930
Let's say that this is set S,
and this is set T. The union

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.540
of the two sets consists of all
elements that belong to

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.980
one set or the other,
or in both.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.470
The union is denoted this way,
and the formal definition is

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:55.310
that some element belongs to the
union if and only if this

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.780
element belongs to one of the
sets, or it belongs to the

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.270
other one of the sets.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.060
We can also form the
intersection of two sets,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.300
which we denote this way,
and which stands for the

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.350
collection of elements that
belong to both of the sets.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.790
So formally, an element belongs
to the intersection of

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.890
two sets if and only
if that element

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.020
belongs to both of them.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.670
So x must be an element of S,
and it must also be an element

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.180
of T.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.630
By the way, we can also define
unions and intersections of

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.580
more than two sets, even of
infinitely many sets.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.140
So suppose that we have an
infinite collection of sets.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.600
Let's denote them by Sn.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.190
So n ranges over, let's say, all
of the positive integers.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.780
So pictorially, you might
think of having one set,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.570
another set, a third set, a
fourth set, and so on, and we

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.970
have an infinite collection
of such sets.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.480
Given this infinite collection,
we can still

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.890
define their union to be the
set of all elements that

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:20.060
belong to one of those sets
Sn that we started with.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.830
That is, an element is going to
belong to that union if and

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:32.300
only if this element belongs
to some of the sets that we

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.550
started with.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.960
We can also define the
intersection of an infinite

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.810
collection of sets.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.010
We say that an element x belongs
to the intersection of

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:55.409
all these sets if and only if
x belongs to Sn for all n.

00:07:55.409 --> 00:08:00.450
So if x belongs to each one of
those Sn's, then we say that x

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.840
belongs to their intersection.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.560
Set operations satisfy certain
basic properties.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.290
One of these we already
discussed.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.100
This property, for example,
is pretty clear.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.740
The union of a set with another
set is the same as the

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.820
union if you consider the two
sets in different orders.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.980
If you take the union of three
sets, you can do it by

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.060
forming, first, the union of
these two sets, and then the

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.700
union with this one; or, do it
in any alternative order.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.330
Both expressions are equal.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.260
Because of this, we do not
really need the parentheses,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.820
and we often write just this
expression here, which is the

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.090
same as this one.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.540
And the same would be true
for intersections.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.920
That is, the intersection of
three sets is the same no

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.030
matter how you put parentheses
around the different sets.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.140
Now if you take a union of a set
with a universal set, you

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.950
cannot get anything bigger than
the universal set, so you

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.970
just get the universal set.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:13.170
On the other hand, if you take
the intersection of a set with

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:19.320
the universal set, what is left
is just the set itself.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.080
Perhaps the more complicated
properties out of this list is

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.790
this one and this one, which
are sort of a distributive

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.100
property of intersections
and unions.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.820
And I will let you convince
yourselves

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.420
that these are true.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.730
The way that you verify them
is by proceeding logically.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:48.510
If x is an element of this, then
x must be an element of

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.580
S, and it must also be an
element of either T or U.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.550
Therefore, it's going to belong
either to this set--

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.720
it belongs to S, and it also
belongs to T-- or it's going

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.150
to be an element of that set--
it belongs to S, and it

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.300
belongs to U.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.920
So this argument shows that
this set here is a

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.580
subset of that set.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.930
Anything that belongs
here belongs there.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.630
Then you need to reverse the
argument to convince yourself

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.840
that anything that belongs here
belongs also to the first

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.890
set, and therefore, the
two sets are equal.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.020
Here, I'm using the following
fact-- that if S is a subset

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.410
of T, and T is a subset of
S, this implies that the

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.640
two sets are equal.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.070
And then you can use a similar
argument to convince

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.190
yourselves about this
equality, as well.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.850
So this is it about basic
properties of sets.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.290
We will be using some of these
properties all of the time

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.850
without making any special
comment about them.
