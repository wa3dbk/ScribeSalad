00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.940
Let us now move from the
abstract to the concrete.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.590
Recall the example that we
discussed earlier where we

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.200
have two rolls of a
tetrahedral die.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.380
So there are 16 possible
outcomes

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.070
illustrated in this diagram.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.370
To continue, now we need to
specify a probability law,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.070
some kind of probability
assignment.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.620
To keep things simple, we're
going to make the assumption

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.390
that the 16 possible outcomes
are all equally likely.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.570
And each outcome has a
probability of 1 over 16.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.870
Given this assumption, we will
now proceed to calculate

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.330
certain probabilities.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.190
Let us look first at the
probability that X, which

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.790
stands the result of the first
roll, is equal to 1.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.590
The way to calculate this
probability is to identify

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.330
what exactly that event is in
our picture of the sample

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.130
space, and then calculate.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.600
The event that X is equal to 1
can happen in four different

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.930
ways that correspond to these
four particular outcomes.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.330
Each one of these outcomes has
a probability of 1 over 16.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.470
The probability of this event
is the sum of the

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.130
probabilities of the outcomes
that it contains.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:32.740
So it is 4 times 1 over 16,
equal to one fourth.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.780
Let now Z stand for the smaller
of the two numbers

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.550
that came up in our two rolls.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:49.460
So for example, if X is 2 and
Y is equal to 3, then Z is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.860
equal to 2, which is the
smaller of the two.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.400
Let us try to calculate the
probability that the smaller

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.050
of the two outcomes
is equal to 4.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.380
Now for the smaller of the two
outcomes to be equal to 4, we

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.370
must have that both X and
Y are equal to 4.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.000
So this outcome here is the only
way that this particular

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.030
event can happen.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.940
Since there's only one outcome
that makes the event happen,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.760
the probability of this event
is the probability of that

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.695
outcome and is equal
to 1 over 16.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.760
For another example, let's
calculate the probability that

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.220
the minimum is equal to 2.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.670
What does it mean that the
minimum is equal to 2?

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.490
It means that one of the dice
resulted in a 2, and the other

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.100
die resulted in a number
that's 2 or larger.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.850
So we could have both
equal to 2.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.340
We could have X equal
to 2, but Y larger.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.100
Or we could have Y equal to
2 and X something larger.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.360
This green event, this green
set, is the set of all

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.770
outcomes for which the
minimum of the two

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.300
rolls is equal to 2.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.060
There's a total of five
such outcomes.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.610
Each one of them has
probably 1 over 16.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.480
And we have discussed that for
finite sets, the probability

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.370
of a finite set is the sum of
the probabilities of the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.780
elements of that set.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.720
So we have five elements
here, each one with

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.760
probability 1 over 16.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.210
And this is the answer
to this problem.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.130
This particular example that we
saw here is a special case

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.920
of what is called a discrete
uniform law.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.770
In a discrete uniform law,
we have a sample

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.925
space which is finite.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.260
And it has n elements.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.030
And we assume that these n
elements are equally likely.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.100
Now since the probability of
omega, the probability of the

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.170
entire sample space, is equal to
1, this means that each one

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.980
of these elements must have
probability 1 over n.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.220
That's the only way that the
sum of the probabilities of

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.610
the different outcomes would be
equal to 1 as required by

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.329
the normalization axiom.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.630
Consider now some subset of the
sample space, an event A

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.840
that, exactly k elements.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.320
What is the probability
of the set A?

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.980
It's the sum of the
probabilities of its elements.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.340
There are k elements.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.760
And each one of them has a
probability of 1 over n.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.570
And this way we can find the
probability of the set A.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.070
So when we have a discrete
uniform probability law, we

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.110
can calculate probabilities by
simply counting the number of

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.120
elements of omega, which is n,
finding the number n, and

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.510
counting the number of elements
of the set A. That's

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.740
the reason why counting
will turn out to be

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.110
an important skill.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.740
And there will be a whole
lecture devoted to this

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.990
particular topic.
