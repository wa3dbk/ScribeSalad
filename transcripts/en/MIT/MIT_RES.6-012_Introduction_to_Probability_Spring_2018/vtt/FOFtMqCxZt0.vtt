00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.730
We now introduce a new of
random variable, the

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.520
exponential random variable.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.360
It has a probability density
function that is determined by

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.740
a single parameter lambda, which
is a positive number.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.250
And the form of the PDF
is as shown here.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.340
Note that the PDF is equal to
0 when x is negative, which

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.510
means that negative values
of X will not occur.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.240
They have zero probability.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.590
And so our random variable is a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.360
non-negative random variable.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.360
The shape of the PDF is as
shown in this diagram.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.740
It's 0 for negative values, and
then for positive values,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.300
it starts off, it starts off
at a value equal to lambda.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.620
This is because if you plug
in x equal to 0 in this

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.680
expression, you get lambda times
e to the 0, which leaves

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.170
you just with lambda.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.230
So it starts off with lambda,
and then it decays

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.200
at the rate of lambda.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.760
Notice that when lambda is
small, the initial value of

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.360
the PDF is small.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.140
But then the decay rate is also
small, so that the PDF

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.280
extends over a large
range of x's.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.190
On the other hand, when lambda
is large, then the PDF starts

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.940
large, so there's a fair amount
of probability in the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.390
vicinity of 0.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.789
But then it decays pretty fast,
so there's much less

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.560
probability for larger
values of x.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.300
Another observation to make
is that the shape of this

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.770
exponential PDF is quite similar
to the shape of the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.550
geometric PDF that we have
seen before, the only

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.280
difference being that here we
have a discrete distribution,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.650
but here we have a continuous
analog of that distribution.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.229
Let's now carry out
a calculation.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.050
Let us fix some positive number
a, and let us calculate

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.550
the probability that our random
variable takes a value

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.390
larger than or equal to a.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.720
So what we're trying to do is
to calculate the probability

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.160
that the random variable
falls inside this

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.890
interval from a to infinity.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.630
Whenever we have a PDF, we can
calculate the probability of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.660
falling inside an interval by
integrating over that interval

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.910
the value of the PDF.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.470
Therefore, we have to calculate

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.790
this particular integral.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.140
And at this point, we can recall
a fact from calculus,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:35.860
namely that the integral of the
function e to the ax is 1

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.030
over a times e to the ax.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.070
We can use this fact by making
the correspondence between a

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.445
and minus lambda.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.680
And using this correspondence,
we can now continue the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.640
calculation of our integral.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.829
We have a factor of lambda.

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.850
And then a factor of
1 over a, where a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.840
stands for minus lambda.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.030
So we get the minus
1 over lambda.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.840
And then the same exponential
function, e to the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.830
minus lambda x.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.070
And because the range of
integration is from a to

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.060
infinity, we need to evaluate
the integral at a and infinity

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.930
and take the difference.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.000
Now, this lambda cancels
that lambda.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.270
We're left with a minus sign.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.710
And from the upper limit, we
get e to the minus lambda

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.790
times infinity.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.780
And then from the second term,
we have a minus sign that

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.810
cancels with that minus sign and
gives us a plus term, plus

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.360
e to the minus lambda a.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.680
Now, e to the minus
infinity is 0.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.160
And so we're left just
with the last term.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.370
And the answer is e to
the minus lambda a.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.480
So this gives us the tail
probability for an exponential

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.660
random variable.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.630
It tells us that the probability
of falling higher

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.120
than a certain number falls off
exponentially with that

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.430
certain number.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.960
An interesting additional
observation--

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.225
if we let a equal to 0 in this
calculation, we obtain the

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:25.050
integral of the PDF over the
entire range of x's.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.780
And in that case, this
probability becomes e to the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.570
minus lambda 0, which
is equal to 1.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.380
So we have indeed verified that
the integral of this PDF

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.880
is equal to 1, as
it should be.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.110
Now, let's move to the
calculation of the expected

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.980
value of this random variable.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.920
We can use the definition.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.340
Since the PDF is non-zero only
for positive values of x, we

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.860
only need to integrate
from 0 to infinity.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.775
We integrate x times the PDF.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.510
And this is an integral that
you may have encountered at

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.860
some point before.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.230
It is evaluated by using
integration by parts.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.570
And the final answer turns
out to be 1 over lambda.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.600
Regarding the calculation of
the expected value of the

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.520
square of the random variable,
we need to write down a

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.710
similar integral, except
that now we

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.300
will have here x squared.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.980
This is just another integration
by parts, only a

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.670
little more tedious.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.670
And the answer turns out to
be 2 over lambda squared.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.600
Finally, to calculate the
variance, we use the handy

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.170
formula that we have.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.540
And the expected value of
X squared is this term.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.060
The expected value of
X is this term.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.520
When we square it, it becomes
similar to this term, but we

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.930
have here a 2.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.180
There we have a 1.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.080
And so we're left with just
1 over lambda squared.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.020
And this is the variance of the

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.970
exponential random variable.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.290
Notice that when lambda is
small, the PDF, as we

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.330
discussed before, falls off very
slowly, which means that

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.290
large x's are also
quite possible.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.360
And so the average of this
random variable will be on the

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.990
higher side.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.350
The PDF extends over a large
range, and that translates

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.440
into having a large mean.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.650
And because when that happens,
the PDF actually spreads, the

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.710
variance also increases.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.190
And this is reflected in this
formula for the variance.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.410
The exponential random variable
is, in many ways,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.200
similar to the geometric.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.630
For example, the expression for
the mean, which is 1 over

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.310
lambda, can be contrasted with
the expression for the mean of

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.770
the geometric, which
is 1 over p.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.570
And the relationship between
these two distributions, the

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.400
discrete and the continuous
analog, is a theme that we

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.930
will revisit several times.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.520
At this point, let me just say
that the exponential random

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.400
variable is used to model
many important

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.490
and real world phenomena.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.050
Generally, it models the time
that we have to wait until

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.500
something happens.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.220
In the discrete case, the
geometric random variable

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.150
models the time until we see a
success for the first time.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.850
In the continuous case, an
exponential can be used to

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.140
model the time until a customer
arrives, the time

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.390
until a light bulb burns out,
the time until a machine

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:05.300
breaks down, the time until you
receive an email, or maybe

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.240
the time until a meteorite
falls on your house.
