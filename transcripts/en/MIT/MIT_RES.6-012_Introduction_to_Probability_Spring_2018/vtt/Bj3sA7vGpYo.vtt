00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.550
Let us now look at some
numerical examples to get a

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.690
feel for how the central limit
theorem works in practice.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.470
Let us look at a discrete random
variable that has a

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.550
uniform distribution in the
range here from 1 to 8.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.360
If we add two independent random
variables, drawn from

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.450
this PMF, we obtain a random
variable whose PMF is the

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.460
convolution of this
PMF with itself.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.380
We can even carry out this
calculation by hand, and we

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.350
get a triangular PMF.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.620
So this is what we get for the
case where n is equal to 2.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.290
Now we can keep doing this.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.650
If we add four of these discrete
uniforms, of course

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.680
assumed independent, then we
obtain a PMF that starts to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.490
have a shape close to that
of a normal shape.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.160
And if you take as many as 32
of them, then the PMF of the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.000
sum of 32 discrete uniforms is
almost identical to the shape

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.410
that you would get if you were
to draw a normal PDF.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.270
So with n as small as 32, we
have essentially converged.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.530
In fact, this convergence is
so good that in practice,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.630
quite often people use this
idea to generate random

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.870
samples of a normal
random variable.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.300
What do you do?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.370
You draw 32 random samples
from a discrete

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.170
uniform, add them up.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.670
And what you get is a sample
of essentially a

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.979
normal random variable.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.229
Now in this example, things
worked out well for us because

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.789
the distribution that we
started from was nicely

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.440
symmetric and didn't have
any strange features.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.450
Things are not always
so favorable.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.970
Let us consider starting from
a truncated geometric.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.910
If we add eight random variables
that are independent

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.070
and drawn from this
distribution, what we obtain

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.900
is a PMF of this form, which
does not really look like a

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.660
normal shape.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.070
The reason is that there's
a pronounced asymmetry.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.920
So let us add more and
more independent X's.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.350
If we add 16 of them, we start
to get something that's a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.640
little closer to normal.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.180
But the asymmetry is
still visible.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.660
And if we add 32 of them, we can
still see some asymmetry.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.360
Namely, this tail here does
not look exactly like this

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.720
tail out there.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.110
So in this instance, it's really
the asymmetry of the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.500
original distribution
that makes it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.110
difficult to converge.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.250
And it will take larger values
of n before we can get a very

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.500
accurate approximation.
