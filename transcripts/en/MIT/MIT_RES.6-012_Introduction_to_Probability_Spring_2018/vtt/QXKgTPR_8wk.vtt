00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.360
In this lecture, we introduce
and develop the concept of

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.940
independence between events.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.630
The general idea is
the following.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.190
If I tell you that a certain
event A has occurred, this

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.400
will generally change the
probability of some other

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.760
event B. Probabilities will
have to be replaced by

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.210
conditional probabilities.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.170
But if the conditional
probability turns out to be

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.890
the same as the unconditional
probability, then the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.840
occurrence of event A does not
carry any useful information

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.530
on whether event B will occur.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.970
In such a case, we say that
events A and B are

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.140
independent.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.320
We will develop some intuition
about the meaning of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.780
independence of two events and
introduce an extension, the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.890
concept of conditional
independence.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.180
We will then proceed to define
the independence of a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.470
collection of more
than two events.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.620
If, for any two of the events
in the collection we have

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.610
independence between them, we
will say that we have pairwise

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.910
independence.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.750
But we will see that
independence of the entire

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.230
collection is something
different.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.470
It involves additional
conditions.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.910
Finally, we will close with an
application in reliability

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.650
analysis and with a nice puzzle
that will serve as a

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.130
word of caution about putting
together probabilistic models.
