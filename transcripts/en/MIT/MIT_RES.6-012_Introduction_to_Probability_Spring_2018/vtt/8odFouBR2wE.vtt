00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.750
Let us now revisit the second
calculation that we carried

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.070
out in the context of
our earlier example.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.480
In that example, we calculated
the total probability of an

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.700
event that can occur under
different scenarios.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.130
And it involves the powerful
idea of divide and conquer

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.470
where we break up complex
situations

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.490
into simpler pieces.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.770
Here is what is involved.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.610
We have our sample space.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.520
And our sample space is
partitioned into a number of

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.770
subsets or events.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.880
In this picture we take that
number to be 3, so we'll have

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.540
it partitioned into three
possible scenarios.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.890
It is a partition which means
that these events cover the

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.990
entire sample, space
and they're

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.730
disjoint from each other.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.430
For each one of the scenarios
we're given their

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.470
probabilities.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.470
If you prefer, you can also
draw this situation

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.690
in terms of a tree.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.240
There are three different
scenarios that can happen.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.380
We're interested in a particular
event, B. That

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.780
event B can happen in three
different ways.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.800
It can happen under scenario
one, under scenario two, or

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.610
under scenario three.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.039
And this corresponds to these
particular sub-events.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.630
So for example, this
is the event

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.860
where scenario A1 happens.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.440
And then event B happens
as well.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.990
In terms of a tree diagram, the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.690
picture becomes as follows.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.840
If scenario A1 materializes,
event B may occur or event B

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.710
might not occur.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.120
Finally, we are given
conditional probabilities that

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.780
event B will materialize under
each one of the different

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.450
possible scenarios.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.300
Under those circumstances, can
we calculate the probability

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.210
of event B?

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.479
Of course we can.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.470
And here's how we do it.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.060
First we realize that event
B consists of a number of

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.940
disjoint pieces.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.560
One piece is when event B occurs
together with event A1.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.510
Another piece is when event
B occurs together with A2.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.912
Another piece is when event
B occurs together with A3.

00:02:15.912 --> 00:02:20.490
These three sets are disjoint
from each other, as we see in

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.530
this picture.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.010
And together they form the
event B. Therefore, the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.700
probability of B is going to be,
by the additivity axiom of

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.579
probabilities, equal to the sum
of the probabilities of

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.140
these sub-events.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.800
Furthermore, for each one of
these sub-events we can use

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.150
the multiplication rule
and write their

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.690
probabilities as follows.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.410
The probability that B and A1
both occur is the probability

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.340
that scenario one materializes
times the conditional

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.400
probability that B occurs
given that A1 occurred.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.660
And then we're going to have
similar terms under the second

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.390
scenario and a similar term
under the third scenario.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.830
So putting everything together,
we have arrived at a

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.880
formula of this form.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.220
The total probability of event
B is the sum of the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.079
probabilities of the different
ways that B may occur, that

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.340
is, B occurring under the
different scenarios.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.990
And those particular
probabilities are the product

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.630
of the probability of the
scenario times the conditional

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.630
probability of B given
that scenario.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.680
Now, note that the sum of the
probabilities of the different

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.200
scenarios is of course
equal to 1.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.590
And this is because the
scenarios form a partition of

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.400
our sample space.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.120
So if we look at this formula
here, we realize that it is a

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.790
weighted average of the
conditional probabilities of

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.430
event B, weighted average of the
conditional probabilities

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.560
where these probabilities of the
individual scenarios are

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.810
the weights.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.090
In words, the probability that
an event occurs is a weighted

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.990
average of the probability
that it has under each

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.300
possible scenario, where the
weights are the probabilities

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.280
of the different scenarios.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.180
One final comment--

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.700
our derivation was for the
case of three events.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.580
But you can certainly see that
the same derivation would go

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.760
through if we had any finite
number of events.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.340
But even more, if we had a
partition of our sample space

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.890
into an infinite sequence of
events, the same derivation

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.930
would still go through, except
that in this place in the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.580
derivation, instead of using the
ordinary additivity axiom

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.270
we would have to use the
countable additivity axiom.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.570
But other than that, all the
steps would be the same.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.970
And we would end up with the
same formula, except that now

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.890
this would be an infinite
sum over the

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.310
infinite set of scenarios.
