00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.670
This is a simple example where
we want to just apply the

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.630
formula for conditional
probabilities

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.610
and see what we get.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.140
The example involves a
four-sided die, if you can

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.300
imagine such an object, which
we roll twice, and we record

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.830
the first roll, and
the second roll.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.660
So there are 16 possible
outcomes.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.350
We assume to keep things simple,
that each one of those

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.820
16 possible outcomes, each
one of them has the same

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.800
probability, so each outcome
has the probability 1/16.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.250
Let us consider now a particular
event B on which

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.460
we're going to condition.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.286
This is the event under which
the smaller of the two die

00:00:49.286 --> 00:00:53.990
rolls is equal to 2, which means
that one of the dice

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.970
must have resulted in two, and
the other die has resulted in

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.220
something which is
2 or larger.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.800
So this can happen
in multiple ways.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.130
And here are the different
ways that it can happen.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.100
So at 2, 2, or 2, 3, or 2, 4;
then a 3, 2 and a 4, 2.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.080
All of these are outcomes in
which one of the dice has a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.200
value equal to 2, and
the other die

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.880
is at least as large.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.560
So we condition on this event.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.520
This results in a conditional
model where each one of those

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.820
five outcomes are equally likely
since they used to be

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.759
equally likely in the
original model.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.539
Now let's look at
this quantity.

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.340
The maximum of the
two die rolls--

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.960
that is, the largest
of the results.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.710
And let us try to calculate
the following quantity--

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.240
the conditional probability that
the maximum is equal to 1

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.420
given that the minimum
is equal to 2.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.820
So this is the conditional
probability of

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.050
this particular outcome.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.480
Well, this particular outcome
cannot happen.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.450
If I tell you that the smaller
number is 2, then the larger

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.669
number cannot be equal to 1, so
this outcome is impossible,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.870
and therefore this conditional
probability is equal to 0.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.550
Let's do something a little
more interesting.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.910
Let us now look at the
conditional probability that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.690
the maximum is equal to 3 given
the information that

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.190
event B has occurred.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.210
It's best to draw a picture
and see what that event

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.990
corresponds to.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.829
M is equal to 3--

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.110
the maximum is equal to 3--

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.500
if one of the dice resulted
in a 3, and the other die

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.190
resulted in something
that's 3 or less.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.770
So this event here corresponds
to the blue

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.630
region in this diagram.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.610
Now let us try to calculate the
conditional probability by

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.110
just following the definition.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.910
The conditional probability of
one event given another is the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.860
probability that
both of them--

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.900
both of the two events--

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.810
occur, divided by the
probability of the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.690
conditioning event.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.880
That is, out of the total
probability in the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.000
conditioning event, we ask,
what fraction of that

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.060
probability is assigned to
outcomes in which the event of

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.730
interest is also happening?

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.200
So what is this event?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.100
The maximum is equal to 3,
which is the blue event.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.500
And simultaneously, the red
event is happening.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.840
These two events intersect
only in two places.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.020
This is the intersection
of the two events.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.480
And the probability of that
intersection is 2 out of 16,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.720
since there's 16 outcomes and
that event happens only with

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.910
two particular outcomes.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.360
So this gives us 2/16
in the numerator.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.210
How about the denominator?

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.990
Event B consists of a total
of five possible outcomes.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.360
Each one has probability 1/16,
so this is 5/16, so the final

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.860
answer is 2/5.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.470
We could have gotten that same
answer in a simple and perhaps

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.870
more intuitive way.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.409
In the original model, all
outcomes were equally likely.

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.470
Therefore, in the conditional
model, the five outcomes that

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.470
belong to B should also
be equally likely.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.980
Out of those five, there's two
of them that make the event of

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.190
interest to occur.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.500
So given that we live in B,
there's two ways out of five

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.940
that the event of interest
will materialize.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.159
So the event of interest has

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.230
conditional probability [equal to]

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.480
2/5.
