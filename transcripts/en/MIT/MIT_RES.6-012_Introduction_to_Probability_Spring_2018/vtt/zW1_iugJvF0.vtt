00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.390
A random variable can take
different numerical values

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.890
depending on the outcome
of the experiment.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.800
Some outcomes are more likely
than others, and similarly

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.130
some of the possible numerical
values of a random variable

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.480
will be more likely
than others.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.500
We restrict ourselves to
discrete random variables, and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.060
we will describe these relative
likelihoods in terms

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.080
of the so-called probability
mass function, or PMF for

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.440
short, which gives the
probability of the different

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.530
possible numerical values.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.480
The PMF is also sometimes called
the probability law or

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.590
the probability distribution of
a discrete random variable.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.090
Let me illustrate the idea in
terms of a simple example.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.160
We have a probabilistic
experiment with

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.380
four possible outcomes.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.600
We also have a probability
law on the sample space.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.170
And to keep things simple, we
assume that all four outcomes

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.610
in our sample space are
equally likely.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.450
We then introduce a random
variable that associates a

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.800
number with each possible
outcome as

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.630
shown in this diagram.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.310
The random variable,
X, can take one of

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.030
three possible values--

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.510
namely 3, 4, or 5.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.810
Let us focus on one
of those numbers--

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.610
let's say the number 5.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.100
So let us focus on x
being equal to 5.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.990
We can think of the event
that X is equal to 5.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.890
Which event is this?

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.090
This is the event that the
outcome of the experiment led

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.310
to the random variable
taking a value of 5.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.470
So it is this particular event
which consists of two

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.729
elements, namely a and b.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.580
More formally, the event that
we're talking about is the set

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.790
of all outcomes for which the
value, the numerical value of

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.200
our random variable, which is
a function of the outcome,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.770
that numerical value happens
to be equal to 5.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.880
And in this example it is a set

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.410
consisting of two elements.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.460
It's a subset of the
sample space.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.750
So it is an event.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.700
And it has a probability.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.510
And that probability we will be

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.500
denoting with this notation.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.160
And in our case this probability
is equal to 1/2.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.310
Because we have two outcomes,
each one has probability 1/4.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.890
The probability of this
event is equal to 1/2.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.290
More generally, we will be using
this notation to denote

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.730
the probability of the event
that the random variable, X ,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.900
takes on a particular
value, x.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.130
This is just a piece of
notation, not a new concept.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.740
We're dealing with a
probability, and we indicate

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.350
it using this particular
notation.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.550
More formally, the probability
that we're dealing with is the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.950
probability, the total
probability, of all outcomes

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.360
for which the numerical value of
our random variable is this

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.320
particular number, x.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.960
A few things to notice.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.780
We use a subscript, X, to
indicate which random variable

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.230
we're talking about.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.510
This will be useful
if we have several

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.300
random variables involved.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.060
For example, if we have another
random variable on the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.890
same sample space, Y, then it
would have its own probability

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.079
mass function which would be
denoted with this particular

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.329
notation here.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.470
The argument of the PMF, which
is x, ranges over the possible

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.750
values of the random variable,
X. So in this sense, here

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.020
we're really dealing
with a function.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.200
A function that we could
denote just by p with a

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.310
subscript x.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.170
This is a function as opposed
to the specific

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.839
values of this function.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.350
And we can produce plots
of this function.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.050
In this particular example that
we're dealing with, the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.890
interesting values of
x are 3, 4, and 5.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.640
And the associated probabilities
are the value of

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.790
5 is obtained with probability
1/2, the value of 4--

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.930
this is the event that the
outcome is c, which has

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.070
probability 1/4.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.960
And the value of 3 is also
obtained with probability 1/4

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.420
because the value of 3 is
obtained when the outcome is

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.740
d, and that outcome has
probability 1/4.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.390
So the probability mass function
is a function of an

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.480
argument x.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.920
And for any x, it specifies
the probability that the

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.930
random variable takes on
this particular value.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.710
A few more things to notice.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.150
The probability mass function is
always non-negative, since

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.750
we're talking about
probabilities and

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.930
probabilities are always
non-negative.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.350
In addition, since the total
probability of all outcomes is

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.590
equal to 1, the probabilities
of the different possible

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.330
values of the random variable
should also add to 1.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.040
So when you add over all
possible values of x, the sum

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.790
of the associated probabilities

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.740
should be equal to 1.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.690
In terms of our picture, the
event that x is equal to 3,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.200
which is this subset of the
sample space, the event that x

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.520
is equal to 4, which is this
subset of the sample space,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.990
and the event that x is equal to
5, which is this subset of

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.470
the sample space.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.840
These three events--

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.080
the red, green, and blue--

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.940
they are disjoint, and together
they cover the entire

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.820
sample space.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.940
So their probabilities
should add to 1.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.360
And the probabilities of these
events are the probabilities

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.860
of the different values of the
random variable, X. So the

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.790
probabilities of these
different values

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.650
should also add to 1.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.950
Let us now go through a simple
example to illustrate the

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.950
general method for calculating
the PMF of a

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.890
discrete random variable.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.090
We will revisit our familiar
example involving two rolls of

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.690
the tetrahedral die.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.000
And let X be the result of the
first roll, Y be the result of

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.159
the second roll.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.430
And notice that we're using
uppercase letters.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.180
And this is because X and
Y are random variables.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.160
In order to do any probability
calculations, we also need the

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.170
probability law.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.150
So to keep things simple, let us
assume that every possible

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.440
outcome, there's 16 of them, has
the same probability which

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.420
is therefore 1 over 16 for
each one of the outcomes.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.770
We will concentrate on a
particular random variable

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.540
defined to be the sum of the
random variables, X and Y. So

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.240
if X and Y both happen to
be 1, then Z will take

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.850
the value of 2.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.850
If X is 2 and Y is 1 our random
variable will take the

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.940
value of 3.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.290
And similarly if we have this
outcome, in those outcomes

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.540
here, the random variable
takes the value of 4.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.560
And we can continue this way
by marking, for each

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.040
particular outcome, the
corresponding value of the

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.735
random variable of interest.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.280
What we want to do now is to
calculate the PMF of this

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.110
random variable.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.690
What does it mean to
calculate the PMF?

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:07.600
We need to find this value for
all choices of z, that is for

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.530
all possible values in the range
of our random variable.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.120
The way we're going to do it is
to consider each possible

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.830
value of z, one at a time, and
for any particular value find

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.810
out what are the outcomes--

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.110
the elements of the
sample space--

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.220
for which our random variable
takes on the specific value,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.240
and add the probabilities
of those outcomes.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.820
So to illustrate this process,
let us calculate the value of

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.630
the PMF for z equal to 2.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.900
This is by definition the
probability that our random

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.950
variable takes the value of 2.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.640
And this is an event that
can only happen here.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.690
It corresponds to only one
element of the sample space,

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.185
which has probability
1 over 16.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.390
We can continue the same way
for other values of z.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:07.930
So for example, the value of PMF
at z equal to 3, this is

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.640
the probability that our random
variable takes the

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.150
value of 3.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.300
This is an event that can
happen in two ways--

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.810
it corresponds to
two outcomes--

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.540
and so it has probability
2 over 16.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.100
Continuing similarly, the
probability that our random

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:33.650
variable takes the value of
4 is equal to 3 over 16.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.250
And we can continue this way
and calculate the remaining

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.080
entries of our PMF.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.330
After you are done, you
end up with a table--

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.850
or rather a graph--

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.050
a plot that has this form.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.590
And these are the values of the
different probabilities

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.005
that we have computed.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.260
And you can continue with
the other values.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.030
It's a reasonable guess that
this was going to be 4 over

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:07.490
16, this is going to be 3 over
16, 2 over 16, and 1 over 16.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.640
So we have completely determined
the PMF of our

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.640
random variable.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.950
We have given the form
of the answers.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.790
And it's always convenient to
also provide a plot with the

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.040
answers that we have.
