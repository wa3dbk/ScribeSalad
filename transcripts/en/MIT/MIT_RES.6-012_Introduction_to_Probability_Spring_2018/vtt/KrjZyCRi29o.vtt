00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.630
We will now use counting
to solve a simple

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.510
probabilistic problem.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.280
We have in our hands an ordinary
six-sided die which

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.570
we are going to roll
six times.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.700
So this is our probabilistic
experiment.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.950
And we're interested in the
probability of a certain

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.810
event, the event that
the six rolls result

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.250
in different numbers.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.390
So let us give a name to that
event and call it event A. So

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.440
we wish to calculate the
probability of this event.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.600
But before we can even get
started answering this

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.920
question, we need a
probabilistic model.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.500
We need to make some
assumptions, and the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.200
assumption that we're going to
make is that all outcomes of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.130
this experiment are
equally likely.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.750
This is going to place us within
a discrete uniform

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.310
probabilistic model so
that we can calculate

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.830
probabilities by counting.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.950
In particular, as we discussed
earlier in this lecture, the

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.530
probability of an event A is
going to be the number of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.520
elements of the set A, the
number of outcomes that make

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.930
event A occur, divided by the
total number of possible

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.150
outcomes, which is the
number of elements

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.400
in our sample space.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.150
So let us start with the
denominator, and let us look

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.080
at the typical outcomes
of this experiment.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:43.080
A typical outcome is something
like this sequence,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.130
2, 3, 4, 3, 6, 2.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.460
That's one possible outcome.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.539
How many outcomes of this
kind are there?

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.860
Well, we have 6 choices for the
result of the first roll,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.070
6 choices for the result of the
second roll, and so on.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.100
And since we have a total of 6
rolls, this means that there

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.500
is a total of 6 to the 6th
power possible outcomes,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.010
according to the Counting
Principle.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.579
And by the way, since we have so
many possible outcomes and

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.890
we assume that they are
equally likely, the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.400
probability of each one
of them would be 1

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.090
over 6 to the 6th.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.340
Incidentally, that's the same
number, the same answer, you

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.079
would get if you were to assume,
instead of assuming

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.310
directly that all outcomes are
equally likely, to just assume

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.380
that the different rolls are
rolls of a fair six-sided die,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.480
so the probability of getting a
2 is 1/6, and also that the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.170
different rolls are independent
of each other.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.730
So in that case, the
probability, let's say, of

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.050
this particular sequence would
be the probability of

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.630
obtaining a 2, which is 1/6,
times the probability that we

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.840
get a 3 at the next roll, which
is 1/6, times 1/6 times

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.080
1/6 and so on, and we get the
same answer, 1 over 6 to 6th.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.070
So we see that this assumption
of all outcomes being equally

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.310
likely has an alternative
interpretation in terms of

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.380
having a fair die which is
rolled independently 6 times.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.470
Now, let us look at the event
of interest, A. What is a

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.450
typical element of A?

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.010
A typical element of A is a
sequence of 6 rolls in which

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.640
no number gets repeated.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.880
So, for example, it could be a
sequence of results of this

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.130
kind, where each number
appears just once.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.770
So all the numbers appear
exactly once in this sequence.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.450
So what we need here is
basically to have a

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.680
permutation of the numbers
1 up to 6.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.160
So these 6 numbers have to
appear in an arbitrary order.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.040
In how many ways can we
order 6 elements?

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.050
This is the number of
permutations of a set of 6

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.460
elements and, as we discussed
earlier, this

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.310
is equal to 6 factorial.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.940
So we have now counted the
number of outcomes that make

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.990
event A happen, which
is 6 factorial.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.830
And by calculating this ratio,
we have obtained the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.820
probability of the
desired event.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.065
You can now pause and try
to solve a problem

00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:36.450
of a similar kind.
