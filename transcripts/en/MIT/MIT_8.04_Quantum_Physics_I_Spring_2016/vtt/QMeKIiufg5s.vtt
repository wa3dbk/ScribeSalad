00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.325
PROFESSOR: This will
be qualitative insights

00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:04.200
on the wave function.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.970
It's qualitative,
and it's partially

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:22.840
quantitative of course,
insights into, let's say,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.050
real energy eigenstates.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.590
So whenever you have a
problem and a potential,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.770
we have what is called the total
energy, the kinetic energy,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.220
and the potential energy.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.945
So you have the energy, which
is total, equal kinetic energy

00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:51.770
plus the potential energy.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.970
Now, the potential
energy, as you've seen,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.310
sometimes depends on position.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.330
We did piecewise
continuous end potentials,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.440
but they could be
more complicated

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.379
and do funny things.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.580
So this is a function of x.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.240
And classically speaking,
we speak of the energy.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.375
You see in quantum mechanics,
the energy is an observable

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:21.810
and is the result of a
measurement with a permission

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.500
operator.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.280
Sometimes there could be
uncertainty, sometimes not.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.400
But in classical physics, which
this intuition will come from,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400
you have a total energy.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.315
It is conserved.

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:36.750
It's equal to potential
energy and kinetic energy.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.420
That will also depend
on where the particle is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.860
in the potential.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.705
Let's do a very simple case.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.100
Coordinate x, a potential.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.800
v of x, this based the
potential. v of x, it's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.760
a constant, nothing
that complicated.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.520
And suppose you
have a total energy.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.790
Now, the total energy
in classical mechanics

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.880
is conserved.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.930
So when I draw a
line, I'm not implying

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.940
that is a function of x,
that sometimes the energy is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.550
like that.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.190
No, it's just a number
there that I fixed.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.490
Here is the energy.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.140
And then wherever you
move, if the particle,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.790
the classical particle,
is here, then it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.980
has some potential energy, v
of x, and some kinetic energy,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.770
k of x, building up
the total energy.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.182
Classically, the kinetic
energy determines the momentum.

00:02:47.182 --> 00:02:52.580
The kinetic energy
is p squared over 2m.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.160
Now, the kinetic energy
is p squared over 2m.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.830
In this case, the kinetic
energy is a constant.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.920
The momentum will be a constant.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.520
And then what we really want
to just say something about

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.300
is the wave function.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.520
Well, but if we note
the momentum classically

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.100
it's a momentum p, we can
infer the Broglie wavelength

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.420
of the particle.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.660
And that the Broglie
wavelength would be h over p.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.360
And that's for
the wave function.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.150
So we should expect
a wave function

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.620
that has a wave length
equal to lambda.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.040
After all, that is
what the Broglie did.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.770
And from the Broglie, you
got the Schrodinger equation.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.210
The Schrodinger
equation, in fact,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.380
says this, if you
look at it again.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.850
So if you look at
the wave function.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.700
Well, it must have
wavelength lambda.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.910
And therefore, I'm talking
about real wave function.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.060
So it could be a
cosine or a sine that

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.940
has that wavelength lambda.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.490
Of course in quantum
mechanics, a cosine or a side

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.720
doesn't have exactly--

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.740
it's not an eigenstate
of momentum.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.110
But it's an eigenstate
state of energy.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.790
And we want to plug
eigenstates of energy.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.710
So you will have something
like that, with that lambda.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.660
And that's intuition.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.320
You go from the diagram
to a kinetic energy,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.720
from a kinetic
energy to a momentum,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.530
from a momentum to a wavelength,
and that's the wavelength

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.830
of your energy eigenstate.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.840
And maybe it's a good idea that
you try to convince yourself

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.830
this is true by looking again
at the Schrodinger equation.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.650
For this simple case
of a constant potential

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.610
and an energy that is big,
you will find this result

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.230
very quickly.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.675
But let's do now a more
interesting case, in which here

00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:07.430
is x.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.680
And the potential is a
growing function of x.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.895
And there's a total
energy here still.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.680
So if you are at
some point here,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.775
here is the potential of x.

00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:28.694
And now, this is k of x.

00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:35.060
And now comes the
interesting thing.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.280
You see, as your particle,
or whatever particle,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.920
is moving here,
the kinetic energy

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.920
is decreasing as you
move to the right.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.040
So the kinetic
energy [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.910
velocity and slows down,
slows down, slows down.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.900
The kinetic energy is
becoming smaller and smaller.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.710
Therefore the momentum is
becoming smaller and smaller.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.760
And therefore the wavelength,
the Broglie wavelength,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.950
must be becoming
bigger and bigger.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.800
Now that is not exact
because you really

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.980
have to solve the Schrodinger
equation to do this.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.660
But intuitively, you know that
if a potential is constant,

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.210
this is absolutely true.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.850
The kinetic energy,
and the momentum,

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.780
and the Broglie waveform
have related in this way.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.170
It will be sort of true,
or approximately true,

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.400
if the potential is
not changing that fast.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.830
Because then it's
approximately constant.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.020
So there's a notion the
slowly changing potential,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:55.810
in which we can talk about the
k of x that is decreasing as we

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.770
move to the right, a p of
x that is also decreasing,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:11.290
and a lambda of x that
would be increasing,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.520
a wave with the Broglie
wavelength that is increasing.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.682
Now I should have
written in here, maybe,

00:07:20.682 --> 00:07:24.830
k of x, p of x, lambda of x.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.970
This is decreasing,
decreasing, increasing.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.345
So I can plot it here.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.100
And I would say, well, I don't
know exactly how this goes.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.840
But maybe it's the
wavelength is small.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.490
And then the
wavelength is becoming

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.620
bigger, something like that.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.610
Well, the wavelength's becoming
bigger in the energy eigenstate

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.505
that you will find is true.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.930
But there's also the question
whether the amplitude

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.070
of the wave will change or not.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.320
So we'll answer that
in a couple of minutes.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.120
But the Broglie
wavelength now is becoming

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.110
a function of position.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.210
Now, you know that solving
the Schrodinger equation now

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.580
with an arbitrary potential
is a difficult thing.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.060
With a linear potentially
it's a difficult problem,

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.059
in which the exact solution
exists in terms of Airy

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:34.760
functions and things like that.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.740
So this can only be an
approximate statement

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.309
that the Broglie wavelength
is becoming bigger and bigger,

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:46.000
because the momentum is
becoming smaller and smaller.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.040
But it's a very
useful statement.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.980
And whenever you look at
wave functions of potentials,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.760
you see that thing happening.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.480
Questions?

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:14.320
Let me draw another diagram
that illustrates these issues.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:29.440
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.300
So let's draw a general
picture of a potential

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:40.360
now, so we can make
a few features here.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.430
So here it is.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:54.740
We'll have a potential that
is like this, v of x, maybe

00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:04.330
some energy, e, and that's it.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:10.040
Now what happens
classically, well,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.430
if your particle
has some energy,

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.040
you know already
this part is v of x.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.720
This is k of x.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.950
There is a potential
energy and kinetic energy.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.490
The kinetic energy cannot
become negative classically.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:31.770
So the particle cannot go to the
left of this point called xl,

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.340
x to the left.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:46.304
So this region, x left, is
the classically forbidden.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.080
Similarly on the right,
you cannot go beyond here.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.760
Because then you would have
negative kinetic energy.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.410
So this is an x right.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.370
And everything to the
right [INAUDIBLE],

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.535
x right, is also
classical forbidden.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.310
These points, x
left and x right,

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:16.950
are called turning points.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.850
Because those are
the points where

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.200
a particle, a
classical particle,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:32.050
if it lives in this potential,
has to bounce back and turn.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:37.470
As we mentioned, at
any general point,

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:42.150
you have v of x and k of x.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.180
And this point, for
example, is the point

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:54.010
with maximum k of x
or maximum velocity.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.110
This is the point where the
particle is moving the fastest.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.710
And it always slows down as
it reaches the turning point.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.970
Because the kinetic energy is
becoming smaller and smaller.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:18.200
So as we said, if you
had a constant potential,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.360
this would be the solution.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.450
It's constant p,
constant lambda,

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.640
nice, simple wave function.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.860
If it's not constant, well,
nothing is guaranteed.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:36.070
But if it's sufficiently
constant or slowly varied,

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.690
then you're in good shape.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.298
Now what is the meaning
of slowly varying?

00:12:42.298 --> 00:12:46.270
The meaning of
slowly varying has

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:51.330
to be said in a precise way.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.860
And this is what
leads eventually

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.490
to the so-called WKB
approximation of quantum

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.530
mechanics.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.410
Because we're giving you
the first results of this

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.310
approximation that you
can understand classically

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.900
how they go.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.030
To mean that you have a
slowly varying potential,

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:17.980
is a potential whose
percentage change

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:23.230
is small in the
relevant distances.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:27.490
So it's the change
in the potential

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.400
over the relevant
distance must be small

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.460
compared to the potential.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.390
But what is a relevant distance?

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.870
If we use intuition
from quantum mechanics,

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.230
it's at the Broglie
wavelength at any point.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.340
That is what the
quantum particle sees.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.500
So what we need
is that the change

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:57.250
in the potential over at
the Broglie wavelength--

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.260
take the derivative
multiply it by that.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.920
The Broglie wavelength
must be much smaller

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.300
than the potential itself.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.620
And notice, of course, the
potential is a function of x.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.750
And even lambda is a
function of x there

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.380
at the Broglie wavelength.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.590
Now, an exact solution will
not be a sine or a cosine.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:26.490
So to say has a precise defined
wavelength is an approximation.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.270
It is the approximation
of slowly varying.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.890
But it's a nice approximation.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.120
And this lambda
is the lambda that

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:42.350
would come as h over p of x.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:48.090
And h over p of x is
the square root of 2m

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:53.760
times the kinetic
energy over h squared--

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.900
no, it's just that,
the square root of 2mk.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.081
Square root of 2mk of x.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.750
So the idea is that
you can roughly

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:27.210
say that the Broglie wavelength
here is of some value here.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.310
The momentum is small if the
Broglie wavelength is large.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.380
And so when you draw
things, you adjust that.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.710
You say, OK, here,
the momentum is large.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.770
Therefore the Broglie
wavelength is small.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.230
So you write a short
wavelength thing.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.620
And then it becomes longer
wavelength and then shorter.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.620
And you just tried
to get some insight

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.280
into how this thing looks.
