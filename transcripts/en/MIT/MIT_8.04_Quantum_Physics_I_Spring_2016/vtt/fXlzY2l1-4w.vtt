00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.240
PROFESSOR: We spoke
about the hydrogen atom.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.240
And in the hydrogen
atom, we drew

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.059
the spectrum, so the table, the
data of spectrum of a quantum

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:16.700
system.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.750
So this is a question that I
you in general to be aware of.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.560
What do we mean by a
diagram of the energy

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.440
levels in a central potential?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.020
So this is something we
did for the hydrogen atom.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.230
But in general, the diagram
of energy eigenstates

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.740
in a central potential
looks like this.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.480
You put the energies here.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.140
And they could be bound states
that have negative energy.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.410
They could be even bound
states with positive energy,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.600
depending on the system
you're discussing.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.920
You remember the
harmonic oscillator,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.670
the potential is naturally
defined to be positive.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.780
And all these energy states
that the harmonic oscillator

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.560
has represent bound states.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.600
They are normalizeable
wave functions.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.080
In fact, you don't
have scattering states

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.350
because the potential
just reaches forever.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.320
So in general, for
a central potential,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.850
however, the system
is shown like that.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.210
And we plot here l.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.770
But l is not a
continuous variable,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.410
so we'll put l equals 0
here, l equals 1, l equals 2,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.210
l equals 3.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.260
And then you start
plotting the energy levels.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.780
You solve the radial equation.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.470
Remember, the radial equation
is a Schrodinger equation,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:56.660
minus h squared over 2m, d
second u d r squared, plus V

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.660
effective of r u equals Eu.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.479
And V effective
of r is the V of r

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.060
that your system had, plus
a contribution from angular

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.360
momentum, 2m.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.820
So this radial equation is a
collection of radial equations.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.270
We've tried to emphasize
that many times already.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.090
And you solve it
first for l equal 0,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.720
then for l equal 1, for l
equal 2, you go on and on.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.260
So you solve it for l equal 0.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.920
And just like as in any
one-dimensional problem,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.720
for l equals 0, you
solve this equation

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.810
and you find energy levels.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.620
So you sketch them like that.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.430
Those are the energy
levels for l equals 0.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.470
This is the ground state of
the l equal 0 radial equation.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.600
Now just to remind you,
this is the hard part

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.400
of solving the
Schrodinger equation.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.800
Because at the end
of the day, the psi

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.550
is u of r over r times some Ylm.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.630
So the l that you have
here, the term is a Y

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.440
and the m is arbitrary.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.080
In fact, the u doesn't
know about the m value.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.210
So here you have
these energy levels.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.630
And then what happened with
this hydrogen atom is you keep

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.790
solving, of course,
for all the l's.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.360
And in general, when you
solve for l equals 1,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.940
you may find some
levels like this.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.450
It's a miracle when
the levels coincide.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.970
There's no reason why
they should coincide.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.970
They happen to coincide
for the hydrogen atom.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.290
And that's because of a very
special symmetry of the 1 over

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.660
r potential orbit.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.355
Then for l equal
2, you solve it.

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:06.580
And for l equal 3, you solve.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.530
And you find these
states, and that's

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.370
the diagram of states
of a central potential.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.709
For the hydrogen
atom, of course,

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.680
first, all the
energies were negative

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.010
and the energy levels coincide.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.920
So this is the ground state of
the l equal 0 radial equation.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.110
This is the ground state of
the l equal 1 radial equation.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.170
This is the ground state of
the l equal 2 radial equation.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.495
This is the ground state
of the whole system.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.240
So this is what we call
plotting the spectrum

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.360
in a radial potential problem.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.400
And it's a generic form.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.470
So we were doing this
for the hydrogen atom

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.730
last time to try to
understand the various orbits.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:07.400
And we had for the
hydrogen atom, V of r

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.280
was a potential like this,
minus e squared over r.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.870
And then you have sometimes
the l contribution

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.350
that this function diverges
towards the origin, 1

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.190
over r squared.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.530
And by the time you
add them together,

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.490
This is the original
potential, so this could

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.070
be thought as l equals 0 case.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:42.600
Then if you have some l
over here and some other l,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.310
maybe like that, these
are the various potentials

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.790
that you get.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.260
And in general, you
may want to figure out,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.060
for example, if
you have an energy

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.560
level, some particular energy,
what are the turning points.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.030
So let's consider for
that case that's just one

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.310
curve that we care about.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.110
And the electron will be going
from some value of the radius,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.105
so this is the plot of
the effective potential

00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:22.330
of the function of radius.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.020
And we'll go from
one to another.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.840
They could be called
r minus to r plus.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.110
And our semi-classical
interpretation,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.760
which is roughly good if you're
talking about high quantum

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.660
numbers, high principle
quantum numbers, high l

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:49.600
quantum numbers, is
that you have an ellipse

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.630
and the radial distance
to the center where

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.555
the proton is located goes
from r plus to r minus.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.880
The electron is
bouncing back and forth.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.800
That is the classical picture.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.720
In the quantum
mechanical picture,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.490
you expect something
somewhat similar.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.720
There's going to be a wave
function, maybe a wave

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.690
function here, psi squared.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.480
And it's going to be vanishingly
small before this point.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.670
And then by the
time you get here,

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:33.620
it's going to be very
fast, and then decay again.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.890
So the probability
distribution will

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.590
mimic the time spent
by the particles,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.640
as we used to argue before.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.730
So let's do a little exercise of
calculating the turning points.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.940
So how do we do that?

00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:03.890
Well, we set h squared l times
l plus 1 over 2mr squared,

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.980
minus e squared over r--

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.580
that's the effective potential--

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:17.390
equal to the energy of some
level n, principle quantum

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.700
number n.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:26.840
So it would be minus e squared
over 2a0, 1 over n squared.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.970
That's the value
of the energy En.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.570
And the solutions of
this quadratic equation

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.725
are going to give us the r plus
and the r minus of the orbit.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:51.560
So it's probably worthwhile
to do a little transformation

00:08:51.560 --> 00:09:00.920
and to say r equal a0 times
x, where x is unit free.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.590
And then the equation becomes
h squared, l times l plus 1,

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:21.900
over 2ma0 squared,
times l times l plus 1,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:36.090
over x squared, minus e squared
over a0x, is equal to minus

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.180
e squared over 2a0,
1 over n squared.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.280
So the unit should work out.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.680
We should get a nice
equation without units.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.860
So what must be happening
is that the coefficient

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:05.070
in front of here, h
squared 2ma0 squared,

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:11.250
let's take the other a0 and
separate it out, and transform

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:11.750
this.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.670
Remember, a0 was h
squared over m e squared.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.430
So here we get h
squared over 2ma0.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.340
And that a0 now
has an h squared.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.670
And there's m e squared.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.110
So the h squared
cancels, the m cancels.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.280
And this is e squared over 2a0.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:49.190
So this whole
coefficient is e squared

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:55.100
over 2a0, which is nice because
now the e squared over a0,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.680
the e squared over a0, a
squared over a0, cancel.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:08.890
And we get l times l
plus 1 over x squared--

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.520
I've canceled all this factor--

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:20.885
minus 2 over x is equal
to minus 1 over n squared.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.700
So I multiplied by the
inverse of this quantity.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.360
It clears up the factor
in the first term.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.720
It produces an extra factor
of 2 in the second term.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.640
And you've got a nice
simple quadratic equation.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.902
AUDIENCE: Question?

00:11:43.902 --> 00:11:45.026
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:11:45.026 --> 00:11:48.232
AUDIENCE: Where do you get
the extra [INAUDIBLE] l,

00:11:48.232 --> 00:11:50.140
l plus 1 [? come from? ?]

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.890
PROFESSOR: Oh,
there's no such thing.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.880
There's too many of them.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.490
Thank you very much.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:10.350
Yes, too many, 1 over x squared.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.990
Thank you.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:21.470
So let's move this
to the other side--

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.280
plus 1 over n squared equals 0.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.015
So this is the main equation.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.720
And we can write this--

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.600
well, the solution for 1 over
x is a quadratic equation in 1

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.190
over x.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:47.215
So I'll write it here.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:56.600
1 plus/minus square root of
1 minus l times l plus 1,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.660
over n squared, divided
by l times l plus 1.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.920
That's just from the
quadratic formula.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.680
So then you invert it.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:21.500
So x is now l times l plus 1,
over 1 plus/minus square root

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.755
of 1 minus l, l plus
1 over n squared.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:38.330
And we multiply by
the opposite factor

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.710
to clear the square root.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:48.035
So 1 minus/plus square root of
1 minus l times l plus 1 over n

00:13:48.035 --> 00:13:48.535
squared.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.970
And the same factor here--

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:57.980
1 minus/plus square
root of 1 minus l,

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:04.870
l plus 1 over n squared,
all of these things.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.780
But that's not so bad.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:15.880
You get l times l plus
1, times this factor

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.100
that you had in the numerator--

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.450
that still is the same--

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:24.550
1 minus l, l plus
1 over n squared.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:31.180
Now we're after an interesting
piece of information, the two

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:36.200
sizes of the ellipse, so it's
worth simplifying what you got.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.450
This equation is not nice
enough, so we're simplifying.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:46.840
And in the denominator, you
have a plus b times a minus b.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:56.370
So it's 1 minus 1 minus l,
l plus 1, over n squared.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:01.470
And the good thing is that the
denominator, the 1 cancels.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.620
And you get the plus,
l times l plus 1 over n

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.350
squared, that cancels, that one.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:12.780
So that, at the end of the day,
we get a pretty nice formula.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.620
The formula is x is
equal to n squared,

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:31.770
1 minus/plus, 1 minus l times
l plus 1, over n squared,

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.100
like that.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:42.620
So if we wish, it's r plus/minus
is x multiplied by a0,

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:49.730
so it's n squared a0, 1
minus/plus square root

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.750
of 1 minus l times l
plus 1, over n squared.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:14.430
OK, so the ellipse is
defined by those two values

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.260
that we have here.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.660
But the surprising
thing is that the sum

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.640
over the ellipse,
and its eccentricity,

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:29.130
is dramatically affected
by the values of l.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:37.320
In fact, for l equals largest,
l will be comparable to n.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.700
Remember, l can go
up to n minus 1.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.070
So at that point,
this is essentially 1.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.670
You cancel this and
there's nothing here.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:55.830
So r plus and r minus become
about the same for l equals n

00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:00.990
minus 1. r plus is almost
the same as r minus

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.730
And the orbit is circular,
completely circular.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:13.260
On the other hand,
for l equals 0,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:19.170
the orbit is completely
elliptical in that the radius

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.319
for l equal 0, this
is 0, 1, plus/minus 1.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:27.210
So sometimes it's twice this
value, sometimes it's 0.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:33.120
So you have the case
where r minus can be 0,

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.650
and you have just an orbit
that is like that, r minus 0,

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.930
so extremely elliptical--

00:17:44.325 --> 00:17:45.295
elliptical.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.990
Of course, that is the
semi-classical approximation.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.175
So it's more reliable when
you have a reasonable l.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:05.370
And finally we can
say here, for example,

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:14.310
one interesting thing, that
r plus plus r minus, over 2,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.290
which is this--

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.460
r plus plus r minus
is the total longest

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:25.450
axis of the ellipse, divided by
2, the center of the ellipse,

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:31.330
not the focus, that distance
is independent of l,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.610
so you have n squared a0.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:46.890
So a typical Rydberg atom
will have n equal 100.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.810
So this is an example--

00:18:49.810 --> 00:19:02.420
n equal 100, l equals 60, in
which case, for n equal 100,

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:15.370
r plus/minus is equal to
10,000a0, n squared a0,

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:21.100
times this factor, which in one
case is 1.8 and in the other

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.290
case is 0.2.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.880
That's what you get for l
equal 60 and n equal 100.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:39.220
So this orbit, you have
r plus about 18,000a0,

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:52.090
and r minus about 2,000a0.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:56.350
And all of our orbits
satisfy this property

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:06.040
that if you have this,
r minus and r plus,

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.340
all of the orbits
with different l

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.130
have the same r
plus plus r minus.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:20.190
So if this is the total
length of the major axis when

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:27.330
the orbit becomes
circular, it's the same.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:34.260
And this distance, when the
orbit becomes very elliptical,

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.340
is the same as well.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:46.040
I mentioned last time that this
nice property is degeneracy.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:52.310
We're here, if you're keeping
n fixed but changing l,

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.250
you're going from
all these ellipses.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.150
This is for l equals n minus 1.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.730
And this one is for l equals 0.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.550
And all this ellipses arc here.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:09.350
And those are all the
semi-classical picture

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.950
of those degenerate states in
the diagram of the hydrogen

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.450
atom.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.020
The diagram of the hydrogen
atom was something like this.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.460
And you're looking at
all the degenerate states

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.650
that you have there.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.330
And they are degenerate,
and you would say, well,

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:37.210
why are ellipses that
look like that degenerate.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:42.370
Well, even Kepler apparently
knew that in Kepler's laws.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:47.410
That he observed that the
period of motion of an orbit

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.200
just depended on
the semi-major axis.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.670
So periods are
related to energies.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.430
And it's reasonable
that we have this thing

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.150
in quantum mechanics.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.740
Now this degeneracy, I
want to just finish up

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.760
by emphasizing
what you have here.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:13.660
When somebody asks what is the
number of states you have here,

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.780
well, you have to be precise
in what you're counting.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:22.990
The number of full physical
states of the quantum system

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.850
is one here, one here, one here.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.960
But each one of this
corresponds to l equals 1,

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.900
so each one of this
is triply degenerate,

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.770
because m can be
minus 1, 0, and 1.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:43.700
So here-- three states,
three states, three states.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:48.690
Here-- this is five states,
five states, five states,

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.830
because they all have l equal 2.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.100
And l equal 2 goes m
from minus 2 to plus 2.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.030
So we don't actually
put three things here.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.030
I think that would be confusing.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.900
We could not put five
and we cannot see.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.620
But it should be
remembered that there's

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.830
the implicit extra
degeneracy here

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:17.680
associated with the
azimuthal quantum number

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.070
that we sometimes just don't
represent it in a figure.
