00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.350
PROFESSOR: So we go
back to the integral.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.065
We think of k.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.200
We'll write it as k
naught plus k tilde.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.780
And then we have
psi of x0 equal 1

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.330
over square root of 2pi
e to the ik naught x--

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.180
that part goes out--

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:42.502
integral dk tilde phi
of k naught plus k tilde

00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:48.605
e to the ik tilde x dk.

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:49.105
OK.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.145
So we're doing this integral.

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:05.410
And now we're focusing
on the integration

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.960
near k naught, where the
contribution is large.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.485
So we write k as k naught
plus a little fluctuation.

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:20.520
dk will be dk tilde.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.520
Wherever you see a k, you must
put k naught plus k tilde.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.950
And that's it.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.350
And why do we have to worry?

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.230
Well, we basically have now
this peak over here, k naught.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.020
And we're going
to be integrating

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.130
k tilde, which is
the fluctuation, all

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.680
over the width of this profile.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.100
So the relevant region of
integration for k tilde

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:07.420
is the range from delta k over
2 to minus delta k over 2.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.265
So maybe I'll make this
picture a little bigger.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.260
Here is k naught.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.310
And here we're going to be going
and integrate in this region.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.080
And since this is delta
k, the relevant region

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.870
of integration--

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:50.330
integration-- for k tilde
is from minus delta k over 2

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.180
to delta k over 2.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.120
That's where it's
going to range.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.670
So all the integral has to
be localized in the hump.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.810
Otherwise, you don't
get any contribution.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.280
So the relevant
region of integration

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.840
for the only variable that
is there is just that one.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.780
Now as you vary this k tilde,
you're going to vary the phase.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.170
And as the phase changes, well,
there's some effect [? on ?]

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.890
[? it. ?] But if x is equal
to 0, the phase is stationary,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.910
because k tilde is going to
very, but x is equal to 0.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.850
No phase is stationary.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.730
And therefore, you will
get a substantial answer.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.800
And that's what we know already.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.420
For x is going to
0 or x equal to 0,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.600
we're going to get a
substantial answer.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.240
But now think of the
phase in general.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.350
So for any x that
you choose, the phase

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.640
will range over some value.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:18.040
So for any x different from
0, the face in the integral

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:37.820
will range over minus delta k
over 2x and to delta k over 2x.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.100
You see, x is here.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.710
The phase is k tilde x.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.590
Whatever x is, since k tilde
is going run in this range,

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.390
the phase is going to run in
that range multiplied by x.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.070
So as you do the integral--

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.250
now think you're
doing this integral.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.520
You have a nice, real,
smooth function here.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.570
And now you have a running
phase that you don't

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.390
manage to make it stationary.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.490
Because when x is
different from 0,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.950
this is not going
to be stationary.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.680
It's going to vary.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.820
But it's going to vary from
this value to that value.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.850
So the total, as you
integrate over that peak,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.070
your phase excursion is
going to be delta k times x--

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:48.580
total phase excursion
is delta k times x.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.760
But then that tells
you what can happen.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.010
As long as this total phase
excursion is very small--

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:13.370
so if x is such
that delta k times

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.780
x is significantly less than 1--

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.530
or, in fact, I could
say less than 1--

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.130
there will be a
good contribution

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:45.340
if x is such that--

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:54.090
then you will get
a contribution.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.970
And the reason is because the
phase is not changing much.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.760
You are doing your integral,
and the phase is not killing it.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.350
On the other hand,
if delta k times x--

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.550
delta k times x is
much bigger than 1,

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.660
then as you range over
the peak, the phase

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.590
has done many, many cycles and
is going to kill the integral.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:37.670
So if k of x is greater than
1, the contribution goes to 0.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:48.840
So let's then just extract
the final conclusion

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.280
from this thing.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:08:11.990
So psi of x 0 will be sizable
in an interval x belonging

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.380
from minus x0 to x0.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:29.870
So it's some value
here minus x0 to x0.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:39.600
If, even for values
as long as x0,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.059
this product is still about 1--

00:08:46.830 --> 00:09:07.820
if for delta k times x0, roughly
say of value 1, we have this.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:20.480
And therefore the uncertainty
in x would be given by 2x0.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:31.880
So x0 or 2x0, this x0 is
basically the uncertainty in x.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.560
And you would get
that delta k times

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.870
delta x is roughly equal to 1--

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:50.630
so delta k delta x
roughly equal to 1.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.420
So I'm dropping factors of 2.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.350
In principle here,
I should push a 2.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:02.570
But the 2s, or 1s, or
pi's at this moment

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.240
are completely unreliable.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.050
But we got to the
end of this argument.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:15.597
We have a relation of
uncertainties is equal to 1.

00:10:15.597 --> 00:10:21.350
And the thing that comes
to mind immediately

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:26.780
is, why didn't Fourier invent
the uncertainty principle?

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.540
Where did we use
quantum mechanics here?

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.340
The answer is nowhere.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.480
We didn't use quantum mechanics.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:47.280
We found the relation between
wave packets, known to Fourier,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.700
known to electrical engineers.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.630
The place where quantum
mechanics comes about

00:10:54.630 --> 00:11:02.710
is when you realize that these
waves in quantum mechanics, e

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:09.860
to the ikx represent states
with some values of momentum.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:16.470
So while this is fine and it's
a very important intuition,

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.160
the step that you
can follow with is--

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.925
it's interesting.

00:11:21.925 --> 00:11:29.950
And you say that, well,
since p, the momentum,

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:37.510
is equal to h bar k and
that's quantum mechanical--

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.190
it involves h bar.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:44.290
It's the whole discussion about
these waves of matter particles

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.320
carrying momentum.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:53.920
You can say-- you can
multiply or take a delta here.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.648
And you would say, delta p
is equal to h bar delta k.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.090
So multiplying this
equation by an h bar,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:14.280
you would find that delta
p, delta x is roughly h bar.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.590
And that's quantum mechanical.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.020
Now we will make the
definitions of delta p and delta

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:37.670
x precise and rigorous
with precise definitions.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.930
Then there is a precise
result, which is very neat,

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.590
which is that delta
x times delta p

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:56.110
is always greater than or
equal than h bar over 2.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.570
So this is really exact.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:07.570
But for that, we need to
define precisely what we

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:14.910
mean by uncertainties, which
we will do soon, but not today.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:19.640
So I think it's
probably a good idea

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.330
to do an example,
a simple example,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:29.630
to illustrate these relations.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:35.690
And here is one example.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:45.290
You have a phi of k of
the form of a step that

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:51.460
goes from delta k over 2
to minus delta k over 2,

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:57.750
and height 1 over
square root of delta k.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.590
That's phi of k.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.860
It's 0 otherwise--

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.370
0 here, 0 there.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.760
Here is 0.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.350
Here is a function of k.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.740
What do you think?

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.990
Is this psi of x, the
psi x corresponding

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.990
to this phi of k-- is it going
to be a real function or not?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.145
Anybody?

00:14:37.145 --> 00:14:40.790
AUDIENCE: This equation
[? is ?] [? true, ?] [? but-- ?]

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.976
PROFESSOR: Is it true or not?

00:14:42.976 --> 00:14:44.410
AUDIENCE: I think it is.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.220
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.720
Yes, you're right.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.520
It is true.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.880
This phi of k is real.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.400
And whenever you have
a value at some k,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.930
there is the same
value at minus k.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:08.060
And therefore the star doesn't
matter, because it's real.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.130
So phi is completely real.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.790
So phi of k is equal
to phi of minus k.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:18.440
And that should give
you a real psi of x--

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.060
correct.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:28.175
So some psi of x-- have to
do the integral-- psi of x0

00:15:28.175 --> 00:15:34.500
is 1 over square root of
2 pi minus delta k over 2

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.820
to delta k over 2.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:45.040
The function, which is
1 over delta k in here--

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.210
that's the whole function.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.930
And the integral was supposed
to be from minus infinity

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:53.980
to infinity.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.120
But since the function only
extends from minus delta

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.520
k over 2 to plus delta k over
2, you restrict the integral

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.600
to those values.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:12.850
So we've already got the phi
of k and then e to the ikx dx.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.890
Well, the constants go out--

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.370
2 pi delta k.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:31.120
And we have the integral
is an integral over x--

00:16:35.472 --> 00:16:37.050
no, I'm sorry.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.260
It's an integral over k.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.820
What I'm writing here--

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:45.230
dk, of course.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:54.900
And that gives you e
to the ikx over ix,

00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:01.250
evaluated between delta k over
2 and minus delta k over 2.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:12.700
OK, a little simplification
gives the final answer.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:23.290
It's delta k over 2pi
sine of delta kx over 2

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.339
over delta kx over 2.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:36.520
So it's a sine of x
over x type function.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:43.150
It's a familiar looking curve.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.215
It goes like this.

00:17:44.215 --> 00:17:49.604
It has some value-- it goes
down, up, down, up like that--

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.400
symmetric.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:04.254
And here is psi of x and 0.

00:18:04.254 --> 00:18:17.100
Here is 2 pi over delta k, and
minus 2 pi over delta k here.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:25.400
Sine of x over x
looks like that.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:33.860
So this function already was
defined with the delta k.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.290
And what is the delta x here?

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:44.910
Well, the delta x is
roughly 2 pi over delta k.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.730
No, it's-- you could say it's
this much or half of that.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.610
I took [? it half ?] of that.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.040
It doesn't matter.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.740
It's approximate
that at any rate now.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.330
So delta x is this.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.720
And therefore the
product delta x, delta k,

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.050
delta x is about 2 pi.
