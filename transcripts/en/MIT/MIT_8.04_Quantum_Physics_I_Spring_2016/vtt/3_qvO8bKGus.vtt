00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.610
PROFESSOR: We've talked a
lot about de Broglie saying

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.210
that the wavelength
is given by h over p.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:14.320
But we have not said much
yet about the frequency

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.970
of the waves.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.160
So what is the frequency
of those matter waves?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.950
So what is the frequency--

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.652
frequency--

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.680
of the matter waves.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.210
So de Broglie did answer
that same question.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.810
And the answer was
obtained by analogy.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.875
We have p equal h bar k.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.390
And he said, well, just
like the wavelength

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:10.820
is determined by the momentum,
we'll have e equal h bar omega.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.370
So the frequency--
so this equation

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.750
is the one that now
completes the story.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.205
Omega is equal to e over h bar.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.670
Fixes omega in
terms of the energy.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.460
And we're going to
say a few things.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.130
In fact, this will be an
interesting digression

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.490
into an important
subject about waves

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.875
that illustrates why this
answer makes a lot of sense.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.880
And that's, really, all
you can do at this moment.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.450
This is a postulate
of quantum mechanics.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.970
That you do this thing,
and with this, you

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.380
get quantum mechanics.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.190
So the best thing we
can do is to explain

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.310
why it makes sense
in a number of ways,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.340
and then hope that the
theory that you built

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.680
makes full sense.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.700
So I want to remind you
about velocities of waves.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.540
So if you have a wave now
that it has k and omega--

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.105
you have this thing. k minus
omega, wave with a phase.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.890
kx minus omega t.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.460
Then there is something
called the phase velocity.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.945
And it's given by omega over k.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.080
It's the velocity in which the
nodes and maxima of this plane

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.480
wave move.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.950
So let's see if this
makes some sense.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.300
Omega over k is the
same thing as e over p.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.390
We're nonrelativistic,
so let's continue.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.650
1/2 mv squared over mv.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.420
And this seems a little strange.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.540
1/2--

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.950
v. So if I have a
particle, you see,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.690
this is matter waves of
energy e and momentum p.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.660
And e is 1/2 mv squared, the
velocity of the particle.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.310
p is equal to mv.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.700
And now, somehow
this wave seems to be

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.040
moving with half the
speed of the particle.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.130
That looks pretty bad.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.280
What's going on?

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.500
Well, this is the
usual story with waves.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.780
If the wave itself doesn't--

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.540
a wave, a plane wave
carries no real information.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.140
It's not the signal.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.959
So many times when you try
to represent the particle--

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.760
a little bit of information
traveling-- representing it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.450
with a plane wave is
actually quite wrong.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.680
You have to represent
it with a wave packet.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.120
And therefore, this
phase wave velocity

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.670
being one half of the
velocity of the particles

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.750
seems to just confirm the idea
that, first, these waves are

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.610
a little strange.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.960
And second, phase velocity is
not very meaningful physically.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.940
The velocity that this more
meaningful is v group velocity.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:11.880
And it's d omega dk evaluated at
the value k that you're using.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.020
k is a proxy for momentum.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.340
So d omega dk may
depend on k and omega.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.390
So if it's d omega,
dk is a function.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.810
Which value should you use?

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.010
Well, the value at the k
that you're propagating.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.200
And this would be the
same as d omega dk.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.050
Is because of the constant
separating-- the same as de vp.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.610
But what is the kinetic energy
in terms of the momentum?

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.110
We wrote it last time.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.650
p squared over 2m.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.960
That's the kinetic energy
expressed in terms of momentum.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.540
So this is d dp of
p squared over 2m.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.560
Write p equal mv and you'll
recover the kinetic energy.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.750
And this is just--

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.224
because of the 2--

00:06:21.224 --> 00:06:27.560
p over m, which is the
velocity of the particle.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.030
And this is the reason
people believe de Broglie.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:38.350
De Broglie made sense
because the group velocity

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.670
of this [? package
?] would be correct.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.440
And that's a very
beautiful result.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.780
Actually, it's true
relativistically, as well.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.950
If you put the energy and
the momentum in relativity,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.910
this answer comes out exactly
the same, perfectly well.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.870
So to a large
degree, since it also

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.450
works for energy and
momentum in relativity,

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.750
there was a motivation
from relativity

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:11.960
that I want to quote, although
not elaborate on it too much.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.781
So--

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.168
the motivation--

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.790
is that in special relativity--

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.094
relativity--

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:36.850
the components of the energy
divided by c and the momentum

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.930
form a 4-vector.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.870
Just like position and time
forms a 4-vector and transform

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.430
nicely about--

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.350
with Lorenz transformation--
e and p form a 4-vector.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.970
Nevertheless, when
you consider phases--

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.470
like this, and you have x
and t that form a 4-vector,

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.140
the good behavior
of phases also imply

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.470
that k and omega
form a 4-vector.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:18.390
In fact, omega-- in relativity,
omega over c and the k vector--

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.900
form a 4-vector.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.170
You see, in all the
equations we've written--

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.340
and de Broglie-- de Broglie
in three dimensions or more,

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:35.309
really, is p vector
equal h bar k vector.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:41.320
And k is usually used for the
magnitude of this k vector.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.440
So this is also 4-vector
in special relativity.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:53.460
And therefore, vectors are
things that transform nicely.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.970
So it makes sense to
say that one 4-vector is

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.830
equal to another 4-vector.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.390
Because if it's true
in one reference frame,

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.820
it will be true in
every reference frame.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.260
So it's almost irresistible
to make them equal.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:13.760
And de Broglie, in some sense,
said this is equal to h bar.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.700
That's de Broglie.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.090
The interesting thing is that
this is true relativistically.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.120
But actually,
nonrelativistically, you

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.150
can make sense of this and set
it equal to be the same things.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.695
And the phase velocities, group
velocities all makes sense.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.800
Certainly, we've now said
for [? minor ?] particles

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.800
that e is equal to j bar omega.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.390
But another statement would
be that, yes, indeed, Einstein

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.335
said that.

00:09:48.335 --> 00:09:55.580
That for photons, e was
equal to h bar omega or h nu.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.000
And therefore, yes,
whatever happens for photons

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.280
happens for this matter waves.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.660
And so also, so this
is another argument.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.970
Group velocities is one.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.430
Special relativity
is another reason.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.630
And of, course photons.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.072
Einstein--

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:23.760
said that e is equal h nu,
which is equal to h bar omega.
