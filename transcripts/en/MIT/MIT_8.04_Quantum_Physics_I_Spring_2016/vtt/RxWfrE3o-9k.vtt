00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
PROFESSOR: This was a
differential equation

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.670
for the energy eigenstates phi.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.958
Supposed to be
normalizable functions.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.680
We looked at this equation
and decided we would first

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.800
clean out the constant.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.310
We did that by replacing x
by a unit-free coordinate u.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.130
For that we needed a constant
that carries units of length,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.960
and that constant is
given by this combination

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.030
of the constants of the problem.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.430
H-bar, m, and omega--

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.240
the frequency of the oscillator.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.275
We also defined the
unit-free energy--

00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:45.420
calligraphic e.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.330
In terms of which
the real energies

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.740
are given by multiples
of h omega over 2.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.120
So the problem has now become--

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.850
and this whole
differential equation

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.450
turns into this simple
differential equation.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.930
Simple looking--
let's say properly--

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.480
differential equation for phi--

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.060
as a function of u--

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.600
which is the new
rescaled coordinate,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.620
and where the energy
shows up here.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.700
And for some reason,
this equation

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.325
doesn't have
normalizable solutions.

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:26.890
Unless those
energies are peculiar

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.590
values that allow a
normalizable solution to exist.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.370
We looked at this equation
for u going to infinity,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.280
and realized that e to the
plus minus u squared over 2

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.820
are the possible dependencies.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.460
So we said-- without
loss of generality--

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.065
that phi could be written
as some function of u

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:56.690
to be determined times
this exponential.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.730
And we hope for a function
that may be a polynomial.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.790
So that the dependence
at the infinity

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.620
is governed by this factor.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.930
So with this for
the function phi,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.170
we substitute back into
the differential equation.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.230
Now the unknown is h.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.400
So you can take the derivatives
and find this differential

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.600
equation for h-- a second
order differential equation.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.300
And that's the equation.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.860
It may look a little
more complicated

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.840
than the equation
we started with,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.465
but it's much simpler, actually.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.340
There would be no polynomial
solution of this equation,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.364
but there may be a
polynomial solution

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.886
of the second equation.

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:49.840
So we have to solve
this equation now.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.610
And the way to do it is to
attempt a serious expansion.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:03.352
So we would try to write h
of u equals the sum over j.

00:03:03.352 --> 00:03:05.540
Equals 0 to infinity.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.340
Ak, u to the k.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.630
P equals 0 to infinity.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.750
Now, one way to
proceed with this

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.310
is to plot this expansion into
the differential equation.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.830
You will get three sums.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.570
You will have to shift indices.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.350
It's kind of a
little complicated.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.590
Actually, there's a simpler
way to do this in which you

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.830
think in the following way.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.355
You have this series
and you imagine

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:53.933
there's a term aj, u to the j,
plus aj plus 1, u to the j plus

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:57.330
1, plus aj plus 2.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.028
U to the j plus 2.

00:04:02.772 --> 00:04:16.690
And you say, let me
look at the terms with u

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.360
to the j in the
differential equation.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.180
So just look at the terms
that have a u to the power j.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.330
So from this second--

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.470
h vu squared-- what do we get?

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.210
Well, to get a term that has
a u to the j, you must start--

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.040
if you take two derivatives
and to end up with u to the j--

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.270
you must have started with this.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.910
U to the j plus 2.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.360
So this gives you j
plus 2, j plus 1--

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.240
taking the two derivatives--

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.070
aj plus 2, u to the j.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:11.790
From the series, the term with
u to the j from the second hvu

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.820
squared is this one.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.280
How about for minus 2u dh, du?

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:34.110
Well, if I start with h and
differentiate and then multiply

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.960
by u, I'm going to get u to
the j starting from u to the j.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.740
Because when I differentiate
I'll get u to the j minus 1,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.200
but the u will bring it back.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.320
So this time I get minus 2 a j--

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.345
or minus 2.

00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:57.201
One derivative j.

00:05:57.201 --> 00:06:00.500
That's aj, u to the j.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.202
So it's from this
[? step. ?] Minus 2.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.730
You differentiate
and you get that.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:18.750
From the last term,
e minus 1 times h,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:27.360
it's clearly e minus
1 times aj u to the j.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.930
So these are my three terms that
we get from the differential

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.570
equation.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.270
So at the end of the
day, what have we gotten?

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:54.030
We've gotten j plus 2, j plus
1, aj plus 2, minus 2jaj,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.770
plus e minus 1 aj.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.390
All multiplied by u to the j.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.752
And that's what we
get for u to the j.

00:07:06.752 --> 00:07:10.760
So if you wish, for the
whole differential equation--

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.790
all of the
differential equation--

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:24.710
you get the sum from j equals
0 to infinity of these things.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.400
And that should
be equal to zero.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.560
So this is the
whole left-hand side

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.775
of the differential equation.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.090
We calculated what is
the term u to the j.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.620
And there will be terms
from u to the zeroth

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.100
to u to the infinity.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.390
So that's the whole thing.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.350
And we need this differential
equation to be solved.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.150
So this must be zero.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.440
And whenever you have a function
of u like a polynomial-- well,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.040
we don't know if it's a
polynomial-- and it stops.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.560
But if you have a
function of u like this,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.710
each coefficient must be 0.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.330
Therefore, we have
that j plus 2,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:28.810
times j plus 1, times aj plus
2, is equal to 2 j plus 1 minus

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.520
e, aj.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:38.280
I set this whole combination
inside brackets to 0.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.710
So this term is equal to
this term and that term

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.970
on the other side.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.330
You get a plus 2j.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.210
A plus 1 and minus e.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:56.165
So basically this is
a recursion relation.

00:08:56.165 --> 00:09:03.855
Aj plus 2 is equal
to 2j plus 1 minus e,

00:09:03.855 --> 00:09:10.050
over j plus 2, j
plus 1 times aj.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.870
And this is perfectly nice.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.630
This is what should
have happened

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.200
for this kind of
differential equation--

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.820
a second-order linear
differential equation.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.320
We get a recursion
that jumps one step.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.205
That's very nice.

00:09:37.205 --> 00:09:42.700
And this should hold
for j equals 0, 1, 2--

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.420
all numbers.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.960
So when you start solving this,
there's two ways to solve it.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.977
You can decide, OK, let me
assume that you know a0--

00:09:52.977 --> 00:09:54.290
you give it.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.500
Give a0.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.215
Well, from this equation--
from a0-- you can calculate a2.

00:10:00.215 --> 00:10:03.070
And then from a2 you
can calculate a4.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.745
And successively.

00:10:04.745 --> 00:10:09.160
So you get a2, a4--

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:09.940
all of those.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:17.350
And this corresponds to an even
solution of the differential

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.010
equation for h.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.010
Even coefficients.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.290
Even solution for h.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:36.190
Or-- given this recursion--
you could also give a1--

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:41.210
give it-- and then
calculate a3, a5--

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.354
and those would be
an odd solution.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.375
So you need two
conditions to solve this.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:01.990
And those conditions
are a0 and a1,

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:09.570
which is the same as specifying
the value of the function h

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.580
at 0--

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.970
because the value of the
function h at 0 is a0.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.460
And the value of the derivative
of the function at 0,

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.593
which is a1.

00:11:26.537 --> 00:11:36.910
[INAUDIBLE] h of mu is a0
plus a1u plus a2u squared.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.040
So the derivative
at 0 is [? h1. ?]

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.730
And that's what you must have
for solving a differential

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.990
equation-- a second-order
differential equation for h.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.010
You need to know the value
of the function at zero

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.920
and the value of the
function at the derivative

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.500
of the function--

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.110
at zero, as well.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.310
And then you can
start integrating it.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:08.670
So this first gives you a
solution a0 plus a2u squared,

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.780
plus a4u to the fourth.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:21.640
And the second is an a1u plus
a3u cubed, plus these ones.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.220
So all looks pretty much OK.
