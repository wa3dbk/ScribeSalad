00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
PROFESSOR: In order to learn
more about this subject,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.060
we must do the wave packets.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.060
So this is the place
where you really

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.520
connect this need solution
of Schrodinger's equation,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.440
the energy eigenstates,
to a physical problem.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.925
So we'll do our wave packets.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.600
So we've been dealing
with packets for a while,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.110
so I think it's not going to
be that difficult. We've also

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.170
been talking about
stationary phase

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.620
and you've practiced that,
so you have the math ready.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.630
We should not have
a great difficulty.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:53.700
So let's new wave packets with--

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.060
I'm going to use A
equals 1 in the solution.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.360
Now, I've erased every
solution, and we'll

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.300
work with E greater than
v naught to begin with.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.600
The reason I want to work
with E greater than v naught

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.535
is because there is
a transmitted wave.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.230
So that's kind of nice.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.300
So what am I going to do?

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.920
I'm going to write it
this following way.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.921
So here is a solution
with A equals to 1.

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:40.590
e to the i kx plus k
minus k bar over k plus k

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.300
bar e to the minus i kx.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.850
And this was for x less than 0.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.140
And indeed, when there
was an A, there was a B,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.495
if A is equal to 1, remember we
solve for the ratio of B to A

00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:06.060
and it was this number
so I put it there.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.440
I'm just writing it
a little differently,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.845
but this is a solution.

00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:18.860
And for x greater
than 0, the solution

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:28.680
is C, which was 2k over k
plus k bar e to the i k bar x.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.070
Now we have to
superimpose things.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.550
But I will do it very slowly.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.530
First, is this a solution of
the full Schrodinger equation?

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.030
No.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.610
Is this a solution a
time-independent Schrodinger

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.810
equation?

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.420
What do I need to
make it the solution

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.090
of the full
Schrodinger equation?

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.890
I need e to the
minus i Et over h.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.350
And I need it here as well.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.340
And this is a psi
now of x and t.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.490
There's two options for x,
less than 0 and x less than 0,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.710
and those are solutions.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.310
So far so good.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.310
Now I'm going to
multiply each solution.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.070
So this is a solution of the
full Schrodinger equation,

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.620
not just the time-independent
one, all of it.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.090
It has two expressions
because there's

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.635
a little discontinuity in
the middle, but as a whole,

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:48.980
it is a solution.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.470
That is the solution.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.830
Some mathematicians would
put a theta function here,

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.710
theta of minus x and add
this with a theta of x so

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.916
that this one exists for
less than x, x less than 0,

00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:07.790
and this would exist
for less greater than 0.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.930
I would not do that.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.740
I will write cases, but
the philosophy is the same.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.610
So let's multiply
by a number, f of k.

00:04:23.336 --> 00:04:24.555
Still a solution.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.900
k is fixed, so this
is just the number.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.360
Now superposition.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.050
That will still
be a solution if I

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.978
do the same superposition in
the two formulas, integral dk

00:04:43.978 --> 00:04:47.150
and integral dk.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.960
That's still a solution
of a Schrodinger equation.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.910
Now I want to ask
you what limits

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.305
I should use for that integral.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.270
And if anybody has
an opinion on that,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.910
it might naively be minus
infinity to infinity,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.580
and that might be good,
but maybe it's not so good.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.840
It's not so good.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.410
Why is not so good, minus
infinity to infinity?

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.310
Would I have to do from
minus infinity on my force.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.801
Does anybody force me?

00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:28.300
No.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.430
You're superimposing solutions.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.030
For different values of
k, you're superimposing.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.520
You had a solution,
and another solution

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.930
for another, another solution.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.125
What goes wrong if I go from
minus infinity to infinity?

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.670
Yes.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.526
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the wave
packet's going to be in one

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:53.730
direction, so it [? shouldn't
?] be [? applied. ?]

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.730
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:00.260
You see here, this
wave packet is

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.490
going to be going in the
positive x direction,

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.330
positive direction, as
long as k is positive.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.640
It's just that the direction is
determined by the relative sign

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.950
within those quantities.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.560
E is positive in this
case. k is positive.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.810
This moves to the right.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.160
If I start putting things
where k is negative,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.080
I'm going to start producing
things and move to the left

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.740
and to the right in
a terrible confusion.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.460
So yes, it should go 0 to
infinity, 0 to infinity.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.410
And f of k, what is it?

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:40.640
Well, in our usual
picture, k f of k

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.580
is some function that is
peaked around some k naught.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:58.150
And this whole thing
is psi of x and t,

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.480
the full solution
of a wave packet.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.160
So now you see how the
A, B, and C coefficients

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.640
enter into the construction
of a wave packet.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.450
I look back at the
textbook in which I

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:19.130
learned quantum mechanics,
and it's a book by Schiff.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.695
It's a very good book.

00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:22.660
It's an old book.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.710
I think was probably
written in the '60s.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.420
And it goes through some
discussion of wave packets

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.180
and then presents a jewel,
says with a supercomputer,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.510
we've been able to evaluate
numerically these things,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.790
something you can do now with
three seconds in your laptop,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.250
and it was the only
way to do this.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.840
So you produce an f of k.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.780
You fix their energy and
send in a wave packet

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.730
and see what happens.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.920
You can do numerical
experiments with wave packets

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.790
and see how the packet gets
distorted at the obstacle

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.400
and how it eventually
bounces back or reflects,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.310
so it's very nice.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.450
So there is our solution.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.100
Now we're going to say
a few things about it.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.250
I want to split it a little bit.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.720
So lets go here.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.570
So how do we split it?

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:41.580
I say the solution
is this whole thing,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:52.540
so let's call the
incident wave that

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.390
is going to be defined
for x less than 0

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.400
and t, this is x less than 0.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.190
And the incident
wave packet is dk 0

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:17.170
to infinity f of k e to i kx e
to the minus i et over h bar.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.800
And this is just defined
for x less than 0,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.250
and that's so important
that write it here.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.940
For x less than 0, you have
an incident wave packet.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.960
And then you also have
a reflected wave packet,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.030
x less than 0 t is
the second part dk

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:54.780
f of k k minus k bar over k
plus k bar e to the minus i kx

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.210
e to the minus i et over h bar.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.370
It's also for x
less than 0, and we

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:11.700
have a psi transmitted for
x greater than 0 and t,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:22.012
and that would be 0 to infinity
dk f of k 2k over k plus k bar

00:10:22.012 --> 00:10:30.480
e to the i k bar x e to
the minus i et over h bar.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.420
Lots of writing, but
that's important.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.280
And notice given
our definitions,

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:48.960
the total psi of x and t is
equal to psi incident plus psi

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:56.180
reflected for x less than 0,
and the total wave function of x

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.160
and t is equal to
psi transmitted

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.800
for x greater than 0.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.450
Lots of equations.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:15.293
I'll give you a second to copy
them if you are copying them.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:28.490
So now comes if we really
want to understand this,

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.730
we have to push it
a little further.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.380
And perhaps in exercises we
will do some numerics to play

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.220
with this thing as well.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:47.460
So I want to do stationary
phase approximation here.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.920
Otherwise, we don't
see what these packets,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.540
how they're moving.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.210
So you have some practice
already with this.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:00.120
You're supposed to have a
phase whose derivative is 0,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.840
and it's very, very
slowly at that place where

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.600
there could be a contribution.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.330
Now every integral
has the f of k.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.560
So that still dominates
everything, of course.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:20.230
You see, if f of
k is very narrow,

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.550
you pretty much could
evaluate these functions

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:32.070
at the value of k naught
and get a rather accurate

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.140
interpretation of the answer.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.280
The main difficulty would
be to do the leftover

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.480
part of the integral.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:45.200
But again, here we
can identify phases.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.010
We're going to take f of k to
be localized and to be real.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:54.530
So there is no phase
associated with it,

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.600
and there is no
phases associated

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.380
with these quantities either,
so the phases are up there.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.320
So let's take, for
example, psi incident.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.900
What is this stationary
phase condition?

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.660
Would be that the
derivative with respect

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.290
to k that we are
integrating of the phase,

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:20.490
kx minus Et over h bar must
be evaluated at k naught

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.220
and must be equal to 0.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.980
So that's our stationary
phase approximation

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.390
for the top interval.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:34.870
Now remember that E is equal
to h squared k squared over 2m.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.780
So what does this give you?

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:43.470
That the peak of the
pulse of the wave packet

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.490
is localized at the place where
the following condition holds.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:58.310
x minus de dk, with an h bar
will give an h k t over m

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.650
evaluated at k naught equals 0.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:12.670
So this will be x equals
h bar k naught over m t.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:18.960
That's where the incident
wave is propagating.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.670
Now, look at that incident wave.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.370
What does it do
for negative time?

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:33.210
As time is infinite and
negative, x is negative,

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.270
and it's far away.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.930
Yes, the packet is very much
to the left of the barrier

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.470
at time equals minus infinity.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.640
And that's consistent
because psi incident is only

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.070
defined for x less than 0.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.910
It's only defined there.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.630
So as long as t is negative,
yes, the center of the packet

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.910
is moving in.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.255
I'll maybe draw it here.

00:15:00.255 --> 00:15:05.690
The center of the packet is
moving in from minus infinity

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.450
into the wall, and
that is the picture.

00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:19.000
The packet is here, and
it's moving like that,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.726
and that's t negative.

00:15:21.726 --> 00:15:30.220
The psi incident is coming
from the left into the barrier,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.305
and that's OK.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:43.080
But then what happens with
psi incident as t is positive?

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.800
As t is positive, psi
incident, well, it's

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.030
just another integral.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.400
You might do it and
see what you get,

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.490
but we can see what
we will get, roughly.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:16:00.090
When t is positive, the answer
would be you get something

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.370
if you have positive x.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.240
But psi incident is
only for negative x.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.540
So for negative x, you cannot
satisfy the stationarity

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:17.410
condition, and therefore, for
negative x and positive time,

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.930
t positive, psi
incident is nothing.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.090
It's a little wiggle.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:26.860
There's probably
something, a little bit--

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.280
look at it with Mathematica--

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.280
there will be something.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:36.730
But for positive t, since
you only look at negative x,

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.280
you don't satisfy
stationarity, so you're not

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.120
going to get much.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.950
So that's interesting.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.010
Somehow automatically
psi incident just

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.120
exists for negative time.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.324
For time near 0 is very
interesting because somehow

00:16:54.324 --> 00:16:55.990
stationary [INAUDIBLE],
when you assess,

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.150
you still get
something, but you're

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.140
going to see what the packet
does as it hits the thing.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.550
Let's do the second
one of psi reflected.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:17.440
d dk this time would be
kx with a different sign,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:24.339
minus kx minus E t over h
bar at k naught equals 0.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:30.090
For the reflected wave, the
phase is really the same.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.325
Yeah, this factor is a
little more complicated,

00:17:32.325 --> 00:17:34.720
but it doesn't have
any phase in it.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.090
It's real, so [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.150
So I just change a
sign, so this time I'm

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.790
going to get the change of sign.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:48.820
x is equal to minus h
bar k naught over m t.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:55.170
And this says that for t
positive, you get things.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.860
And in fact, as t is positive
your are at x negative.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.170
And remember psi reflected is
only defined for x negative,

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.390
so you can satisfy
stationary, and you're

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.040
going to get something.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.170
So for t positive,
you're going to get

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.790
as t increases, a thing that
goes more and more to the left

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.130
as you would expect.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:23.340
So you will get psi
reflected going to the left.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:30.645
I will leave for you to
do the psi transmitted.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:37.550
It's a little different
because you have now k bar,

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.910
and you have to take
the derivative of k bar

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.350
with respect to k.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:46.720
It's going to be a little
more interesting example.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:55.360
But the answer is that this
one moves as x equals h bar k

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.027
bar over m t.

00:19:00.027 --> 00:19:05.700
k bar is really the
momentum on the right,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:17.690
and since psi transmitted
exists only for positive x,

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:21.290
this relation can be
satisfied for positive t.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:33.370
For positive t, there
will be a psi transmitted.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:41.940
The psi transmitted certainly
exists for negative t,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:47.910
but for negative t, stationarity
would want x to be negative,

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.810
but that's not defined.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:20:00.220
So for negative t on the right,
yes, psi transmitted maybe

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.160
it's a little bit of
something especially for times

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.090
that are not too negative.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.880
But the picture is that
stationary phase tells you

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.920
that these packets,
psi incident,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.370
pretty much exist just
for negative t and psi

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:19.090
reflected and psi transmitted
exist for positive t.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.460
And these are
consequences of the fact

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.910
that psi incident and psi
reflected exist for negative x.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.350
The other exists for
positive x, and that coupled

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:35.020
with stationarity produces
the physical picture that you

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.770
expect intuitively, that
the incident wave is just

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.940
something, part of
the solution that

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.730
exists just at the beginning.

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.740
And somehow it whistles away.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.940
Some of it becomes transmitted,
some of it becomes reflected.
