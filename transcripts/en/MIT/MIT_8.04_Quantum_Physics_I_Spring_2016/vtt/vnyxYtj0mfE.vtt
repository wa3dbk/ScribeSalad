00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.030
PROFESSOR: So let's write
the Hamiltonian again

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.490
in terms of v and v dagger.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.020
So for this equation, v
dagger v, from this equation,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.982
is equal to 2 h bar over
m omega, a dagger a.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.885
And immediately above
equation v dagger v's, this--

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:34.420
we substitute into
the Hamiltonian.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:42.870
And Hamiltonian becomes the nice
object h bar omega, a dagger

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.680
a plus 1/2 if you want.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.550
All right.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.870
We did this hard work
of factorization.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.390
We have to show what's good for.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.430
Well, in fact, we're
going to be able to solve

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.280
the harmonic oscillator
without ever talking

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.250
about differential-- almost
ever talking about differential

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.750
equations.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.830
In fact, we will not talk about
the second order differential

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190
equation.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.292
Thanks to our
great work here, we

00:01:21.292 --> 00:01:24.640
will have to talk about a first
order differential equation,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.600
and a much simpler one.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.130
And only one, not for
and n 1, 2, 3, infitinty,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.480
infinity number of polynomials.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.060
It's a great simplification.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.660
Other Hamiltonians
admit factorization.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.070
In fact, there's whole books
of factorizable Hamiltonians,

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.360
because those are the nicest
Hamiltonians to solve.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.920
Let's see why, though.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.620
We haven't said why yet.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.040
Here is the leading
thing that we can do.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.460
Remember we recalled 5
psi the integral dx phi

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.314
star of x psi of x.

00:02:11.314 --> 00:02:15.090
This is just notation.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.200
So the expectation value,
calculate the expectation value

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.050
of the Hamiltonian
in some state psi.

00:02:28.184 --> 00:02:33.100
Could be the general state sum.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.526
So what are you supposed to do?

00:02:35.526 --> 00:02:44.030
You're supposed to do psi h psi.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.670
This is normalized state,
the expectation value

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.840
is the integral
of psi star h psi.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.700
That's what this is.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.300
But now, let's put
in this information.

00:03:02.992 --> 00:03:11.600
And the expectation value
of this would be psi h--

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.530
or let me do it this way-- h
bar ome-- well, let's go slow.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:33.860
Psi h omega a dagger a a
psi plus h omega over 2 psi.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.910
So I just calculated
h on psi, and I

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.980
wrote what it is-- h
omega this, this term.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.890
So this is two terms--

00:03:50.890 --> 00:04:04.236
h omega psi a dagger a psi
plus h omega over 2 psi psi.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.940
OK.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.660
So what did I gain
with the factorization?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.019
So far, it looks like nothing.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.420
But here we go--

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.240
this term is equal to 1,
because the wave function

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.800
is normalized.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.110
And here I can do one thing--

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:37.210
I can remember my definition
of a Hermitian conjugate.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.880
I can move an operator and
put its Hermitian conjugate

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.810
on the other side.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.596
So think of this
operator, a dagger--

00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:53.550
a dagger is acting on
this wave function.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.050
What is a dagger?

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.030
It's this.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.190
And p is h bar over idex.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.030
So this-- you know how to act.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.770
But if a dagger is here, I
can put it on the first wave

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.630
function, but I must put
the dagger of this operator,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.550
and the dagger of a dagger is a.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:26.165
So this is h omega, a psi
a psi plus h omega over 2.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.700
Now here comes the next thing.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.630
If this is an inner
product, any phi phi

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.375
is greater or equal than 0,
because you would have phi star

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:48.670
phi, and that's positive.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.050
So any of that [INAUDIBLE]
is greater or equal than 0.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.210
Note-- here you have
some function, but here

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.100
the same function.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.660
It is this case.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.060
That thing is greater
or equal than 0.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.540
That is the great benefit of
the factorized Hamiltonian--

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.455
if h has a v dagger v, you
can flip the v dagger here

00:06:14.455 --> 00:06:18.830
and it becomes v psi v
psi, and it's positive.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.920
And you've learned
something very important,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.210
and you can get
positive energies.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.090
In fact, from here,
since this is positive,

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.540
this must be greater or
equal than h omega over 2.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.530
Because this is greater
than equal than 0.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.720
So the expectation value
of the Hamiltonian--

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.130
if you would be thinking
now of energy eigenstates,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.750
the energy eigenvalue
is the expectation value

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.240
of the Hamiltonian in
an energy eigenstate

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.680
must be greater than
h bar omega over 2.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.710
And in some blackboard
that has been erased,

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.820
we remember that the lowest
energy state had energy--

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.250
there it is.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:18.010
The lowest energy state
has energy h omega over 2.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.860
So look at this, and
you say, OK, this

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:29.590
shows that any eigenstate
must have energy

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.060
greater than h omega over 2.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:39.520
But could there be one state
for which the energies exactly

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.920
h omega over 2.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.010
Yes, if this inner product is 0.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.760
But for an inner product
of two things to be 0,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.270
each function must be 0.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:08:01.160
So from this, we conclude that
if there is a ground state,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.940
it's a state for which a phi--

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.750
or a psi is equal to 0.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.880
So this is a very
nice conclusion.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:29.240
So if the lower
bound is realized,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:37.980
so that you get a state with
energy equal h bar over 2,

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:46.733
then it must be true
that a psi is equal to 0.

00:08:46.733 --> 00:08:59.410
And a psi equal to 0 means x
plus ip over m omega on psi

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:07.340
is equal to 0, or x plus
p is h bar over i ddx,

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:16.050
so this is h bar over m omega
d/dx on psi of x is equal to 0.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.700
And that was the promised fact.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.940
We have turned the second
order differential equation

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.070
into a first order
differential equation.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.630
Think of that magic that
has happened to do that.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.305
You had a second order
differential equation

00:09:35.305 --> 00:09:39.480
because the Hamiltonian
has x squared b squared.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.960
By factorizing, you go two first
order differential operators.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.420
And by Hermeticity, you
were led to the condition

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.500
that the lowest energy
state had to be killed by a.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.760
That's why a is called
the annihilation operator.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.010
It should be killed.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.065
And now you have to solve
a first order differential

00:10:04.065 --> 00:10:08.640
equation, which is a game.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.570
An easy game compared with
a second order differential

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.020
equation.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.110
So let's, of course, solve it.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.450
It doesn't take any time.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.270
Let's call this
the ground state.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.190
If it exists.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:35.850
And this gives you d psi 0 v x
is equal to minus m omega over

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.665
h bar x psi .

00:10:38.665 --> 00:10:39.165
0.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.920
This can be degraded easily
or you can guess the answer.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.110
It's an exponential.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.230
Anything that differentiates
that you should extend

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.300
the same function
as an exponential--

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:05.310
e to the minus m omega
2 h squared x squared

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.290
is the solution.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:11.670
Psi 0 of x is equal to
some number times that.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.620
This was-- the number is
the Hermit polynomials

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.125
sub 0, and that exponential,
this exponential,

00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:23.430
we wrote a few blackboards ago.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.702
It's a good exponential.

00:11:24.702 --> 00:11:28.500
It's a perfect Gaussian.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.250
It's our ground state.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.110
And 0, if you want
to normalize it,

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:40.970
m 0 is equal to m omega
over phi h bar to the 1/4.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.430
And that is the ground state.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:55.010
And it has energy,
h omega over 2.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.520
You could see what
the energy is by doing

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.480
this very simple calculation.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.910
Look, get accustomed
to these things.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.690
H hat psi 0.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.690
What is h?

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:17.285
Is h omega a dagger a
plus 1/2 acting on psi 0.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.120
The a acting on psi
0 already kills it.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.920
Because that's the
defining equation.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.600
Well that's 0.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:37.030
And you get 1/2 h bar omega,
confirming that you did

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:44.480
get this thing to be correct.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.040
So this is only the
beginning of the story.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.690
We found the ground
state, and now we

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.760
have to find the excited states.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.880
Let me say a couple
of words to set up

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.012
this discussion for next time.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.640
The excited states appear
in a very nice way as well.

00:13:12.608 --> 00:13:23.612
So first a tiny bit
of language, of h bar.

00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:29.350
This equal h omega,
a dagger a is usually

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.070
called the number operator.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.870
We'll explain more
on that next time.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.985
So n number operator
is a dagger a.

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:42.620
It's a permission operator,
and it's pretty much

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.572
the Hamiltonian.

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:45.380
It's the number, it's called.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.250
Why is it called the number
is what we have to figure out.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.030
It is a counting operator--
it just looks at the state

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.990
and counts things.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.270
So what does this give us?

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:03.080
Well, we also know that
the number operator kills

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.137
phi 0, because a kills psi 0.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.450
A kills it.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.890
So that's what we have.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:20.270
So we did say that
a was a destruction

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:25.710
operator, annihilation
operator, because it annihilates

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.280
the ground state.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.800
So if a annihilates
the ground state,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.290
a dagger cannot annihilate
the ground state.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.790
Why?

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:44.130
Because a dagger with a
computator is equal to 1.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.070
Look at this.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:49.520
This is a a dagger
minus a dagger a.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.140
Act on the ground state.

00:14:54.804 --> 00:14:56.500
That's it.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.760
Now this term kills it.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.840
But this term
better not kill it,

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.900
because it has to give
you back the ground

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.230
state if this is true.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:06.950
And this is true.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.080
So a dagger doesn't
kill the ground state.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:16.000
Since it doesn't kill it, it's
called a creation operator.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.590
So you have this
state, but now there's

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:25.710
also this state a dagger
acting on the vacuum.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:31.130
And there's a state a dagger
a dagger acting on the vacuum.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.480
And all those.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.950
And what we will
figure out next time

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.780
is that, yes, this
is the ground state.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.890
And this is the
first excited state.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.280
And this is the
second excited state.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.150
And goes on forever.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.440
So we'll have a very compact
formula for the excited states

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.310
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:56.260
They're just creation
operators acting on the ground

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.620
state or the [INAUDIBLE].
