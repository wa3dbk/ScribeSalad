00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.430
BARTON ZWIEBACH: De Broglie,
as we discussed last time, we

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.850
spoke about waves.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.955
Matter waves.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.010
Because people
thought, anyway light

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.230
is waves so the surprising
thing that would

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.490
be that matters are waves.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:53.735
So a free particle with momentum
p can be associated to a wave--

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.790
to a plane wave, in fact--

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.860
plane wave-- with
wavelength lambda

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.370
equals Planck's constant over p.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:21.430
So this wave is what eventually
becomes a famous wave function.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.910
So de Broglie was
writing the example

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.500
or trying to write the example
of what eventually would become

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.100
wave functions, and the
equations for this wave

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.960
would become the
Schrodinger equation.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.910
So really, this is a pillar
of quantum mechanics.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.500
You're getting there when
you talk about this wave.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.300
So Schrodinger's equation is a
wave equation for these matter

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.290
waves and this plane
wave eventually

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.640
will become the wave
function and there is

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.330
a Schrodinger equation for it.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.930
So it's a wave of what?

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.160
he was asking-- de Broglie had
little idea what that wave was.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.190
When you have waves, like
electromagnetic waves,

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.310
you have polarization, you
have directional properties,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.890
the electric field
points in some direction,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.690
the wave is polarized.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.080
Is there a same property
for the wave function?

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.510
The answer is yes.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.640
We'll have to wait a
little in 8.04 to see it,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.020
but it has to do with spin.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.020
When the particles
have spin, there

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.780
are directional
properties of the wave

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.020
and typically, you use
several wave functions

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.130
that correspond to directional
components of this wave.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.700
So photons are spin
1 particle electrons

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.560
or spin 1/2 particles,
so there will be

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.010
directional properties to it.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.550
But to begin with,
let's consider cases

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.700
where this directional
properties don't matter

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.530
so much, and for the
case of electrons,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.040
if the electrons
have small velocities

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.880
or they are inside
small magnetic fields

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.260
where some of these properties
of the spin is important,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.820
we can ignore that and work
with a wave function that

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.020
will be a complex number.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.460
So it will be a wave function--
we'll denote it by the letter

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.960
psi, capitol psi--

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.120
that depends on
position and time,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.700
and that's the wave function.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.130
And to begin with, simplicity
will be one of them,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.180
and it's a complex number.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.870
And it's just one wave function.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.070
And the obvious questions
about this wave function are,

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.890
is it measurable and
what it's meaning is?

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.390
So is it measurable?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.120
And what is its meaning?

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.110
But to understand some
of that-- in fact,

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.730
to get to realize that these
waves are no ordinary waves,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.720
we're going to think
a little about what

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.400
it means to have a wave
whose wavelength is inversely

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.860
proportional to the
momentum of a particle.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.370
That's certainly a
strange statement

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.930
and probably these are
strange waves as you will see.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.440
And by understanding that
these are strange waves,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.000
we are ready to admit later on
that the interpretation could

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.030
be somewhat surprising as well.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:24.100
And the nature of this number
is, again, a little strange

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.970
as you will see.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.715
So all of that will come by just
looking a little more in detail

00:05:31.715 --> 00:05:34.250
at this formula of
de Broglie and asking

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.590
a very simple question--

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.290
you have this particle
moving with some momentum

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.560
and I say, OK, it has
this much wavelength.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.910
How about the person?

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.410
If one of you is moving
relative to me, like you usually

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.140
do with Einstein,
these observers

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.300
that are boosted, but let's just
do non-relativistic physics,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.050
what is called the Galilean
transformation, in which there

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.110
will be another observer
moving with constant velocity

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.120
with respect to you and
you and that other observer

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.460
compare the results on the
momentum and the wavelength

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:22.170
and see if you find a reasonable
agreement or things make sense.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:31.670
So we're going to try to
think of p is h over lambda.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.810
And 2 pi's are very
useful sometimes.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:43.830
So you put an h over
2 pi here and a 2 pi

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.180
over lambda and you rewrite
this in terms of quantities

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.370
that are a little more common--

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:57.530
one is h-bar and the other
is called the wave number k.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:04.560
So these are these two
constants and this one

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.905
is called the wave number.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.770
The 2 pi's are all
over the place.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.190
If you have a wave
with some frequency nu,

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.570
there's also a frequency
omega, which is 2 pi nu.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.840
So we're going to
look at this wave,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.550
and it has some momentum
and some wave number,

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.520
therefore it has
some wavelength,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.900
and let's see-- if
we compare things

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.630
between two different
frames, what do we find?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:52.740
So we'll put the
frame S and a frame S

00:07:52.740 --> 00:08:10.676
prime moving with some velocity
plus v in the x direction.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:19.380
So the setup is
relatively common.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:24.230
We'll have one frame
here that's the S frame,

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.650
and it's the x-axis
of the S frame.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.940
And the S prime frame coincided
with the S frame at time

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.880
equals 0-- now it's moving,
so it's now over here,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.830
it's S prime.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:44.043
It has moved a distance of vt--

00:08:44.043 --> 00:08:47.680
it's moving with
velocity v and there's t.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.240
And S prime has--

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.300
and x is x prime.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.270
On this, we're going
to write a few things.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:03.210
We're going to say we
have a particle of mass m.

00:09:06.514 --> 00:09:15.480
It has velocity v
underbar, otherwise

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.820
I'm going to get all
my velocities confused.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.320
So this velocity v is the
velocity of the frame,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.110
v underbar is the
velocity of the particle,

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.760
and v underbar prime,
because the velocity depends

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.080
on the frame of reference.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.020
Similarly, it will
have a momentum--

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.730
and all the things we're
doing are nonrelativistic,

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.015
so momentum p or p prime.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.800
Here is the particle.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:59.260
And that's the position x
prime with the particle.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.670
And that's a position
x of the particle.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.930
So that's our system.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:11.530
This particle is moving with
some velocity over here,

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:16.300
and we're going to compare
these observations.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.070
So it's simple to
write equations

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.750
to relate the coordinates.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:27.890
So x prime, for
example, is the value

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:33.030
of the corner at x of the
particle minus the separation.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.840
So x minus vt.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.740
And I should say it
here, we're assuming

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.100
that t prime is
equal to t, which

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.010
is good nonrelativistically.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.380
It's fairly accurate.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.260
But that's the exact
Galilean answer--

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.690
when you talk about
Galilean transformations

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.050
and Galilean physics,
it's very useful.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.850
Even in condensed
matter physics,

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.840
people write these days lots of
papers about Galilean physics,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.050
so when you have particles
moving with low velocities,

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:14.200
it's accurate enough, so
might as well consider it.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.280
And these are the two ways
you transform coordinates,

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.630
coordinates and time.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:26.630
So from this, we can take a
time derivative talking about

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:32.780
the particle-- so we have
dx prime and dt prime or t,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.580
it's your choice--

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.230
I guess I should
put dt prime here,

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:48.690
dx/dt minus v, which means that
the velocity v prime underbar

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:57.360
is equal to v underbar
minus little v.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.160
And that's what you expect.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.580
The difference of
velocities is given

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:07.870
by the subtraction
of the velocity

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.780
that the frame is moving.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.780
So if this particular has some
high velocity with respect

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.020
to the lab frame with
respect to this frame,

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.250
it will have a smaller velocity.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.760
So this sine seems right.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.940
And therefore,
multiplying by m, you

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:33.530
get that p prime is
equal to p minus mv.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.280
So if you have
that, we would have

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.970
that lambda prime, the de
Broglie wavelength measured

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:50.530
by either running person,
is equal to h over

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:56.930
p prime is equal to
h over p minus mv,

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:05.550
and it's quite different, quite
substantially different from h

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:11.370
over p, which is equal to the
de Broglie wavelength seen

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.400
in the lab.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.820
So these two de
Broglie wavelengths

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.820
will differ very substantially.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.530
If this would be a
familiar type of wave--

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.720
like a sound wave
that propagates

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.740
in the medium, any kind of wave
that propagates in a medium,

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.940
like a water wave or
any wave of that type--

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.240
this would simply not happen.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.160
In the case of those waves,
you get a Doppler shift--

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.420
omega is changed-- but
the wavelength really

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.100
doesn't change.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.780
The wavelength is
almost like something

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.240
you look at when
you take a picture

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.760
and whether you take
a picture of the wave

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.120
as you run or you take
a picture of the wave

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.600
as you are sitting still, you'll
measure the same wavelength.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.370
Let me convince you of that.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.460
It's an opportunity to
just do a little more

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.650
formal transformations,
because these

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.710
are going to be Galilean
transformations,

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.250
simple transformations.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.010
So our first observation is
that the de Broglie wavelength

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:39.440
don't agree, which
pretty much, I think,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.540
intuitively is saying that
if you could just sort of see

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.140
those waves and measure
the distance between peaks,

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.110
they should agree, but they
don't, so there's something

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.080
very strange happening here.
