00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.150
PROFESSOR: The simplest
quantum system.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.190
In order to decide what could
be the simplest quantum system

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.320
you could say a
particle in a box.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.640
It's very simple, but in a
sense it's not all that simple.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.410
It has infinitely many states.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.650
All these functions on an
interval, and then the energy

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.390
is where infinitely many of
them, so not that simple.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.420
OK, infinite bound says
something with one bound.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.880
OK, a delta function potential
just one bound state,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.550
but it has infinitely
many scattering states.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.300
It's still complicated.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.710
What could be simpler?

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.530
Suppose you have the
Schrodinger equation.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.110
H psi.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.910
And we work in general we
know that this thing has

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.730
energy eigenstates, and probably
we should focus on them.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.930
So Psi equal E to the
minus I, Et over H bar.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.360
Little psi, and then
have H Psi equal E psi.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.040
That is quantum mechanics,
and you could say,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.660
well it's up to me to decide
what the Hamiltonian is.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.330
If I want to invent the simplest
quantum mechanical system.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.100
On the other hand,
there are some things

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.230
that should be true.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.360
These are complex
numbers, energies,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.850
H must be an operator
that has units of energy.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.910
And we also saw that if
we want probabilities

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.699
that are going to be
associated with PSI

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:16.790
squared to be conserved
we need H to be Hermitian.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.540
There should be some
notion of inner product.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.560
Some sort of operation
that gives us

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.305
numbers we used to defy
PSI that gives a number.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.720
To complex numbers
in general, and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.855
has the property of somewhat
conjugates this thing.

00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:43.590
It has this, and integrates,
but maybe if you're

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.820
doing the simplest quantum
mechanical system in the world

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.850
it will be simpler
than an integral.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.710
Integrals are complicated.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.740
But anyway we have
something like that,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.450
and we want H to be Hermitian.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:13.460
Let me write this in
for any operator A,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.370
this is equal to a dagger Psi.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.560
And that's a
Hermitian conjugate.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.990
That's a general definition,
and we want H to be Hermitian.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:37.630
H dagger equal H.
OK, in some sense

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.810
you could say that's
quantum mechanics for you.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.580
It's a Schrodinger equation, a
Hamiltonian, an inner product,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.210
a notion of Hermitian
operators, and then you're

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.890
supposed to solve it.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.270
And what we've done is solve
this for a whole semester,

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.550
and try to understand
some physics out of it.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.380
But we started with the notion
that something simple would

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.020
be a particle living
in one dimension,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.870
and that's a very
reasonable thought.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.500
Motivated from
classical mechanics

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.060
that surely we have
particles that move,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.990
and moving in three dimensions
is more complicated.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.540
We waited towards the
end of the semester

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.110
to do three dimensions,
but moving in one dimension

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.940
is already kind of
interesting, and complicated.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.310
We had Psi of X that represented
the fact that the particle

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.630
could be anywhere here.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.240
How can I simplify this?

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.660
The key to simplifying
this is maybe

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.520
not to be too attached to
the physics for a while,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.490
and try to visualize what could
you describe that was simpler.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:20.650
Suppose the particle could only
live at two points X1, and X2.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.960
The particle can
be here, or here.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.750
Now we've re-aligned
down to just two points.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.700
It can only be this
point, or that point.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.260
And you say, that's
very in physical.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.920
But let's wait a second,
and think of this.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.480
What does that mean?

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.060
We used to have Psi effects
that could be anywhere,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.435
and we wrote it as a function.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.320
If I think of this
the simplest thing OK,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.560
the simplest thing is a
particle is just at one point.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.010
There is only one point.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.300
The whole world for the particle
is one point, and it's there.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.900
But that probably is
not too interesting

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.250
because the particle is there.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.210
The probability defined
there is always one,

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.040
and what can you do with It?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.820
But if you have two points
there's room for funny things

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.440
to happen.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.250
We'll assume that the
particle can be in two points.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:34.360
From F of this Psi effects will
go to a new Psi effects that

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.450
has two pieces of information.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:44.990
The value of PSI at x1,
and the value of Psi at X2.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.530
And those are two
numbers alpha, and beta.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:07:03.490
Alpha squared would be the
probability to be at the X1.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.750
Beta squared would be the
probability to be at X2.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.490
And this may remind you
already of something we're

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.250
doing with interferometers.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.980
In which the photon could be in
the upper branch, or the lower

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.290
branch, and you
have two numbers.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.960
This is somewhat
analogous except that

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.920
the interferometer
you could eventually

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.570
put more beam splitters, and
maybe later three branches,

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.820
or four branches,
or things like that.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:48.120
Here I want to consider
two things, particle there.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.730
One thing that this could be
strictly that, but now let's

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.340
relax our assumptions.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.790
It could also mean
for example, if you

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.150
have a box, and a partition.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.250
And there's the left
side of the box,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.470
and the right side of the box.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.280
And the molecule can
either be on the left side,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.410
or on the right side.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:19.270
That's a fairly
physical question.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:27.490
Here you could be
probability the amplitude

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.390
to be on the left, or
amplitude to be on the right.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.150
Two component vector
just like that.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.280
One would be the amplitude to
be in either one, and maybe

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.720
that amplitude changes in time.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.390
Or it could be that
you have a particle,

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.440
and suddenly you discovered that
yeah, the particle is at rest.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.010
It's not moving.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.620
It's not doing anything.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.920
It's one single
point, not two points.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.320
But actually this particle has
maybe something called spin,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:09.790
and the spin can be up,
or the spin can be down.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.620
We it could invent something.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.320
We could call it
spin, or a particle

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.760
could be in this state,
or in that state.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.390
And if that's possible
for a particle

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:28.670
you could have here the
amplitude for up spin,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.720
and the amplitude for down spin.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.350
And those would be
the two numbers.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.020
It's lots of possibilities
in the sense this

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.600
is a classic problem waiting
for a physical application

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.070
in quantum mechanics.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.520
Let's push it a little more.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:10.660
Now how would we
do inner products?

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:16.630
We decided OK, you need
to do inner products.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.750
And what was the inner
product of two functions

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:30.715
phi and psi was the integral,
the X of phi star of X1 times--

00:10:30.715 --> 00:10:35.440
phi star of X times psi of X.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.870
And what you're
really doing is taking

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:42.430
the values of the first
wave function at one point.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.840
Complex conjugating it, take
the value of the second wave

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.380
function at the same point
complex conjugating it.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:11:00.710
If you would have two vectors
like this alpha, and beta

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.920
the first wave function.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.100
Alpha one, beta one, and
the second wave function.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.430
Alpha two, beta two.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:17.220
The inner products
psi 1, psi 2 should

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.740
be the analog of
this thing which

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.190
is multiply things
at the same point.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.430
You should do the
alpha one star.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:35.900
That's alpha two plus beta
one star times beta two.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.150
That would be the
nice way to do this.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:49.460
You could think of this as
having transposed this alpha

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.140
one, and complex conjugated it.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:58.930
Beta one, and then the matrix
product with alpha one,

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.720
beta one.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.610
You transpose complex
conjugate the first,

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:11.050
and you do that with the second.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.740
When you study a little more
quantum mechanics in 805

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.540
you will explore this
analogy even more

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:23.180
in that you will think of a wave
function as a column vector,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:31.280
infinite one. psi at zero, psi
at epsilon, psi at two epsilon,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.780
psi at minus epsilon.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:40.720
So you've sliced the x-axis and
conserved an infinite vector.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.520
And that's all wave function.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:48.890
It's not so
unnatural to do this,

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.560
and this will be
our inner product.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.410
How about H be in Hermitian.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:09.010
That just means for
matrices that H transpose

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:16.860
complex conjugate that dagger,
Hermitian, is equal to H.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.720
And you may have seen that
that's what dagger means.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.300
You transpose a
complex conjugate.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.590
If you haven't seen it you
could prove it now using

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.520
this rule for the inner product
because the inner product

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:40.990
will tell you how to construct
the dagger of any operator.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.200
And you will find that indeed
the dagger what it does

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.290
is transposes, and
complex conjugates it.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.790
And it sort of comes because
the inner product transposes,

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.140
and complex conjugates
the first object.
