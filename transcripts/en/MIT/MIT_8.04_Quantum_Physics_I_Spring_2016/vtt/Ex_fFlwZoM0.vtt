00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.920
Three-dimensional case.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.610
Now, in the future
homework, you will

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.450
be doing the equivalent
of this calculation

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.480
here with the Laplacians--

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.090
it's not complicated--
so that you will

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.170
derive with the current is.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.080
And the current must be a very
similar formula as this one.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.180
And indeed, I'll
just write it here.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:41.720
The current is h bar over m,
the imaginary part of psi star.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.170
And instead of ddx, you
expect the gradient of psi.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.310
That is the current
for the probability

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.040
in three dimensions.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:04.170
And the analog of this equation,
d rho dt plus dj dx equals 0,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:15.520
is d rho dt plus divergence
of j is equal to 0.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.760
That is current conservation.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.680
Perhaps you do remember
that from your study

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.080
of electromagnetism.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.060
That's how Maxwell discovered
the displacement current

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.340
when he tried to figure
out how everything

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.530
was compatible with
current conservation.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.580
Anyway, that argument
I'll do in a second

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.910
so that it will become clearer.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.550
So one last thing here--

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:58.230
it's something also-- you
can check the units here of j

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:17.540
is 1 over l squared times 1 over
t, so probability per unit area

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.940
and unit time.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.340
So what did we have?

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.590
We were doing the integral of
the derivative of the integral

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.180
given by n.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.550
It was over here, dn dt.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.770
We worked hard on it.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.260
And dn dt was the
integral of d rho dt.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.070
So it was the integral
of d rho dt dx.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.530
But we showed now that
d rho dt is minus dj dx.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.280
So here you have integral
from minus infinity

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.250
to infinity dx of dj dx.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.010
And therefore, this is--

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.910
I should have a minus sign,
because it was minus dj dx.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:36.880
This is minus the current
of x equals infinity times

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.060
p minus the current at x
equals minus infinity nt.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.720
And as we more or
less hinted before,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:01.450
since the current is equal to
h over 2im psi star [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:10.910
psi dx minus psi [INAUDIBLE]
psi star dx, as you

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.440
go to plus infinity
or minus infinity,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.570
these things go to
0 given the boundary

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.920
conditions that we put.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.300
Because psi or psi star
go to 0 to infinity,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.470
and the derivates are
bound at the infinity.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:39.440
So this is 0, dn dt 0.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.700
All is good.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.430
And two things happened.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.480
In the way of doing
this, we realized

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.520
that the computation we
have done pretty much

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.470
established that this is equal
to that, because dn dt is

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.370
the difference of
these two integrals,

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.040
and we showed it's 0.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.020
So this is true.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.870
And therefore, we suspect
h is a Hermitian operator.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.276
And the thing that we should
do in order to make sure it is

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:24.530
is put two different functions
here, not two equal functions.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.285
This worked for
two equal function,

00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:30.410
but for two different
functions, and check it as well.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.975
And we'll leave
it as an exercise.

00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:35.360
It's a good exercise.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.892
So this shows the consistency.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.600
But we discover two
important ideas--

00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:13.240
one, the existence of a current
for probability, and two,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.380
h is a Hermitian operator.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:41.080
So last thing is to
explain the analogy

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.330
with current conservation.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.370
I think this should
help as well.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.610
So the interpretation
that we'll have

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.470
is the same as we have
in electromagnetism.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.030
And there's a complete
analogy for everything here.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.320
So not for the wave function,
but for all these charge

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.710
densities and current densities.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.270
So we have electromagnetism
and quantum mechanics.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.050
We have rho.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.910
Here is the charge density.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.030
And here is the
probability density.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:49.460
If you have a total
charge q in a volume,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:56.480
here is the probability to
find the particle in a volume.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.120
There is a j in Maxwell's
equations as well,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.580
and that's a current density.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.850
Amber's law has that current.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:21.050
It generates the curl of b.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.465
And here is a probability
current density.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.919
So that's the table.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:50.880
So what I want to make
sure is that you understand

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.870
why these equations,
like this or that,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:02.870
are more powerful than just
showing that dn dt is 0.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.650
They imply a local
conservation of probability.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:13.190
You see, there has to be
physics of this thing.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.540
So the total
probability must be 1.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.190
But suppose you have the
probability distributed

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.990
over space.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.470
There must be some
relation between the way

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.590
the probabilities are varying
at one point and varying

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.000
in other points so that
everything is consistent.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.380
And those are these
differential relations

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.550
that say that whenever you
see a probability density

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.480
change anywhere, it's because
there is some current.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.620
And that makes sense.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.090
If you see the charge density
in some point in space changing,

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.160
it's because there
must be a current.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.250
So thanks to the
current, you can

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.870
learn how to interpret
the probability much more

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.040
physically.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.610
Because if you ask what is the
probability that the particle

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.020
is from this distance
to that distance,

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.620
you can look at what the
currents are at the edges

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.160
and see whether that probability
is increasing or decreasing.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.980
So let's see that.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:25.550
Suppose you have a
volume, and define

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.980
the charge inside the volume.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.200
Then you say OK, does this
charge change in time?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.880
Sure, it could.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:56.290
So dq dt is equal
to integral d rho dt

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.450
d cube x over the volume.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:09.740
But d rho dt, by the current
conservation equation--

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.160
that's the equation
we're trying to make sure

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.950
your intuition is clear about--

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:22.360
this is equal to minus
the integral of j--

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:32.310
no, of divergence of j d
cube x over the volume.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.000
OK.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.190
But then Gauss's law.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.960
Gauss's Lot tells you that
you can relate this divergence

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.650
to a surface integral.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:53.770
dq dt is therefore minus
the surface integral,

00:11:53.770 --> 00:12:00.830
the area of the
current times that.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:09.590
So I'll write it as minus
jda, the flux of the current,

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.620
over the surface that bounds--

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:17.770
this is the volume, and there's
the surface bounding it.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.970
So by the divergence
theorem, it becomes this.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.680
And this is how you understand
current conservation.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:32.390
You say, look, charge is
never created or destroyed.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:38.420
So if you see the charge
inside the volume changing,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.220
it's because there's
some current escaping

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.220
through the surface.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.220
So that's the physical
interpretation

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.770
of that differential equation,
of that d rho dt plus

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:58.180
divergence of j is equal to 0.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.820
This is current conservation.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.960
And many people look at
this equation and say, what?

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.865
Current conservation?

00:13:04.865 --> 00:13:05.980
I don't see anything.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.760
But when you look at this
equation, you say, oh, yes.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.170
The charge changes only because
it escapes the volume, not

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.390
created nor destroyed.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.620
So the same thing happens
for the probability.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:25.530
Now, let me close up
with this statement

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:35.060
in one dimension, which is the
one you care, at this moment.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:44.270
And on the line, you
would have points a and b.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.760
And you would say
the probability

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:57.075
to be within a and b is the
integral from a to b dx of rho.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.070
That's your probability.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:11.390
That's the integral of
psi squared from a to b.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:15.616
Now, what is the time
derivative of it?

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:24.990
dp ab dt would be integral
from a to b dx of d rho dt.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:34.460
But again, for that case,
d rho dt is minus dj dx.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:44.560
So this is minus dx
dj dx between b and a.

00:14:47.368 --> 00:14:48.710
And what is that?

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.840
Well, you get the
j at the boundary.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:15:04.880
So this is minus j at x equals
bt minus j at x equal a, t.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:15.840
So simplifying it,
you get dp ab dt

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:30.318
is equal to minus j at x
equals bt plus j of a, t.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.145
Let's see if that makes sense.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.990
You have been looking
for the particle

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.310
and decided to look at
this range from a to b.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.970
That's the probability
to find it there.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.390
We learned already that
the total probability

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.450
to find it anywhere
is going to be 1,

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.825
and that's going
to be conserved,

00:16:01.825 --> 00:16:03.440
and it's going to
be no problems.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.980
But now let's just
ask given what happens

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.220
to this probability in time.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.290
Well, it could change,
because the wave

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.000
function could go up and down.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.300
Maybe the wave
function was big here

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.330
and a little later is small
so there's less probability

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.850
to find it here.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.580
But now you have another
physical variable

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.790
to help you understand it,
and that's the current.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:31.020
That formula we found
there for j of x and t

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.420
in the upper
blackboard box formula

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.480
is a current that
can be computed.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:42.580
And here you see
if the probability

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.540
to find the particle
in this region changes,

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:52.690
it's because some current must
be escaping from the edges.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:57.130
And let's see if the
formula gives it right.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.790
Well, we're assuming
quantities are

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:06.400
positive if they
have plus components

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.280
in the direction of x.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.880
So this current is the current
component in the x direction.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.829
And it should not
be lost-- maybe

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:18.339
I didn't quite say it--
that if you are dealing

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:28.300
with a divergence of j, this
is dj x dx plus dj y dy plus dj

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.460
z dz.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.330
And in the case of one
dimension, you will have those,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.110
and you get this equation.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.190
So it's certainly the reduction.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:43.030
But here you see indeed,
if the currents are

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.100
positive-- if the
current at b is positive,

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.040
there is a current going out.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.770
So that tends to
reduce the probability.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.570
That's why the sign
came out with a minus.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:59.140
On the other hand, if
there is a current in a,

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.900
that tends to send
in probability,

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.520
and that's why it
increases it here.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.740
So the difference between
these two currents

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.820
determines whether
the probability here

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.470
increases or decreases.
