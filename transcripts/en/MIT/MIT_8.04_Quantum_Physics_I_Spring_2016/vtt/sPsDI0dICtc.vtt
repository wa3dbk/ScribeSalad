00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.515
PROFESSOR: The fact is
that angular momentum is

00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:08.800
an observable, and as such
it deserves attention.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.290
There is an active way of
thinking of observables,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.310
and we have not developed
it that much in this course.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.960
But for example, with
a momentum operator

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.780
you've learned that the
momentum operator can give you

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.260
the differential operator.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.710
It's a derivative, and
derivatives tell you how

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.730
to move, how a function varies.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.800
So with the momentum
operator, for example,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.680
you have the momentum
operator p hat,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.050
which is h bar over i d dx.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.640
And you could ask
the question of, OK,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.590
so the momentum operator
moves or takes a derivative,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.310
does the momentum
operator move a function?

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.720
Does it generate a translation?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.790
And the answer is, yes.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.230
That's another way of thinking
of the momentum operator

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.950
as a generator of translations.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160
But how does it do it?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.010
This is a Hermitian operator,
and it takes a derivative.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.880
It doesn't translate
the function.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.220
But there is a universal
trick that if you exponentiate

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.550
i times a Hermitian
operator, you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.420
get a new kind of operator
that actually, in this case,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.400
moves things.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.200
So we could think
of exponentiating

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.710
e to the i p hat, and
for purposes of units

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.440
I have to put a constant
with units of length,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.120
and an h bar here.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.380
And now you have the
exponential of an operator.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.430
That's good.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.100
That's a very
interesting operator,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.590
and we can ask what
does it do when

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.180
you act on a wave function?

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.450
It's an operator.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.390
And look, simplify by putting
what p is going to do.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.060
P is h over i d dx.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.540
So this is like a
d dx exponentiated

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.770
acting on psi of x.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.680
And as an exponential,
it can be expanded

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.270
in a Taylor series with
this funny object there,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.350
but it would be the
sum from n equals 0

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.380
to infinity 1 over
n factorial a d dx.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.890
I will write it this
as normal derivatives,

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.000
because we just have a function
of x, a d dx to the n psi of x.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.480
And you see that,
of course, this

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:26.460
is psi of x plus a d
psi dx plus 1 over 2

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.930
a squared, d second
psi dx squared.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:45.400
But this is nothing else but
the Taylor series for this.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.910
And there it is, the miracle.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.320
The e to the i momentum
generated translation.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.550
It really moves
the wave function.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.620
So that in a sense
is a deeper way

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.260
of characterizing
the momentum operator

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.160
as a generator of translations.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.190
With the angular
momentum operators,

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.790
we will have that they
generate rotations.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.519
So I need a little bit
more mathematics here,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.390
because I have to deal with
three dimensions, a vector,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.730
and produce an exponential
that rotates the vector,

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.060
so that it gives you the wave
function at a rotated point.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.580
But this will be the same story.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.030
Angular momentum will
generate rotations

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.250
the same way as momentum
generates translations.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.000
And there is yet another story
that when you will appreciate

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.930
the abstract properties
of angular momentum

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.170
that some of them
will appear today,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.340
you will realize that in
addition of angular momentum

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.900
that represent rotations
of objects doing things,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.340
there is another way of
having angular momentum.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.390
And that's spin
angular momentum.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.320
That mysterious property
of particles that have--

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.710
even though they
have 0 size, they

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:33.260
behave as if they were little
balls rotating and spinning.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.360
That spin angular momentum
has no ordinary wave functions

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.850
associated to it, and
it's fractional sometimes.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.280
And the study of angular
momentum inspired

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.160
by orbital angular
momentum associated

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.260
with normal rotations,
will lead us

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.030
to understand where spin
angular momentum comes about.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.610
So it's a gigantic
interesting subject,

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.280
and we're beginning
with it today.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.420
So it's really quantum
mechanics in three dimensions,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:29.900
central potentials,
and angular momentum.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.860
And let's begin by
mentioning that if we

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.990
are in three dimensions--
and many things

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.900
with it so far in
this course, we always

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.260
took the time to write
them in three dimensions.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:57.810
So we wrote this, for
example, as a generalization

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.390
of the derivative form
of the momentum operator.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:07.922
Meaning there is a Px,
which is h bar over i d dx,

00:07:07.922 --> 00:07:16.910
Py h bar over i d dy, and
Pz equal h bar over i d dz.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:32.100
And we had commutators within Px
and x, Py and y, and Pz and z.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.880
There were always the same
commutators of the form

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.520
x Px equal i h bar.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.410
Similar things here.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.950
With this we wrote the three
dimensional Schrodinger

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.810
equation, which was minus h
squared over 2m, and instead

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.010
of p squared three
dimensional, he

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.790
would have a derivative if you
were doing in one dimension.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:05.110
For three dimensions
you have the Laplacian.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.690
And this time you
have a wave function

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:16.522
that depends on the
vector x plus v of r--

00:08:16.522 --> 00:08:18.220
v of x.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.320
Should I write r?

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.850
Let me write r vector.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:30.780
V of r psi of r
equal e psi of r.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.895
This is our time independent
Schrodinger equation.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.760
This corresponds to
the energy eigenstate,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.290
but in three dimensions.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:55.180
So this is the equation
we wish to understand,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:01.240
and our ability to
understand that equation

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.830
in a simple and nice way
rests on a simplification.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.110
That is not always
true, but it's

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.060
true under so many
circumstances that it's worth

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.950
studying by itself.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:22.770
And it's the case when you
have a central potential,

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:27.330
and by that we mean that
the potential is not

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:35.060
quite the vector function
of r, but is just a function

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.940
of the magnitude of r.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.220
That's a little bit
funny way of writing it,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.140
because I'm using
the same letter v,

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.540
but I hope there's no confusion.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:54.000
I mean that the potential just
depends on the value of r.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:04.220
So what this means physically
is that over concentric spheres,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.020
the potential is constant.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.910
All over the surface of
spheres of constant radius,

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.130
the potential is
constant, because it only

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.135
depends on the radius.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:24.870
And this potential is there
for a spherically symmetric.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.560
You can rotate the
world, and the potential

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.220
still looks the same, because
rotations don't change

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.230
the magnitude of vectors.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.740
If you have a vector of
some length, you rotate it,

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.330
it's the same length,
and therefore you

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.960
remain on this sphere.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:50.680
So the central potential
are spherically symmetric.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:59.160
By that we mean they're
invariant under rotations.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.010
So this is the reason
why angular momentum will

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:22.030
play an important role, because
precisely the angular momentum

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.780
operators, in the fashion
we discussed a minute ago,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.430
generate rotation.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.880
So they will have
a nice interplay,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:37.150
to be developed in the following
lectures, with the Hamiltonian.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.850
So at this moment we
have a central potential,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.720
and let's assume
that's the case.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.520
And we need to
understand a little more

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.500
of this differential equation.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:54.220
So let me write the formula for
the Laplacian of a function.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.720
It has a radial contribution.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.260
You know it's second
order derivatives.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.525
And it has a radial part,
and an angular part.

00:12:10.525 --> 00:12:13.120
The units are 1
over length squared.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.940
So you need, if you have an
angular part, all over here

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.220
is going to be
angular, you still

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:25.100
need the 1 over on r squared
here for the units to work out.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.970
So here it is, it's
slightly complicated.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:36.960
d d theta sine
theta d d theta of--

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.680
well, put the psi, plus 1
over sine squared theta,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.575
d second d phi squared
all acting on psi.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.840
It's a complicated
operator, and here

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.230
is some radial
derivatives, and here there

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.730
are some angular derivatives.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:13.320
So you see, today's lecture
will have many steps,

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.190
and you have to keep track
of where we're going.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.360
And what we're going
to do is, build up

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.570
a structure that
allows us pretty much

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.370
to forget about all this thing.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.885
That's our goal.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.990
And angular momentum will
play a role in doing this.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:43.850
So there are in fact two
things I want to justify,

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.940
two facts to be justified.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.730
So I will erase this.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:02.270
The first fact is the relation
between this differential

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.560
operator and angular momentum.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.665
So two facts to justify.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:20.180
The first is that minus h
squared 1 over sine theta

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:30.290
d d theta sine theta d d theta
plus 1 over sine squared theta

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.680
d second d phi squared.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:46.030
This whole thing can be viewed
as the differential operator

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:50.630
version of angular momentum.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.970
Remember, d dx was a
differential operator version

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.600
of momentum.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.120
So maybe this has to do with
angular momentum, and indeed

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:06.130
this whole thing, remember,
units of angular momentum

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.230
is h bar.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.170
Angular momentum is
length times momentum.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.970
And from the
certainty principle,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.480
you know that x times
p has units of h bar.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.220
So angular momentum
has units of h bar.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.170
So there's h bar squared here.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:27.970
So this must be angular
momentum squared.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.830
In fact, if you
think about that,

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.570
angular momentum is x times p.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.090
So x times a derivative.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.910
So it's a first order
differential operator,

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.670
but this is a second order one.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.530
So this could not be
just angular momentum.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.710
Anyway, angular
momentum is a vector.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.950
So this will turn
out to be, and we

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:54.120
will want to justify L squared.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.485
The quantum version of the
angular momentum operator

00:15:58.485 --> 00:15:58.985
squared.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:08.960
And the other thing I want
to justify if I write--

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.540
call this equation one.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:16.460
So this is fact
one, and fact two,

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:28.280
is that equation one
is relevant, when--

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.572
let me wait a second
to complete this.

00:16:32.572 --> 00:16:37.280
This equation is an
equation for a particle

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.650
moving in a potential,
a spherically

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.800
symmetric potential.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.760
It turns out that is
relevant under more

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.160
general circumstances.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:57.074
If you have two particles
whose potential energy--

00:16:57.074 --> 00:16:58.490
if you have two
particles you have

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.465
a potential energy between them,
maybe it's a electromagnetic--

00:17:02.465 --> 00:17:06.260
if the potential
energy just depends

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:11.170
on the distance
that separates them,

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:16.690
this two body problem can
be reduced to a one body

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.460
problem of this form.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.839
This is a fairly non-trivial
fact, and an absolutely

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.040
interesting one.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.850
Because if you want to really
solve the hydrogen atom,

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.290
you have an electron
and a proton.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.720
Now it turns out that the proton
is almost 2,000 times heavier

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.340
than the electron.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.440
And therefore, you
could almost think

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.600
that the proton
creates a potential

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.400
in which the electron moves.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:53.010
But similar analysis is valid
for neuron orbiting a nucleus.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.120
And in that case, the neuron is
still lighter than the proton,

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.190
but not that much lighter.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:04.620
Or maybe for a quark and an
anti-quark orbiting each other.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.410
Or an electron and a
positron orbiting each other,

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:12.790
and this would be
valid and useful.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.590
So we need to somehow
explain that as well.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.490
If you really want to
understand what's going on,

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:26.160
is that equation
one is relevant when

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:40.000
we have a two body problem
with a potential function

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.800
v of x1 x2.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.530
The potential energy
given that configuration,

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.920
x1 and x2 of the first
and second particle,

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:58.660
is a function of
the separation only.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.880
The absolute value or the length
of the vector, it's 1 minus x2.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.610
This far we'll
get through today.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:13.670
This will be next lecture still.
