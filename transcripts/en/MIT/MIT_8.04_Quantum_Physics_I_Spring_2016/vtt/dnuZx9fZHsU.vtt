00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.570
PROFESSOR: This is Louis--

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:13.650
L-O-U-I-S d-e Broglie.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.620
And this is not
hyphenated nor together.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.210
They are separate.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.350
And the d is not
capitalized apparently too.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:35.180
And it's 1924, the photon
as a particle is clear,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.580
and the photon is also a wave.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.140
And Louis de Broglie
basically had a great insight

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.740
in which he said that
if this is supposed

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.950
to be a universal or a real
basic physical property

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.270
that photons are
waves and particles,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.570
we knew them as waves and now
we know they're particles.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.520
But if they are dualed
with respect to each other,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.350
both descriptions are
in different regimes

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.360
and in a sense, a particle
at the end of the day

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.230
has wave attributes and
particle attributes.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.900
Wave attributes
because it interferes

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.230
and is described by waves.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.500
And particle attributes is
because it has a definite

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.620
amount of energy,
it comes in packets,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.130
they cannot be broken
into other things--

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.000
this could be a more
general property.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.860
And in a sense, you could
say that de Broglie did

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.740
a fundamental step almost
as important as Schrodinger

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.190
when he claimed that all matter
particles behave as waves as

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.100
well.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.340
Not just the photon, that's one
example, but everybody does.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.900
So associated to every modern
particle, there is a wave.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.920
But that is quite interesting
because in quantum mechanics,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.580
you have the photon
and it's a particle,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.930
but it's associated to a wave
and if you are a little quick,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.120
you say, oh sure, the
electromagnetic wave,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.970
but no, in quantum
mechanics, it's

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.330
the probability amplitude
to be some work.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.300
Those are the numbers
we tracked in the mass

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.020
and the interferometer, the
probability to be sampled.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.720
We didn't track the
waves or a single photon,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.010
the wave was a wave of
probability amplitude,

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.250
something they didn't know at
all about yet at that time.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.080
So de Broglie's says just like
the photons have properties

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.110
of particles and
properties of waves,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.410
every particle has
properties of waves as well

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.150
and every wave has a
property of particles.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.440
But what is left unsaid here
is yes, you have a wave,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.810
but a wave of what?

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.100
And we've already
told you a little bit,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.880
the answer has to do
with probability waves.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.270
So it's very strange that
the fundamental equation

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.860
for a wave that represents
a particle is not

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.770
an electric field or
a sound wave or this,

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.410
it's for all of them
is a probability wave.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.060
Very, very surprising.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.230
But that's what de
Broglie's ideas led to.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:56.410
So if you had a photon, you
would say it's a particle,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.240
and when you think
of it as a particle,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.580
you would say it's a bundle of
some energy and some momentum.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.160
And if you think
of it as a wave,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.080
you would say it
has a frequency.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.300
And that's a particle wave
duality or in some sense,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.220
a particle wave
description of this

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.090
object-- you have a particle
and a wave at the same time.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.030
When we have this, we have
a particle wave duality.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.350
And de Broglie said that this
is universal for all particles.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.800
Universal.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.955
And it appeared the
name of matter waves.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.380
These are the matter waves that
we're going to try to discuss.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.600
These are the waves
of something that

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.670
are probability amplitudes
we're going to try to discuss.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.225
So you could say wave of what?

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.470
What.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.680
And that comes
later, but the answer

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:16.020
is probability amplitudes, those
complex numbers whose squares

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.970
are probabilities.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.980
So just like we
had for a photon,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.620
de Broglie's idea was that we
would associate to a particle

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.180
a wave that depends
on the momentum.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.540
So remember, the
Compton wavelength

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.340
was a universal--
for any particle,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.070
the Compton wavelength
is just one number,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.010
but just for photons,
the wavelength depends

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.850
on the momentum, so
in general, it should

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.480
be dependent on the momentum.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:06:00.780
So we say that for a
particle of momentum p,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.720
we associate a wave--

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.410
a plane wave, in fact--

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.950
a plane wave, so we're getting
a little more technical,

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.080
with of lambda equals
h over p, which

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.500
is the de Broglie wavelength--

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.526
de Broglie wavelength.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.860
So it's a pretty
daring statement.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.500
It was his PhD thesis and there
was no experimental evidence

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.090
for it.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.340
It was a very
natural conjecture--

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.360
we'll discuss it a lot
more next lecture--

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.950
but there are very
little evidence for it.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:03.440
So experiments can
a few years later,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:11.240
and people saw that you
could interfere or diffract

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.610
electrons.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.630
They would behave, colliding
into lattices like waves,

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.410
and those are rather
famous experiments

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.620
of Davisson and Germer.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.600
So particles, just like you
do as an interference effect--

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.810
a two slit interference
effect in which

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.600
you have a screen, a slit and
a screen, and you shine photons

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.270
and then you get an
interference effect over here

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.240
because of the wave
nature of photons,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.760
or in quantum
mechanics, you would

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.270
say, because there are
probability amplitudes, that

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.780
are complex numbers that
have to be interfered

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.660
between the possibilities
of the two paths,

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.200
because every photon
goes through both paths

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.260
at the same time, these
experiments of interference,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:15.960
or two slit interference,
were done for electrons.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.770
And then, eventually,
they've been

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.800
done for bigger and
bigger particles,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.900
so that it's not just
something that you do

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.270
with elementary particles now.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:33.970
There's experiments done
about three years ago--

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.720
I will put on the web site or on
the notes some of these things

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.480
so that you can
see them, but now

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.640
you can throw in
molecules here, molecules

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:52.880
that have a weight of now 10,000
atomic mass units, like 10,000

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.190
protons, like hundreds of--

00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:01.080
430 atom molecules, and you can
get an interference pattern,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.480
so it's pretty ridiculous.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.450
It's almost like, you one
day so you throw a baseball

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.450
and you're going to see
an interference pattern,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.490
but, you know,
we've got to things

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.920
with about 10,000 hydrogen
atoms and de Broglie

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:22.220
wavelengths of 1 picometer,
which are pretty unbelievable.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.840
So the experiments are done
with those particles and in fact

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.920
with electrons.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.740
People do those
experiments and they're

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.830
in very beautiful
movies in which you

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:40.040
see those electrons hitting
on the screen and then--

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.470
I'll give you some links so
you can find them as well--

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.590
and you see one
electron falls here

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.720
and it gets detected and two
electrons, three electrons,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.850
four electrons, five electrons,
six electrons-- by the time

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.620
you get 10,000 electrons,
you see lots of electrons

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.360
here, very well here,
lots of electrons

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.740
here, and the whole
interference pattern is created

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.850
by sending one electron at
that time in an experiment that

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.190
takes several hours
and it's reduced

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.250
to a movie of about one minute.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:19.100
So particles, big particles
interfere, not just photons

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.000
interfere.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.720
So those particles
have some waves,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.860
some matter waves discovered by
de Broglie, and next lecture,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.410
we're going to track
the story from de

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.290
Broglie to the
Schrodinger equation

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.900
where the nature of the
wave suddenly becomes clear.
