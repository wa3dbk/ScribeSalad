00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
PROFESSOR: Here is
where the power of this

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.920
comes when you
decide that you're

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.620
going to invent all possible
Hamiltonians at this moment.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.950
You've reduced the infinite
dimensional space of functions

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.400
in the line to
two points, so you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.620
have a two-dimensional vector
space, dramatic reduction.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.369
So here we decide, OK,
here is the Hamiltonian.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.680
And it's going to be
a two-by-two matrix,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.480
and it better be Hermitian.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.310
So what options do I have?

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.420
Well, Hermitian means transpose
complex conjugated gives you

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.810
back the same matrix.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.170
So let's try to
parametrize such a matrix.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.790
I could put a0, a real quantity
here, and another real quantity

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.740
in the bottom size.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.220
And if they are real, the
transpose complex conjugate

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.450
will remain the same.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.680
That's OK.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.630
So I could put a0 and a1 here.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.870
I'll do it in a
little different way.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.260
I'll put a0 plus a3,
and a0 minus a3 here.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.180
Now, the thing is that a0
and a3 have to be real.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.170
So I'll use a0, a1, a2, and a3.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.010
And they all should be real.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.390
So here, transpose
complex conjugate

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.510
doesn't affect these things.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.510
They are the same.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.760
That's good.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.390
Here, we can a1 minus ia2.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.600
This is a complex number.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.220
And the only thing
that must happen

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.750
is that, when I transpose
a complex conjugate,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.140
I must get the same thing.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.745
So I should put
here a1 plus ia2.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.610
Because if I transpose this,
I will have it on this side.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.960
And then I complex conjugate
it, and it becomes this term.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.980
Similarly, if I transpose
this term, it goes here.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.920
But then complex
conjugated, it becomes that.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.900
So actually, I claim the most
general two-by-two Hermitian

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.280
matrix.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.130
Time independent-- you see,
all our quantum mechanics

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.150
this semester has been time
independent potentials.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.600
So here it's time independent.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.140
And now, this is the
most general Hamiltonian

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.550
you could have.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.240
That's it.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.850
So when you see
something like that,

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.690
you realize that in an hour
or two or after some thinking,

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.620
you will have solved the
most general dynamical system

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.260
with two degrees of freedom
in quantum mechanics.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.780
So I will write this as
a0 times this matrix,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:30.910
plus a1 times this matrix,
plus a2 times this matrix,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.750
plus a3 times this matrix.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.330
That's exactly what
you have in there.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.220
Multiply in these constants
and add these matrices,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.130
and they give you
all what we have.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.350
So actually, these are the basic
Hermitian two-by-two matrices.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.990
And if you multiply
them by real numbers,

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.010
you still are Hermitian.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.540
And if you add them,
you still are Hermitian.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.110
So the most general Hermitian
matrix has four parameters.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:21.884
And it is a space of matrices
spanned by these four matrices.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.980
They are so famous,
these matrices,

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.450
that this is called sigma
1, this is called sigma 2,

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.440
and this is called sigma 3.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.845
And they're called
the Pauli matrices.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.365
Well, but let's put
units to these things.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.330
We want to write Hamiltonians.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.550
So let's make sure we have
units that do the job.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.780
The Hamiltonian must
have units of energy.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:19.680
So we could do a Hamiltonian
that has units of energy.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:29.740
So I'll write h omega, which has
units of energy, omega 1, sigma

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.815
1, plus h--

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:35.520
I'll put it even over 2--

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:47.970
h omega 2, over 2, sigma 2,
plus h omega 3, over 2, sigma 3.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.680
Now you would say,
well, why didn't you

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.020
use the first matrix.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.750
I could have used
the first matrix,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.620
but the first matrix is
proportional to the identity.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.920
We already learned in
our course that if you

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.840
have an extra constant
operator in the Hamiltonian,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.730
it doesn't change your
calculations in any way.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.215
You had the Hamiltonian for
the harmonic oscillator.

00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:20.280
It was h omega N plus 1/2.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.340
And the 1/2 was an
additive constant

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.190
that never played
any important role.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.445
So this would be an additive
constant to the energy.

00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:31.860
It would tell you
how you're measuring

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.440
the energy from what level.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.390
So it's not very interesting.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.450
You can use it sometimes,
but it's definitely not

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.670
all that interesting.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:50.310
So I'll do a little
variation of this

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:58.160
by writing omega 1, h over
2, sigma 1, plus omega 2,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:06.185
h over 2, sigma 2, plus
omega 3, h over 2, sigma 3.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.760
And then you say, look,
that's interesting, OK,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.330
I have an omega on this thing.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.240
But omega is fine.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.340
We know what it is.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.830
It's a frequency,
1 over time unit.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.530
But this has units
of angular momentum.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.870
h bar has units of
angular momentum.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.830
And the thing that is a
little mysterious here

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.600
is that we seem to
have three of them.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.770
So maybe somehow this has
to do with angular momentum.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.730
So let's investigate
it a little bit.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.720
Well, they have units
of angular momentum.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:11.540
So maybe I can call some first
component of angular momentum,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:18.420
h bar over 2 sigma 1, second
component of angular momentum,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:24.300
h 1 over 2 sigma 2, and the
third component of angular

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.630
momentum, h bar over 2 sigma 3.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.049
Well, those are just names.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:38.870
But we can try to do a
computation with them.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:44.210
We can try to see what is
the commutator of Sx with Sy.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.920
And happily, these are matrices,
so it's a natural thing

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.450
to do commutators.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:58.220
So you would have h
bar over 2, sigma 1,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:04.410
with h bar over 2,
sigma 2, commutator.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:11.180
And it's equal to h bar
over 2 times h bar over 2,

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:18.300
sigma 1, sigma 2,
minus sigma 2, sigma 1.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.260
So it's h bar over 2
times h bar over 2.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.310
And let's do this.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.660
Sigma 1 is 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:39.940
Sigma 2 is 0, minus i, i, 0,
minus 0, minus i, i, 0, 0, 1,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.060
1, 0.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.760
OK, I have to do
all that arithmetic.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.860
Happily, this is not that bad.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.880
Let's see if I
don't make mistakes.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.600
OK, here I get two terms,
an i from the first,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:04.270
a 0 here, a 0, and
a minus i here--

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:16.750
minus-- and minus i,
a 0, a 0, and an i,

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:25.910
which is h bar over 2,
times h bar over 2, times--

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.560
oh, they don't cancel.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.780
They seem to cancel,
but there's some minus--

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.830
it's actually twice--

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:39.690
of those, so 2i minus 2i, 0, 0.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.940
And here we get a 2 cancels
this and then i goes out.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.960
So I'll have with
this factor and i out

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:59.710
is i h bar times h bar over
2, times the matrix 1 minus 1,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.656
0, 0.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.245
Somehow, it gave that.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.055
h bar over 2, 1 minus 1--

00:11:13.055 --> 00:11:15.210
1 minus 1 is sigma 3.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:24.480
And h bar over 2 sigma 3
is Sz, so this is all Sz.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.630
So it's i h bar Sz.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:38.920
So this stuff, Sx, Sy,
is giving you i h bar Sz.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.600
And that was exactly
like angular momentum.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.640
So not only it has the
units of angular momentum,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.950
it has the commutation
relations of angular momentum.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.830
Hermitian operators,
two-by-two matrices,

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.430
they used to be r cross
p, all these derivatives,

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.080
complicated stuff.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.140
Here it is-- with
two-by-two matrices,

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.250
you've constructed
angular momentum.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:14.810
What we've constructed at
this moment is spin 1/2.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:19.700
A whole spin 1/2 system is
nothing else than that--

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:25.100
angular momentum and the freedom
of having two discrete degrees

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.530
of freedom.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.970
The interpretation that
what they have to do

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.760
is spin up and spin
down is something

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.030
that physicists came up with.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.050
But the mathematics was there
waiting as the simplest quantum

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.280
mechanical problem.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.010
Considering [? who wrote ?]
the Schrodinger equation,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.270
maybe, if he had been more
mathematically inclined,

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.170
he could have discovered,
five minutes later, spin.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.920
But he wanted to figure out the
wave function of the hydrogen

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.090
atom and scattering and all
these very complicated things.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:05.930
So needless to say, the other
commutation relations work out.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:14.090
So if you check that Sy with
Sz, you will get i h bar Sx.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:22.880
And if you do finally Sz with
Sx, you will get i h bar Sy.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:30.650
So these two-by-two matrices
satisfy this property.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.810
And there is a little
more to be said.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.090
I want to say a few
more things about it

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:43.805
because it's counter-intuitive
and therefore very nice.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.280
Half of the semester in
805 is devoted to spin 1/2.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.920
It takes a while
to understand it.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.405
So I wanted you to
see it, at least once.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.120
And the problem is the
physical interpretation

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.710
takes time to get accustomed.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:16.070
So on the other hand, we
did write the Hamiltonian.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:31.720
So the Hamiltonian was
omega 1 Sx, plus omega 2 Sy,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.360
plus omega 3 Sz.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:42.320
And it's there--

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.980
S1, S2, S3, second line.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.240
And this is the Hamiltonian.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:57.860
So people write it sometimes as
omega dotted with an S vector,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.660
as it's saying it has
three components, as omega

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.480
has three components as well.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.970
And there's a lot of
physics in this Hamiltonian.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:12.980
It's the simplest Hamiltonian,
but it actually represents

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.860
a spin in a magnetic field.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.630
And what it will make
it do, this Hamiltonian,

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.080
if we solve the differential,
this two-by-two matrix

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:28.030
equation, we will find that
the spin starts to precess.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.030
That's the origin of
nuclear magnetic resonance,

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:36.850
spinning, precessing spins, that
the machine makes them precess.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.820
And they send a
signal and you detect

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.530
the density of different
fluids in the body.
