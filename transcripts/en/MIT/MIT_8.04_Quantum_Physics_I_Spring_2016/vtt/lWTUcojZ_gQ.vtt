00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.603
PROFESSOR: Simultaneous
eigenstates.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.710
So let's begin with that.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.100
We decided that we could
pick 1 l and l squared,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.680
and they would commute.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.920
And we could try
to find functions

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.850
that are eigenstates of both.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.720
So if we have functions that
are eigenstates of those,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.780
we'll try to expand in
terms of those functions.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.990
And all this operator
will become a number

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.740
acting on those functions.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.600
And that's why the
Laplacian simplifies,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.990
and that's why we'll be able
to reduce the Schrodinger

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.950
equation to a radial equation.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.350
This is the goal.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.810
Schrodinger equation
has r theta and phi.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.250
But theta and phi will deal
with all the angular dependents.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.810
We'll find functions for
which that operator gives

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.730
a number acting on them.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.250
And therefore, the whole
differential equation

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.830
will simplify.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.840
So simultaneous eigenstates,
and given the simplicity of l z,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.190
everybody chooses l z.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.630
So we should find simultaneous
eigenstates of this two things.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.385
And let's call them psi
l m of theta and phi.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.350
Where l and m are numbers
that, at this moment,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.180
are totally arbitrary, but
are related to the eigenvalues

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.750
of this equations.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.009
So we wish that l
z acting on psi l m

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.540
is going to be a
number times psi l m.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.300
That is to be an eigenstate.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.200
The number must have the
right units, must be an H bar.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.760
And then we'll use m.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.218
We don't say what m is yet.

00:02:29.218 --> 00:02:34.700
M. Where m belongs
to the real numbers.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.050
Because the eigenvalues
of a Hermitian

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.320
operator are always real.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.030
So this could be what we
would demand from l z.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:03:00.920
From l squared on
psi l m, I can demand

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.380
that this be equal because
of units and h squared.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.090
And then a number,
lambda psi l m.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.880
Now this lambda-- do I know
anything about this lambda?

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.510
Well, I could argue that this
lambda has to be positive.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.440
And the reason is
that this begins

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.560
as some sort of positive
operator, is L. Squared.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.430
Now that intuition may
not be completely precise.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.410
But if you followed it a little
more with an inner product.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.010
Suppose we would have
an inner product,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.410
and we can put psi l m here.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.200
And l squared, psi l
m from this equation.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:12.360
This would be equal to h squared
lambda, psi l m, psi I m.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.600
An inner product if
you have it there.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.010
And then if your wave functions
are suitably normalized,

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.530
this would be a 1.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.446
But this thing is l x--

00:04:29.446 --> 00:04:36.880
l x plus l y, l y plus l z, l z.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.850
And l x, l x--

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.875
you could bring one l
x here, and you would

00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:48.630
have l x, psi l m, l x psi l m.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.390
Plus the same thing
for y and for z.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.760
And each of these
things is positive.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.670
Because when you have the
same wavefunction on the left

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.760
and on the right, you
integrate the norm squared.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760
It's positive.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.020
This is positive.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.760
This is positive.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.080
So the sum must be positive,
and lambda must be positive.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.010
So lambda must be positive.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.710
This is our expectation.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.710
And it's a reasonable
expectation.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.370
And that's why, in
fact, anticipating

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.170
a little the answer, people
write this as l times

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.350
l plus 1 psi l m.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:41.040
And where l is a real
number, at this moment.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.580
And you say, well,
that's a little strange.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.230
Why do you put it
as l times l plus 1.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.220
What's the reason?

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.670
The reason is-- comes when
we look at the differential

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.050
equation.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.740
But the reason you
don't get in trouble

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:05.870
by doing this is that as you
span all the real numbers,

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.405
the function l times
l plus 1 is like this.

00:06:12.085 --> 00:06:14.000
l times l plus 1.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.760
And therefore, whatever lambda
you have that is positive,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.610
there is some l
for which l times

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.480
l plus 1 is a positive number.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.350
So there's nothing wrong.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.940
I'm trying to argue there's
nothing wrong with writing

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.640
that the eigenvalue is of
the form l times l plus 1.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.210
Because we know the
eigenvalue's positive,

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.260
and therefore, whatever lambda
you give me that is positive,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:53.440
I can always find, in fact, two
values of l, for which l times

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.170
l plus 1 is equal to lambda.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.430
We can choose the positive one,
and that's what we will do.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.360
So these are the equations
we want to deal with.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.030
Are there questions in the
setting up of these equations?

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.720
This is the conceptual part.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.170
Now begins a little bit of
play with the differential

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.980
equations.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.280
And we'll have to do
a little bit of work.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.990
But this is what the physical
intuition-- the commutators,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.330
everything led us to believe.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.600
That we should be able
to solve this much.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.460
We should be able to find
functions that do all this.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.460
All right, let's
do the first one.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.130
So the first equation--

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.190
The first equation is--

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.660
let me call it equation 1 and 2.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:13.290
The first equation is
h bar over i d d 5.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:21.867
That's l z, psi l m,
equal h bar m psi l m.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:32.880
So canceling the h bars,
you'll get dd phi of psi l m

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.400
is equal to i m, psi l m.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:48.250
So psi l m is equal
to e to the i m phi

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.840
times some function of theta.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.330
Arbitrary function
of theta this moment.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.250
So this is my solution.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.425
This is up psi l m
of theta and phi.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.550
With the term in
the phi dependants,

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.360
and it's not that complicated.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.930
So at this moment,
you say, well, I'm

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.970
going to use this
for wavefunctions.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.440
I want them to behave normally.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.800
So if somebody gives
me a value of phi,

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.930
I can tell them what
the wavefunction is.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:38.290
And since phi increases by 2
pi and is periodic with 2 pi,

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:49.870
I may demand that psi l m
of theta, and 5 plus 2 pi

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:56.410
be the same as psi
l m theta and phi.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.670
You could say, well, what if you
could put the minus sign there?

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.770
Well, you could try.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.160
The attempt would
fail eventually.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.380
There's nothing, obviously,
wrong with trying

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.450
to put the sine there.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.800
But it doesn't work.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.210
It would lead to rather
inconsistent things

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.820
soon enough.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:25.430
So this condition here requires
that this function be periodic.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.930
And therefore when
phi changes by 2 pi,

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.950
it should be a multiple of 2 pi.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.750
So m belong to the integers.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.430
So we found the
first quantization.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.180
The eigenvalues of
l z are quantized.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.460
They have to be integers.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.970
That was easy enough.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.520
Let's look at the
second equation.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.120
That takes a bit more work.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.730
So what is the second equation?

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.660
Well, it is most slightly
complicated differential

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.950
operator.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.000
And let's see what it does.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.340
So l squared.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.360
Well, we had it there.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:34.620
So it's minus h squared 1
over sine theta, dd theta,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:42.230
sine theta, dd theta, plus
1 over sine squared theta,

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:49.250
d second d phi squared
psi l m equal h

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:56.600
squared l times
l plus 1 psi l m.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.800
One thing we can do here is let
the dd phi squared act on this.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.160
Because we know
what dd phi does.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.800
Dd phi brings an i n factor,
because you know already

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.610
the phi dependents of psi l m.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.020
So things we can do.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:26.390
So we'll do the second d
5 squared gives minus--

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:31.240
gives you i m squared,
which is minus

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.930
m squared, multiplying
the same function.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.020
You can cancel
the h bar squared.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.440
Cancel h bar squared.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:50.075
And multiply by minus
sine squared theta.

00:12:53.592 --> 00:12:55.340
To clean up things.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.500
So few things.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.020
So here is what we have.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.890
We have sine theta, dd theta.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.250
This is the minus sine squared
that you are multiplying.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.600
The h squared went away.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:22.250
Sine theta, d p l m d theta.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.070
Already I substituted
that psi was

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.530
into the i m phi times the p.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.560
So I have that.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.440
And maybe I should put
the parentheses here

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.070
to make it all look nicer.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:44.230
Then I have in here
two more terms.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.460
I'll bring the right-hand
side to the left.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.630
It will end up with
l l plus 1, sine

00:13:52.630 --> 00:14:00.115
squared theta, minus m
squared, p l m equals 0.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.130
There we go.

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.480
That's our
differential equation.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.720
It's a major, somewhat
complicated, differential

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.968
equation.

00:14:20.968 --> 00:14:23.010
But it's a famous
one, because it

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.020
comes from [?
Laplatians. ?] You know,

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.680
people had to
study this equation

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.490
to do anything with Laplatians,
and so many problems.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.930
So everything is
known about this.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.560
And the first
thing that is known

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:46.890
is that theta really appears
as cosine theta everywhere.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.500
And that makes sense.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.580
You see, theta and cosine theta
is sort of the same thing,

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.080
even though it
doesn't look like it.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.770
You need angles that
go from 0 to pi.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.690
And that's nice.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.210
But [? close ?] and
theta, in that interval

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.630
goes from 1 to minus 1.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.390
So it's a good parameter.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:13.670
People use 0 to 180
degrees of latitude.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.220
But you could use from 1
to minus 1, the cosine.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.830
That would be perfectly good.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.410
So theta or cosine theta
is a different variable.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:30.200
And this equation is simpler
for cosine theta as a variable.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.710
So let me write that,
do that simplification.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.110
So I have it here.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:55.530
If x is closer in
theta, d d x is minus 1

00:15:55.530 --> 00:16:00.190
over sine theta, d d theta.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.040
Please check that.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:10.540
And you can also show
that sine theta, d d theta

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:17.770
is equal to minus 1
minus x squared d d x.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.590
The claim is that this
differential equation just

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.030
involves cosine theta.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.050
And this operator you see in the
first term of the differential

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.690
equation, sine
theta, dd theta is

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.350
this, where x is cosine theta.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.330
And then there is a
sine squared theta,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.540
but sine squared theta is 1
minus cosine squared theta.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:46.060
So this differential
equation becomes d d x--

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:54.550
well, should I write
the whole thing?

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.960
No.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.960
I'll write the
simplified version.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.688
It's not-- it's
only one slight--

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:11.790
m of the x plus l
times l plus 1 minus m

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:21.230
squared over 1 minus x
squared p l m of x equals 0.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.170
The only thing
that you may wonder

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:33.270
is what happened to the 1
minus x squared that arises

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.220
from this first term.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.110
Well, there's a 1
minus x squared here.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.150
And we divided by all of it.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.970
So it disappeared from the first
term, disappeared from here.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:52.030
But the m squared ended up
divided by 1 minus x squared.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.985
So this is our equation.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:04.120
And so far, our
solutions are psi l m's.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.010
Are going to be
some coefficients,

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:15.370
m l m's, into the i m phi
p l m of cosine theta.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.021
Now I want to do a little
more before finishing today's

00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:24.520
lecture.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.380
So this equation is
somewhat complicated.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.080
So the way physicists
analyze it is

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.310
by considering first the
case when m is equal to 0.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:47.930
And when m is equal to 0,
the differential equation--

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.830
m equals 0 first.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:19:00.050
The differential equation
becomes d d x 1 minus x

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:04.420
squared d p l 0.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.090
But p l 0, people write as p l.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:17.290
The x plus l times l
plus 1, p l equals 0.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:27.160
So this we solve by
a serious solution.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.620
So we write p l of x
equals some sort of a k--

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:39.070
sum over k, a k, x k.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.890
And we substitute in there.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:52.950
Now if you substituted it
and pick the coefficient

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:58.560
of x to the k, you get
a recursion relation,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.370
like we did for the case
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.890
And this is a simple
recursion relation.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.930
It reads k plus 1-- this
is a two-line exercise--

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:19.500
k plus 2, a k plus 2, plus
l times l plus 1, minus k

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.360
times k plus 1, a k.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:37.340
So actually, this
recursive relation

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.640
can be put as a
[? ratio ?] form.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.540
The [? ratio ?] form we're
accustomed, in which we

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.500
divide a k plus 2 by a k.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.750
And that gives you
a k plus 2 over a k.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.555
I'm sorry, all this
coefficient must be equal to 0.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:15.360
And a k plus 2 over a k,
therefore is minus l times

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:27.790
l plus 1 minus k times k plus
1 over k plus 1 times k plus 2.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.430
OK, good.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.490
We're almost done.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.900
So what has happened?

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.410
We had a general
equation for phi.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.840
The first equation,
one, we solved.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.500
The second became an [?
integrated ?] differential

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.670
equation.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.470
We still don't know
how to solve it.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.410
M must be an integer so far.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.960
L we have no idea.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.250
Nevertheless we now solve this
for the case m equal to 0,

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.210
and find this
recursive relation.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.520
And this same
story that happened

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.580
for the harmonic
oscillator happens here.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.490
If this recursion
doesn't terminate,

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:16.770
you get singular functions
that diverge at x equals 1

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.196
or minus 1.

00:22:19.196 --> 00:22:24.180
And therefore this
must terminate.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.580
Must terminate.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.980
And if it terminates,
the only way

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.020
to achieve termination
on this series

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.880
is if l is an
integer equal to k.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:43.530
So you can choose some case--
you choose l equals to k.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:49.620
And then you get
that p l of x is

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.750
of the form of an x
to the l coefficient.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:23:00.320
Because l is equal to k, and a
k is the last one that exists.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.880
And now a l plus 2, k plus
2 would be equal to 0.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:12.950
So you match this, the last
efficient is the value of l.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:16.440
And the polynomial
is an elf polynomial,

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.190
up to some number at the end.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.410
and you got a quantization.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:28.130
L now can be any
positive integer or 0.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:33.060
So l can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:38.490
And it's the quantization of
the magnitude of the angular

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.940
momentum.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.210
This is a little surprising.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:48.540
L squared is an operator
that reflects the magnitude

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.810
of the angular momentum.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.000
And suddenly, it is quantized.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.270
The eigenvalues
of that operator,

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:03.570
where l times l plus 1, that
I had in some blackboard

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:04.580
must be quantized.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.430
So what you get here are
the Legendre polynomials.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:13.860
The p l's of x that satisfy
this differential equation are

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.130
legendre polynomials.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.030
And next time, when we
return to this equation,

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:26.740
we'll find that m
cannot exceed l.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.950
Otherwise you can't
solve this equation.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.010
So we'll find the complete
set of constraints

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.940
on the eigenvalues
of the operator.
