00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.990
We spoke about
superposition, and we

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.870
showed how, when you have two
states that are superimposed,

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.730
the resulting state
that is built up

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.410
doesn't have properties that
are intermediate between the two

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.210
states that you're
superimposing.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.270
But rather, when you
do a measurement,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.900
you obtain the result
that you would sometimes--

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.750
you sometimes obtain
the result that you

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.060
would have with
one of the states,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.240
and some other times with
different probabilities,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.280
the result as if you
had the other state.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.520
So it's a strange kind of
way in which things are

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.500
combined in quantum mechanics.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.810
So the next thing we have to
say is a physical assumption

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.720
that is made here.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.670
And it is that if
you have a state

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.000
and you superimpose
it to itself,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.840
you haven't done anything.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.890
So the superposition
of a state with itself

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.620
has no physical import.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.910
So we can say this.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:42.830
A physical assumption
superimposing a state to itself

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.385
does not change the physics.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.170
So if I have a state, this
is physically equivalent--

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.070
I'll write physically
equivalent with this symbol--

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.740
to the state a plus a,
which would be 2 times a.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.040
It's physically equivalent
to the state minus a.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.600
It's physically equivalent
to the state ia on anything.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.290
It's not equivalent
to 0a, because that

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.640
would be the zero state.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.330
So it's physically
equivalent as long

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.210
as you have a
non-zero coefficient.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.280
All these states are supposed
to be physically equivalent.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.710
And that will eventually
mean that we sometimes

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.660
choose a particular one in
those collection of states

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.450
that is one that is
convenient to work with.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.700
And that will be called a
normalized state, a state that

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.730
satisfies other
properties having

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.470
to do with the norm
squared of the state.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.540
That will come later.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.160
But it's important
that the number that

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.350
is multiplying the physical
state of your system

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.360
has no relevance.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.750
And you could say, well, why all
of the sudden you tell us this.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.230
Could this be shown
to be necessary?

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.260
Or it's a physical
assumption, so can we test it?

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.590
Does it make some sense?

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.920
And we can make some sense of
this assumption at this level.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.900
And we do it with
states of light.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.800
So remember, we spoke about
photons hitting a polarizer.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.450
And we could speak of two
independent kind of photons--

00:03:50.450 --> 00:04:01.350
photons polarized along the
x-axis and a photon polarized

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.310
along the y-axis.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.525
And those are two quantum
mechanical states.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.180
Now suppose I decide
to superimpose

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.370
those states to create the
most general photon state.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.899
I would have an alpha,
which is a number here,

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:24.220
a complex number,
and a beta there.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.170
And I would say, OK, here is
my most general photon state.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.620
And how many parameters
does this state have?

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.840
It has two complex parameters,
alpha and beta, and therefore,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.410
four real parameters.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.330
And then you think about
polarization states,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.290
how many parameters they have.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.930
And as we'll review in a second,
it's well known that photons--

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.340
their polarization
state can be expressed

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.410
with just two real parameters.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.100
So some counting is not
going very well here.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.650
But here comes the help.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.550
If the overall coefficient
here doesn't matter--

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.000
if I can change it, I
can multiply everything

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.480
by 1 over alpha, and therefore
get that the state is just

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.960
the same, physically
equivalent to this state,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.980
beta over alpha photon y.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.600
So all the physics is contained
in this state as well.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.570
And if all the physics is
contained in that state,

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.090
I must look how many
parameters it has.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.840
It still looks like
there's two numbers here,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.220
but only the ratio appears.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.260
So if you call beta over
alpha, the number gamma

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.380
is just one complex parameter.

00:06:04.188 --> 00:06:09.450
And therefore, thanks
to this assumption,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.180
you now get that the most
general photon polarization

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.590
state has just one
complex parameter, or just

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.100
equivalently, two
real parameters.

00:06:27.228 --> 00:06:32.520
And that is the correct number.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:40.400
Indeed, if you have a
polarization, a wave that

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.660
has some polarization, the
most general polarization state

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.180
of a wave is an
elliptical polarization.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.810
You probably did study a lot
about circular polarizations,

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.460
or maybe you also heard
about the elliptical one

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.930
in which the electric field--
in a circular polarization,

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.120
the electric field at any
point traces a circle.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.420
But if you have an
elliptical polarization,

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.275
the electric field
traces an ellipse.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:18.040
And that ellipse has an
angle that is one parameter.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.950
And for an ellipse, the other--

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.850
the size doesn't matter.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.950
The size depends
just on the magnitude

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.690
of the electric field.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.890
It's not a parameter of the
polarization of the wave.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.660
Since the size
doesn't matter, it's

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.850
the shape of the
ellipse that matters.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.510
And that's characterized by the
eccentricity or by the ratio

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:50.070
a over b of the semi-major axis,
so parameters, two parameters,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:56.140
and they are a over b and theta.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.760
So an elliptically
polarized wave,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.900
which is the most general state
of polarization of a wave,

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.310
has two real parameters.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:09.460
And now, thanks to this physical
assumption, we get this right.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.790
And this is important
because that's

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.830
something we're going
to use all the time,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.540
that the overall factor in a
wave function does not matter.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.510
So if we have
superpositions, I want

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.740
to emphasize one more
thing about superpositions.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.711
And for that, I'm
going to use spins.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.890
So what is spin?

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.580
Spin is a property of
elementary particles

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.740
that says that actually,
even if they're not

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.620
rotating around
some other particle,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.660
they have angular momentum.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.300
They have intrinsic
angular momentum,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.530
as if they would be made
of a tiny little ball that

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.320
is spinning.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.230
I say as if because
nobody has ever

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.550
constructed a model of
an elementary particle

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.760
where you can really make
it spin and calculate

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.600
how it works.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.570
Somehow, this
elementary particle

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.600
has angular momentum is born.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.950
Even if it is a point particle,
it has angular momentum,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.020
and it's spin.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.820
And spin is very
quantum mechanical.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.760
And we can't quite
understand it without it.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.910
So what happens is that you can
measure the spin of a particle.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.860
And then if you
measure it, you have

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.580
to decide, however, since
angular momentum is a vector,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.960
what direction you should use.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.440
And suppose you
use the z direction

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.410
to measure the
spin of a particle.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:57.770
You may find that the
particle has either spin up

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.535
or the particle has spin down.

00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:02.035
Spin.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.280
And the spin is the direction
of the angular momentum.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.640
And that's a funny thing
that happens with most matter

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.630
particles.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.150
These are spin 1/2 particles.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:20.950
The spin can be up or it can
be down along the z direction

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:21.760
that you measure.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.400
You measure it, and you never
find it's 0 or a little bit.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.580
It's just either up
with the full magnitude

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.740
or down with the full magnitude.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.070
That is a spin 1/2 particle.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.120
And the state where it is
up, we sometimes denote it

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:47.140
with an arrow up and call it
z because it's up along z.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.040
And this would be down,
an arrow down along z.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.450
If those are possible
quantum states,

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.730
you could build a
new quantum state

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:17.020
by superposition which would be
up along z plus down along z.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.980
Now, if I wish to
normalize it, I

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.050
would put the factor
in front of this.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.590
I will not talk about
normalizations at this moment.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.000
They're not so important.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.960
If you are faced with
this quantum state--

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.060
so suppose you have an electron
that is not in this state

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.030
nor in this state, but is
in this state, in a quantum

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.260
superposition.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.640
So you go and you decide
to try to measure it.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.110
Now, since you cannot predict
what that electron is going

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.280
to be doing--

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.340
we cannot predict things
in quantum mechanics with

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.030
certainty--

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.330
we, since we're going
to do this experiment,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:17.260
avail ourselves of 1,000 copies
of this electron, all of them

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.100
in this peculiar quantum state.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.740
So you have the 1,000 copies,
and you start measuring.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:29.260
And you decide to measure
the spin in the z direction.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.940
And now what do you get?

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.020
Well, we mentioned last time
that you don't get an average,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.800
or since this is up and
this is down, you get 0.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.150
You measure the first
particle and you find it up.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.830
Measure the second, up, the
third, up, the fourth, down,

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.980
five, down.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.850
And then you get a
series of measurements.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:57.038
At the end of the 1,000
particles, you find about 495

00:12:57.038 --> 00:13:03.920
up and 505 down,
about half and half.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.160
And if you did it
with 10,000 particles,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.690
maybe it would be closer.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:17.040
Eventually, you'll
find 50% in this state

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.780
and find 50% in this state.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:41.210
And if you think this is
strange, which you probably do,

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.720
well, you could be justified.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.720
But here would
come Einstein along

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:53.350
and would say all this
stuff of this superposition

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.610
is not quite right.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.280
You had this 1,000 particles.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.940
But actually, those 1,000
particles, half of them

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.300
were with a spin up and half
of them were with a spin down.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.600
So here you have
your 1,000 particles,

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.030
your quantum state, this.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:20.150
But Einsten says, no, let's make
an ensemble of 1,000 particles,

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:25.730
500 up, 500 down, and
do the same experiment.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.870
And the result is
going to be the same.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.980
So how do you know you
really have this as opposed

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:39.080
to somebody has given you 1,000
particles, 500 up, 500 down?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.520
How can you tell?

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.120
And in fact, he
would say even more--

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.310
whenever Einstein
used the word realism

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:55.130
to say if I measure a
spin and I find it up,

00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:01.600
it's because before I
measured it, the spin was up.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.160
It's almost like learning
something about an object.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.410
If I look at this page
and I find the color red,

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.740
it's because before I
looked at it, it was red.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.870
But then in quantum
mechanics, that

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.590
doesn't seem to be the case.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.500
The state is this mix.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.460
And it was this mix
before you measured.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.800
And after you
measure, it's this.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.130
So there is no such
thing as you learn

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:36.810
by doing one measurement what
the state of the particle was.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.450
So we will not resolve
Einstein's paradox

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:45.540
completely here because we would
have to learn more about spins,

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.500
which you will do soon enough.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.090
But here's the catch
that actually happens.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:58.640
If, instead of having an
ensemble of quantum states,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.080
you would have an ensemble of
those states that half of them

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.570
are up and half
of them are down,

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:10.550
you could now decide to measure
the spin of the particle

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.670
along the x direction.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:18.630
You take these particles,
and you measure along x.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.510
And what you will calculate
with quantum mechanics

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.590
later in this course--

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:26.610
if you measure along
x, in this state,

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:32.880
you will find all of them to
be pointing along plus, up

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.370
along x, all of them.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:43.990
While on this Einstein ensemble
of 50% up and 50% down,

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:50.230
you would find 50% up along
x and 50% down along x.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:55.210
So there is an experiment
that can tell the difference,

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.740
but you have to look
in another direction.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.170
And that experiment,
of course, can be done.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.120
And it's a calculation
that can be done,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.930
and you can decide whether
these quantum states exist.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.369
And they really seem to exist.
