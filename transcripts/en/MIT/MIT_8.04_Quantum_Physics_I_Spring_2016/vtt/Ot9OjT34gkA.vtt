00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.130
PROFESSOR: If you tell
someone solve this equation

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.260
for l equals zero--

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.150
so you have this
effective potential

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.210
for the real equation--
solve it for l equals zero

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.300
and you find some energies.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.040
You solve it for l equals 1,
and you've found some energies.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.230
You solve it now
for l equals two

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.790
and you found some energies.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.670
Well, we found
them all together,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.090
but something
extraordinary happened

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.290
there was no a priori
reason the system should

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.610
have been so simple.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.830
It might have happened that
these states would have not

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.810
been aligned with
the previous states.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.400
Nothing we've explained
in this course

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.840
predicts that this
would have happened,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.620
this perfect alignment with
extreme amount of degeneracy.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.190
Because you have an l
equals 2 multiplet here.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.020
That means five states.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.140
So there is
degeneracy, but that's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.570
implicit in angular momentum.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.250
It has an explanation.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.430
But why would there
be a degeneracy

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.846
between l equals 1 solutions
and l equals 2 solutions?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.520
Total mystery, actually.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.670
And this led to all kinds
of interesting discoveries

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.380
that have to do with the
Runge-Lenz vector, which

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.010
is some conserved vector
in planetary orbits.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.540
In planetary orbits,
in Newton's theory,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.960
an elliptical orbit is
the general solution.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.070
Nevertheless, elliptical
orbits do not precess.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.620
So you have an ellipse,
it goes like that.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.360
It's not going around
and rotating the ellipse

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.080
at the same time.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.660
The precession of an ellipse is
not allowed by Newton's theory.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.880
It's allowed by
Einstein's gravity theory,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.250
and in fact, the precession
of mercury was measured.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.000
But there is no precession
in Newton's theory,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.620
and there's no precession
in a hydrogen atom,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.570
in a sense, as you will see.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.980
And that explains, actually
in a rather interesting way--

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.830
but I'm not saying how yet--

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.410
why there is this
extra degeneracy.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.430
In fact, if you had
solved the problem

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.180
of an infinite spherical, well,
you will solve that in 805.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.410
Infinite spherical well.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.450
Suppose there's infinite square
well-- infinite spherical well.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.570
Inside a sphere of radius
A, the potential is 0.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.700
Outside the sphere of radius
A, the potential is infinite.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.440
That potential that
looks so symmetric--

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.610
the l equals 0
states are like this.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.670
The l equal 1 states
are like that.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.330
The l equal 2 states
are like that,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.070
and there's never
any coincidence.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.585
So this coincidence
between the l

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:28.780
equals 0, l equals 2, l
equals 2 is very special.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.150
It just doesn't happen often.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.170
It's a sign of an
extra symmetry.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.900
This could only be explained
because the hydrogen

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.950
atom has an extra symmetry
you're not aware of.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.080
So that's why this
Runge-Lenz vector

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.600
has to do with
that extra symmetry

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.330
and explains this effect.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.470
And we'll get some
intuition about it today.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.490
A few more remarks
to get your intuition

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.610
working on the hydrogen atoms.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.070
Z equals 1, we write
the wave function.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.690
This is the most
famous wave function.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.021
Pi a0 cubed e to
the minus r over a0.

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:19.900
And this is for z equals 1.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.510
n equals 1, l equals
0, m equals zero--

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.160
the complete ground state.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.510
It's interesting to note and
try to think, OK, suppose they

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.410
gave you the z equals 1 answer.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.900
How do you get z
different from 1?

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.960
Can I just do something
with this solution?

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.130
Well, somehow it's written
here, but I don't give here

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.220
the normalization because
it's impossibly complicated

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.110
to write the general form
for the normalization.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.340
So how should I
think of changing

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.930
if somebody would
have told me this

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.810
is the answer for Z equals 1?

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.380
How do I get to Z
different from 1?

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.930
And then I think
of the potential,

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.390
and the potential
was e squared over r.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.130
That was the potential
before, V of r.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.320
And it will pass
to a V of r that

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.610
has minus Ze squared over r.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.130
Because now you have a nucleus
with Z protons interacting

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.520
with one electron, so
that's how it changed.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.840
So naturally, what seems
to be the change here,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.400
and you could imagine just
solving it without the Z

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.990
and then adding the Z, is that
everywhere that you have e

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.385
squared you should
put Z times e squared.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.140
And then you think of a0.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.905
a0 was h squared
over me squared.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.290
We calculated that
some time ago.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.460
And then if e squared
goes to Ze squared,

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:36.350
this will go to 1 over Z
squared over me squared.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:44.300
So it will go to a0 over Z.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:51.000
So you change a0 to a0 over Z.
And these are the two changes.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.570
One is implicit on the
other, but many times you

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.970
write the formula
in a mixed way.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.200
Look at that energy.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.190
If you would have looked
at this without the Z

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.280
and you would have
said, oh, e squared

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.510
is replaced by Ze squared,
you would have put a single Z.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:21.930
But there is a Z squared here,
and it comes because 1z is here

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.220
and the other z is in
the a0 because a0 also

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.530
has the e squared.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.490
So you have to be aware
that we write these things.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.380
And this is intuitively a very
nice way to write the energy,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.040
because it has the right units--

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.369
electric charge squared
divided by distance.

00:07:43.369 --> 00:07:44.910
But you could have
written everything

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.270
with h bar, something
like that, in which case

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:53.700
the z squared might have
been less surprising.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.020
We see here, however, the z is
appearing in the right place

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.000
because of the a0.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.530
So here, I was right.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:10.096
e to the minus zr over a0.

00:08:13.824 --> 00:08:17.500
And can I get the
normalization even right?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.140
At this moment, yes.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.270
Let's do the same change here.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:27.870
Pi a0 cubed, z cubed.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.299
And this must be right,
because, in fact,

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.940
if this wave function
was normalizable--

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.706
not normalizable;
was normalized--

00:08:40.706 --> 00:08:45.720
when you do the integral,
somehow the a0 did not matter,

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.625
must not matter.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.250
You checked psi squared
integrated over volume

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.205
is equal to 1.

00:08:53.205 --> 00:08:56.720
The a0 must be canceling here.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.600
And therefore, if it works for
a0, it must work for a0 over z,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.050
and that must be
a wave function.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.390
So that's fine.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.965
That's one thing you could ask.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:21.630
Another thing that you could
ask is, at least intuitively,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.950
why did we get this factor here?

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.860
Why did we get this exponential?

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:36.970
And that's also not
mysterious at all.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:42.190
This comes from the
differential equation.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:47.950
It comes up rather immediately
from the differential equation.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:57.100
You have minus h squared over
2m d second u dr squared,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.310
plus some sort of number--

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.720
you don't care how
much-- u over r squared

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.500
in the effective potential,
minus some number over r

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.340
times u is equal to Eu.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.880
This was your radial
differential equation.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.608
And this r goes to infinity.

00:10:20.608 --> 00:10:24.910
As r goes to infinity,
you get minus h

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:35.110
squared over 2m d second u
dr squared is equal to Eu,

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.430
roughly.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.820
That's the key terms.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.990
And from here, d
second u dr squared

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:49.970
is equal to minus 2
mE over h squared u.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.100
And that gives you
an exponential,

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.990
and the exponential must be
of the right value, which

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:12.300
we can calculate easily from
the expression for the energy.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.460
So the expression for
the energy gives you

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:28.930
em equals minus z squared
over 2a0 e squared, times 1

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.000
over n squared.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:47.725
And I can change this
thing into minus z squared.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:58.660
Recall what's the value of
the fine structure constant.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:05.580
I can replace e squared from
a0 to get the following thing

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.840
over 2a0 times h
squared over ma0.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.960
That is 1 over m squared.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.920
A little bit of manipulation.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:29.180
So at the end, minus
2mEn over h squared,

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.735
which is what I need from
the differential equation.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.420
I must multiply by
minus 2m over h squared.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:45.470
You see that minus the 2m over
h squared, they will disappear.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:53.650
So you get here z squared
over n squared a0 squared.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.330
A little bit of manipulation.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.730
So what are we trying to get?

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.610
We want to understand
immediately

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.050
where this came from.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.640
And we see it.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.630
It comes from the asymptotic
form of the differential

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.690
equation for a solution.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:14.440
So I calculate the value of
the right-hand side is this,

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.540
and therefore this
differential equation

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:24.850
now looks like the du dr
squared equals z squared over n

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.820
squared a0 squared u.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.000
Are indeed, from
here, the solutions

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.720
are exponentials
of the square root

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.370
of this, which is z over na0r.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:46.490
And that's a quicker derivation
of a feature of the wave

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.190
function.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.420
It's almost like you want to
look at this wave function,

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.280
and you want to
say, I understand

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.890
where everything comes from.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.340
And I don't have to solve
pages and pages of differential

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:04.160
equations to see why I need
this, why I need that much.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.220
I know I need this
from r equals zero.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.450
I know this degree.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.120
I need it from the node theorem.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.500
Everything sort of has a
reason for being there,

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.720
and we should understand.
