00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.800
PROFESSOR: Delta
function potential.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.120
So it's still a one-dimensional
potential-- potential

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.960
is a function of x.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.490
We'll write it this
way-- minus alpha delta

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.190
of x, where alpha is positive.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.030
So this is a delta function
in a negative direction.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.910
So if you want to
draw the potential--

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.350
there's no way to draw really
nicely a delta function.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.970
So you just do a thick
arrow with it pointing down.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.750
It's a representation of
a potential that, somehow,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.070
is rather infinite
at x equals zero--

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.010
but infinite and negative.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.990
It can be thought of as the
limit of a square well that

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.350
is becoming deeper and deeper.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.900
And, in fact, that
could be a way

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.200
to analytically
calculate the energy

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.010
levels-- by taking carefully
the limit of a potential.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.180
It is becoming thinner and
thinner, but deeper and deeper,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.290
which is the way you define or
regulate the delta function.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.360
You can imagine
the delta function

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.450
as a sequence of
functions, in which it's

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.040
becoming more and more narrow--

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.850
but deeper at the same time.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.350
So that the area under the
curve is still the same.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.970
So, at any rate, the delta
function potential is

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.690
a potential that should be
understood as 0 everywhere ,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.250
else except at the delta
function where it becomes

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.000
infinite.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.700
And there are all kinds
of questions we can ask.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.500
OK.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.330
Are there bound states?

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.430
What are bound
states in this case?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.270
They are energy eigenstates
with energy less than zero.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:02.160
So bound states, which
means e less than zero.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.216
Do they exist?

00:02:04.216 --> 00:02:08.190
Does this potential
have bound states?

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.130
And, if it does, how
many bound states?

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.480
1, 2, 3?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.110
Does It depend on the intensity
of the delta function?

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.590
When you get more bound states,
the deeper the potential is.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.580
Well, we'll try to figure out.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.550
In fact, there's a lot
that can be figured out

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.280
without calculating, too much.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.240
And it's a good habit to try
to do those things before you--

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.010
not to be so impatient
that you begin,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.100
and within a second
start writing

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.830
the differential equation
trying to solve it.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.860
Get a little intuition about
how any state could look like,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.210
and how could the answer
for the energy eigenstates--

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.060
the energies--
what could they be?

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.160
Could you just reason
your way and conclude

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.620
there's no bound states?

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.820
Or one bound state?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.960
Or two?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.840
All these things
are pretty useful.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.355
So one way, as you can
imagine, is to think of units.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.710
And what are the
constants in this problem?

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.340
In this problem we'll
have three constants.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.730
Alpha, the mass of the
particle, and h-bar.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.340
So with alpha, the
mass and the particle,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.450
and h-bar you can ask, how
do I construct the quantity

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.910
with units of energy?

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.100
If there there's only one
way to construct the quantity

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.510
with units of energy, then
the energy of a bound state

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.880
will be proportional
to that quantity--

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.840
because that's the only quantity
that can carry the units.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.150
And here, indeed,
there's only one way

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.000
to construct that quantity
with units of energy--

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.730
from these three.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.020
That's to be expected.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.290
With three constants that
are not linearly dependent--

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.830
whatever that is
supposed to mean--

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.019
you can build anything that has
units of length, mass, or time.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.700
And from that you
can build something

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.000
that has units of energy.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.030
So you can now decide, well,
what are the units of alpha?

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.350
The units of alpha
have give you energy,

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.070
but the delta function has
units of one over length.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.522
This has one over length.

00:04:38.522 --> 00:04:42.940
, Remember if you integrate over
x the delta function gives you

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.440
1.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.960
So this has units
of 1 over length.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.150
And, therefore,
alpha has to have

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.140
units of energy times length.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.120
So this is not quite enough
to solve the problem,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.010
because I want to write e--

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.810
think of finding how do
you get units of energy

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.040
from these quantities?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.610
But l-- we still don't
have a length scale either.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.900
So we have to do a
little more work.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.550
So from here we say that units
of energy is alpha over l.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.340
There should be a
way to say that this

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.800
is an equality between units.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.300
I could put units or
leave it just like that.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.660
So in terms of units, it's this.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.120
But in terms of units, energy--

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.490
you should always remember--

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.340
is p squared over m.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.800
And p is h-bar over a length.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.200
So that's p squared
and that's m.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.170
So that's also units of energy

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:05.100
From these two you can get
what has units of length.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.860
Length.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.830
You pass the l to
this side-- the l

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.871
squared to this left-hand side.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:12.370
Divide.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:20.950
So you get l is h
squared over m alpha.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.970
And if I substitute
back into this l here,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:33.660
e would be alpha over l, which
is h squared, alpha squared, m.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.500
So that's the quantity
that has units of energy.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.730
M alpha squared over h
squared has units of energy.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.830
If this has units of energy--

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.080
the bound state energy.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.460
Now, if you have a
bounce state here,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.810
it has to decay in order
to be normalizable.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.930
In order to be normalizable
it has to decay,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.090
so it has to be in the
forbidden region throughout x.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.790
So the energy as we
said is negative,

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.410
energy of a bound
state-- if it exists.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.910
And this bound
state energy would

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:25.970
have to be negative some number
m alpha squared over h squared.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.850
And that's very
useful information.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.950
The whole problem
has been reduced

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.540
to calculating a number.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.670
It better be and the answer
cannot be any other way.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.290
There's no other way to
get the units of energy.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.880
So if a bound state
exists it has to be that.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.830
And that number could be
pi, it could be 1/3, 1/4,

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.820
it could be anything.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.690
There's a naturalness
to that problem

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.610
in that you don't expect
that number to be a trillion.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.900
Nor do you expect that number
to be 10 to the minus 6.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.810
Because there's no way-- where
would those numbers appear?

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.110
So this number should be
a number of order one,

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.370
and we're going to wait
and see what it is.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:21.660
So that's one thing we know
already about this problem.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.270
The other thing we can do is
to think of the regulated delta

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.530
function.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:33.870
So we think of this as a
potential that has this form.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.220
So here is v of
x, and here is x.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.490
And for this potential--

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.630
if you have a bound state--

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.260
how would the wave
function look?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.480
Well, it would have to--

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.820
suppose you have
a ground state--

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.378
it's an even potential.

00:09:01.378 --> 00:09:03.700
The delta function is even, too.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.590
It's in the middle.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.610
It's symmetric.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.610
There's nothing asymmetric
about the delta function.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.890
So if it's an even
potential the ground states

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.110
should be even, because
the ground state

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.930
is supposed to have no nodes.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.100
And it's supposed to be even
if the potential is even.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.540
So how will it look?

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.440
Well, it shouldn't be
decaying in this region.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.610
So, presumably, it decays here.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.530
It decays there-- symmetrically.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:42.580
And in the middle it curves
in the other direction.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.520
It is in an allowed region--

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.730
and you remember that's
kind of allowed this way.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.290
So that's probably
the way it looks.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:56.240
Now, if that bound
state exists, somehow,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.490
as I narrow this and go down--

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:06.170
as it becomes even more narrow,
very narrow now, but very deep.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.510
This region becomes smaller.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.020
And I would pretty much
expect the wave function

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.810
to have a discontinuity.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.390
You basically don't
have enough power

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.630
to see the curving
that is happening here.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.940
Especially because the
curving is going down.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.120
The distance is going down.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:33.490
So if this bound state
exists, as you approach

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.220
the limit in which this
becomes a delta function

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:42.240
the energy moves a little, but
stays finite at some number.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.550
And the curvature that is
created by the delta function

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.150
is not visible, and the thing
looks just discontinuous

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.350
in its derivative.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.890
So this is an intuitive
way to understand

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.480
that the wave
function we're looking

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.330
for is going to be
discontinuous on its derivative.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.050
Let's write the
differential equation,

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.550
even though we're still
not going to solve it.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.430
So what is the
differential equation?

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:16.270
Minus h squared over
m, psi double prime,

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.420
is equal to E psi.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.170
And, therefore-- and I
write this, and you say,

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.730
oh, what are you writing?

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.220
I'm writing the
differential equation

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.500
when x is different from 0.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.380
No potential when x
is different from 0.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.710
So this applies for
positive x and negative x.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.140
It doesn't apply at x equals 0.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.280
We'll have to deal
with that later.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.050
So then, no potential
for x different from 0.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.960
And this differential
equation becomes

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:59.980
psi double prime equals minus
2m e over h squared psi.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.040
And this is equal
to kappa squared

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.880
psi, where kappa squared is
minus 2me over h squared.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.350
And it's positive.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.000
Let's make that positive.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.180
It's positive because
the energy is negative

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.450
and we're looking
for bound states.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.690
So we're looking for
bound states only.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.560
Kappa squared is positive.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.470
And this differential
equation is just this.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.690
I'll copy it again here.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.990
Kappa squared psi.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.920
And the solutions of this
equation are-- solutions--

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:52.640
are e to the minus kappa
x and e to the kappa x.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.840
Or, if you wish, cosh
kappa x and sinh kappa x--

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.830
whichever you prefer.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.560
This is something we
now have to use in order

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.550
to produce a solution.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.900
But now, let's see
if I can figure out

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.940
how many bound states there are.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.840
If there is one bound state,
it's going to be even.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.180
It's the ground state.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.975
It has no nodes.

00:13:40.975 --> 00:13:45.800
It has to be even, because
the potential is even.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.990
If I have the first excited
state after the ground state,

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.330
it will have to be odd.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:59.320
It would have to vanish at x
equals 0, because it's odd.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.010
There is it's node--

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.390
it has to have one node.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:10.800
For an odd bound state--

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.310
or first excited state--

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:26.590
you'd have to have psi
equals 0 at x equals 0.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:37.920
And the way to do that would
be to have a sinh, because this

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.530
doesn't vanish at zero.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.870
This doesn't vanish at zero.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.050
And cosh doesn't vanish at zero.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:51.210
So you would need psi of
x equals sinh of kappa x.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.230
But that's not good.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:06.420
sinh of kappa x is
like this and blows up.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.030
Blows down.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.590
It has to go like this.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.230
It is in a forbidden
region, so it has

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.230
to be convex towards the axis.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.300
And convex here.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.930
But it blows up.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.370
So there's no such solution.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.240
No such solution.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.630
You cannot have an
odd bound state.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.870
So since the bound states
alternate-- even, odd, even,

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.270
odd, even, odd--

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.560
you're stuck.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.720
You only will have a ground
state-- if we're lucky--

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.970
but no excited state that is
bound, while a finite square

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:48.470
will.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.590
You remember this
quantity z0 that

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:56.420
tells you how many bound
states you can have.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.080
Probably you're anticipating
that in the case

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.630
of the delta function
potential, you can only

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.630
have one bound state, if any.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.960
The first excited
state would not exist.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.630
So, enough preliminaries.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.410
Let's just solve that now.
