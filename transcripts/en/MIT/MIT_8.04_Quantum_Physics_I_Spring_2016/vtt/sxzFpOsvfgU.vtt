00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
PROFESSOR: Simple
harmonic oscillator.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.420
So what is there about this
simple harmonic oscillator?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.270
Well, it's a classical
system that you

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.130
understand perfectly well.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.100
An oscillator, a
spring with a mass

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.960
oscillates and has
an energy, which

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.330
is the kinetic energy
plus the potential energy,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.750
and that's p
squared over 2m plus

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.680
1/2 m omega squared x squared.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.990
And this may be a
tiny bit unfamiliar,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.180
this way of writing it.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.560
But you may recall that omega
is equal to the square root of k

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.040
over m, the so-called
spring constant,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:05.170
in which the potential in terms
of k would be 1/2 k x squared.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And that's the potential
energy stored in a spring

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.120
that you stretch at distance x.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.820
That's the total energy
of a harmonic oscillator.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.080
So when physicists starting
with quantum mechanics

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.560
in the '20s decided, let's
do a harmonic oscillator,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.350
a quantum harmonic
oscillator, they

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.110
had to invent the Hamiltonian.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.560
And the Hamiltonian they
invented was a simple one.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.000
They looked at
that and said, h is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.290
going to be p hat
squared over 2m

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.610
plus 1/2 m omega
squared x hat squared.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.390
And now the difference is
going to be that x with p

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.790
are operators, and
this is our h bar,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.310
and that's going to
be my quantum system.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.670
So this is a quantum
system that is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.460
inspired by classical mechanics
in the purest and simple way.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.150
Anyone could have invented
this quantum system.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.135
It was very natural.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.010
Still, the result
of the quantization

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.310
is very surprising because while
this mechanical oscillator can

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.880
oscillate with any amplitude,
the quantum oscillator

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.530
has quantized amplitudes and
quantized energies therefore.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.630
So all kinds of
interesting things

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.490
happen with this oscillator.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.420
Now the reason this is
also very ubiquitous is

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.400
that this potential is exactly
a quadratic potential v of x.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.790
v of x is 1/2 m omega
squared x squared.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.870
We have x without the hat.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.470
This is a good approximation
to almost any system

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.980
we consider in nature,
any oscillating system.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.110
Because for any potential
that has a minimum,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.210
there is some parabolic
approximation at the bottom.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.530
At the bottom the
derivative vanishes,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.350
so the Taylor series says that
approximately at the bottom

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.750
is a quadratic potential.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.300
And therefore this
quadratic potential

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.970
will govern the
quantum oscillations

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.690
of a diatomic molecule,
the quantum oscillations

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.310
of a periodic system, all
kind of quantum oscillations

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.840
will be approximately governed
by a harmonic oscillator.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.910
Light has a harmonic oscillator
description for its photons.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.990
This Hamiltonian is the most
famous Hamiltonian there is.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.460
In fact, when you have
electrons in a magnetic field,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.860
somehow this shows up.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.460
And this becomes
some sort of problem

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.750
that you solve very well,
understand very well,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.760
and suddenly it pops up
in all kinds of contexts.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.760
So we need to understand it.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.210
And let's go directly to the
issue of solving this problem,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.980
because it has many
important lessons.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.160
So there's two ways to solve
this problem of finding

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.040
the bound states of
the energy eigenstates

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.450
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.180
This is a very
interesting potential

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.880
because all its energy
eigenstates are bound states.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.720
That's not the case for the
delta function potential.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.050
In the delta function potential
we found one bound state,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:11.310
but they're all kind of unbound
states with positive energy.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.810
But this potential grows
forever, never stops growing.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.070
So whatever energy you
have, it is a bound state.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.240
It will decay.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.680
It will be localized.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.062
So you just have bound states.

00:05:28.062 --> 00:05:32.680
It's marvelously nice
because of that property.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.520
Much simpler than
anything you can imagine.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.740
So what do we have to do?

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.050
We want to find the
energy eigenstates.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.600
So we'll write h, and
I will write phis.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.405
People write sometimes phis.

00:05:47.405 --> 00:05:55.080
Phi n of x is equal
to E phi n of x.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.950
And we don't know the
energy eigenstates.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.720
You know it's a
symmetric potential.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.220
It's a real potential.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.180
This we used to go psi
n's, but I will write them

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.430
as phi n's as many
people do, because they

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.520
are the harmonic oscillator
ones that are very famous.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.500
And we don't know--

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.400
this could be En, energy
of the n-th state.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.560
And we don't know what
are the energies nor how

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.510
the wave functions look.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.710
And we have to solve a
differential equation.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.190
As I was saying,
there's two ways

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.310
of solving this
differential equation.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.760
One, treating this as
a differential equation

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.260
and understanding
why the energy is

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.010
quantized from the
differential equation.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.490
This actually gives you a lot of
insight as to what's going on,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.240
and it will relate to the
kind of things you're doing

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.890
in the homework this week.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.040
The other way is
to be very clever

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.360
and invent what are called
raising and lowering operators,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.080
and sort of solve this
whole system without solving

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.110
the general
differential equation,

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.680
by solving a first order very
simple differential equation,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.500
and then doing everything
else algebraically

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.990
with creation and
annihilation operators.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.830
We will also do that.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.840
But we will not
develop that too far.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:30.120
That's The applications of
that method are mostly for 805.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.230
So we'll introduce creation and
annihilation operators, which

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.260
are very nice and very useful.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.930
But we leave some
of the applications

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.160
to coherent states of
harmonic oscillators,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.020
to squeezed states of harmonic
oscillators, for later.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.810
So this is what
we want to solve.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:58.160
So we have minus h squared over
2m d second phi n dx squared.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.580
And I will probably
forget about the labels.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.800
The labels will come later
as we solve the equation.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:16.600
Plus v of x 1/2 m omega
squared x squared phi of x,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.330
is equal to E phi of x.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:21.830
OK.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.590
This is the question
we want to solve.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.700
Now we're going to do one thing
first with this differential

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.310
equation.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.559
We don't like all these
dimensionful constants.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.960
If you had to put it
in the computer, what?

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.900
Are you going to put 6 times
10 to the minus 23 over m?

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.060
And you won't solve a
differential equation.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.350
We have to clean this up.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.290
To clean this up,
there is a procedure

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:57.090
that is guaranteed to
do the job for you.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:05.190
And the procedure is to change
the x variable into a variable

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.650
that has no units.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.890
This is guaranteed to
lead you to the way

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.850
to solve this
differential equation.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.610
You will be using this
throughout the semester.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.200
Cleaning differential
equations is a nice skill.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.830
And the fact is that
there's a method,

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.310
and the method always
proceeds by first

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:37.220
writing x equals au, where
this will be unit-free,

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.030
this quantity u.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.130
So this will become a
differential equation

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.940
on a unit-free
constant, which is

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.590
ideal for your numerical
solution and is much nicer.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.720
But then this a to
have units of length.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.980
So the first thing you have to
do is look up in your problem.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.750
What are your constants?

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:06.735
And you have a mass m, a
frequency omega, an h bar.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:14.190
And you need to find a
constant with units of length.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.010
Wasn't that in your test?

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.770
I think so.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.920
How do you find a constant
with units of length here?

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.665
Well, energy is equal to--

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.310
you can write it in two ways.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:36.980
The energy can be written
as p squared over m,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:44.600
so it will be h squared over
m times a length squared.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.150
But from the potential,
it also has the units

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:55.580
of m omega squared a squared.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.030
These are units,
equations for units.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.610
The units of energy are
these, and the units

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.420
of energy from the second term
in the Hamiltonian are those.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.110
From where you get
that a squared is

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:18.800
equal to h over m omega.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.150
So that's the constant
that you need.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.320
If you have that constant,
your differential equation

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.432
becomes what?

00:11:32.432 --> 00:11:36.410
Well, it becomes the following.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.200
Let's write it out.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.940
It's very simple,
because x is equal to au,

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.270
and therefore you get
minus h squared over

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:57.730
2m a squared d second
phi du squared.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.770
x is equal to au, so it
basically just shows up here.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:11.610
Plus 1/2 m omega squared
a squared u squared phi,

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.930
is equal to E phi.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.590
Now things have to work nicely.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.455
If you did the job well,
they have to work nicely.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.000
Let's think of the
units of this equation.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.570
Phi is here, phi is here, phi
is here, so phi is not an issue.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:40.550
The units of phi are irrelevant.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:47.310
Here is units of energy,
but u has no units.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.460
This has no units.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.300
So this must have
units of energy.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.590
And since u has no units,
this derivative has no units,

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.990
and this must have
units of energy.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.520
And these two numbers
must be something

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.280
nice if you
substitute a squared.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.560
And indeed, if you
substitute a squared here,

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:17.580
this whole number
becomes h bar omega.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:22.110
And this number
becomes h bar omega

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:27.130
as well, which is very nice.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.310
So this whole
equation has become

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:40.660
minus 1/2 times h bar omega
d second phi du squared

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:48.880
plus 1/2 h bar omega u
squared phi equal E phi.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.860
The next step is
to say, you know,

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.820
I don't even want
these energy units.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.650
Even though they
don't look that bad,

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.330
this equation looks much nicer
than the original equation

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.210
which had all kinds
of strange units.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:18.070
So I will multiply this equation
by 2 over h omega to cancel it.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:27.650
So I get minus d second
phi du squared plus u

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:36.630
squared phi is equal to
2E over h bar omega phi.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.980
So look at this.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:54.890
The equation is now
almost in perfect form.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.690
And in order to
make it perfect, I

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.040
would say that the
right hand side--

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.505
now, see again.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.270
Phi, whatever units it
has, it doesn't matter.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.070
It's all over the place.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.160
But this has no units,
this derivative,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.720
and this has no units,
this multiplication.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.600
So this must have no units.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.770
And indeed, you know that h
omega has units of energy,

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:20.520
and that's energy.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:29.690
So it suggests that you define
a unit-free energy, free energy,

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.370
which is 2E over h omega.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.500
And calculating curly
E is the same thing

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:49.080
as calculating the energy,
because if you know this number

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.410
you know the energy.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.060
The energy is h bar
omega over 2 times

00:15:54.060 --> 00:16:01.710
curly E. The advantage is that
curly E will be either 1, 2,

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:11.010
1/2, a nice number, while E
is some 0.87 Ev, or things

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.900
like that.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.550
So all of this equation
has been reduced

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.900
to this very nice equation.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.380
Minus d second phi
du squared plus u

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:29.120
squared phi is equal to E phi.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:39.430
Or, d second phi du squared is
equal to u squared minus E phi.
