BARTON ZWIEBACH:
The next thing I

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.330
want to talk about
for a few minutes is

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.590
about the node theorem.

00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:08.776
Theorem.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.540
And it's something
we've seen before.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.530
We've heard that if you have
a one-dimensional potential

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.830
and you have bound states,
the ground state has no nodes.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.290
The first excited
state has 1 node.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.310
Second, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.580
All I want to do is give
you a little intuition

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.220
as to why this happens.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.360
So this will be an argument
that is not mathematically

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.230
very rigorous, but
it's fairly intuitive

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.930
and it captures the
physics of the problem.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.740
So it begins by making
two observations.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.320
So in the node theorem, if
you have psi 1, psi 2, psi 3,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170
all energy--

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:10.020
energy-- eigenstates of a
one-dimensional potential--

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.470
bound states.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.160
Bound states.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.490
With energy E1 less than
E2, less than E3 and E4,

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.570
psi n has n minus 1 nodes.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.640
Those are points where
the wave function

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.290
vanishes inside the range of x.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.210
So for this square
well, you've proven this

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.970
by calculating all the
energy eigenstates.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.500
The first state is
the ground state.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.180
It has no nodes.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.300
The next state is the
first excited state.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.380
It has one node.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.210
And you can write
all of them, and we

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.765
saw that each one has one
more node than the next.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.030
Now I want to argue that in
an arbitrary potential that

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.400
has bound states,
this is also true.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.720
So why would that be true
for an arbitrary potential?

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.020
The argument we're going to
make is based on continuity.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.305
Suppose you have a
potential like this--

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:42.740
V of x-- and I want to argue
that this potential will

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.130
have bound states and will
have no node, 1 node, 2 nodes,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.980
3 nodes.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.870
How could I argue that?

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.730
Well, I would do the following.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.040
Here is the argument.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.820
Identify the minimum here.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.772
Call this x equals 0.

00:03:02.772 --> 00:03:06.210
Oh, I want to say one more thing
and remind you of another fact

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.930
that I'm going to use.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.810
So this is the first
thing, that the square well

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.690
realizes this theorem,
and the second

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.260
is that psi of x0 being
equal to psi prime at x0

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.800
being equal to 0
is not possible.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.210
The wave function and its
derivative cannot vanish

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.155
at the same point.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.090
Please see the notes about this.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.200
There is an explanation
in last lecture's notes.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.300
It is fact that for a second
order differential equation,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.810
psi and psi prime tell you
how to start the solution,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.050
and if both psi and psi
prime are equal to 0,

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.660
the general solution of
the differential equation

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.220
is always 0 everywhere.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.130
So this kind of thing doesn't
happen to a wave function--

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.950
the point where it's 0
and the derivative is 0.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.060
That never happens.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.730
This happens-- 0 wave
function with the derivative.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.649
But this, no.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.390
Never happens.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.270
So those two facts.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.650
And now let's do the following.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.510
Let's invent a new potential.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.240
Not this potential,
but a new one

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.220
that I'll mark the point minus
a here and the point a here

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.440
and invent a new potential
that is infinite here,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:52.290
infinite there, and has
this part I'll write there.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.200
So this will be called
the screened potential.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.030
Screened potential.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.250
Va of x in which Va
of x is equal to V

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:20.150
of x for x less than a, and it's
infinity for x greater than a.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.700
So that's a potential in
which you turn your potential

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.420
into an infinite square
well whose bottom follows

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.200
the potential.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.010
It's not flat.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:45.890
And now, we intuitively argue
that as I take a to infinity,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.150
the bound states of
the screened potentials

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.630
become the bound states of
your original potential.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.110
Because when the screen is
very, very, very far away,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.520
up to infinity, you've got all
your potential, and by the time

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.620
you have bound states
that are decaying,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.810
so the screen is not going
to do much at infinity.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.380
And anyway, you can move
it even further away.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.030
If you move it one light year
away or two light years away,

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.790
shouldn't matter.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.910
So the idea is that
the bound states--

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:31.180
bound states-- of Va of
x as a goes to infinity

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.910
are the bound states of V of x.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:50.270
And moreover, as
you slowly increase

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:56.560
the width of the screen,
the bound states evolve,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.720
but they evolve continuously.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.950
At no point a bound state
blows up and reappears

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.360
or does something like that.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.060
It just goes continuously.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.560
These are physically
reasonable, but a mathematician

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.280
would demand a
better explanation.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.990
But that's OK.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.530
We'll stick to this.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.840
So let's continue there.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.090
So here is the
idea, simply stated.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:36.710
If a is going to 0, if
the width of the screen

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.790
is extremely narrow, you're
sitting at the bottom

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:48.110
of the potential at x equals 0.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.080
And the screened
potential is basically

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.070
a very, very narrow
thing, and here, there's

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.270
the bottom of the potential.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.300
And for sufficiently small a--

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.170
since you picked the bottom
of the potential there--

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.462
it's basically flat.

00:08:06.462 --> 00:08:12.100
And then I can use the states
of the infinite square well

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.630
potential.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.520
As a goes to 0, yes,
you have a ground state

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.770
with no nodes, a first
excited state with one node,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.890
and all the states have
the right number of nodes

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.690
because they are the states
of the infinite square well,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.570
however narrow it is.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.240
So the only thing we have to now
show is that if you have a wave

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.970
function-- say, let's begin
with one with no nodes--

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.780
as you increase the
width of the screen,

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.630
you cannot get more nodes.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.760
It's impossible to change the
number of nodes continuously.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.830
So here it is.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.685
I'm going to do
a little diagram.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.910
So for example, let's
assume the screen

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.490
is this big at this
moment, that you have

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.850
some ground state like this.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:22.200
You've been growing
this, and then

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:31.310
as the screen grows bigger,
you somehow have maybe a node.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.890
Could this have happened?

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:39.110
As you increase this
screen, you get a node.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.420
Now I made it on this point.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:47.235
I didn't intend to do that, so
let me do it again somewhere.

00:09:47.235 --> 00:09:50.290
Do you get a node?

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.580
Well, here was the
original screen,

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:57.160
and here the derivative
psi prime is negative.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.910
Psi prime is negative.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:13.630
On the other hand, psi prime
here is already positive.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:21.370
So as you grew this screen,
this PSI prime that was here

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:27.360
must have turned from
negative to positive,

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.340
the way it looks here.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.920
But for that, there
must have been a point

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:38.190
somewhere here when it was
horizontal if it's continuous.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.650
And therefore,
there must have been

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:51.910
some point at which psi
and psi prime were both 0

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:59.950
at the endpoint x equals a,
whatever the value of a was,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:05.500
because psi prime here is
positive, and here is negative.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.260
So at some point it
was 0, but since it's

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.095
at the point where you have
the infinite square well,

00:11:12.095 --> 00:11:13.870
psi is also 0.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.990
And you would have both
psi and psi prime equal 0,

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.140
which is impossible.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.730
So basically, you can't quite
flip this and produce a node

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.810
because you would have to flip
here, and you can't do it.

00:11:31.522 --> 00:11:35.160
One could try to make a very
precise, rigorous argument,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.770
but if you have
another possibility

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:42.900
that you might think, well, you
have this wave function maybe.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:50.630
And then suddenly it starts
doing this, and at some stage,

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.010
it's going to try to do this.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.745
But before it does
that, at some point,

00:11:56.745 --> 00:11:59.760
it will have to be just
like this and cross,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.190
but at this point, psi
and psi prime would be 0.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:08.300
So you can intuitively
convince yourself

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:13.670
that this thing doesn't
allow you to produce a node.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.930
So if you start with
whatever wave function

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.410
that has no nodes, as
you increase the screen,

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.400
you just can't produce a node.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.900
So the ground state of
the whole big potential

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.650
will have no nodes.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.630
And if you start with the
first excited state that

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.260
has one node, as you
increase the screen,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.950
you still keep one node.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.120
So the next state of
the full potential

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.470
will have one node as well.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:47.950
And that way, you argue
that all your bound states

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.590
of the complete
potential will just

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.630
have the right number of
nodes, which is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.660
And it all came, essentially,
from the infinite square

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.380
well and continued.
