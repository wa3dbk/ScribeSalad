00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.410
PROFESSOR: Last time we talked
about particle on a circle.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.890
Today the whole lecture is
going to be developed to solving

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.240
Schrodinger's equation.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.700
This is very important,
has lots of applications,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.000
and begins to give you
the insight that you

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.490
need to the solutions.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.250
So we're going to be
solving this equation

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.130
all through this lecture.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.170
And let me remind
you what with had

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.300
with a particle on a circle.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.170
The circle is segment 0 to
L, with L and 0 identified.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.780
More properly we actually
think of the whole x-axis

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.450
with the identification
that two points related

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.800
in this way that differ by
L, or therefore for 2L, 3L,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.900
are the same point.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.340
As a result, we
want wave functions

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.520
that have this periodicity.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.980
And that implies the same
periodicity for the derivatives

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.530
as well.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.860
We looked at the
Schrodinger equation

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.410
and we proved that the
energy of any solution

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.700
has to be positive or 0.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.320
And therefore the differential
equation, the Schrodinger

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.570
differential equation,
can be read then

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.070
as minus k squared psi, where
k squared is this quantity

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.940
and it's positive, so
k is a real number.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.110
That makes sense.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.940
And finally, once you
have this equation,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.060
you know that if the second
derivative of a function

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.010
is proportional to
minus the function,

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.510
the solution are trigonometric
functions or exponentials.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.976
And we decided to
go for exponentials,

00:01:52.976 --> 00:01:56.900
that they are perhaps a
little more understandable,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.550
though we will go back to them.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.040
Now that's where we
stopped last time.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.570
And now we apply the
periodicity condition.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:16.230
So we must have e to the ik x
plus L equal to e to the ikx.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.970
If you cancel the e to
the ikx on both sides,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:33.080
you get to e to the ikL must
be equal to 1, which forces kL

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.500
to be a multiple of pi.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.020
That is, kL equal 2 pi n--

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.350
of 2 pi, I'm sorry--

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.015
2 pi n, where n is an integer.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.170
So those are the values of k.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.235
We'll write them
slightly differently.

00:03:02.235 --> 00:03:09.540
We'll write kn with
the subscript n

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.150
to represent the k
determined by the integer n.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:26.900
So it will be 2 pi n over
L. Now from that equation,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.220
for k squared equal
2mE over h squared,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.900
you get e is equal to h
squared k squared over 2m.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.670
And k in these solutions
represents therefore

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.570
the momentum.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.680
That is, the momentum
Pn is h bar kn,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.950
and it's 2 pi h bar n over L.
And the energies associated

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.870
with solutions
with kn value is En

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.070
would be h squared
kn squared, so

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.610
4 pi squared n squared
over L squared over 2m.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.560
So this is equal to 2
pi squared h squared

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.910
n squared over m L squared.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.160
Those are numbers.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.890
It's good to have them.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:49.250
Our solution is psi n of
x is equal to e to the i,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.150
or is proportional
to, e to the i knx.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.950
So far so good.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.520
But we can now
normalize this thing.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.650
This is the beauty
of the problem

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.730
of a particle on a circle.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.140
If you have a particle
in free space,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.290
psi squared is equal to 1
and the integral is infinite.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.150
On the other hand, these
ones are normalizable.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:24.830
That is, we can demand that the
infinite over the circle of psi

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.910
n squared be equal to 1.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.450
So how do we do that?

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.230
Well I'll write it a little
more explicitly here.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:44.420
Psi n of x will be some
constant times e to the iknx.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.110
And therefore this thing
is the integral from 0

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.800
to L dx of the constant squared.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.825
The constant can be
chosen to be real.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.810
N squared times psi
n squared, which is--

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.930
this exponential
squared is just 1.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.950
This is 1.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:14.210
So it just gives you L times
N squared is equal to 1.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:20.510
So N is equal to 1
over square root of L.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:28.125
And finally, our psi n's of
x are 1 over square root of L

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:39.510
e to the iknx or 1 over square
root of L e to the 2 pi inx

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.680
over L. Oops.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.330
All right.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:55.420
So these are our wave functions.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.100
These are our
energy eigenstates.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.010
Our full stationary
states, where we're

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.840
finding stationary states--

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.660
stationary states have a psi
of x times a time dependence.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.790
The time dependence is
e to the minus i e--

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.860
so you could say that
psi n of x and t,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:25.470
the full stationary
state, is psi n of x times

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.840
e to the minus i
e n t over h bar.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.970
And that solves the full
Schrodinger equation.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.470
That's our stationary state.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.520
So one thing that should
be emphasized here

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.830
is the range of the integers.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:52.020
n is an integer and
we better realize

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.570
if there are some exceptions.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.460
Maybe just the positive?

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.780
Is 0 included?

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.390
Is 0 not included?

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.230
And here, it's really
as stated here.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.310
It's all the integers,
n from minus infinity

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.788
to plus infinity.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.118
All of them must be included.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.510
The reason we can
understand that

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:30.880
is that the momentum of each
of these states, the momentum

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.679
is 2 pi h n over
L. And therefore

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:39.299
these are all states
of different momentum.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:44.010
There's no question that
these are different states.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.940
It cannot be that one is
just the same as another one.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.710
They have different momentum.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.660
They represent
the particle going

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.690
with some momentum
around the circle,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.420
and that momentum
is quantified by n

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.760
and it could be in
the positive direction

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.590
or negative direction.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.970
Now you could be suspicious
about n equals 0.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.690
But there's actually nothing
to be suspicious about it.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.250
It's surprising.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:19.920
But psi 0 is 1 over square
root of L, has no x dependence.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.280
And therefore it has 0 energy.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.280
And that's-- I'm sorry, here.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.530
There's some psi missing.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.020
The second derivative
of a constant is 0.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.630
And if e is equal to 0,
that's a consistent solution.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.282
The constant is important.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.630
And now you also
realize that psi,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.610
you have a nice phenomenon,
that psi minus 1 and psi 1,

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:59.620
for example, they correspond
to n equals 1 and minus 1,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.040
have the same energy.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.200
Because energy
depends on n squared,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:17.270
so these are degenerate
states with energy E1

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.330
equal to E minus 1.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:26.240
And so are psi 2
and psi minus 2.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:34.810
And of course just
psi minus k and psi k.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.020
They are degenerate states.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.220
And now this hits
into a property

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.220
that is going to be
important in the future about

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.840
degenerate states.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.520
Whenever somebody gives you a
couple of degenerate states,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.700
you know they have
the same energy.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.970
But you must not stop there.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.700
If they are degenerate states
and there are two states,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.650
it means that they
are not the same.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.490
So there must be something
physical about them

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.190
that distinguishes them.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.550
Whenever you have
degenerate states,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.670
you have to work
until you figure out

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.210
what is different about
one state and the other.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.720
And here we got the answer.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.490
The answer is simply that
they are degenerate states

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.290
with a different momentum.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.820
So the momentum is an
observable that distinguishes

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.030
those degenerate states.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:44.370
In fact, as we've
written here, p on psi n

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:51.946
of x is equal to Pn psi n.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.630
And P n given by this quantity.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.590
OK.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:10.630
Our eigenstates are orthonormal.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.510
They're eigenstates.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.320
So why are they orthonormal?

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.920
They are eigenstates
of a Hermitian operator

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.110
with different eigenvalues.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.270
They're eigenstates of p
with different eigenvalues.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.630
So they're orthonormal.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.110
The argument with the
energy would have not

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.140
worked out so well because there
you have degenerate states.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:39.680
So these two states are
degenerate with respect

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.400
to energy.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.400
So you could wonder, how do
you know they are orthogonal?

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.920
But in this case it's simple.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.680
They have different momentum.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.540
Momentum is a
Hermitian operator,

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.900
and it should be orthogonal.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.970
So the states are orthogonal.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.950
They are complete.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.100
You could write any wave
function of the circle

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.340
as a superposition
of those psi n's.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:16.670
So any psi of x periodic can be
written as psi of x the sum a n

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:25.070
psi n's over all the integers .

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.380
And one last remark.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:34.380
We could have worked
with sines and cosines.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.600
And therefore we
could have worked

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.280
with psi k plus psi minus k.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:52.350
This psi k and psi minus
k have the same energy.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:57.890
Therefore this sum is an energy
eigenstate of that same energy.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.720
The Hamiltonian acting
on psi k gives you

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.730
the energy times psi k.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.550
Here, the same energy
times psi minus k,

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.920
so this is an energy eigenstate.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:19.475
And this is proportional
to cosine of kx.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.440
And this is an energy
eigenstate you know,

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.110
because two
derivatives of a cosine

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.770
will give you back that cosine.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:39.330
Similarly, psi k
minus psi of minus k

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.290
is proportional to sine of kx.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.870
And that's also an
energy eigenstate.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:54.050
Both are energy eigenstates.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:15:00.090
So this is kind of the
way you can reformulate

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.870
Fourier's theorem here.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.650
You could say anything
can be written

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.900
as a superposition of
all the exponentials,

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.300
including the
exponential with n equals

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.270
0, which is just a constant.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.790
Or alternatively,
everything could

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:20.430
be written in terms
of sines and cosines,

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:26.020
which is another way of
doing the Fourier theorem.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:32.140
These are energy eigenstates,
but they're not P eigenstates

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:32.860
anymore.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.320
This, when you take a
derivative, becomes a sine.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.850
When this, you take a
derivative, becomes a cosine.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.460
They're not energy.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.050
They're not momentum
eigenstates.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.430
So you can work with
momentum eigenstates,

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.570
you can work with
energy eigenstates.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.980
It's your choice.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.050
It's probably easier to work
just with momentum, I can say.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.680
So that's it for the
particle in a circle.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.350
We have three problems
to solve today.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.870
Particle in a circle, particle
in a box, and particle

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.350
in a finite well.
