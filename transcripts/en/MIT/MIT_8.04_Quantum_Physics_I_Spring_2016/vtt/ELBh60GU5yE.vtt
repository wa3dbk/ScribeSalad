00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.820
PROFESSOR: Last time, we talked
about the Broglie wavelength.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.090
And our conclusion was,
at the end of the day,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.730
that we could write the
plane wave that corresponded

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.840
to a matter particle, with some
momentum, p, and some energy,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.030
E. So that was our
main result last time,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.890
the final form for the wave.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.250
So we had psi of
x and t that was

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.150
e to the i k x minus i omega t.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.680
And that was the matter
wave with the relations

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.150
that p is equal to h bar k.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.020
So this represents a
particle with momentum,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.200
p, where p is h bar times
this number that appears here,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.810
the wave number,
and with energy,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.310
E, equal to h bar
omega, where omega

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.720
is that number that appears
in the [? term ?] exponential.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.410
Nevertheless, we
were talking, or we

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.700
could talk, about
non-relativistic particles.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.970
And this is our
focus of attention.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.190
And in this case, E is
equal to p squared over 2m.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.400
That formula that expresses
the kinetic energy

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.060
in terms of the momentum, mv.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.880
So this is the wave function
for a free particle.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.730
And the task that
we have today is

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.920
to try to use this insight,
this wave function,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.620
to figure out what
is the equation that

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.380
governs general wave functions.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.740
So, you see, we've been
led to this wave function

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.120
by postulates of the Broglie
and experiments of Davisson,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.850
and Germer, and
others, that prove

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.310
that particles like electrons
have wave properties.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.490
But to put this
on a solid footing

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.630
you need to obtain this
from some equation, that

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.720
will say, OK, if you have
a free particle, what

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.770
are the solutions.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.540
And you should
find this solution.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.770
Perhaps you will
find more solutions.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.390
And you will understand
the problem better.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.340
And finally, if you understand
the problem of free particle,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.330
there is a good chance you
can generalize this and write

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.500
the equation for a
particle that moves

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.300
under the influence
of potentials.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.170
So basically, what
I'm going to do

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.910
by trying to figure out how this
wave emerges from an equation,

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.510
is motivate and
eventually give you,

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.540
by the middle of this lecture,
the Schrodinger equation.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.850
So that's what we're
going to try to do.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.860
And the first thing is
to try to understand

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.630
what kind of equation this
wave function satisfies.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.170
So you want to think of
differential equations

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.640
like wave equations.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.430
Maybe it's some kind
of wave equation.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.200
We'll see it's kind
of a variant of that.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.530
But one thing we
could say, is that you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.720
have this wave function here.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.140
And you wish to know, for
example, what is the momentum.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.820
Well you should look at k, the
number that multiplies the x

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.640
here, and multiply by h bar.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.010
And that would give
you the momentum.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.220
But another way of doing it
would be to do the following.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:15.850
To say, well, h bar over
i d dx of psi of x and t,

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.850
calculate this thing.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.110
Now, if I differentiate
with respect to x,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.120
I get here, i
times k going down.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.300
The i cancels this
i, and I get h bar k.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.320
So, I get h bar k
times the exponential.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.740
And that is equal to the value
of the momentum times the wave.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.350
So here is this wave actually
satisfies a funny equation,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.250
not quite the differential
equation we're looking for yet,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.580
but you can act with a
differential operator.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.790
A derivative is something
of a differential operator.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.660
It operates in functions,
and takes the derivative.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.320
And when it acts on
this wave function,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.910
it gives you the momentum
times the wave function.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.260
And this momentum
here is a number.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.802
Here you have an operator.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.270
An operator just means something
that acts on functions,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.040
and gives you functions.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.080
So taking a derivative of a
function is still a function.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.730
So that's an operator.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.920
So we are left here to
think of this operator

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.420
as the operator that
reveals for you the momentum

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.590
of the free particle, because
acting on the wave function,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.850
it gives you the momentum
times the wave function.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.570
Now it couldn't be that
acting on the wave function

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.620
just gives you the momentum,
because the exponential doesn't

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.770
disappear after the
differential operator acts.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.960
So it's actually
the operator acting

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.860
on the wave function gives you a
number times the wave function.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.200
And that number is the momentum.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.280
So we will call
this operator, given

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.840
that it gives us the momentum,
the momentum operator, so

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.530
momentum operator.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.850
And to distinguish it
from p, we'll put a hat,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:38.440
is defined to be
h bar over i d dx.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:49.220
And therefore, for
our free particle,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.290
you can write what we've
just derived in a brief way,

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.990
writing p hat
acting on psi, where

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.580
this means the
operator acting on psi,

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:11.350
gives you the momentum of this
state times psi of x and t.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.520
And that's a number.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.670
So this is an operator
state, number state.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.680
So we say a few things,
this language that we're

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.780
going to be using all the time.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:34.840
We call this wave function,
this psi, if this is true,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:45.340
this holds, then we
say the psi of x and t

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:57.610
is an eigenstate of
the momentum operator.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:05.480
And that language comes from
matrix algebra, linear algebra,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.360
in which you have a
matrix and a vector.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.520
And when the matrix
on a vector gives you

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.250
a number times the
same vector, we

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.810
say that that vector is an
eigenvector of the matrix.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.600
Here, we call it an eigenstate.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.460
Probably, nobody
would complain if you

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.910
called it an eigenvector,
but eigenstate

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.450
would be more appropriate.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.919
So it's an eigenstate of p.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:44.260
So, in general, if you have an
operator, A, under a function,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:56.040
phi, such that A acting
on phi is alpha phi,

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.750
we say that phi is an
eigenstate of the operator,

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.690
and in fact eigenvalue alpha.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:12.276
So, here is an eigenstate
of p with eigenvalue

00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:18.375
of p, the number p, because
acting on the wave function

00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:21.150
gives you the number p
times that wave function.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.900
Not every wave function
will be an eigenstate.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.930
Just like, when you have a
matrix acting on most vectors,

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.800
a matrix will rotate
the vector and move it

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.970
into something else.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.910
But sometimes, a matrix
acting in a vector

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.510
will give you the same
vector up to a constant,

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.960
and then you've
got an eigenvector.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.140
And here, we have an eigenstate.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:50.220
So another way of
expressing this,

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:56.610
is we say that psi of x
and t, this psi of x and t,

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:04.950
is a state of definite momentum.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.010
It's important terminology,
definite momentum means

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:16.230
that if you measured it, you
would find the momentum p.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.010
And the momentum-- there
would be no uncertainty

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.970
on this measurement.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.040
You measure, and
you always get p.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.300
And that's what,
intuitively, we have,

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.090
because we decided
that this was the wave

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.170
function for a free
particle with momentum, p.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.160
So as long as we
just have that, we

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.600
have that psi is a state
of definite momentum.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.512
This is an interesting statement
that will apply for many things

00:10:48.512 --> 00:10:49.470
as we go in the course.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:54.410
But now let's consider another
aspect of this equation.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.040
So we succeeded with that.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.710
And we can ask if there
is a similar thing

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:04.720
that we can do to figure out
the energy of the particle.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.400
And indeed we can
do the following.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.555
We can do i h bar d dt of psi.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:21.730
And if we have that,
we'll take the derivative.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.810
Now, this time,
we'll have i h bar.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.770
And when we differentiate that
wave function with respect

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:33.740
to time, we get minus i omega
times the wave function.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.230
So i times minus i is 1.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.110
And you get h bar omega psi.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:44.260
Success, that was the energy
of the particle times psi.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.990
And this looks quite
interesting already.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.460
This is a number, again.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:06.710
And this is a time derivative
of the wave function.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:15.580
But we can put more physics into
this, because in a sense, well,

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.700
this differential
equation tells you

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.390
how a wave function
with energy, E,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.540
what the time dependence
of that wave function is.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.690
But that wave function
already, in our case,

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.110
is a wave function
of definite momentum.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.190
So somehow, the information
that is missing there,

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:44.320
is that the energy
is p squared over 2m.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:52.080
So we have that the energy
is p squared over 2m.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:13:00.990
So let's try to think of
the energy as an operator.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.830
And look, you could
say the energy,

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.790
well, this is the energy
operator acting on the function

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.350
gives you the energy.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:15.630
That this true, but it's too
general, not interesting enough

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.680
at this point.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.780
What is really interesting is
that the energy has a formula.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.430
And that's the physics
of the particle,

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.090
the formula for the energy
depends on the momentum.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.970
So we want to capture that.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.340
So let's look what
we're going to do.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.210
We're going to do a
relatively simple thing, which

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.070
we are going to walk back this.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.490
So I'm going to
start with E psi.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:47.940
And I'm going to invent
an operator acting on psi

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.065
that gives you this energy.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:14:01.517
So I'm going to invent an O.

00:14:01.517 --> 00:14:07.050
So how do we do that?

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:15.140
Well, E is equal to p
squared over 2m times psi.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.630
It's a number times psi.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.500
But then you say, oh,
p, but I remember p.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.420
I could write it as an operator.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:30.750
So if I have p times
psi, I could write it

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:44.792
as p over 2m h bar
over i d dx of psi.

00:14:44.792 --> 00:14:50.380
Now please, listen
with lots of attention.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.930
I'm going to do a simple
thing, but it's very easy

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.820
to get confused
with the notation.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.540
If I make a little typo
in what I'm writing

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.480
it can confuse you
for a long time.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.990
So, so far these are numbers.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.100
Number, this is a
number times psi.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.780
But this p times
psi is p hat psi

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.150
which is that operator, there.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.720
So I wrote it this way.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.660
I want to make one more-- yes?

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.610
AUDIENCE: Should that say E psi?

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.550
PROFESSOR: Oh yes,
thank you very much.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.020
Thank you.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:43.985
Now, the question is, can I
move this p close to the psi.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.360
Opinions?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.900
Yes?

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.260
AUDIENCE: Are you asking
if it's just a constant?

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.710
PROFESSOR: Correct,
p is a constant.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.460
p hat is not a constant.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.330
Derivatives are not.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.490
But p at this
moment is a number.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.750
So it doesn't care
about the derivatives.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:07.610
And it goes in.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:16.180
So I'll write it as
1 over 2m h/i d dx,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:22.480
and here, output p psi,
where is that number.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.750
But now, p psi, I can
write it as whatever it is,

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:41.550
which is h/i d dx, and p
psi is again, h/i d dx psi.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.340
So here we go.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.180
We have obtained, and
let me write the equation

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.240
in slightly reversed form.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.780
Minus, because of the two
i's, 1 over 2m, two partials

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:03.660
derivatives is a second order
partial derivative on psi,

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:09.329
h bar squared over
2m d second dx psi.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:13.904
That's the whole right-hand
side, is equal to E psi.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:26.890
So the number E
times psi is this.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:33.732
So we could call this
thing the energy operator.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.090
And this is the energy operator.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:18:03.800
And it has the property that
the energy operator acting

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.620
on this wave function
is, in fact, equal

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.530
to the energy times
the wave function.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:19.970
So this state again is
an energy eigenstate.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.710
Energy operator on the
state is the energy

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.920
times the same state.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:46.110
So psi is an energy eigenstate,
or a state of definite energy,

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.970
or an energy
eigenstate with energy,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:56.100
E. I can make it clear for
you that, in fact, this energy

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.890
operator, as you've
noticed, the only thing

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:07.870
that it is is minus h squared
over 2m d second dx squared.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.850
But where it came
from, it's clear

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:17.420
that it's nothing else but
1 over 2m p hat squared,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:23.210
because p hat is
indeed h/i d dx.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.430
So if you do this computation.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.510
How much is this?

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:32.000
This is A p hat times p
hat, that's p hat squared.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.440
And that's h/i d dx h/i d dx.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.470
X And that gives you the answer.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:49.650
So the energy operator
is p hat squared over 2m.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.110
All right, so actually,
at this moment,

00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:00.970
we do have a Schrodinger
equation, for the first time.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:06.050
If we combine the
top line over there.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:17.050
I h bar d dt of psi
is equal to E psi,

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:23.900
but E psi I will write it
as minus h squared over 2m d

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.530
second dx squared psi.
