00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
PROFESSOR: I've put on the
blackboard here the things

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.460
we were doing last time.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.510
We began our study
of stationary states

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.160
that are not normalizable.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.790
These are scattering states.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.580
Momentum eigenstates
were not normalizable,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.180
but now we have more
interesting states that

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.080
represent the solutions of
the Schrodinger equation, that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.500
are stationary states
with some energy e.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.690
Because they are
not normalizable,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.030
but we cannot directly
interpret any of these solutions

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.880
as the behavior of a particle.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.750
I kind of tell you a story, OK.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.230
So this is-- a particle
is coming, colliding,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.520
doing something.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.310
These are not
normalizable states.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.860
So part of what we're going
to be trying to do today

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.520
is connect to the
picture of wave packets

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.360
and see how this is
used to really calculate

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.050
what would happen if you send
in a particle of potential.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.150
Nevertheless, we
wrote a solution

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.340
that has roughly that
interpretation, at least

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.090
morally speaking.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.640
We think of a wave that is
coming from the left, that's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.410
ae to the ikx.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.420
Now, in order to
have a wave, you

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.970
would have to have
time dependents,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.860
and this is a
stationary solution.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.490
And there is some
time dependents.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.570
There is exponential of e to
the minus iet over h bar, where

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.220
e is the energy.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.100
So this could be
added here to produce

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.280
the full stationary
state psi of x and t.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.160
But we'll leave it understood--
it's a common phase

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.080
factor for both the
solutions of x less than 0,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.910
and x greater than 0, because
the whole solution represents

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.130
a single solution.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.630
It's not like a
solution on the left

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.796
and a solution on the right.

00:02:03.796 --> 00:02:09.270
It's a single solution
over all of x 4 a psi that

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.890
has some definite energy.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.210
So we looked at the
conditions of continuity

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.680
of the wave function
and continuity

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.230
of the derivative of the
wave function, at x equals 0.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.310
Those were two conditions.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.680
And they gave you
this expression

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.450
for the ratios of c
over a and b over a.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.330
We could even imagine, since
we can't normalize this,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.340
setting a equal to 1, And.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.390
Then calculating b and
c from those numbers.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.280
We have two case a k in a k bar.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.360
The k is relevant to the wave
function for x less than 0.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.670
The k bar is relevant
for x greater than 0.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.110
And they have to be different
because this represents

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.660
a DeBroglie wavelength, and
the DeBroglie wavelength

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.050
encodes the momentum
of the particle,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.760
and the momentum of the
particle that we imagine here

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.220
classically is
different here where

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.330
this has this much kinetic
energy, and in the region

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.000
on the right, where
the particle only has

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.370
a much smaller kinetic energy.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.220
So that's represented by k bar.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.700
And k bar, being the
energy proportional

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.100
to the energy minus v 0, while
k squared has just the energy,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.230
it's smaller than k.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.650
So this is what we did.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.230
We essentially
solved the problem,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.480
and this qualifies
as a solution,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.260
but we still haven't learned
anything very interesting

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.610
from it.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.100
We have to understand
more what's going on.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.700
And one thing we can do is
think of a particular limit.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:06.440
The limit, or the case,
when e is equal to v 0,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.410
exactly equal to
b 0, what happens?

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.390
Well, k bar would be equal to 0.

00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:24.600
And if k bar is
equal to 0, you're

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.200
going to have just the
constant c in here.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.200
But if k bar is
equal to 0, first b

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.450
is equal to a, because then it's
k over k, so b is equal to a.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.060
And c is equal to 2a.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.650
And the solution would
become psi of x equals--

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.290
well, a is equal to b.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:07.930
So this is twice a cosine
of kx, when a equal to b

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.335
is a common factor, call it a.

00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:13.490
And this thing is the
sum of two exponentials

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.570
with opposite signs.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.040
That gives you the cosine.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.008
And for c, you have 2a.

00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:25.720
And since k bar is equal
to 0, well, it's just 2a.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.360
It's a number.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.740
This is unnormalizable, but
even the original solution

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.050
is unnormalizable,
so we wouldn't

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.550
worry too much about it.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.850
So how does that
look for x over here?

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.200
You have a cosine
of kx, so it's going

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.420
to be doing this to the left.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.660
That's for x less than 0.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.380
And at this point,
it goes like that.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.620
Just flat side
effects, and here's 2a.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.290
so there's nothing wrong with
the solution in this case.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.680
It's kind of a little strange
that it becomes a constant,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.060
but perfectly OK.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.220
What really helps
you here is to find

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:30.630
some conditions that express
the conservation of probability.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.060
You see, you have a
stationary state solution.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.960
Now, stationary states
are funny states.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.280
They're not static states,
completely static states.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.070
For example, if you have a
loop, and you have a current

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.060
that never changes in time.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.800
This is a stationary condition,
even in electromagnetism.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.280
So what we imagine
here is that we're

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.500
going to have some current,
probability current,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:08.430
that is coming from the
left, and some of it

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.670
maybe bounces back, and
some of it goes forward.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:22.640
But essentially, if you think
of the barrier, whatever--

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.890
you look a little to
the left of the barrier

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.810
and a little to the
right of the barrier.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.300
Whatever is coming in, say,
must be going out there,

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.260
because probability cannot
increase in this region.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.620
It would be like saying that
the particle suddenly requires

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.815
larger and larger
probability to be

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:44.870
in this portion of the graph.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.980
And that can't happen.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.920
So probabilistic
current gives you

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.960
a way to quantify some of the
things that are happening.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:07.020
So probability current
plus j effects,

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:15.180
which was h bar over m,
imaginary part of psi star

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.470
d psi dx.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.160
So let's compute the
probability current.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.820
Let's compute for x less than 0.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.510
What is the probability
current j of x?

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.720
We then call it the probability
current on the left side.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.140
I would have to substitute
the value of the wave function

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.690
for x less than 0, which
is the top line there,

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.610
into this formula.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.200
And see what is the current.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.240
In fact, I believe you've
done that in an exercise

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.860
some time ago.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.470
And as you can
imagine, the current

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:06.040
is proportional to the
modulus of a squared,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.250
the length of a squared,
the length of b squared also

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:10.780
enters.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.940
And the funny thing is,
between those two waves,

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.630
one that is going to the right
and one is going to the left,

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.690
that that's very
visible in the current.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:26.328
This is h bar k over m.

00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:31.620
A squared minus b squared.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.820
It's a short computation, and it
might be an OK and a good idea

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.650
to do it again.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.890
It was done in the homework.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.015
And x greater than 0.

00:09:45.102 --> 00:09:54.100
J right of x would be
equal to h bar k bar.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.510
Now that, you can almost
do it in your head.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.670
This c into the ik bar x.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.470
Look what's happening.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.200
From psi star you get a c star.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.070
From psi you get the c, so
that's going to be a c squared.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.060
The face is going in a
cancel between the one here

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.870
and the one on psi,
but the derivative

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.800
will bring down an ik bar,
and the imaginary part of that

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.120
is just k bar.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.000
So the answer is this.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.470
And these are the two currents.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:37.040
Now, if we are doing
things correctly,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.860
the two currents
should be the same.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.580
Whatever current
exists to the left,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.500
say a positive current that
is coming in, to the right

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.820
must be the same.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.310
Another pleasant thing
is that this current

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.750
doesn't depend on the value
of x, as x is less than 0.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.250
Nor of the value of x
when x is greater than 0.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.080
And that's good
for conservation.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.390
It would be pretty
bad as well, if you

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.770
look at two places
for x less than 0,

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.990
and you find that the
current is not the same.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.860
So where is it accumulating?

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.720
What's going on?

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.670
So the independence
of these things--

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:26.010
from x, this is
constant, and a constant

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.140
is very important, because this
constant should be the same.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:35.110
Now, whether or not about
current conservation,

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.860
it's encoded in
Schrodinger's equation.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.330
And we solved
Schrodinger's equation.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:46.090
That's how we got these
relations between b, a and c

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.990
So it better be that these
two things are the same.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.250
So Jay elsewhere--
jl, for example.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.500
I won't put off x,
because it's just clear.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.522
It doesn't depend on x.

00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:08.900
1 minus b over a
squared a squared.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.850
I'm starting to
manipulate the left one,

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.130
and see if indeed the
currents are the same.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:25.520
And now, I get h bar k over m.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.400
1 minus b over a squared.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.820
I put the modulus squared,
but so far everything

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.740
is real in this--

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.220
k, k bar, b, a, c--

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.430
all real.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.310
Is that right?

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.610
No complex numbers there.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.160
So I don't have to
be that careful.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:51.300
B over a squared is
k minus k bar over k

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:58.880
plus k bar squared a squared.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.320
And I gfit that here, maybe.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.250
H bar k over m.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.020
Now what?

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.540
This is squared,
so the si, squared

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.440
passes here to the numerator
minus the difference squared,

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:23.470
that's going to be
a 4k k bar over k

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:28.775
plus k bar squared a squared.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:39.210
And yes, this seems to
be working quite well.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:45.490
Flip these k's-- these
two k's, flip them around.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:50.530
So the answer for
jl so far is h bar,

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.830
now k bar, because
I flipped that, m,

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.610
and now I would have 4 k
squared over this thing, which

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:08.310
is 2k over k plus k bar
squared of a squared.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:14.230
And this quantity,
if I remember right,

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:21.550
is just c squared, as
you can see from there.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:30.550
So indeed, this is j
right, and it worked out.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.880
This is j right.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:38.640
So j left is equal to j right
by current conservation.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.900
So that's nice.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.240
That's another way
of getting insight

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.900
into these coefficients.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.010
And that kind of
thing that makes you

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.300
feel that there's no
chance you got this wrong.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.690
It all works well.
