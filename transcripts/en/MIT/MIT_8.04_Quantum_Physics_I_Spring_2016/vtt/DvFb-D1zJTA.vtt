00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.990
PROFESSOR: We ask,
is psi of x, 0 real?

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.370
And I told you the answer is no.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.750
And how would I know
that this is not real?

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.240
Well, we can take the
complex conjugate.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.640
And at the end of the
day, this will boil down

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.524
to some property of phi of k.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:30.160
You see, you have an expression
phi of x in terms of phi of k.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.150
So it would not be surprising
that the requirement

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.170
that psi is real means
something about phi of k.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.210
So let's just say, suppose
psi is given by that,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.950
then psi x, 0 star,
the complex conjugate

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:59.330
would be 1 over square root
of 2 pi integral phi of k star

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.930
e to the minus ikx dk.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.550
I conjugated everything in that
equation for psi of x and 0.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.070
Now, you want to compare
this with psi of x and 0

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.480
to see if it's real.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.320
Or let's consider what is the
condition that this be real.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.500
So I want to simplify
here a little more.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.420
So what I'm going to do is
going to change variables,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.760
by changing k to minus k.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.810
If you prefer to go
a little more slowly,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.840
you could say you're
going to change k prime--

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.020
you're going to be a
new k, called k prime,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.550
equals to minus k.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.160
But it's possible
to do it this way.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.600
Now, there's going to
be a couple of changes.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.830
Wherever you see k, you're
now going to see minus k--

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.280
so 1 over 2 pi integral
phi of minus k.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.670
And I'll just put this star
here, not so many parentheses--

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.730
e to the minus ikx becomes ikx.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.630
And the dk will go to minus dk,
but the order of integration,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.640
that was from minus infinity
to plus infinity, would switch.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.580
So those two signs cancel.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.200
So there's a sign from
doing dk to minus dk,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.460
and 1 from the limit
of integration--

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.270
so at the end of the
day, you have dk,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.755
and you still have this--

00:02:50.755 --> 00:02:53.340
minus infinity to infinity.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.420
And you can say, well,
is this equal to--

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:08.340
or what is the condition
of for psi to be real?

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:17.640
Well, is this equal to 1
over 2 pi minus phi of k, e

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.240
to the ikx dk--

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.100
is that-- question mark--
is that equal to it?

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.390
That would mean
that the psi of x, 0

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.810
is real, because this thing
is just psi of x and 0.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.720
So this is a question
mark-- this is a condition.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:53.980
So here you could say, exploring
the reality condition--

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.460
condition-- when
is a psi of x real?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.460
So what must be true
is that these two terms

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.730
must equal each other.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.280
So, in fact, this requires--

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:19.850
reality requires that 1 over
square root of 2 pi integral

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:27.000
from minus infinity
to infinity phi of k

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:39.540
minus phi star of minus k, e
to the ikx dx is equal to 0.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.860
I brought the two
terms to one side.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.210
Both are of the same type--

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.520
they're integrated
against an e to the ikx.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.220
And therefore, we
can combine them,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.540
and that's what must be true
in order for the function

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.560
to be real.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.340
And now you can
say, so what is it?

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.810
What's the answer?

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.685
Well, this integral
should vanish.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.800
Now, this integral
should vanish--

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.290
it should vanish
for all values of k.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.680
So actually, what
you want to conclude

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.440
is that this thing
is identically 0.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.420
AUDIENCE: Excuse me, shouldn't
that be dk and not dx?

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.260
PROFESSOR: Yes, thank you.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.290
Thanks very much.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:48.760
So this property that this whole
integral be equal to 0, you

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.550
were tempted to
conclude that it means

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.810
that this thing is equal to 0.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.640
And that is correct--

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.880
that is a perfectly
legal argument.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:11.070
And it basically-- if you want
to express it more precisely,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.420
you could base it on the
Fourier theorem, again.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:21.240
These two sets of equalities
here are Fourier's theorem.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.100
And look what this is saying--

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.770
this is saying that this
quantity has a 0 Fourier

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.660
transform.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.400
Because how do you do
the Fourier transform

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.830
of a function of k?

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.820
You multiply by e to
the ikx and integrate.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.640
And therefore, this function
has a 0 Fourier transform.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.790
So, but if a function has
a 0 Fourier transform,

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.380
the function must be 0.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.180
Because already this is
0, and the integral is 0--

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.610
0.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.100
So this is absolutely rigorous.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.520
And therefore, you
get the conclusion

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:21.670
that phi of minus k star
must be equal to phi of k,

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.695
and that's the
condition for reality.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:35.340
So if a phi of k satisfies
this property, that psi of x

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.720
will be real, and our phi of k
doesn't satisfy this property,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.690
what do you see
in this property?

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:49.380
Basically, if you have phi that
exists for some value of k,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.640
it should also exist for
the value of minus k.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.890
And in fact, should be
the complex conjugate

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.850
of the other value.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:05.910
But here, you have some phis
of k, and no phis at minus k.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:14.130
So the phi that we wrote above
doesn't satisfy this condition.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.555
And therefore psi is not
real, and it all makes sense.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:32.320
OK, so basically,
if you were plotting

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.299
not the absolute value,
but the real part

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.419
and the imaginary
parts of psi, you

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:44.290
would see some sort
of funny waves.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:49.690
I think if you were plotting
the real part, for example,

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.780
you would see a wave like that.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.710
And if you were plotting
the imaginary part,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.700
you'd presumably see some
other wave like that.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:09.440
And the absolute value,
it's much nicer and simpler.
