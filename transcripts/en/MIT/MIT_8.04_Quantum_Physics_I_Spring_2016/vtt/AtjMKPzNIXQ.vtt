00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
PROFESSOR: Now we
prove the other thing

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.820
that we used in order to
solve the square well.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.050
So this is property number 3.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.420
It's so important that I
think I should do it here.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.000
If a potential is even--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.390
here comes again the
careful statement--

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:39.220
the energy eigenstates can
be chosen to be even or odd

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.050
under x goes to minus x.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.310
So that's analog of the first
sentence in property number 2.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.510
But then comes the
second sentence,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.670
that you can imagine what it is.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:18.650
For 1D potentials the bound
states are either even or odd.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.290
So look again at this freedom.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.970
You have a general
problem-- you're not

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.850
talking bound states.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.850
You have a wave
function that solves

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.980
a problem of a potential of the
symmetric around a mid-point.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.770
Then you find an arbitrary
solution, no need

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.360
to work with that solution.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.010
You can work with a
solution that is even,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.940
and a solution that is odd.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.680
You can always choose
to be even or odd.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.790
But if you have
one-dimensional potential,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.420
there is no such solution
that is neither even nor odd.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.610
You cannot find it.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.060
It will be, automatically,
even or odd--

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.060
which is kind of remarkable.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.700
It's sufficiently subtle that
in the general exam at MIT

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.600
for graduate quantum mechanics,
the professor that invented

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.070
the problem forgot this property
and the problem had to be

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.128
cancelled.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.940
It's a very interesting.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.840
So let's just try to prove it.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.670
So complete proof in this case.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.790
So what is the equation?

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.870
Proof.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.190
What is the equation
we have to solve?

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:03.100
Sine double prime of x,
plus 2M over h squared.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.558
E minus v of x.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.330
Equals 0.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.150
Now, the proof,
actually, is very simple.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.200
I just do it and
I elaborate on it,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.450
because it's possible to get
a little confused about it.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.840
I think it's kind
of interesting.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.310
So here's equation one.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.720
And sine double
prime of x notation

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:55.630
means the second derivative
of psi evaluated at x.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.950
You see, what you want to do
is to show that psi of minus x

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.460
solves the same equation.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.220
Right?

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.840
It's kind of clear.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.680
Well, you sort of put psi of
minus x here, minus x here.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.350
Well, you would do minus x here.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.870
But if the potential is even it
will solve the same equation.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.850
Now, the only
complication here is

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.240
that there are a few X's
in the derivatives here.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.660
But whether there's a
complication or not there's

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.715
two derivatives, so the
[? signs ?] should not matter.

00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:39.590
But I want to make
this a little clearer,

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:49.530
and in order to do that I
will just define phi of x

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.457
to be equal to psi at minus x.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.230
So if you have that,
the derivative of phi--

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.760
with respect to x--

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.310
you must differentiate this
with respect to the argument.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.310
You evaluate at the
argument, and then

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.170
differentiate the argument
with respect to x.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.798
So that leaves you a minus 1.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:31.290
On the second derivative of
phi with respect to x squared--

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.600
at x-- will be yet
another derivative.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.240
So you now get a
second derivative

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.400
evaluated at the thing.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.990
And then differentiate
the thing inside again.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.830
So minus 1 plus another minus 1.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.200
So this is just psi
double prime of x--

00:05:55.284 --> 00:05:56.480
of minus x.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:27.070
Now, evaluate equation
one at minus x.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.342
Well, it would be the second
derivative of psi evaluated

00:06:31.342 --> 00:06:40.150
at minus x, plus 2m h squared,
E minus V of minus x--

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.430
but that's the same as v of x--

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.556
psi at minus x equals 0.

00:06:51.858 --> 00:06:58.180
And then you'll realize
that this thing is just

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.802
the second phi of x.

00:07:03.138 --> 00:07:09.726
[? h squared ?] of x,
plus 2m over h squared,

00:07:09.726 --> 00:07:17.290
e minus v of x,
phi of x equals 0.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.640
So actually you've
proven that phi

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.570
defined this way solved
the same Schrodinger

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.990
equation with the same energy.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.560
So if one is true--

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.500
this thing-- I guess we
could call it [? three ?]

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.800
or [? two. ?]

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:51.890
So you've proven that both
psi of x and phi of x--

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.600
which is equal to
psi of minus x are

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:06.815
solutions of the Schrodinger
equation with the same energy.

00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:16.130
And, therefore, if you
have two solutions--

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:21.680
and now I emphasize this psi
of minus x, and the psi of x.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.450
If you have two
solutions then you

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:31.010
can form the symmetric part of
the wave function, which is 1/2

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.690
psi of x, plus psi of minus x.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:44.710
And the anti-symmetric
part of the wave function,

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:53.260
which would be 1/2 of psi
of x minus psi of minus x.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.610
And notice that by
definition psi s of minus

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.130
x is indeed psi s of x.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.410
It's symmetric.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:07.020
If you change x for minus
x on the left hand side,

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.410
this goes into this,
this goes into that.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.140
So it's unchanged.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.940
Here it's changed by a psi.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:24.750
So psi a of minus x is equal
to psi minus psi a of x.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:30.690
And these two are solutions
with the same energy--

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.470
psi s and psi a.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.970
You see, if you have--

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.100
remember that key
fact-- if you have

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.030
two solutions of the Schrodinger
equation with the same energy,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.680
any linear combination
of them is a solution

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.980
with the same energy.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.410
So we form two
linear combinations

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.140
and they have the same energy.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.960
And, therefore, the
theorem has been proven.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.020
The first part of the theorem--

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.610
the wave functions
that you work with--

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:08.510
can be chosen to be even or odd.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.300
And that's pretty nice.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:18.520
But now we go to the second
part of the statement.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.695
So for one-dimensional
bound states--

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.885
1-D bound states.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.265
Again, there cannot
be two solutions.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.590
So it cannot be that there
are two degenerate solutions.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:49.880
So after all, psi of
x and psi of minus x,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.180
we have two solutions.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.170
This and psi of minus x.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.770
But if you're in a
one-dimensional bound state you

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.870
cannot have two solutions.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.200
So they must be
proportional to each other.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.180
Now, if you started
with a solution--

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.380
I want to say this.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.200
You start with a
solution from there,

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.320
from the beginning
you can assume now--

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.350
because of property two--

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.280
that the solution is real.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.710
[? You can work those ?]
with real solutions.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.050
So in here, I can
assume that psi is real.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.380
Just simpler.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.720
So these two solutions-- that
would be two real solutions--

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.100
would be degenerating energy--

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.960
there's no degeneracy
for bound states.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.990
Therefore, these
two must be the same

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.420
up to a constant, that again--

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.900
because psi is real c--

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.540
is real.

00:12:03.078 --> 00:12:06.510
There cannot be two solutions.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:11.850
Let x goes to minus
x in this equation.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:19.230
So you would get psi of x
equals c of psi of minus x.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.440
But psi of minus x uses
this equation again.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.815
You get c times c psi of x.

00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:35.020
But from comparing
these two sides,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.320
you get that c squared
must be equal to 1.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.000
But c is real.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.560
Therefore, there's
only two solutions.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.280
Two options.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.420
C is equal to plus
1-- in which case--

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.620
psi is even-- automatically.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:05.590
Or c is equal to minus
1 and psi is odd.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.480
You have no option.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.650
You may think that the general
solution of a bound state--

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.770
of a symmetric potential--

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.290
could be arbitrary.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:25.850
But no.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.590
The solutions come out
automatically symmetrical

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.900
or anti-symmetrical.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.520
And that's why-- when
we decided to search

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.360
for all the solutions of
the finite square-- well,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.445
we could divide
it into two cases.

00:13:41.445 --> 00:13:43.880
Let's find the
symmetric solutions

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.980
and the anti-symmetric
solutions.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.280
There is no other solution
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.660
But what if you add a symmetric
to an anti-symmetric solution?

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.400
Don't you get the
general solution?

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.180
Well you cannot add them,
because for bound states they

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.630
are different energies.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.030
And adding two solutions
with different energies

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.266
is pointless.

00:14:05.266 --> 00:14:09.030
It's not a energy
eigenstate anymore.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.290
So a very powerful theorem.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.600
We'll be using it a
lot, and I thought

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.590
you really ought to see it.
