00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.200
PROFESSOR: Let's
look at the magnitude

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.970
squared of those waves that
we've already defined here.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.120
We have two solutions,
one for no potential

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.060
and one for a real potential.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.460
Both are for some
finite range potential.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:28.280
We have phi of x squared is
equal to sine squared of kx.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:39.860
And psi of x squared is equal to
sine squared of kx plus delta.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.750
Even from this information
you can get something.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.740
Think of x plotted here.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.540
Here's x equals 0.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.320
And there's this sine squared.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.425
This wave for phi of x squared.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.590
Suppose you're looking
at some feature--

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.310
a maximum, a minimum--

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.040
of this function.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.220
Suppose the feature happens
when the argument, kx, is

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.050
equal to some number, a0.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.180
Whatever feature-- this
number a0 could be 0,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.180
in which case you're
looking at a minimum,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.200
it could be pi over 2, in
which case you're looking

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.910
at a maximum--

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.550
some feature of sine squared.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.980
Well the same feature
will appear in this case

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.990
when the whole argument
is equal to a0.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.860
So while this one happens
at x equals a0 over k,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.820
here it happens at x still
equals a0 over k minus delta

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.690
over k.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.250
If this is the probability
density associated

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.050
to the solution for
no potential and it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.270
has a maximum here, the
maximum of the true solution--

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:52.410
say, here-- would appear at a
distance equal to delta over k.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.850
Earlier-- so this is like the x,
and this is like the x tilde--

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.170
that feature would appear,
delta over k in that direction.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.540
So this is psi.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.640
This is psi squared.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.300
So we conclude, for example,
that when delta is greater

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.870
than 0, the wave is pulled.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.280
Delta equals 0, the two shapes
are on top of each other.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.240
For delta different from 0,
the wave function is pulled in.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.935
So delta greater than
0, psi is pulled in.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.840
What could we think of this?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.640
The potential is attractive.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.295
It's pulling in
the wave function.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.860
Attractive.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.256
Delta less than 0, the
wave is pushed out.

00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:06.980
It would be in the
other direction,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.930
and the psi is pushed out.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.589
Potential is repulsive.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.670
So a little bit of information
even from the signs

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.480
of this thing.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.075
We want to define one last
thing, and then we'll stop.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.020
It's the concept of
the scattered wave.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.900
What should we call
the scattered wave?

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:49.740
We will define
the scattered wave

00:04:49.740 --> 00:05:02.400
psi s as the extra
piece in the solution--

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:16.390
the psi solution-- that would
vanish without potential.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.940
So we say, you have a psi, but
if you didn't have a potential,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.730
what part of this
psi would survive?

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:42.660
Think of writing the
psi of x as the solution

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.490
without the potential
plus the extra part,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.820
the scattered wave, psi x.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.290
So this is the definition.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.530
The full scattering
solution, the full solution

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.700
when you have a potential,
can be written in a solution

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.930
without the potential
and this scattered thing.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.840
Now, you may remember--

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.920
we just did it a second ago--

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.720
that this original solution
and the psi solution

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.130
have the same incoming wave.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.510
The incoming wave up there is
the same for the psi solution

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.400
as for this one.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.090
So the incoming
waves are the same.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.600
So only the outgoing
waves are different.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.470
And this represents how much
more of an outgoing wave

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.500
you get than from what you
would have gotten with psi.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.690
So this must be
an outgoing wave.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.140
We'll just plug in
the formula here.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:01.710
psi s is equal to psi minus phi.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:09.120
And it's equal to 1 over 2i
e to the ikx plus 2i delta

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.750
minus e to the minus
ikx minus 1 over 2i--

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:24.060
the phi-- into the ikx
minus e to the minus ikx.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.760
So the incoming
waves wee the same.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.230
Indeed, they cancelled.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.290
But the outgoing waves are not.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:38.750
You can factor an e
to the ikx, and you

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:44.400
get e to the 2i delta minus 1.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.970
Which is equal to e
to the ikx e to the i

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:57.410
delta times sine delta.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.160
There we go.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.770
We have the answer for
the scattered wave.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:12.410
It's proportional to sine delta,
which, again, makes sense.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.910
If delta is equal to 0,
there is no scattering.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.970
It's an outgoing
wave and all is good.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:29.480
So I'll write it like this. psi
s is equal to As e to the ikx,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.080
with As equal to e to
the i delta sine delta.
