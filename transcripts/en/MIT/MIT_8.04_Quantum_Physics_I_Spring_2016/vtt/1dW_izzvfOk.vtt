00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.330
PROFESSOR: So, what is the
wave function that we have?

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.280
We must have a wave
function now that

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.190
is symmetric, and built
with e to the k x, kappa x,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.940
and into the minus kappa x.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.270
This is the only possibility.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:22.850
E to the minus of kappa
absolute value of x.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.830
This is psi of x for
x different from 0.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.310
This is-- as you
can quickly see--

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.060
this is e to get minus
kappa x, when x is positive,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.480
A e to the kappa x,
when x is negative.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.060
And, both of them decay.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.690
The first exponential negative
is the standard decaying

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.700
exponential to the right.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.360
The one with
positive-- well, here x

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.130
is negative as you go
all the way to the left.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.590
This one decays case as well.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.260
And, this thing plotted
is a decaying exponential

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.380
with amplitude A, like that.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.820
And, a decaying exponential with
amplitude A, and a singularity

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.020
there, which is what
you would have expected.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.500
So, this seems to be
on the right track--

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.170
it's a continuous wave function.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.470
The wave function cannot
fail to be continuous,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.220
that's a complete disaster to
show that an equation could not

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.850
be satisfied.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.550
So, this is our
discontinuous wave function.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.350
So, at this moment you
really haven't yet used

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.920
the delta function-- the delta
function with intensity alpha

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.720
down.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.360
I should have made a comment
that it's very nice that alpha

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.110
appeared here in the numerator.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.630
If it would have appeared
in the denominator,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.020
I would be telling you that
I think this problem is not

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.740
going to have a solution.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.850
Why?

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.220
Because if it appears
in the numerator,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.090
it means that as the delta
function potential is becoming

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.780
stronger and stronger,
the bound state

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.610
is getting deeper and deeper--

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.240
which is what you would expect.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.110
But, if it would be
in the numerator--

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.370
in the denominator--

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.090
as the potential gets
deeper and deeper,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.130
the boundary is going up.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.270
That makes no sense whatsoever.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.700
So, it's good that
it appeared there,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.050
it's a sign that things are
in reasonable conditions.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.730
So, now we really have to
face the delta function.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.470
And, this is a procedure you
are going to do many times

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.200
in this course.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.940
So, look at it, and
do it again and again

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.430
until you're very
comfortable with it.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.730
It's the issue of discovering
what kind of discontinuity

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.280
you can have with
the delta function.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.740
And, it's a discontinuity
in the derivative,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.050
so let's quantify it.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.211
So, here it is-- we begin
with the Schrodinger equation,

00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:07.710
again.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.330
But, I will write now the
potential term as well.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:27.810
The potential is plus v of x
psi of x equals E psi of x.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.000
And the idea is to
integrate this equation

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.665
from minus epsilon to epsilon.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.830
And, epsilon is supposed to
be a small positive number.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.000
So, you integrate
from minus epsilon

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.440
to epsilon the
differential equation,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.120
and see what it does to you in
the limit as epsilon goes to 0.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.300
That's what we're
going to try to do.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.830
So, what do we get?

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.820
If you integrate this, you
get minus h squared over 2 m.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.790
And now, you have to integrate
the second derivative

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.940
with respect to x, which
is the first derivative,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.550
and therefore this is
the first derivative

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:29.740
at x equal epsilon minus the
first derivative at x equals

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.700
minus epsilon.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.050
This is from the first
term, because you integrate

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.200
d x d second d x squared
psi is the same thing

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:52.630
as d x d d x of d psi
d x between A and B.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.150
And, the integral of a
total derivative is d

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.430
psi d x at B A--

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.440
I think people
write it like this--

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.280
A to B. Evaluate it at the
top, minus the evaluation

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.030
at the bottom.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:18.050
Now, the next term is the
integral of psi times v of x.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.790
So, I'll write it
plus the integral

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:29.515
from minus epsilon to epsilon
d x minus alpha delta of x psi

00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:31.390
of x--

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.830
that's the potential.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.796
Now, we use the delta function.

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:41.490
And, on the right hand
side this will be E times

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:50.970
the integral from minus epsilon
to epsilon of psi of x d x.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.400
So, that's the differential
equation integrated.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.170
And now, we're going
to do two things.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.970
We're going to do some
of these integrals,

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.230
and take the limit
as epsilon goes to 0.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:17.010
So, I'll write this minus
h squared over 2 m limit

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:26.870
as epsilon goes to 0 of d psi
d x at epsilon minus d psi d x

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.660
at minus epsilon plus.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.690
Let's think of this integral.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.690
We can do this integral,
it's a delta function.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.970
So, it picks the value of
the wave function at 0,

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.360
because 0 is inside the
interval of integration.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.480
That's why we integrate it
from minus epsilon to epsilon,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.060
to have the delta
function inside.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.250
So, you get an alpha
out, a psi of 0,

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.900
and that's what
this integral is.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.960
It's independent of
the value of epsilon

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.510
as long as epsilon
is different from 0.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:13.180
So, this gives you
minus alpha psi of 0.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.520
And now, the last
term is an integral

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.830
from minus epsilon to
epsilon of the wave function.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.250
Now, the wave function
is continuous--

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.140
it should be continuous--

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.330
that means it's finite.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.740
And, this integral,
as of any function

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.600
that is not divergent from
minus epsilon to epsilon

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.410
as epsilon goes to 0, is 0.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.175
Any integral of a function
that doesn't diverge

00:07:50.175 --> 00:07:52.800
as the limits of
integration go to 0,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.320
the area under
the function is 0.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.795
So, this is 0--

00:07:56.795 --> 00:07:57.295
the limit.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.640
And this thing goes to
0, so we put a 0 here.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.730
So, at this moment we got
really what we wanted.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.070
I'll write it this way.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:23.960
I'll go here, and I'll say
minus h squared over 2 m,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.722
and what is this?

00:08:27.722 --> 00:08:31.530
This expression says,
calculate the derivative

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:37.059
of the function a little
bit to the right of 0,

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.970
and subtract the derivative
of the function a little bit

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.030
to the left of 0.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:48.150
This is nothing but the
discontinuity in psi prime.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.080
You're evaluating for any
epsilon greater than 0--

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.520
the psi prime a little to
right, a little too the left,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.760
and taking the difference.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:04.100
So, this is what we should call
the discontinuity delta at 0--

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.190
at x equals 0.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:15.900
And, this and this is for
discontinuity of psi prime at x

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:23.130
equals 0 minus alpha
psi of 0 equals 0.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:30.550
And from here, we discover
that delta zero psi prime

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:38.120
is equal to minus 2 m alpha
over h squared psi of 0.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.720
This is the
discontinuity condition

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.475
produced by the delta function.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:59.120
This whole quantity is what
we call delta 0 of psi prime.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:10.280
And, what it says is that
yes, the wave function

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.350
can have a discontinuous
first derivative if the wave

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.140
function doesn't vanish there.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.485
Once the wave function
doesn't vanish at that point,

00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:22.600
the discontinuity
is in fact even

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.575
proportional to the value of
the wave function at that point.

00:10:26.575 --> 00:10:31.320
And, here are the constants
of proportionality.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.580
Now, I don't think it's worth
to memorize this equation

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.460
or anything like that,
because it basically

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.640
can be derived in a few lines.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.110
This may have looked like
an interesting or somewhat

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.450
intricate derivation,
but after you've done

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.340
is a couple of times--
this is something

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.250
you'll do in a minute or so.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.060
And, you just integrate
and find the discontinuity

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.150
in the derivative--
that's a formula there.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:05.920
And, that's a formula
for a potential,

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.410
minus alpha delta of x.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.720
So, if somebody gives you
a different potential,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.650
well, you have to change
the alpha accordingly.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.800
So, let's wrap this up.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.500
So, we go to our case.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.870
Here is our situation.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.880
So, let's apply this.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.980
So, what is the value?

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:31.350
Apply this equation
to our wave function.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.100
So, what is the
derivative at epsilon?

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:41.730
It's minus kappa A E to
the minus kappa epsilon.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.020
That's the derivative of
psi on the positive side.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.380
I differentiated the top
line of this equation

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:55.230
minus the derivative
on the left side--

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.070
this one, the derivative.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:04.960
So, this is kappa A E
to the kappa epsilon--

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.350
no, kappa minus epsilon again.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.750
So, that's the left hand side.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:21.250
The right hand side would be
minus 2 m alpha h squared psi

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.270
at 0.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:27.550
Psi at 0 is A, so
that's what it gives us.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.460
And we should take the
limit as epsilon goes to 0.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:37.020
So, this is going
to 1, both of them.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:43.110
So, the left hand side
is minus 2 kappa A,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:55.100
and the right hand side is
2 m alpha over h squared A.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.480
So, the 2--

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.270
it's also minus, I'm sorry--

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.170
so the 2s cancel,
the A cancels--

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.830
you never should have expected
to determine A unless you tried

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.020
to normalize the wave function.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.260
Solving for energy
eigenstates states will never

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.920
determine A. The Schrodinger
equation is linear,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.150
so A drops out, the
minus 2 drops out,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:27.530
and kappa is equal to
m alpha over h squared.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:35.910
So, that said that's great
because kappa is just

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:40.090
another name for the energy.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.540
So, I have kappa m
alpha over h squared,

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.520
so that's another
name for the energy.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.530
So, let's go to the energy.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:54.870
The energy is h bar
squared kappa minus h bar

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:59.380
squared kappa squared over 2 m.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.980
So, it's minus h bar squared.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:10.480
Kappa squared would be m squared
alpha squared h to the fourth,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.480
and there's a two m.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.920
All these constants.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:23.700
So, final answer.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:35.220
E, the bound state energy is
minus m alpha squared minus m

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.144
alpha squared.

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:43.750
The m cancels it over h
squared minus one half.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:53.020
So, back here the units worked
out, everything is good,

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.756
and the number was
determined as minus one half.

00:14:56.756 --> 00:15:01.850
That's your bound state
energy for this problem.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.450
So, this problem is instructive
because you basically

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.170
learn that in delta functions,
with one delta function

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.580
you get a bound state.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.900
If you have two delta functions,
you may get more bound states--

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.020
three, four-- people
study those problems,

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.880
and you will investigate the
two delta function cases.
