00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.958
PROFESSOR: We start with
the stationary states.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.340
In fact, stationary
states are going

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.550
to keep us quite busy for
probably a couple of weeks.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.780
Because it's a place where you
get the intuition about solving

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.150
Schrodinger's equation.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:37.600
So the stationary states are
simple and useful solutions

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.175
of the Schrodinger equation,
very nice and simple.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:46.450
So what are they by definition?

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.131
Well, we begin
with a definition.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:54.450
And the intuition of a
stationary state will follow.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.200
See the word stationary
is not the same as static.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.250
Stationary is something that
maybe it's kind of moving,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.410
but things don't change.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.280
Static is something
that's just not moving.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.802
Stationary states
have time dependence.

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:18.720
It is very simple,
as we will see.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:31.335
So, your definition
of a stationary state

00:01:31.335 --> 00:01:43.635
has a factorized space
and time dependencies.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.060
So this psi of x and t
is a stationary state.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.860
If you can write it as a
product of a function of time

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.800
times a function of position.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.242
And now, I will try to
be careful about this.

00:02:13.242 --> 00:02:16.540
Wave functions that
have position and time

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.580
will have this
bar at the bottom.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.920
Wave functions that don't
have x will not have it.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.950
If I slip on that,
please let me know.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.915
So this is a stationary
state, but a stationary state

00:02:37.915 --> 00:02:40.512
has factorized space
and time dependencies

00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:43.697
and solves the Schrodinger
equation-- the solution

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:46.000
of Schrodinger's equation.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.290
So what we need to understand is
what this factorized dependence

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.350
tell us for the
Schrodinger equation.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:02.410
So this stationary state
has time dependence.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.020
But the thing that
makes them stationary

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.160
is that if you look
at some observable,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.940
a Hermitian operator,
and you say,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.462
OK, the state has
time dependence,

00:03:14.462 --> 00:03:17.040
so maybe my observable
will have time dependence.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.404
No.

00:03:18.404 --> 00:03:21.790
The observables don't
have time dependence.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.280
That is the nice thing
about stationary states.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:36.349
So, what we call time
independent observables which

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.050
are all observables that
are familiar [INAUDIBLE]--

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.160
Hamiltonian, the
momentum, the precision,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.800
the angular momentum.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:53.563
Time independent observables
have no time dependence.

00:03:58.373 --> 00:04:02.158
And it kind of looks simple
when you write it like that.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:05.581
Time independent means
don't have time dependence.

00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:11.485
But you've seen that d
dt of the expectation

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:19.332
value of x is equal to p
over m, or the sum of p

00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:21.742
over m, the velocity.

00:04:21.742 --> 00:04:24.640
And here it is-- a time
independent observable

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.980
that does have time dependence.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.310
So the observable
is time independent,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.915
but expectation value
have no time dependence

00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:44.020
in their expectation values.

00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:52.610
The time dependence
comes from the state--

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.912
the state, the psi of x
and t have time dependence,

00:04:55.912 --> 00:04:59.790
and sometimes it just
doesn't drop out.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.790
But for stationary states, it
will drop, as you will see.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.664
So, time independent observables
have no time dependence

00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:11.830
in their expectation values.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.720
OK.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.615
So enough of saying things.

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:19.230
And let's just get to them.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.326
So we look at the
Schrodinger equation,

00:05:22.326 --> 00:05:30.060
i h-bar d dt of
psi of x and t is

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.392
equal to h-bar psi of x and t.

00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:41.850
And just to remind, this minus
h squared over 2m d second d x

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.134
squared plus V of x.

00:05:47.134 --> 00:05:54.966
And I will consider states that
have just that at this moment.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.447
Otherwise, it's not so easy
to get time-dependent--

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.430
to get stationary states.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.100
If you have a potential
that has time dependence,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.610
we kind of do the nice thing
that we're going to do.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.420
So we're going to look only at
time independent potentials.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:29.480
So, V of x, like this,
times psi of x and t.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.150
OK.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.090
So what we do next is
to simply substitute

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.424
the value of the wave function
into the differential equation

00:06:38.424 --> 00:06:40.040
and see what we get.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.400
So on the left
hand side, we will

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:50.834
get i h-bar The psi of x goes
out but you have d dt, Now

00:06:50.834 --> 00:06:53.798
a normal derivative of g of t.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:08.000
And now, this factor, H of
psi acts on these two things.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.040
Imagine the function
of time times

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.431
the function of x sitting here.

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:16.200
Well, the function of
time can be moved out.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.758
So the function of time can be
moved across the Hamiltonian

00:07:20.758 --> 00:07:21.674
operator.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:23.752
It doesn't do anything to it.

00:07:23.752 --> 00:07:34.430
So we'll have g of t times
H-hat of the psi of x.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.410
This is H-hat.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:48.420
And because we had
no time dependence

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.390
in the potential,
our assumption,

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.410
this whole thing
is a function of x.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.826
All right.

00:08:01.826 --> 00:08:03.700
Next step.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:10.730
Divide this whole equation
by the total wave function.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.210
Divide by psi.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.850
Well, if you divide by psi,
you cancel the middle psi here,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.500
and you get the 1 over g.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:35.620
So you get i h-bar 1
over g dg dt is equal--

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:41.090
on the right side, you
cancel the g and you get a 1

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:52.002
over psi of x H-hat psi of x.

00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:58.440
And now you look
at this equation.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.171
And this equation is saying
something very strange.

00:09:03.171 --> 00:09:08.460
The left hand side is a
function of time only.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.530
The right hand side is a
function of space only.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:19.953
How can a function of time be
equal to a function of space?

00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:24.060
The only way this can
be is if both are not

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.020
a function of what they
were supposed to be.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.740
They're just numbers.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.671
Any function of time cannot be
equal to a function of space,

00:09:33.671 --> 00:09:34.613
in generality.

00:09:34.613 --> 00:09:36.030
It just doesn't make sense.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.765
So each side must be
equal to a constant,

00:09:39.765 --> 00:09:41.280
and it's the same constant.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.240
So each side, this is
all equal to a constant.

00:09:48.864 --> 00:09:58.530
And we'll call the constant E.
And this E has units of energy.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:11.872
E equal to be a real constant
with units of energy.

00:10:19.808 --> 00:10:22.907
You can see the units
because the Hamiltonian

00:10:22.907 --> 00:10:23.740
has units of energy.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.683
And whatever psi units it has--

00:10:27.683 --> 00:10:31.100
whatever every unit
psi has, they cancel.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.177
Here, whatever units
g has, they cancel.

00:10:35.177 --> 00:10:39.005
And h-bar over time
is units of energy,

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:41.900
like in energies
equal h-bar omega.

00:10:44.635 --> 00:10:46.170
So it has units of energy.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.650
The only thing that you
may be could say, why real.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.700
Quantum mechanics
loves complex numbers.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.590
So why don't we
put the complex E?

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.956
We'll see what trouble
we get if you choose

00:11:00.956 --> 00:11:02.326
something that is complex.

00:11:02.326 --> 00:11:04.100
So here we go.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.597
It's a real quantity
to be-- let's

00:11:06.597 --> 00:11:09.270
do it real for the time being.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.840
And let's solve
the first equation.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:22.390
The left hand side, i h-bar dg
dt is now equal to gE, or E,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:29.180
where E is a number and
g is a function of time

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.330
from where g of p is
equal to constant E

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:39.910
to the minus iEt over h-bar.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:45.070
Let's just check
it works correctly.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.480
It's a first order
differential equation.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.510
Just one function
of integration.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.815
If you guess the answer,
must be the answer.

00:11:52.815 --> 00:11:58.070
And that's the time dependence
of a stationary state.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:08.310
It's exponential
minus iEt over h-bar.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.620
What about the other equation?

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:22.200
The other equation has become
H psi of x equals E psi of x.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:28.402
Or, we should write at least
once, minus h squared over 2m--

00:12:28.402 --> 00:12:30.266
did I make a mistake?

00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:35.370
No, I didn't-- d
second dx squared--

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.220
I got this normal
derivatives here

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.760
because this is just
a function of x--

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:47.995
plus V of x psi is
equal to E psi of x.

00:12:47.995 --> 00:12:52.712
This is the same equation
that I'm boxing twice,

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:55.110
because it's written
in those two ways.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.200
And both ways are
very important.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.090
And this is part of solving
for stationary state.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.256
You've solved for g of t.

00:13:06.256 --> 00:13:10.950
The time dependence
was easy to solve for,

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.842
but the x dependence is
complicated, in general.

00:13:13.842 --> 00:13:15.410
There, you have to do some work.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.740
You have to solve a
differential equation.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.440
It's not that easy.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.250
So many people-- most people--

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:30.672
call this the time independent
Schrodinger equation.

00:13:45.642 --> 00:13:48.890
So that's the time independent
Schrodinger equation,

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.590
where H psi equal E psi.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.310
And as you can imagine, solving
this differential equation can

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.080
be challenging, or
sometimes very interesting

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.297
because it may be that, as
far as the first equation

00:14:04.297 --> 00:14:06.263
is concerned, of
what we did here,

00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:09.161
we don't know what
this number E is.

00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:13.374
But it may be that the
only reasonable solutions

00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:18.192
that this equation has
are for some values of E.

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:21.560
The analogy with
matrices should tell you

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.180
that's probably what's
going to happen.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:29.235
Because you remember eigenstates
and eigenvalues of matrices

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:30.635
are peculiar numbers.

00:14:30.635 --> 00:14:35.000
If you have a matrix,
they're peculiar eigenvalues.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.940
So this equation is an
eigenfunction equation.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.960
And it's possible that
it has the solution

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.908
for some particular
values of the energy.

00:14:46.908 --> 00:14:50.340
Let me write the
whole solution then.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.400
If you've solved
these two things,

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.410
the whole solution
psi of x and t

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:05.450
is now a constant
times psi of x times

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:12.620
e to the minus iEt over
h-bar, where this psi of x

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.390
solves this equation.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.505
So this is the stationary state.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.980
How about normalizing
the stationary state?

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.230
Can we do that?

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.300
Well, if we try
to normalize it--

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:46.100
psi star of x and t
and psi of x and t dx,

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.560
and you set this equal to 1.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.675
This should be the
case, because this

00:15:51.675 --> 00:15:55.410
should be interesting solutions
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.364
We expect that we could
do particles with them.

00:15:59.364 --> 00:16:04.818
And we can start wave packets
or peculiar states with them.

00:16:04.818 --> 00:16:07.730
And let's see what we get here.

00:16:10.682 --> 00:16:13.142
Maybe I should know.

00:16:13.142 --> 00:16:15.610
I'm really [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:21.405
I'm going to erase
that constant C here.

00:16:21.405 --> 00:16:24.982
Since we want to
normalize this, we

00:16:24.982 --> 00:16:28.840
will think of this as
a normalization of psi.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.837
When we try to
normalize psi, we'll

00:16:31.837 --> 00:16:35.813
be normalizing middle
psi, as you will see here.

00:16:35.813 --> 00:16:38.298
There's no need to put
that constant there.

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:39.789
So what do we get here?

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:44.759
We get integral dx
psi star of x and t,

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:47.910
so you have psi of x star.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:56.242
And now you could say it's
E to the iEt over h-bar.

00:16:56.242 --> 00:16:59.090
That's the complex conjugate.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.820
Now, on the other
hand, suppose--

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.535
I'll do this this way.

00:17:04.535 --> 00:17:08.805
[INAUDIBLE] of
this other term is

00:17:08.805 --> 00:17:14.935
psi of x into the
minus iEt over h-bar.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.725
And now the good
thing about this, you

00:17:21.725 --> 00:17:28.811
see this integral should be
normalized to 1 to make sense.

00:17:28.811 --> 00:17:36.430
And it's a great thing that
the time dependence drops out.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:41.114
And it would not have dropped
out if the energy had not

00:17:41.114 --> 00:17:42.783
been real.

00:17:42.783 --> 00:17:45.440
If the energy was
not real, I would

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.300
have had to put here E start.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.180
And here I would have
had E star minus E

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.060
and some function of time.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.660
And how can a function
of time be equal to 1?

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.180
Would be a problem.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.720
We would not be able to
normalize this wave function.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.165
So E must be real
because otherwise we

00:18:07.165 --> 00:18:11.500
don't cancel this time
dependence, which happily,

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.920
when it cancels,
it just tells you

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:21.180
that the integral dx of
psi star of x psi of x

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:29.780
must be 1, which is
a very nice thing.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:34.180
So in a stationary state,
the normalization condition

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.010
for a full time dependent
stationary state

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.416
is that the spacial
part is normalized.
