00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.270
BARTON ZWIEBACH: We want to
understand now our observables.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.510
So we said these
are observables,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.940
so can we observe them?

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.210
Can we have a state in which we
say, what is the value of Lx,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.990
the value of Ly,
and the value of Lz.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.280
Well, a little
caution is necessary

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.540
because we have states and
we have position and momentum

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.610
operator and they didn't
commute and we ended up

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.210
that we could not
tell simultaneously

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.450
the position and the
momentum of a state.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.950
So for this angular momentum
operators, they don't commute,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.900
so a similar situation
may be happening.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.890
So I want to explain,
for example, or ask,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:15.550
can we have simultaneous
eigenstates of Lx, Ly, and Lz?

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.785
And the answer is no.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.880
And let's see why that happens.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.440
So let's assume we can have
simultaneous eigenstates

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.740
and let's assume, for example,
that Lx on that eigenstate phi

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.380
nought is some number
lambda x phi nought,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.411
and Ly and phi nought is
equal to lambda y phi nought.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.949
Well, the difficulty with
this is essentially--

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:16.160
well, we could even say
that Lz on phi nought

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.470
is equal to lambda z phi nought.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.816
So what is the complication?

00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:24.940
The complication are
those commutators.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.600
If you do Lx, Ly and
phi nought, you're

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.690
supposed to get i h-bar
Lz and phi nought.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.680
And therefore, you're
supposed to get i h-bar lambda

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.970
z times phi nought, because it's
supposed to be an eigenstate.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.170
But how about the
left hand side?

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.950
The left hand side is LxLy
and phi nought minus LyLx

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.840
and phi nought.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.970
When Ly acts, it produces a
lambda y, but then phi nought,

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.020
and then when Lx acts,
it produces a lambda x,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:21.580
so this produces lambda x lambda
y phi nought minus lambda y

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.900
lambda x phi nought,
which is the same thing,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.855
so the left hand side is 0.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.170
0 is equal to lambda z
phi nought, so you get a--

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.220
lambda z must be 0.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:51.230
If you have a non-trivial
state, lambda z should be 0.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.382
By the other commutators--

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.970
this can be attained or
applied to phi nought--

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.560
would be 0 again, because
each term produces a number

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.940
and the order doesn't matter.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.140
But then it would show
that lambda x is 0,

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.410
and this will show
that lambda y is 0.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.740
So at the end of the day,
if these three things hold,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.200
then all of them are 0.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.660
Lambda x equals lambda y
equals lambda z equals 0.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.620
So you can have something
that is killed by all

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.920
of the operators, but you cannot
have a non-trivial state with

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.510
non-trivial eigenvalues
of these things.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.050
So we cannot have--

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.425
we cannot tell what is Lx on
this state and Ly on this state

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:56.170
simultaneously.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.520
Any of those two is too much.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.645
So if we can't tell
that, what can we tell?

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.770
So what is the most we
can tell about this state

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.670
Is our question now.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.460
We can tell maybe what
is its value of Lx,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.760
but then Ly and Lz
are undetermined.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.370
Or we can tell
what is Lz and then

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.670
Lx and Ly are undetermined,
incalculable, impossible

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.110
in principle to calculate them.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:41.800
So let's see what we
can do, and the answer

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.860
comes from a rather
surprising thing, the fact

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:58.620
that if you think about what
could commute with Lx, Ly, Lz,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.260
it should be a rotationally
invariant thing, because Lx,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.040
Ly, and Lz do rotations.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.680
So the only thing
that could possibly

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.230
commute with this
thing is something

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.760
that is rotationally invariant.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:28.370
The thing that could work out
is some thing that is invariant

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.520
and there are rotations.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.470
Now we said, for example,
the magnitude of the vector R

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.360
is invariant under rotation.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.120
You rotate the vector,
the demanded is invariant.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.080
So we can try the
operator L squared,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.570
which is proportionate
to the magnitude squared,

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:58.050
so we define it to be
LxLx plus LyLy plus LzLz.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:11.910
And we tried, we tried to see
if maybe Lx commutes with L

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:12.410
squared.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.620
Remember, we had a role for L
squared in this differential

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.480
operator that had the
Laplacian, the angular part

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.100
of the Laplacian was
our role for L squared,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.050
so L squared is
starting to come back.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.060
So let's see here--

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.370
this is Lx-- now, I'll
write the whole thing--

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.395
LxLx plus LyLy plus LzLz.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.320
Now, Lx and Lx
commute, so I don't

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.370
have to bother with
this thing, that's 0.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.300
But the other ones
don't commute.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.000
So let's do the
distributive law.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:16.510
So this would be an Lx,
Ly Ly plus Ly Lx, Ly--

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.090
this is from the first--

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:29.980
plus Lx, Lz Lz plus Lz Lx, Lz.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.250
You know, if you don't put these
operators in the right order,

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.270
you don't get the right answer.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.990
So I think I did.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.970
Yes.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.799
It's correct.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:48.760
Now you use the commutators
and hope for the best.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.370
So Lx, Ly is i h-bar LzLy.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.120
Lx, Ly is plus i h-bar LyLz.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.210
So far, no signs of
canceling, these two things

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.520
are very different
from each other.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.830
They don't even appear
with a minus sign,

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:15.300
so this is not a commutator,
but anyway, what is this?

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.580
Lx with Lz.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.920
Well, you should always
think cyclically.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:29.740
Lz with Lx is i h-bar, so this
would be minus i h-bar LyLz,

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:35.560
and this is again Lz with Lx
would have been i h-bar Ly,

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:44.240
so this is minus i h-bar
LzLy, and it better cancel--

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.980
yes.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:51.680
This term cancels with the first
and this term cancels with this

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.420
and you get 0.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:00.020
That's an incredible
relief, because now you

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.970
have a second operator that
is measurable simultaneously.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:11.690
You can get eigenstates that are
eigenstates of one of the L's--

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.790
for example, Lx and L
squared, because they commute,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.610
and you won't have the
problems you have there.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:28.430
In fact, it's a general theorem
of linear algebra that--

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.680
we'll see a little bit of
that in this course and you'll

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.040
see it more completely in 805--

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.280
that if you have two Hermitian
operators that commute,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.700
you can find a simultaneous
eigenstates of both operators.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.460
I mean, eigenstates that
are eigenstates of 1,

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.580
and eigenstates of the second.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.680
Simultaneous eigenstates
are possible.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:06.520
So we can find simultaneous
eigenstates of these operators,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.500
and in fact, you could find
simultaneous eigenstates of Lx

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.670
and L squared, but given
the simplicity of all this,

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:22.220
it also means that Ly
commutes with L squared,

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:28.000
and that Lz also
commutes with L squared.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.280
So you have a choice--

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.200
you can choose Lx,
Ly, or Lz and L

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.300
squared and try to form
simultaneous eigenstates

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.750
from all these operators.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.710
Two of them.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.640
Let's study those operators
as differential operators

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.960
a little bit.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:56.295
So x, y, and z are your
spherical coordinates

00:11:56.295 --> 00:12:05.480
and they are r sin theta
cos phi, r sin theta sin

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.752
phi, and r cos theta.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.890
We're trying to calculate
the differential

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.500
operators associated
with angular momentum

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.160
using spherical coordinates.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.920
So r is x squared plus y
squared plus z squared.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:35.890
Theta is cosine minus 1 of z
over r and 5 is tan minus 1 y

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.680
over z.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:44.910
And there's something very
nice about one angular momentum

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.820
operator in spherical
coordinates,

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.480
there is only one angular
momentum that is very simple--

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.580
its rotations about z.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.970
Rotations about z
don't change the angle

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:07.550
theta of spherical coordinates,
just change the angle phi.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.630
r doesn't change.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:14.060
The other rotation, the rotation
about x messes up phi and theta

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.400
and all the others
are complicated,

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:25.120
so maybe we can have some luck
and understand what is d/d-phi,

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.600
the d/d-phi operator.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:42.040
Well, the d/d-phi operator
is d/dy dy/d-phi plus d/dx

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.290
dx/d-phi--

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.190
the rules of chain rule
for partial derivatives--

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.410
plus d/dz dz/d-phi.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.790
But z doesn't depend on phi.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:14.110
On the other hand,
dy/d-phi is what?

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.355
dy/d-phi, this becomes
a cos phi-- it's x.

00:14:21.762 --> 00:14:25.540
X d/dy.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.480
And dx/d-phi is minus y.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.165
And you say, wow,
x d/dy is like x

00:14:36.165 --> 00:14:43.380
py minus y px, that's a z
component of angular momentum!

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:56.580
So indeed, Lz, which is h-bar
over i x d/dy minus y d/dx,

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.680
h-bar over i is
because of the p's--

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.610
x py minus y px.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.600
And this thing is d/d-phi,
so Lz, we discover,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.185
is just h-bar over i d/d-phi.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.840
A very nice equation
that tells you

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.690
that the angular momentum
in the z direction

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:26.500
is associated with its operator.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:34.300
So I have left us exercises to
calculate the other operators

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:43.150
that are more messy, and
to calculate Lx Ly as well

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.425
in terms of d/d-theta's
and d/d-phi's.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.750
And as you remember, angular
momentum has units of h-bar

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.690
and angles have no units,
so the units are good

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.340
and we should find that.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.140
So that calculation is
left as an exercise,

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:12.760
but now you probably could
believe that L squared,

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:25.210
which is LxLx plus LyLy plus
LzLz is really minus h squared

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:31.250
1 over sin theta d/d-theta.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.860
No, it's-- not 1
over sin theta--

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.330
uh, yep.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.470
1 sin theta d/d-theta--

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:52.760
sin theta d/d-theta plus 1 over
sin squared theta d second d

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.410
phi squared.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:17:00.290
So the claim that they had
relating the angular momentum

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:05.970
operator to the
Laplacian is true.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.530
But, you know, you
now see the beginning

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.520
of how you calculate
these things,

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:17.950
but it will be a simple and
nice exercise for you to do it.
