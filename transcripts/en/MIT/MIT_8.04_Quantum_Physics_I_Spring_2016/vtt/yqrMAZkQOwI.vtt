00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.410
PROFESSOR: E less than v0.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:11.650
So you have an incident
wave, e to the ikx, incident,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.240
and a reflected wave that you
have, e to the minus ikx--

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:27.840
remember minus the other face--
and e to the 2i delta of E.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.880
So this is the incident wave,
and this is the reflected wave.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.690
They correspond to
your Ae to the ikx

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.230
plus Be to the minus ikx.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.410
Remember, when the
energy was less than v0,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.870
the range of B over A was
minus e to the 2i delta.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.680
And since I take A equals
1, you get this thing.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.830
So suppose I construct a psi
incident of x less than 0

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:15.085
and t as the sum 0 to infinity
dk f of k e to the ikx

00:01:15.085 --> 00:01:19.394
e to the minus iEt over h bar.

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:20.690
Whew.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.640
So I superimpose the
incident thing here.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.964
Then the reflected one
should be superimposed too

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:33.895
and would be 0 to
infinity, a minus in front

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:43.431
because there's a minus, dk
f of k e to the minus ikx

00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:52.342
e to the 2i delta of E e to
the minus iEt over h bar.

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:52.842
Whew.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.890
That's the reflected
wave superimposed.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.120
So now you've
constructed everything.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.230
Here the reflected wave
is more interesting

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.630
than the transmitted
wave, because there's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.699
no real big transmitted wave.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.919
It just whistles out.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.960
But the reflective
thing is interesting.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.660
If you're doing the experiment,
you send in a particle,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.677
you want to see
what you get back.

00:02:17.677 --> 00:02:19.635
That's going to tell you
what kind of potential

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:23.960
you can expect it encountered.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.520
So let's do the stationary
phase for this one,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.570
for the reflected.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.260
Let's see how it moves.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.670
We know how the incident moves.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.060
The incident moves
with x equals--

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.860
we've done it
there-- hk0 over m t.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.450
But how about this one?

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:53.820
Well, this one you would
have to do d dk of minus kx

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:03.990
plus 2 delta of E minus Et over
h bar, all that at k0 equals 0.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.140
And you'll probably
remember that this thing

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.590
was in your midterm
and your first test.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.590
You had this wave, and
you had to analyze,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.820
what did stationary phase do?

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.570
And it does that.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.715
So what do you get?

00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:28.110
Well, when you take
the derivative,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.110
you have to take the derivative
of delta with respect

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.610
to energy, that's delta prime,
and then derivative of energy

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.980
with respect to t.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.440
Let me save you a little time.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:50.610
The answer is minus h bar
k0 m t minus 2h bar delta

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.160
prime of E. OK.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.670
That's what you get.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.850
That's how this packet moves.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.970
And what does it do really?

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.890
Remember, this is defined
for x less than 0.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.420
So this is valid--

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.920
forget about this
little term here--

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.890
this is valid for t positive.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.200
For t positive, you're going
to get this to satisfy.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.980
So this is a big wave
packet for t positive.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.470
It's the reflected wave.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.750
That's what you would expect.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.880
This is the reflected.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.630
Now, if this factor
was not here,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.085
it is as if, well, the incoming
packet hit the origin at t

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:46.550
equals 0.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.340
And this will be perfect
bouncing in which

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.380
the packet gets reflected.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.520
And at t equals 0, it
starts to move to the left.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.970
And as t increases, it's moved
more and more to the left.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.420
You see it there, because
x must be negative.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.080
But if there is
this term, it really

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.750
doesn't start to
move to the left

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.870
until t is bigger than
that so that x is negative.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.720
So only at t equal to
this amount of time

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.950
the packet reflects.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.660
So there's a delay,
and the delay

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.240
is 2h bar delta prime of E.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.420
So this is a
technology people use

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.690
in scattering theory to figure
out what kind of potential

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.500
you have, figure out
how much things get

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.840
delayed from the bouncing.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.870
Now, this derivative-- we've
plotted it there-- delta

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.090
prime of E. You get a
big delay for low energy,

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.000
for energies near v0, and in
the middle it's not so big.
