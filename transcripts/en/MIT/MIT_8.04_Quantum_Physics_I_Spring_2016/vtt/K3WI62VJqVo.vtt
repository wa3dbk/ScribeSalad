00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.920
PROFESSOR: So here comes the
point that this quite fabulous

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.180
about Hermitian operators.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.700
Here is the thing that it
really should impress you.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.880
It's the fact that any,
all Hermitian operators

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.335
have as many eigenfunctions and
eigenvalues as you can possibly

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:33.470
need, whatever that means.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.720
But they're rich.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.020
It's a lot of those states.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:49.300
What it really means is that the
set of eigenfunctions for any

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.270
Hermitian operator--
whatever Hermitian operator,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.300
it's not just for some
especially nice ones--

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.130
for all of them you
get eigenfunctions.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.490
And these eigenfunctions,
because it has vectors,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.230
they are enough to span
the space of states.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.130
That is any state can be
written as a superposition

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.940
of those eigenvectors.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.120
There's enough.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.270
If you're thinking finite
dimensional vector spaces,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.060
if you're looking at
the Hermitian matrix,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.120
the eigenvectors
will provide you

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.120
a basis for the vector space.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.340
You can understand anything
in terms of eigenvectors.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.870
It is such an important theorem.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.330
It's called the spectral
theorem in mathematics.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.870
And it's discussed in
lots of detail in 805.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.480
Because there's
a minor subtlety.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.190
We can get the whole
idea about it here.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.750
But there are a couple
of complications

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.940
that mathematicians
have to iron out.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.100
So basically let's
state we really

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.370
need, which is the following.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:26.581
Consider the collection of
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues

00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:34.130
of the Hermitian operator q.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:43.380
And then I go and say, well,
q psi 1 equal q 1 psi 1 q psi

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.620
2 equal q2 psi 2.

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:54.620
And I actually don't
specify if it's

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.500
a finite set or an infinite set.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.090
The infinite set, of course,
is a tiny bit more complicated.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.282
But the result is true as well.

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:07.350
And we can work with it.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.590
So that is the set up.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.005
And here comes the claim.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:32.470
Claim 3, the
eigenfunctions can be

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:46.290
organized to satisfy the
following relation, integral dx

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:55.870
psi i of x psi j of x
is equal to delta ij.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.830
And this is called
orthonormality.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.825
Let's see what this all means.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.890
We have a collection
of eigenfunctions.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.110
And here it says
something quite nice.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.610
These functions are like
orthonormal functions,

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.900
which is to say each
function has unit norm.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.430
You see, if you
take i equal to j,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.470
suppose you take psi 1 psi 1,
you get delta 1 1, which is 1.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.140
Remember the [INAUDIBLE] for
delta is 1 from the [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.020
are the same.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.600
And it's 0 otherwise.
psi 1 the norm of psi 1

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.660
is 1 and [INAUDIBLE]
squared [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.090
psi 1, psi 2, psi3, all of
them are well normalized.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.220
So they satisfied this thing
we wanted them to satisfy.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.500
Those are good states.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.020
psi 1, psi 2, psi 3,
those are good states.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.840
They are all normalized.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.410
But even more, any two
different ones are orthonormal.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.470
This is like the 3
basis vectors of r3.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.880
The x basic unit vector, the y
unit vector, the z unit vector,

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.880
each one has length 1, and
they're all orthonormal.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.840
And when are two
functions orthonormal?

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.900
You say, well, when vectors are
orthonormal I know what I mean.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.870
But orthonormality for functions
means doing this integral.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.840
This measures how different one
function is from another one.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.890
Because if you have
the same function,

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.935
this integral and this
positive, and this all adds up.

00:06:06.935 --> 00:06:10.030
But for different
functions, this

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.290
is a measure of the inner
product between two functions.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.300
You see, you have the dot
product between two vectors.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.675
The dot product of two functions
is an integral like that.

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:29.130
It's the only thing
that makes sense

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.130
So I want to prove
one part of this,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.030
which is a part that is doable
with elementary methods.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:44.450
And the other part is a
little more complicated.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.620
So let's do this.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:59.400
And consider the case if
qi is different from qj,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.460
I claim i can prove
this property.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.250
We can prove this
orthonormality.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:17.320
So start with the integral
dx of psi i star q psi j.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.460
Well, q out here at psi j is qj.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:38.230
So this is integral dx
psi i star qj psi j.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:44.772
And therefore, it's equal to qj
times integral psi i star psi

00:07:44.772 --> 00:07:46.100
j.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:53.880
I simplified this by
just enervating it.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.310
Because psi i and psi
j are eigenstates of q.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.760
Now, the other thing I
can do is use the property

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.890
that q is Hermitant and move
the q to act on this function.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:18.270
So this is equal to integral
dx q i psi i star psi j.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.390
And now I can keep
simplifying as well.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.420
And I have dx.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:33.081
And then I have the complex
conjugate of qi psi i psi i,

00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:37.970
like this, psi j.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.490
And now, remember q is an
eigenvalue for Hermitian

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.570
operator.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.320
We already know it's real.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.890
So q goes out of the
integral as a number.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.080
Because it's real,
and it's not changed.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.100
Integral dx psi i star psi j.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.600
The end result is that we've
shown that this quantity is

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.251
equal to this second quantity.

00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:10.030
And therefore moving this--

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.850
since the integral is the same
in both quantities, this shows

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:21.900
that q i minus qj, subtracting
these two equations,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:31.530
or just moving one to one side,
integral psi i star psi j dx

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.550
is equal to 0.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.350
So look what you've proven
by using Hermiticity,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.410
that the difference
between the eigenvalues

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:47.520
times the overlap between
psi i and psi j must be 0.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.800
But we started
with the assumption

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.970
that the eigenvalues
are different.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.780
And if the eigenvalues are
different, this is non-zero.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.810
And the only possibility
is that this integral is 0.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.190
So this implies
since we've assumed

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:08.310
that qi is different than qj.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:17.740
We've proven that psi i
star psi j dx is equal to 0.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.960
And that's part of
this little theorem.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.740
That the eigenfunctions
can be organized

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.580
to have orthonormality
and orthonormality

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.510
between the different points.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.980
My proof is good.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.470
But it's not perfect.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.750
Because it ignores one
possible complication,

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:47.580
which is that here we wrote the
list of all the eigenfunctions.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.550
But sometimes something
very interesting

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.770
happens in quantum mechanics.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.490
It's called degeneracy.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.710
And degeneracy
means that there may

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:05.220
be several eigenfunctions
that are different but have

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.766
the same eigenvalue.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.210
We're going to find that soon--

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.220
we're going to find,
for example, states

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.880
of a particle that move in
a circle that are different

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.260
and have the same energy.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.560
For example, a particle moving
in a circle with this velocity

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.530
and a particle moving in a
circle with the same magnitude

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.440
of the velocity in
the other direction

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.250
are two states that
are different but have

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.040
the same energy eigenvalue.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.440
So it's possible that this
list not all are different.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.050
So suppose you have like three
or four degenerate states,

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.420
say three degenerate states.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.930
They all have the
same eigenvalue.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.330
But they are different.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.070
Are they orthonormal or not?

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:06.046
The answer is-- actually
the clue is there.

00:12:06.046 --> 00:12:11.940
The eigenfunctions can
be organized to satisfy.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.340
It would be wrong if you say
the eigenfunctions satisfy.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.260
They can be
organized to satisfy.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:25.620
It means that, yes, those ones
that have different eigenvalues

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.063
are automatically orthonormal.

00:12:28.063 --> 00:12:32.130
But those that have
the same eigenvalues,

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.440
you may have three
of them maybe,

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.990
they may not necessarily
be orthonormal.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:43.490
But you can do linear
transformations of them

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:48.010
and form linear combinations
such that they are orthonormal.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.070
So the interesting
part of this theorem,

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.070
which is the more difficult
part mathematically,

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.370
is to show that when
you have degeneracies

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.750
this still can be done.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:06.100
And there's still enough
eigenvectors to span the space.
