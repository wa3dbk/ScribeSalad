00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.170
PROFESSOR: I'll begin
by reviewing quickly

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.460
what we did last time.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.350
We considered what are called
finite range potentials,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.330
in which over a distance
R, in the x-axis,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.830
there's a non-zero potential.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:29.430
So the potential is some v of x
for x between capital R and 0,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.310
is equal to 0 for x
larger than capital R,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.270
and it's infinity
for x negative.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.170
So there's a wall at x equals 0.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.900
And there can be some
potential, but this

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.740
is called a finite range
potential, because nothing

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.940
happens after distance R.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.580
As usual, we considered
scattering solutions, solutions

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.320
that are unnormalizable
with energies,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.300
h squared k squared over 2m,
for a particle with mass m.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:20.030
And if we had no potential,
we wrote the solution phi

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.420
of x, the wave function,
which was sine of kx.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.880
And we also wrote it
as a superposition

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.250
of an incoming wave.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.070
Now, an incoming
wave in this set up

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.660
is a wave that propagates
from plus infinity towards 0.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.400
And a reflected wave is
a wave that bounces back

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.300
and propagates towards
more positive x.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.080
So here we'll
write this as minus

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:00.980
e to the minus ikx over 2i,
plus e to the ikx over 2i.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.440
This is the sine
function rewritten

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.990
in terms of exponential
in such a way that

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.960
here is the incoming wave.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.480
Remember the time dependence
is minus iet over h bar.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.470
So this wave
combined with a time

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.570
is a wave that is moving
towards the origin.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.500
This wave is moving outwards.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.940
Then we said that there would
be, in general, with potential.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.680
With a potential, you would
have a solution psi effects,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.620
which we wrote after some
tinkering in the farm

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.905
i delta sine of kx plus delta.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.660
And if you look at the
part of the phase that

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.150
has the minus ikx would have a
minus delta and a delta here.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.350
So they would cancel.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:17.390
So this solution has
the same incoming wave

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.960
as the no potential solution.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.420
On the other hand here, you
would have e to the 2i delta,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.750
e to the ikx over
2i, and this solution

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.910
is only valid for x
greater than R. You see,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.120
this is just a plane
wave after all.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.320
There's nothing more than a
plane wave and a phase shift.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.230
The phase shift,
of course, doesn't

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.920
make the solution any more
complicated or subtle,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.580
but what it does is, by
depending on the energy,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.840
this phase shift delta depends
on the energy, and we're on k.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.570
Then, it produces
interesting phenomena

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.250
when you send in wave packets.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.860
So if we write psi,
we usually write

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.430
psi is equal to
the phi plus psi s,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.640
where psi s is called
the scattered wave.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.680
You see, the full wave that
you get, for x greater than R,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.910
we would have to solve and work
very carefully to figure out

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.370
what is the wave function
in the region 0 to R.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.900
But for x greater
than R is simple,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.710
and for x greater than
R the wave function psi

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.180
is the free wave function,
in the case of no potential,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.270
plus the scattered wave.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.140
Quick calculation with this,
things [? give to ?] you

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:13.960
the scatter wave is e to the i
delta sine delta e to the ikx

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.320
is an outgoing wave.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.830
And this coefficient is called
the scattering amplitude.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.920
It's the amplitude of
the scattered wave.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.030
This is a wave that is going
out, and this is its amplitude.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.810
So it has something to do with
the strength of the scattering,

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.450
because if there
was no scattering,

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.680
the wave function would
just behave like the no

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.260
potential wave function.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.860
But due to the potential,
there is an extra piece,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.750
and that represents
an outgoing wave

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.910
beyond what you get outgoing
with a free no potential wave

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.070
function.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:08.170
So it's the
scattering amplitude,

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.830
and therefore sometimes we
are interested in as squared,

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.725
which is just sine
squared delta.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.260
Anyway, those are the
things we did last time.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:30.630
And we can connect to some
ideas that we were talking about

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.080
in the past, having to
do with time delays,

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.410
by constructing a wave packet.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.030
That's what's usually done.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.740
Consider the process
of time delay, which

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:50.080
is a phenomenon
that we've observed

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.550
happens in several
circumstances.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.150
If you have an incident
wave, how do you

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.080
construct an incident wave?

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.620
Well, it has to be
a superposition of e

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.670
to the minus ikx, for sure.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:14.600
So we'll put the function in
front, we'll integrate over k,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.910
and we'll go from 0 to infinity.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.310
I will actually add the
time dependence as well.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.740
So let's do phi of x and t.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:36.150
Then, we would have e to the
minus i, e of k, t over h bar,

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:44.500
and this would be valid
for x greater than R.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.405
Again, as a solution of
the Schrodinger equation.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.900
You see, it's a free wave.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:59.530
There's nothing extra from what
you know from the de Broglie

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.990
waves we started
a long time ago.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.550
So if this is your
incident wave,

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:16.870
you have to now realize that
you have this equation over here

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:22.790
telling you about the general
solution of the Schrodinger

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.470
equation.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.260
The general solution of
the Schrodinger equation,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.490
in this simple region,
the outside region,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.230
is of this form, and it
depends on this delta

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.950
that must be calculated.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.600
This is the incoming wave,
this is the reflected wave,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.070
and this is a solution.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:50.050
So by superposition, I construct
the reflected wave of x and t.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.010
So for each e to
the minus ikx wave,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.870
I must put down
one e to the ikx,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:05.470
but I must also put an e to
the 2i delta of the energy,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.540
or delta of k.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.860
And I must put an
extra minus sign,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.500
because these two
have opposite signs,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:24.400
so I should put a minus
0 to infinity dk f of k.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:31.880
And we'll have the e to the
minus i, e of k, e over h bar.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:38.500
And just for reference, f of
k is some real function that

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.690
picks at some value k naught.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:51.880
So you see, just
like what we did

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.790
in the case of the step
potential, in which we

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.280
had an incident wave,
a reflected wave

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.430
packet, a transmitted wave
packet, the wave packets go

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.400
along with the basic solution.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.670
The basic solution had
coefficients A, B, and C,

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.030
and you knew what B was
in terms of A and C.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.920
Therefore, you constructed the
incoming wave with A e to ikx,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.330
and then the reflected wave
with B e to the minus ikx.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:28.270
The same thing we're doing
here inspired by this solution,

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.697
the psi affects we
superpose many of those,

00:10:32.697 --> 00:10:34.030
and that's what we've done here.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:42.850
Now of course, we can do the
stationary phase calculations

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.100
that we've done several
times to figure out

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.210
how the peak of the
wave packet moves.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:11:02.602
So a stationary phase
at k equal k naught.

00:11:02.602 --> 00:11:06.000
As you remember, the
only contribution

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.380
can really come when k is near
k naught, and at that point,

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.880
you want the phase to be
stationary as a function of k.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.870
I will not do here
the computation again

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.540
for psi incident.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.620
You've done this computation
a few times already.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.830
For psi incident, you find
the relation between x and t,

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.490
and I will just write it.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.860
It's simple.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.550
You find that x is
equal to minus h

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:50.520
bar k naught over mt, or
minus some v velocity, group

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.080
velocity, times t.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.590
That is the condition
for a peak to exist.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.940
The peak satisfies
that equation,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:08.160
and this makes sense
when t is negative.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.480
This solution for psi incident
only makes sense for x positive

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:19.500
if in fact x greater than R. So
this solution needs x positive.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.660
So it needs t
negative [? indeed. ?]

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.900
This is a wave that is
coming from plus infinity,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.450
x equal plus infinity,
at time minus infinity,

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.870
and it's going in
with this velocity.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.280
For psi reflected,
the derivative

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.890
now has to take the derivative
of delta, with respect to e,

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:50.480
and then the derivative of e
with respect to the energy.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.345
And the answer, in this case--

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.480
you've done this before--

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:11.940
it's v group times t minus
2 h bar delta prime of E.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:20.970
So yes, in the reflected
wave, x grows as t grows

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.880
and it's positive.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.810
t must now be
positive, but in fact,

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.870
if you would have a
just x equal v group t,

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.810
this would correspond
to a particle that

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.610
seems to start at the origin
at time equals 0 and goes out.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.560
But this actually there is
an extra term subtracted.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.910
So only for t greater
than this number

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.590
the particle begins to appear.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:53.120
So this is a delay, t
minus some t naught,

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:59.000
the packet gets delayed
by this potential.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.620
Now, this delay can
really get delayed.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.040
Sometimes it might
even accelerated,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:13.240
but in general, the delay
is given by this quantity

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.060
So I'll write it here.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:24.580
The delay, delta t, is 2
h bar delta prime of E.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.120
And let's write it
in a way that you

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.420
can see maybe the units better
and get a little intuition

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.420
about what this
computation gives.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.910
For that, let's differentiate
this with respect to k,

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.670
and then k with
respect to energy.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:51.845
So v delta with respect to k,
and dk with respect to energy.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:08.460
This is 2 over 1 over h
bar dE with respect to k.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.660
I do a little rearrangement
of this derivative

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.490
is one function
of one variable k

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.150
and neither is a
single relation.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.110
So you can just invert it.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.745
This is more dangerous when
you have partial derivatives.

00:15:23.745 --> 00:15:28.950
This is not necessarily true but
for this ordinary derivatives

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:34.200
is true, and then you have
this 2 to the left here.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.960
The h bar went all the way
down, and I have d delta dk.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.680
And here, we recognize
that this is 2,

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.280
and this is nothing else
than the group velocity

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.740
we were talking before.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:57.510
The E, the energy, is h
squared k squared over 2m.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.300
You differentiate,
divide by h bar,

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:05.220
and it gives you the group
velocity hk naught over m.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.680
Because these
derivatives all have

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.460
to be evaluated at k naught.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.930
So this derivative is really
evaluated at k naught.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.490
This is also
evaluated at k naught.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:30.380
So this is the group velocity,
d delta, dk, and finally,

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:35.100
let me rewrite it in a
slightly different way.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:41.320
I multiply by 1 over R. Why?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.360
Because d delta dk, k has
units of 1 over length.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.860
So if I multiply by 1 over
R, this will have no units.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:17:04.869
So I claim that one over R d
delta dk is equal to delta t,

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:16.250
and you'll have 2 over vg
and R. So I did a few steps.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:22.190
I moved the 2 over
vg down to the left,

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.880
and I multiplied by
1 over R, and now we

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.430
have a nice expression.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.220
This is the delay.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.820
Delta t is the
delay, but you now

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:41.690
have divided it by 2R divided
by the velocity, which

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:46.010
is the time it takes the
particle with the group

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:55.190
velocity to travel back and
forth in the finite range

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.980
potential.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.920
So that gives you an idea.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.680
So if you compute
the time delay,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.530
again, it will have
units of microseconds,

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:08.240
and you may not know if
that's little or much.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.210
But here, by computing
this quantity,

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.800
not exactly delta prime
of v but this quantity.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.720
You get an [? insight,
?] because this is

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:24.510
the delay divided by
the free transit time.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.330
It's kind of a nice quantity.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:43.060
You're dividing your delay
and comparing it with the time

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.410
that it takes a particle,
with a velocity that

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:49.940
is coming in, to do the
bouncing across the finite range

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.790
potential.
