BARTON ZWIEBACH: --that
has served, also,

00:00:01.708 --> 00:00:11.480
our first example of solving
the Schrodinger equation.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.570
Last time, I showed you
a particle in a circle.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.580
And we wrote the wave function.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.080
And we said, OK, let's see
what is the momentum of it.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.720
But now, let's solve,
completely, this problem.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.782
So we have the
particle in the circle.

00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:30.926
Which means particle
moving here.

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:34.060
And this is the coordinate x.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:41.700
And x goes from 0 to L.
And we think of this point

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.160
and that point, identify.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.570
We actually write this as,
x is the same as x plus L.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.430
This is a strange
way of saying things,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.475
but it's actually
very practical.

00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:58.930
Here is 2L, 3L.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.013
We say that any point is the
same as the point at which you

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:11.507
add L. So the circle is
the whole, infinite line

00:01:11.507 --> 00:01:16.407
with this identification,
because every point here,

00:01:16.407 --> 00:01:18.400
for example, is the
same as this point.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.510
And this point is the
same as that point.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.510
So at the end of
everything, it's

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.330
equivalent to this piece,
where L is equivalent to 0.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.215
It's almost like if I was
walking here in this room,

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:36.200
I begin here.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.215
I go there.

00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:39.370
And when I reach
those control panels,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.280
somehow, it looks like a door.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.120
And I walk in.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.290
And there's another classroom
there with lots of people

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.290
sitting.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.230
And it continues,
and goes on forever.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.130
And then I would conclude
that I live in a circle,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.445
because I have just
begun here and returned

00:01:56.445 --> 00:01:58.644
to the same point that is there.

00:01:58.644 --> 00:01:59.560
And it just continues.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.800
So here it is.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.131
You are all sitting here.

00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:03.815
But you are all sitting there.

00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:09.430
And you are all sitting there,
and just live on a circle.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.270
So this implies that in
order to solve wave functions

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:21.918
in a circle, we'll have to
put that psi of x plus L

00:02:21.918 --> 00:02:29.178
is equal to psi of x,
which are the same points.

00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:31.598
And we'll have 0 potential.

00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:33.320
V of x equals 0.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.740
It will make life simple.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.690
So the Hamiltonian is
just minus h squared

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.750
over 2m d second dx squared.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.330
We want to find the
energy eigenstate.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.465
So we want to find
minus h squared over 2m

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:08.960
d second psi dx squared
is equal to E psi.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.498
We want to find those solutions.

00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:21.295
Now it's simple, or
relatively simple

00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:27.470
to show that all the
energies that you can find

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.670
are either zero or positive.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:40.582
It's impossible to find
solutions of this equation

00:03:40.582 --> 00:03:44.370
with a negative energies.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.420
And we do it as follows.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:04:01.980
We multiply by dx and psi star
and integrate from 0 to L.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.236
So we do that on this equation.

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:07.158
And what will we get?

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:13.550
Minus h squared over
2m integral psi star

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:26.561
of x d dx of d dx psi
of x is equal to E times

00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:34.172
the integral psi star psi x dx.

00:04:34.172 --> 00:04:39.574
And we will assume, of
course, that you have things

00:04:39.574 --> 00:04:43.960
that are well normalized.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.460
So if this is well
normalized, this is 1.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.070
So this is the energy is
equal to this quantity.

00:04:57.006 --> 00:04:58.940
And look at this quantity.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.140
This is minus h squared over 2m.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.250
I could integrate by parts.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.340
If I do this quickly,
I would say, just

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.280
integrate by parts over here.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.450
And if we integrate by
parts, d dx of psi of x,

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.100
we will get a minus sign.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.790
We'll cancel this minus
sign, and will be over.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.973
But let's do it a
little bit more slowly.

00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:38.192
You can put dx, this is
equal to d dx of psi star

00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:55.837
d psi dx minus d psi
star dx d psi dx.

00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:59.860
I will do it like this,
with a nice big bracket.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.860
Look what I wrote.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.320
I rewrote the psi
star d second of psi

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.075
as d dx of this
quantity, which gives me

00:06:12.075 --> 00:06:16.540
this term when the derivative
acts on the second factor.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.070
But then I used an extra
term, where the derivative

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.530
acts on the first factor that is
not present in the above line.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.450
Therefore, it must
be subtracted out.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.448
So this bracket has
replaced this thing.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:45.020
Now d dx of something, if
you integrate over x from 0

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.600
to L, the derivative
of something,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:55.390
this will be minus h bar
squared over 2m psi star d psi

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:01.540
dx integrated at L and at 0.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.620
And then minus cancels.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.991
So you get plus h squared
over 2m integral from 0

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:20.920
to L dx d psi dx
squared equal E.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.615
And therefore,
this quantity is 0.

00:07:27.615 --> 00:07:32.465
The point L is the same
point as the point 0.

00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:35.170
This is not the
point at infinity.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.960
I cannot say that the wave
function goes to 0 at L,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.550
or goes to 0, because
you're going to infinity.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.800
No, they have a better
argument in this case.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.460
Whatever it is,
the wave function,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:56.770
the derivative, everything,
is periodic with L.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.220
So whatever values it
has at L equal 0 it has--

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:08.800
at x equals 0, it has at
x equals L. So this is 0.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.495
And this equation shows
that E is the integral

00:08:14.495 --> 00:08:16.360
of a positive quantity.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.150
So it's showing that E is
greater than 0, as claimed.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.070
So E is greater than 0.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:33.955
So let's just try a couple
of solutions, and solve.

00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:37.065
We'll comment on
them more in time.

00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:39.478
But let's get the
solutions, because,

00:08:39.478 --> 00:08:43.390
after all, that's what
we're supposed to do.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.935
The differential equation
is d second psi dx

00:08:48.935 --> 00:08:57.500
squared is equal to minus
2mE over h squared psi.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.895
And here comes the thing.

00:08:58.895 --> 00:09:03.900
We always like to define
quantities, numbers.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.070
If this is a number,
and E is positive,

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.822
this I can call
minus k squared psi.

00:09:13.822 --> 00:09:16.553
Where k is a real number.

00:09:21.954 --> 00:09:24.820
Because k real, the
square is positive.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.590
And we've shown that
the energy is positive.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.830
And in fact, this
is nice notation.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:37.570
Because if you were setting
k squared equal to 2mE

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.320
over h squared,
you're saying that E

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.882
is equal to h squared
k squared over 2m.

00:09:45.882 --> 00:09:50.680
So, in fact, the
momentum is equal to hk.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.330
Which is very nice notation.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.830
So this number, k,
actually has the meaning

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.564
that we usually associate,
that hk is the momentum.

00:10:00.564 --> 00:10:06.270
And now you just have to solve
this. d second psi dx squared

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.790
is equal to minus k squared psi.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:17.660
Well, those are solved by
sines or cosines of kx.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:25.234
So you could choose sine of
kx, cosine of kx, e to the ikx.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.170
And this is, kind of
better, or easier,

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:35.300
because you don't
have to deal with two

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.245
types of different functions.

00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:41.930
And when you take k and minus
k, you have to use this, too.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.990
So let's try this.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.200
And these are your
solutions, indeed.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.622
psi is equal to e to the ikx.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.420
So we leave for
next time to analyze

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.990
the [INAUDIBLE] details.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:02.490
What values of k are
necessary for periodicity

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.540
and how we normalize
this wave function.
