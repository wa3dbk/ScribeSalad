00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.280
PROFESSOR: So here is
of something funny.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.950
You might say, OK,
what is simpler?

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.000
A theory that is linear or
a theory that is not linear?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.750
And the answer, of course, a
linear theory is much simpler.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.920
General-- Maxwell's
equations are linear.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.790
Einstein's theory of
relativity is very nonlinear,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.070
very complicated.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.590
How about classical mechanics?

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.140
Is classical mechanics
linear or nonlinear?

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.010
What do we think?

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.450
Can't hear anyone.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.080
Linear, OK.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.220
You may think it's linear
because it's supposed

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.160
to be simple, but it's not.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.680
It's actually is very nonlinear.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.560
Newton could solve
the two body problem

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.930
but he couldn't solve
the three body problem.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.680
Already with three bodies, you
cannot superpose solutions that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.720
you get with two bodies.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.330
It's extraordinarily
complicated,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.400
classical mechanics.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.600
Let me show you.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.120
If you have motion in
one dimension, in 1D,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.830
you have the equation of
motion, motion in one dimension,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.290
and there are potential V of
x, that this time independent--

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.400
a particle moving
in one dimension x

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.330
with under the influence
of a potential, V of x.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.200
The second-- the dynamical
variable is x of t.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.550
The dynamical variable.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.685
And the equation of motion is--

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.020
so let me explain this.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.660
This is force equal
mass times acceleration.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.950
This is mass, this
is acceleration,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.400
the second derivative
of the position,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.580
and V force is minus the
derivative of the potential

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.310
evaluated at the position.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.480
You know, derivatives
of potentials--

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.460
if you think of a potential,
the derivative of the potential

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.550
is here positive, and you
know if you have a mass

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.240
here, it tends to
go to the left,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.400
so the force is on the
left, so it's minus.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:48.375
So V prime is the derivative of
V with respect to its argument.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.660
And the problem is that while
this, taking derivatives,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.890
is a linear operation.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.250
If you take two derivatives
of a sum of things,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.200
you take two
derivatives of the first

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.930
plus two derivatives
of the second.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.020
But yes, its-- this
side is linear,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.020
but this side may not be linear.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.010
Because a potential
can be arbitrary.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.650
And that the
reverse-- so suppose

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.210
the potential is cubic in x.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.500
V of x goes like x cubed.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.000
Then the derivative of
V goes like x squared,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.180
and x squared is not
a linear function.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.810
So this, Newton's equation,
is not a linear equation.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.290
And therefore, it's
complicated to solve.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.990
Very complicated to solve.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.160
So finally, we can get to
our case, quantum mechanics.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.930
So in quantum mechanics,
what do we have?

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.025
Quantum mechanics is linear.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.420
First, you need an equation,
and whose equation is it?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.380
Schrodinger's equation, 1925.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.370
He writes an equation for
the dynamical variable,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.530
and the dynamical
variable is something

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.030
called the wave function.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.350
This wave function
can depend on t--

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:36.100
depends on time-- and it may
depend on other things as well.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.600
And he describes the dynamics
of the quantum system

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.730
as it evolved in time.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.760
There is the wave function,
and you have an equation

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.570
for this wave function.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.940
And what is the equation
for this wave function?

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.250
It's a universal
equation-- i hbar

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.280
partial derivative with
respect to time of psi

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:14.690
is equal to H hat of psi, where
H hat is called the Hamiltonian

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.100
and it's a linear operator.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.870
That's why I had to
explain a little bit what

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.280
the linear operator is.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.210
This is the general structure
of the Schrodinger equation--

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.150
time derivative and
the linear operator.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.820
So if you wish to write the
Schrodinger equation as an L

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:50.980
psi equals 0, then L psi would
be defined i hbar del/del

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.730
t of psi minus H hat psi.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.710
Then this is the
Schrodinger equation.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.685
This equation here is
Schrodinger's equation.

00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:12.230
And as you can see,
it's a linear equation.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.630
You can check it, check
that L is a linear operator.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.280
Therefore, it is naturally
linear, you can see,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.140
because you do it differently,
because the derivative

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.740
with respect to time
is a linear operation.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.640
If you have the ddt of a
number of times a function,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.930
the number goes out, you
differentiate the function.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.450
ddt of the sum of two functions,
you differentiate the first,

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.380
you differentiate.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.590
So this is linear and
H we said is linear,

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.780
so L is going to be linear
and the Schrodinger equation

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.990
is going to be a
linear equation,

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.380
and therefore, you're going
to have the great advantage

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.040
that any time you find
solutions, you can scale them,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.720
you can add them, you can put
them together, combine them

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.760
in superpositions, and
find new solutions.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.410
So in that sense,
it's remarkable

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.770
that quantum
mechanics is simpler

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.240
than classical mechanics.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.450
And in fact, you will see
throughout this semester

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.570
how the mathematics and
the things that we do

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.120
are simpler in
quantum mechanics,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.110
or more elegant, more
beautiful, more coherent,

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.400
it's simpler and very nice.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.520
OK, i is the square root of
minus 1, is the imaginary unit,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.160
and that's what we're
going to talk next

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.070
on the necessity
of complex numbers.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.860
hbar, yes, it's a number.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.570
It shows up in quantum
mechanics early on.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.450
It it's called Planck's
constant and it

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.310
began when Planck tried to
fit the black value spectrum

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.430
and he found the need to
put a constant in there,

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.580
and then later, Einstein figured
out that it was very relevant,

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.540
so yes, it's a number.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.470
For any physical
system that you have,

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.050
you will have a wave
function and you

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.570
will have a Hamiltonian,
and the Hamiltonian

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.960
is for you to invent
or for you to discover.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.170
So if you have a particle
moving on a line,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.970
the wave function will
depend on time and on x.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.780
If you have a particle
moving in three dimensions,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.140
it will depend on x vector.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.690
It may depend on
other things as well

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.400
or it maybe, like, one particle
has several wave functions

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.340
and that happens when you
have a particle with spin.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.170
So in general, always
time, sometimes position,

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.280
there may be cases where it
doesn't depend on position.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.230
You think of an electron at some
point in space and it's fixed--

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.270
you lock it there and
you want understand

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.230
the physics of that
electron locked into place,

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.250
and then position
is not relevant.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.670
So what it does with
its spin is relevant

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.370
and then you may need more
than one wave function-- what

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.340
is one describing
the spin up and one

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.040
describing the spin down?

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.410
So it was funny that
Schrodinger wrote this equation

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:32.040
and when asked, so what
is the wave function?

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.270
He said, I don't know.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.140
No physical interpretation
for the wave function

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.940
was obvious for the people that
invented quantum mechanics.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.740
It took a few months
until Max Born said

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.842
it has to do with
probabilities, and that's

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.050
what we're going to get next.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:10:00.455
So our next point is the
necessity of complex numbers

00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:02.920
in quantum mechanics.
