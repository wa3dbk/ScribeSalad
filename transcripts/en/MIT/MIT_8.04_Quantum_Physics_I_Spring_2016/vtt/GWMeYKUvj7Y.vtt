00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:13.540
PROFESSOR: Hydrogen atom,
the first thing to do

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.718
is to describe the
potential V or r.

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:24.790
And it would be in the units
that we'd like to use minus e

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.960
squared over r.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.130
e is the charge of the electron,
and the electron and proton

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.130
with the same charge.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610
The potential
energy is negative.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.090
And that sign you should
be comfortable with.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.930
It's suggesting that you
go closer and closer.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.280
You're going down and
energy is favored.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.360
The two particles to go
on top of each other.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.110
Immediately we want to
generalize it a little so

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.540
that it's hydrogen like atoms.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.390
And we'll put a Z here, assuming
that the proton, instead

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.750
of the program, there's
a nucleus with z protons.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.210
And there probably would
be about z electrons,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.875
but we're worried now
about just one electron.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.060
And in this case, a
charge in the proton

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.080
is ze multiplied by the charge
of the electron gives you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.160
this as the potential energy.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.500
And this is advantageous.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.410
You sometimes have
an alpha particle

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.160
that captures an electron,
and then there's two protons.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.470
And you don't want
to solve this, again,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.410
from the beginning.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.280
So just put the z, and
that's what we will do.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.860
So a few numbers.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.080
We've done some of
these numbers before,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:59.940
but the Bohr radius and one way
of calculating the Bohr radius

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.300
is to just think of units
and think of energy.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:14.640
Energy goes like h
squared over ma squared.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.950
This has units of energy.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.940
You remember p squared over 2m.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.770
And p is h over distance.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.000
So if you have a
Bohr radius a 0,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.060
this quantity has
units of energy.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.870
But a potential
has units of energy

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.360
and we just put e
squared over a0.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.660
So this is a consistent equation
between two quantities that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.060
have units of energy
from which you

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.240
can get the unique
length that has

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.220
units of energy, which is a0.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:03.030
And a0 is h squared
over me squared.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.280
It's a very simple and nice
constant is the Bohr radius.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.490
Intuitively one thing
that should remember,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.830
e is appearing in
the right place.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.640
And you could imagine if
the strength of electricity

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.660
was weaker and weaker,
like setting e going to 0,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.020
the atom would become
bigger and bigger.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.830
It would just not
be able to hold it.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:34.210
So it's reasonable to
expect this to happen.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.670
So at this moment,
we can calculate what

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.700
this is, at least, estimate it.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:50.180
And for that, we multiply by
a c squared e squared over m--

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.020
mc squared.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.950
And then we recall
that e is squared

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.040
over hc is about 1 over 137.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.050
So we write this as
hc over e squared

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.829
over hc times mc squared.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.800
Now in here what mass is
the mass that we should put.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.900
I will not be all that careful.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.490
It should really be
the reduced mass.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.460
But in differs by a factor
of one part in 1,000 or less

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.650
even from the mass
of the electrons.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.640
So I'll put just the
mass of the electron.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.300
This it's about
197 mev for Fermi.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.190
This is 1 over 137.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:04.570
And for the electron is 0.5
times 10 to the 6 ev 0.5 mev.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.270
I won't run the numbers.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.640
The answer is about
0.529 angstroms,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.330
which is about 53 picometers.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.600
Angstrom is 10 to
the minus 10 meters.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.385
Picometer 10 to the
minus 12 meters.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.690
So that's a length scale
you've seen several times.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.950
There's an energy scale
that is famous to.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.140
And that's e squared over a0.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.220
Because energy comes
here, the energy scale

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.610
is e squared over e0.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.440
So you can substitute what a0
is because you know it already.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:17.040
And you get e to the
fourth over m over h

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:24.160
squared, which is e to
the fourth over h squared

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.120
c squared times Mc squared.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.570
And you see it's kind of nice to
see these quanities appearing,

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:45.160
because here you have e
squared over hc squared times

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.300
mc squared.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.740
So the typical energy
of the hydrogen atom

00:06:50.740 --> 00:07:00.570
is the fine-structure constant,
sometimes called alpha squared

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.200
times an energy.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.890
And what energy's
available in the problem?

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.180
The rest energy of the electron.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.790
So if the bound state
energy should be something,

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.960
it should be a number
proportional to the energy

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.580
that the problem already has.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.970
And the problem has one
energy, the rest energy

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:21.760
of the electron.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.610
So it's not surprising.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:36.380
So it's one over 137
squared times 511,000 ev.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:43.280
And that's about 27.2 ev.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.100
And the reason this
may sound familiar

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.440
is because the true ground state
energy of the hydrogen atom

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.440
is this number divided
by 2, which is 13.6 ev.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.000
So of course, you would
not know at this stage,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.700
because you're
just doing numbers.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.230
I may remind you of things did
a long time ago in this course.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.920
You calculated a couple
of other constants.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.340
And you showed that alpha--

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.260
again, the
fine-structure constant

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:27.700
comes a0 was the so-called
Compton wavelength

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.790
of the electron, with a bar.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.030
So it's h bar over mc.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.750
Remember, that the
Broglie wavelength

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.530
is h over the momentum.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.830
The Compton wavelength
this h over mc.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.510
And the Bard can wave
at the h bar over mc.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.230
And that's what alpha
times a zero is.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:02.400
And that quantity
is about 400 Fermi.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.470
It's already much smaller
than the Bohr radius.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:11.780
It's smaller by 137
from the Bohr radius.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.830
And then if you do
alpha squared a0,

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.645
that actually was the
classical electron radius.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.630
So you must divide
this by 137, again,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.410
and it gives you
about 2.8 Fermi.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.520
And what you can remember
is that the size of a proton

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.560
is about a Fermi.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.200
So that gives you a
little bit of intuition.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.460
So those are the basic
numbers that we begin with,

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.055
with the hydrogen atom.

00:09:46.055 --> 00:09:52.140
It gives you a scale of what's
going on, the size of an atom,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.640
and the energies that
we're supposed to get.
