00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.780
PROFESSOR: Last time,
we spoke about photons

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.690
in the context of
an interferometer.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.610
The Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.380
And we saw the very
unusual properties

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.540
of photons and interference,
and how relatively simple

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.290
interference a effect
can be used to produce

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.000
a very surprising measurement.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.130
Today we're going to backtrack
and go from the beginning,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.480
and think about photons as
physicists did 100 years ago,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.650
and how, by thinking
about photons,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.770
they pretty much came up
with quantum mechanics.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.470
So we want to trace this back.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.340
And the best place
to start, probably,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.790
is with a photoelectric effect.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.600
The photoelectric
effect is an experiment

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.230
done by Hertz in 1887, in
which he irradiated plates.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.730
That means shine light,
high energy beams of light,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.710
on metal plate, and he found
that electrons were released.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.680
Those were called
photo electrons.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.940
And therefore, you would
get a photoelectric current

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.210
from those electrons.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.740
So this is the effect
we want to discuss now,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.510
is the photoelectric effect.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.300
And it's Hertz, 1887.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.350
So first a description.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:02:13.440
So polished metal plates
irradiated may emit electrons.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.650
And these are called
photo electrons sometimes.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.400
Photo electrons is
just an electron that

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.370
was released due to a photon.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.505
And therefore, we get a
photoelectric current.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.440
OK so so far, so good.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.570
But what was special
about this experiment?

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.840
The first step that was
special was that there

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.420
was a critical frequency.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.410
If you would take a sample
and you would irradiate it

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.980
with light, and you
would begin with light

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.730
with very low frequency,
nothing would happen.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.350
And all of a sudden after
a certain frequency, boom.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.580
You would get a current.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:26.810
So there is a threshold
frequency, nu0,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:35.405
such that only for Nu greater
than nu0 there is a current.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.300
So no current for
lower frequencies.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.720
Now as it turned out,
nu0 depends on the metal

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.460
you're irradiating.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.340
And even more, it's a
complicated thing to calculate.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.140
It depends on the
surface of the metal,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.850
so that's why Hertz apparently
had to polish the metal.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.010
And this frequency, if
the metal is irregular,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.110
may depend on where you shine.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.310
So you'd better prepare
the metal very nicely.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.300
And it may even depend
on the crystalline nature

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.190
of the metal, because
it's a many body effect.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.800
You see, anticipating
the resolution,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.880
there is this piece of metal and
there are a few free electrons

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.350
running around.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.520
And they run around among
the crystalline structure

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.640
of the metal.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.710
And removing them, it's
going to take some energy,

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.240
and that energy depends on
the metal and the arrangement

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.570
and all kinds of things.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:05:08.260
So this nu0 depends on the
metal and the configuration

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.900
of atoms at the surface.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:29.000
Third property was
kind of interesting.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.660
The magnitude of the
current was proportional

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.880
to the intensity of the light.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:52.760
Magnitude current
is proportional

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.370
to the light intensity.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.580
And perhaps the last one and
fourth, a rather important one,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.330
a very crucial
property, is that you

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.470
could observe the energy
of the photo electrons,

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.425
and it seemed to be independent
of the light intensity.

00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:33.760
So energy of the
photo electrons is

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:49.980
independent of the
intensity of light

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.860
The number of photo
electrons would

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.320
depend on the
intensity of light,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.970
but not the energy of
the photo electrons.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.140
Now there is more to that,
but I think it was not

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.620
quite exactly noticed by Hertz.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.920
So Hertz probably didn't
notice all these things.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.280
But the last one, that maybe
we can put in brackets here,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.440
is that the energy of the
photo electrons E gamma--

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:37.380
oh, no-- E of the electrons
increases linearly

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.770
with the frequency of the light.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.330
So this photoelectric
effect was not

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.630
easy to understand if you
thought of light as a wave.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.750
And Einstein came
up with an answer

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.930
that he almost said
what was going on,

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.990
but didn't quite use the word.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:20.370
He said that light comes
in bundles of energy.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:25.300
And in a beam, you have
bundles of energy quanta.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.070
Didn't quite say
light is a particle.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.470
He himself was a little
non-committal, I think,

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.970
about this concept.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:44.340
But Einstein, in 1905, gives
the natural explanation

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:51.040
and says that light
is composed of quanta.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.900
He would have to
wait until 1920s

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.930
until the name photons came
up, given by a chemist, Lewis.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.760
So he called them quanta.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.270
These are later photons, and
I will use the name photons

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.450
from the beginning.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:31.750
With energy, E equal h nu,
where nu is the frequency and h

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.360
was Planck's constant.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.380
Planck had already
introduced the constant

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.640
in trying to fit the
black body spectrum.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.880
The black body spectrum,
the intensity of light

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.590
is a function of frequency
in black body radiation,

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.610
had a particular curve.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.810
Planck tried to fit it and he
realized he needed one constant

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.240
and he called it h.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.490
That's Planck's constant.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.330
And the same constant
that Planck introduced,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.820
reappeared in
Einstein's proposition.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.435
This is Planck's constant.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:22.630
So the picture that
Einstein and others had

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.970
was that you would have
kind of a potential

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:33.790
here and plot energy
over here, and maybe this

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.460
is some distance.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.080
And you have a metal and there
is the electrons captured here.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.310
And here is zero energy.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.660
So they have negative
energy, they're captured.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.780
And you need some
amount of energy, w,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.730
which is called the work
function, that depends

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.150
on the type of metal you have.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.650
And if you could
supply that energy, w,

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:08.350
to any one of these electrons
that are bound in this metal,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.080
they would come out and
not be attracted any more

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.720
and would be able to fly free.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.300
So it is like an
escape velocity,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.200
you're bound by the
gravity of earth.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.980
You need something velocity,
some energy to shoot you out.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.570
Same thing here.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:43.170
So this w, or work function,
is defined as the energy needed

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.430
to release an electron.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.740
And that work
function is that thing

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.250
that depends on the metal
you have and the structure

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.920
and how well you've
polished the surface.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.570
So if this is true,
then Einstein,

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.630
if he was right
with this property,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.720
there would be the following
statement that you could make.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:25.280
The energy of the electron,
which is, roughly speaking,

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:33.090
one half mv squared, would
be equal to the energy

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:38.100
that the photon [INAUDIBLE],
minus the work function.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.290
So you supply a photon.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.470
Some of the energy goes
into the work function,

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:49.200
but the rest of the energy
goes into giving free energy

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.720
to these electrons.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.640
So you have the
energy of the photon

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.230
minus w, which is what you
need to just take it out

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.760
with 0 velocity.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.460
And then the rest of
the energy of the photon

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:10.610
would be transmitted as
kinetic energy of the electron.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:17.920
So if this is true, this
would be h nu minus omega.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.510
And this was considered
a prediction,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.340
because that statement that
the energy of the electron

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.700
increases linearly
with the frequency,

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.120
was not quite obvious to people.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.670
Experiments were
not fine enough.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.220
Measuring the energy of
the emitted particles

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.650
was not all that easy either.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.690
So this was
Einstein's prediction.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.430
And the experimental
confirmation

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.170
took 10 years to come.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:07.320
It was verified by
Millikan in 1915.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:17.780
So Millikan, in 1915, measures
the energy of the photo

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:32.460
electrons, verifies
Einstein's conjecture,

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.790
and actually produces,
by measuring so carefully

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.270
the energy of the photo
electrons, produces

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:47.070
a measurement of h, which
is the best to that point.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:15:01.360
And h is measured
to better than 1%,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.170
so a very accurate
measurement of h.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:10.330
And perhaps you would say,
OK, so this is all wonderful,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.670
now everybody
believes in photons.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:17.920
But that's quite
far from the truth.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.410
They didn't believe
in photons too much,

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.850
because Maxwell had
been too successful.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:28.540
And Einstein himself knew that
once you started believing

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.880
in particles like
photons, you had

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.980
this subject with this case of
loss of determinism and waves

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.190
that we have sometimes
as particles and things

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.260
he didn't like much.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:46.120
So people were quite reluctant
to believe in these things.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.200
It's quite amazing.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.060
So it took a while still.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:58.910
So let's do a simple exercise
to introduce some numbers here,

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.870
and show you how to do some
very simple computation.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.495
So let me do an example.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:25.590
You shine UV light with lambda
290 nanometers on a metal

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:35.040
with work function 4.05 EV.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:44.900
What is the energy, E
of the photo electrons,

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.520
and what is their speed?

00:16:54.810 --> 00:17:00.720
Now it is a goal of mine, and of
the instructors in this course,

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.380
that a calculation
like that, you should

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:10.349
be able to do without
turning on your iPhone

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:14.579
and checking what the h bar is,
and getting a few constants,

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:18.000
and what is an EV
or all these things.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.640
Well nowadays, you can
just check Wolfram Alpha

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.950
and they will give
you the answer

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.599
for this, in beautiful,
beautiful calculations.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.100
Just copy the
question like that,

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.390
pretty much, I think it
will answer it for you.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.220
But you should be
able to do back

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.760
of the envelope calculations,
in which you estimate things

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.360
quickly.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.540
And with one significant
digit, you don't even

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.380
need a calculator to do this.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.290
So let's see how
one does this thing.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.720
So the first thing to
do is to figure out what

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.940
is the energy of this photon.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.160
That's the first problem.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.120
So the energy of
a photon is h nu.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.550
But nu it's not lambda.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.950
So nu time lambda is c,
so this is hc over lambda,

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.820
where c is the speed of light.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:21.610
OK, hc lambda, we could
do it if we knew h.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:26.520
I must say, I never remember
what h is in normal units.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.030
Joule seconds, six
point something,

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.320
I don't quite remember it.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.750
So what do I do?

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:41.660
I use h bar, which
is h over 2 pi.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:48.620
So h is 2 pi h
bar c over lambda.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.980
And here is where you--

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.800
here is the first
thing that maybe you

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.280
want to remember by heart.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.270
h bar c is a pretty
nice number, it's

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:11.350
about 200mev times a fermi,
If you want it more precise,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:17.770
it's 197.33, if you
want to get five digits,

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.130
but it's pretty close
to 200 mev fermi.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.220
And what is a fermi?

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.840
It's 10 to the minus 15 meters.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.990
OK, so with this number,
I claim you can do

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:34.420
pretty much all you want to do.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:42.550
So here you have 2pi
times 200 mev times

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:47.950
10 to the minus 15
meters divided--

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.310
I'll put 197 here--

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:58.210
divided by lambda, which
is 290 nanometers, which

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.850
is 10 to the minus 9 meters.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.000
So 10 to the minus 9
and 10 to the minus 15

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.210
is 10 to the minus 6 up.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:15.630
And this is a million
ev, which is 10 to 6 ev.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:21.440
So all these meters cancel
and there's just an ev left.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:30.710
So this is 2 pi times
197 over 290 ev.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:35.940
And you certainly could estimate
this like 2 over 3 times 2 pi,

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.550
which is 6.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.980
And that's about four.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.720
And if you want to
do it more carefully,

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.550
it comes out to 4.28 ev.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.270
And the nice thing is that
the answer comes in ev's.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.370
And the work
functions, everybody

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:57.870
gives them in ev's, so
it's a convenient thing.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:02.390
So at this moment, you
have this electron energy

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.940
of the photon being this.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.380
So energy of the
electron is energy

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:15.380
of the photon minus the
work function, which is 428

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:31.640
minus 405 ev, and it's 0.23 ev.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.730
That's a kinetic
energy and that should

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.710
be a non-relativistic
electron because the rest

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:46.170
mass of an electron is
about half a million ev.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:51.360
It is 511,000 ev.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.520
So this is fairly
non-relativistic, but how slow

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.020
is it?

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.340
Is it moving a
centimeter per second?

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.490
No, it's moving pretty fast.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:06.120
You can write this as
one half mv squared.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.110
And then what do you do?

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:12.750
You put one half m
of the electron c

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:18.010
squared v squared
over c squared.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:31.180
And this is one half of 511,000
ev times v over c squared.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:37.570
So do the arithmetic, it's
20.46 over that, square root

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.840
and multiply it by
the speed of light.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.000
You can do this
roughly in your head.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:52.540
And the velocity comes out
to 284 kilometers per second,

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.020
so it's pretty fast.
