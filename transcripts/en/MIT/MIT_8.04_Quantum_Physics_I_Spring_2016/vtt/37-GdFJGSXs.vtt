00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.260
PROFESSOR: And let me
I assume, for example,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.910
that I'll put the
state alpha beta in.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.200
Alpha and beta.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.540
What do I get out?

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.330
So you have this
state, alpha beta.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.470
What do you get out?

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.770
Well, state comes in and is
acted by beam splitter 1.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.880
So you must put the
beam splitter, 1 matrix.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.770
And then it comes the mirrors.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.790
And lets assume
mirrors do nothing.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.530
In fact, mirrors--
the two mirrors

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.300
would multiply by minus 1,
which will have no effect.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.790
So lets ignore mirrors.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.830
And then you get
to beam splitter 2

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.550
and you must multiply by the
matrix of beam squared 2.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.615
And that's the output.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.260
And that output is a
two-component vector.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.250
That gives you the amplitude
up and the amplitude down.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:28.800
So I should put BS2 here,
BS1 over here, alpha beta.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.970
The numbers move away, 1
over square root of 2 and 1

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.070
over square root of 2.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.110
Commute in matrix
multiplication.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.420
Then you multiply
these two matrices.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:56.130
You get 0, 2, minus
2, and 0, alpha beta.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.080
And you put the 2 in so
you get beta minus alpha.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.510
So here is the rule.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.050
If you have alpha
and beta, you get,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.550
here, beta and minus alpha
here, or a beta minus

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.120
alpha photon at the end.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.860
Good.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:30.700
So let's do our first
kind of experiment.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.720
Our first experiment is to
have the beam splitters here.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.520
D0-- detector D0 and
detector D1 over there.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.540
And let's send in a
photon over here only--

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.360
1 or input 0, 1.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.570
Well this photon,
0, 1, splits here.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.150
You act with BS1--

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.410
the matrix BS1.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.530
You get two things.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.830
You act with the matrix
BS2, and it gives you this.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.170
But we have the rule already.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.110
If you have an alpha beta,
out comes a beta minus alpha.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.700
So it should have as 1, here,
and minus 0, here, which is 0.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.170
So you get a 1, 0.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.320
So what is really happening?

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.800
What's really happening is
that your photon that came in

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.690
divided in two,
recombined, and, actually,

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.140
there was a very interesting
interference here.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.710
From the top beam
came some amplitude

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.910
and gave some reflected
and some transmitted.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.570
From the bottom beam,
there was some transmission

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.930
and some reflection.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.829
The transmission from the top
and reflection from the bottom

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.890
interfered, to give 0.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.510
And this, too, the reflection
from the top and transmission

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.960
from the bottom, were
coherent and added up to 1.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.060
And every single
photon ends up in D0.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.690
If you would put the beam--

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.950
well, Mach and
Zehnder were working

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.750
in the late 1800s, 1890s.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.180
And they would shine light.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.940
They had no ability
to manipulate photons.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.670
But they could put
those beam splitters

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.100
and they could get this
interference effect,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.180
where everything goes to D0.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.840
So far, so good.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.120
Now let me do a slightly
different experiment.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:19.110
I will now put the same
thing, a BS1 and a beam

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.400
going in, mirror,
mirror, BS2 here.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.720
But now, I will put a block
of concrete here on the way.

00:05:38.164 --> 00:05:39.405
I'll put it like this.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.440
So that if there
is any photon that

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.030
wants to come in this
direction, it will be absorbed.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.210
Photon could still go
like this, but nothing

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.610
would go through here.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.530
And here, of course,
there might be D0 and D1.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.625
And here are the
mirrors, M and M.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:15.560
Now the bottom
mirror is of no use

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.780
anymore because there is
a big block of concrete

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.710
that will stop any photon
from getting there.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:32.480
And we are asked,
again, what happens?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.590
What do the detectors see?

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.010
And this time, we
still have a 01.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:46.310
Now I would be tempted
to use this formula,

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.660
but this formula was right
under the wrong assumption--

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.310
that there was no block here.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.700
So I cannot use that formula.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.060
And certainly, things are
going to be different.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.450
So I have to calculate things.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.970
And we're doing a quantum
mechanical calculation.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.360
Well, up to here,
before it reaches here,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.210
I can you do my
usual calculation.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:20.800
Certainly, we have BS1
acting on the state, 01,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.150
and this is 1 over square root
of 2, I think, minus 1, 1, 1,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.350
1.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.010
Yup, that B is 1, acting on 01.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.860
And that gives me 1
over square root of 2,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.300
1 over square root of 2.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.380
So, yes, here I have one over
square root of 2 amplitude.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.650
And here I also have 1 over
square root of 2 amplitude.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.610
OK.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.180
Now that's the end
of this amplitude.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.160
It doesn't follow.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.480
But on the other
hand, in this branch,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.390
the mirror doesn't change the
amplitude, doesn't absorb.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.490
So you still have 1 over
square root of 2 here.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.880
And now you're reaching BS2.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.050
Now what is the input for BS2?

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.800
The input is a one over
square root 2 in the top beam,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.600
and nothing in the lower beam
because nothing is reaching BS2

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.225
from below.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.740
This is blocked.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.590
So yes, there was some
times when something reached

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.299
from below, but nothing here.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:36.260
So to figure out the
amplitudes, here, I

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:43.440
must do BS2 acting on 1 over
the square root of 2, 0.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.080
Because 1 over square
root of 2 is coming in,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.600
but nothing is
coming in from below.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.160
And, therefore, I get 1
over the square root of 2,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:05.505
1, 1, 1, minus 1, 1 over
square root of 2, 0.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:14.150
This time, I get 1/2 and 1/2.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.970
OK, we must trust the math.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:31.320
1/2 here and 1/2 there, so
1/2 a column vector, 1/2, 1/2.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:43.920
OK, let me maybe tabulate
this result, which

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.090
is somewhat strange, really.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:53.480
So what is strange about
it is the following.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.330
In the first case,
where the interferometer

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.580
was totally clear, nothing
in the middle, everything

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.740
went to D2.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.460
And nothing went into D1.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.430
But now, you do something that
should block some photons.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.300
You block some photons
in the lower path,

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.740
and yet, now you seem to be
able to get something into D1.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.010
There is an amplitude
to get into the D1.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:28.610
So by blocking a source,
you're getting more somewhere.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:33.020
It's somewhat counterintuitive.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.210
You will see by the end of
the lecture in 10 minutes,

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.250
that it's not just
somewhat counterintuitive,

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.350
it's tremendously
counterintuitive.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.250
Let's summarize
the result here--

00:10:47.250 --> 00:11:02.650
the outcome in the blocked lower
branch case and the probability

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.590
for those events.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:14.030
So photon at the block--

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.670
the photon can end
in three places.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.920
It can end on the block.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.730
It can end on the D0.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.060
Or it can end on D1.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.300
So photon at the block--

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.970
well, the amplitude to be here
is one over square root of 2.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.895
The probability should be 1/2.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:49.010
Photon at D0, probability
amplitude, 1/2, probability,

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.720
1/4--

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.420
photon at D1, probability, 1/4.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:03.030
You could put another
table here-- outcome

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:09.830
all open, probability.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.120
And in this case, there's
just photon at D0.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.230
That's 1.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:22.170
And photon at D1 was 0.
