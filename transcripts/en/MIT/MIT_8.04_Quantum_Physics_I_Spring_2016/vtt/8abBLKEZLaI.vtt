BARTON ZWIEBACH: Today's
subject is momentum space.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.250
We're going to kind of discover
the relevance of momentum

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.090
space.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.360
We've been working
with wave functions

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.210
that tell you the
probabilities for finding

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.240
a particle in a given
position and that's sometimes

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.260
called coordinate
space or position space

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.620
representations of
quantum mechanics,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.200
and we just talked about
wave functions that

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.160
tell you about probabilities
to find a particle in a given

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.600
position.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.790
But as we've been
seeing with momentum,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.520
there's a very intimate relation
between momentum and position,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.600
and today we're going to
develop the ideas that

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.380
lead you to think
about momentum space

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.261
in a way that is quite
complimentary to coordinate

00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:55.760
space.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.030
Then we will be able to
talk about expectation

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.790
values of operators
and we're going

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.950
to be moved some steps into
what is called interpretation

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.600
of quantum mechanics.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.010
So operators have expectations
values in quantum mechanism--

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.540
they are defined
in a particular way

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020
and that will be
something we're going

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.070
to be doing in the second
part of the lecture.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.090
In the final part
of the lecture,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390
we will consider
the time dependence

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.980
of those expectation
values, which is again,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.950
the idea of dynamics--

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.480
if you want to understand how
your system evolves in time,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.080
the expectation value--

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.780
the things that you measure--

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.810
may change in time
and that's part

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.290
of the physics of the
problem, so this will tie

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.010
into the Schrodinger equation.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.010
So we're going to begin
with momentum space.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.310
So we'll call this
uncovering momentum space.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.900
And for much of what
I will be talking

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.660
about in the first
half of the lecture,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.530
time will not be relevant--
so time will become relevant

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.100
later.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.830
So I will be writing
wave functions that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.130
don't show the
time, but the time

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.360
could be put there everywhere
and it would make no difference

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.870
whatsoever.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.046
So you remember these
Fourier transform statements

00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:42.770
that we had that a wave
function of x we could put time,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.320
but they said let's
suppress time.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.605
It's a superposition
of plane waves.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.880
So there is a superposition
of plane waves

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.260
and we used it last time to
evolve wave packets and things

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.930
like that.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.500
And the other side of Fourier's
theorem is that phi of k

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.190
can be written by a pretty
similar integral, in which you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.960
put psi of x, you change
the sign in the exponential,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.325
and of course,
integrate now over x.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.380
Now this is the wave
function you've always

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.570
learned about first, and
then this wave function,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.920
as you can see, is encoded
by phi of k as well.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.260
If you know phi of
k, you know psi of x.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.830
And so this phi of k has the
same information in principle

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.250
as psi of x--

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.110
it tells you everything
that you need to know.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.460
We think of it as
saying, well, phi of k

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:26.700
has the same
information as psi of x.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.020
And the other thing
we've said about phi of k

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.840
is that it's the weight with
which you're superposing plane

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.320
waves to reconstruct psi of x.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.770
The Fourier transform
theorem is a representation

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.750
of the wave function in terms of
a superposition of plane waves,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.170
and here, it's the
coefficient of the wave that

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.910
accompanies each exponential.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.540
So phi of k is the
weight of the plane

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.550
waves in the superposition.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.560
So one thing we want to do is
to understand even deeper what

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.740
phi of k can mean.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.400
And so in order to do that,
we need a technical tool.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.680
Based on these
equations, one can

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.690
derive a way of representing
this object that we

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.940
call the delta function.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.800
Delta functions are pretty
useful for manipulating objects

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.650
and Fourier transforms,
so we need them.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.300
So let's try to obtain what
is called the delta function

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.500
statement.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.040
And this is done by
trying to apply these two

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.670
equations simultaneously.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.890
Like, you start
with psi of x, it's

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.980
written in terms of
phi of k, but then what

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.960
would happen if you
would substitute

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.630
the value of phi of k in here?

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.080
What kind of equation you get?

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:29.220
What you get is an equation
for a delta function.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:39.490
So you begin with psi of x
over square root of 2 pi,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.310
and I'll write it
dk e to the ikx,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.720
and now, I want
to write phi of k.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.280
So I put phi of k--

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.640
1 over square root
of 2 pi integral psi,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.070
and now I have to
be a little careful.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:08.240
In here in the second integral,
x is a variable of integration,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.180
it's a dummy variable.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.505
It doesn't have any
physical meaning, per se--

00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:16.230
it disappears after
the integration.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.110
Here, x represents a point
where we're evaluating the wave

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.980
function, so I just cannot
copy the same formula here

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.400
because it would be confusing,
it should be written with

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:35.590
a different x and x-prime.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.350
Because that x certainly
has nothing to do with the x

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.300
we're writing here.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:52.330
So here it is, we've
written now this integral.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.930
And let's rewrite it
still differently.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.200
We'll write as
integral dx-prime.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.300
We'll change the orders of
integration with impunity.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.210
If you're trying to be very
rigorous mathematically,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.010
this is something
you worry about.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.250
In physics problems
that we deal with,

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.510
it doesn't make a difference.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:20.880
So here we have dx-prime,
psi of x-prime, then

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:33.130
a 1 over 2 pi integral dk e
to the ik x minus x-prime.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.650
So this is what the
integral became.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:46.650
And you look at it and you
say, well, here is psi of x,

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.680
and it's equal to the
integral over x-prime

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.300
of psi of x-prime times
some other function

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.860
of x and x-prime.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:03.850
This is a function of x minus
x-prime, or x and x-prime

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:04.720
if you wish.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.000
It doesn't depend on
k, k is integrated.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.320
And this function,
if you recognize it,

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.490
it's what we call
a delta function.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.480
It's a function that,
multiplied with an integral,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:24.130
evaluates the integrand
at a particular point.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:30.365
So this is a delta function,
delta of x-prime minus x.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.890
That is a way these
integrals then would work.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.110
That is, when you
integrate over x-prime--

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.910
when you have x-prime
minus something,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:50.230
then the whole integral
is the integrand

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:56.210
evaluated at the point where we
say the delta function fires.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.290
So the consistency of
these two equations

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.590
means that for all
intents and purposes,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:10.230
this strange integral
is a representation

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.090
of a delta function.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.940
So we will write it down.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.460
I can do one thing here, but--

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.040
it's kind of here you see
the psi of x-prime minus x,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.360
but here you see
x minus x-prime.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.940
But that's sign, in
fact, doesn't matter.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.550
It's not there.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.560
You can get rid of it.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:41.460
Because if in this integral,
you can let K goes to minus k,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:49.300
and then the dk changes sign,
the order of integration

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.480
changes sign, and they
cancel each other.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.270
And the effect is
that you change

00:10:55.270 --> 00:11:01.180
the sign in the exponents, so
if you let k goes to minus k,

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:07.375
the integral just becomes
1 over 2 pi integral dk e

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:13.280
to the ik x-prime minus x.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.240
So we'll say that
this delta function

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.810
is equal to this thing,
exploiting this sign ambiguity

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.610
that you can always have.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.790
So I'll write it
again in the way

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.930
most people write the formula,
which is at this moment,

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.730
switching x and x-prime.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:42.340
So you will write this
delta of x minus x-prime

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:50.160
is 1 over 2 pi integral from
infinity to minus infinity dk

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.900
e to the ik x minus x-prime.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:03.120
So this is a pretty
useful formula

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.960
and we need it all the time
that we do Fourier transforms

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.350
as you will see very soon.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.240
It's a strange integral, though.

00:12:17.635 --> 00:12:22.930
If you have x equal to x-prime,
this is 0 and you get infinity.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.940
So it's a function,
it's sort of 0--

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.940
when x minus x-prime
is different from 0,

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:36.160
somehow all these
waves superimpose to 0.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.130
But when x is equal to
x-prime, it blows up.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.290
So it's does the right thing,
it morally does the right thing,

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.020
but it's a singular
kind of expression

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.050
and we therefore
manipulate it with care

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.720
and typically, we use
it inside of integrals.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.850
So it's a very nice formula,
we're going to need it,

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:06.410
and it brings here for the
first time in our course,

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.200
I guess, the delta functions.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.150
And this is something if
should-- if you have not

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.520
ever play without
the functions, this

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.820
may be something interesting
to ask in recitation

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.140
or you can try to prove, for
example, just like we show

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.940
that delta of minus x
is the same as delta

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.840
of x, the delta of
a being a number

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:40.590
times x is 1 over absolute
value of a times delta of x.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.320
Those are two simple
properties of delta functions

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:53.130
and you could practice by
just trying to prove them--

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:58.400
for example, use this integral
representation to show them.
