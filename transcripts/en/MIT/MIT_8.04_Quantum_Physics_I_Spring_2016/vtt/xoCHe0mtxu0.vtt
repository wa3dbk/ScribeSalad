00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:03.610
PROFESSOR: So
angular momentum, we

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.720
need to deal with
angular momentum,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.600
and the inspiration
for it is classical.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.400
We have L is r cross p.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.329
Classically.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:22.960
So let's try to just
use that information

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.120
and write the various operators.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.650
And in fact, we're
lucky in this case.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.890
The operators that we
would write inspired

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.610
by the classical definition
are good operators

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.900
and will do the job.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.530
So what do we have?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.300
Lx, if you remember
the cross-product rule,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.760
that would be y Pz minus z Py.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.930
Now you can think of
this thing as a cyclic,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.500
like a circle when you have x
and Px, y and Py, and z and Pz.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.290
Things are cyclically symmetric.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.020
There's no real difference
between this core.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.370
And so you can go
cyclically here.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.330
So you say, let's go
cyclical on this index.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.845
Ly is equal to the next
cyclic to y in that direction

00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:35.550
is z Px minus x Pz.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:46.104
And Lz is equal to
x Py minus y Px.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.310
And these things, I'll think
of them as the operators.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.740
Let's put hats to everything.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.430
The first thing I can
wonder with a little bit

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.449
of trepidation is maybe
I got the ordering wrong.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.100
Should I have written--

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.220
here classically,
you put r cross p,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.250
and then the order of these
two terms doesn't matter.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.660
Does it matter
quantum mechanically?

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.960
Happily, it doesn't matter
because y and Pz commute.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.650
z and Py commute,
so you could even

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.770
have written them the other
way, and they are good.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.870
All of them are ambiguous.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.510
You could have even
written them the other way,

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.600
and they would be fine.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.490
But now these are operators.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.240
And moreover, they are
Hermitian operators.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.000
Hermitian.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.130
Let's see.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.820
Lx dagger.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.010
Well, the dagger
of two operators

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.980
you would do Pz
dagger y hat dagger--

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.820
recall the dagger
changes the order--

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:21.510
minus Py dagger z dagger.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.440
Now, p and x's are all
for Hermitian operators,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.940
so this is Pz y minus Py z.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.610
And we use, again, that y and
Pz commute, and z and Py commute

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.940
to put it back in
the standard form.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.890
And that's, again, Lx.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.320
So it is an Hermitian operator.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.870
And so is Ly and Lz.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.670
That means these
operators are observables.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.190
That's all you need for the
operator to be an observable.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.500
And that's a very good thing.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.250
So these operators
are observables.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.459
Li's are observable.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.850
But they're funny properties.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.980
With these operators,
they're not

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.850
all that simple in some ways.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.390
So next we have these operators.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.110
Whenever you have
quantum operators,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.070
the thing you do next is compute
their commutators Just like we

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.800
did with x and p, we wanted to
know what that commutator is.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.450
We want to know what is the
commutator of this L operator.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.300
So we'll do Lx with Ly.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.510
Try to compute the commutators.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.160
So Lx is y Pz.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.626
Let me forget the hat,
so basically minus z Py.

00:05:22.626 --> 00:05:29.474
And Ly is z Px minus x Pz.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.830
Here is a y.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.804
The y commutes with everything
here, so the y doesn't get.

00:05:41.804 --> 00:05:45.730
The Pz gets stuck with the z
and doesn't care about this.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:52.220
So this term just
talks to that term.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.610
And here the z Py, the Py
doesn't care about anybody

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.330
here, but this z, well,
doesn't care about that z,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.100
but it does care about this Pz.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.910
So the only
contribution, there could

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.670
have been four terms out of
this commutator, but only two

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.610
are relevant.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.815
So let's write them down.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:36.530
y Pz with z Px and minus,
it's a plus z Py x Pz.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.780
Well, you can start
peeling off things.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.790
You can think of this as a
single operator with this too,

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.450
and it will fail to
commit with the first.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:07:00.500
So you have y Pz z Px.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.430
That's all this commutator gets.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.240
And the same thing here.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.990
This fails to commute just
with Pz, so the x can go out,

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.270
x z Py Pz.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:31.410
And then here the y
actually can go out,

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.100
doesn't care about this
z, goes out on the left.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.860
Not that it matters
much here, but that's

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:45.170
how using the commutator
identities does.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:52.748
And this Py can go out and
let's go out on the right, z Pz.

00:07:55.556 --> 00:07:58.070
And basing this
on this identity,

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:03.620
we just have A BC
commutator and then

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:09.500
AB C commutators, how
things distribute.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:25.195
Now, this is minus i h
bar, and this is i h bar.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:40.527
So here we get i h
bar x Py minus y Px.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.800
See everything came out
in the right position.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.220
And you recognize
that operator as Lz.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:09:05.160
So this commutator
here has given you

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:14.330
Lx with Ly equal i h bar Lz.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:20.350
It's a very interesting
and fascinating property

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.450
that somehow you're
doing this commutator,

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.560
it could have been
a mess, but it

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:33.060
combined to give you another
angular momentum operator.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.440
Now, it looks like a
miracle, but physically,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.540
it's not that miraculous.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.170
It actually has to do with
the concept of symmetry.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.300
Symmetry transformations.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.700
If you have a symmetry
transformation

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.270
and you do commutators within
those symmetry operators,

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.350
you must get an operator that
corresponds to that symmetry,

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.960
or you must get a symmetry
at the very least.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.830
So if we say that the potential
has very close symmetry,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.680
that suggests that
when you do operations

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.160
with these operators
that generate rotation,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.450
you should get
some rotation here.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.610
And alternatively,
although, again,

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.860
this is suggestive, it
can be made very precise,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.890
when you do rotations
in different order,

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.760
you don't get the
same thing at the end.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.180
Everybody knows
if you have a page

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.840
and you do one rotation
and then the other

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.220
as opposed to the other
and then the first one,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.780
you don't get the same thing.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.410
Rotations do not commute.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.870
A single rotation does
commute in one direction,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.900
but rotations in different
directions don't commute.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.530
That is the reason
for this equation.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.400
And this equation, as we
said, everything is cyclic.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.970
so you don't have to
work again to argue

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:14.290
that then Ly Lz, going cyclic,
must be equal to i h bar Lx.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:21.840
And that Lz Lx
must be i h bar Ly.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.140
And this is called the quantum
algebra of angular momentum.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:43.040
In fact, it is so important
that this algebra appears

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.160
in all fields of
physics and mathematics,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.880
and all kinds of things show up.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:57.000
This algebra is related to
the algebra of generators

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.270
of the group SU2, Special
Unitary Transformations in Two

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.390
Dimensions.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.880
It is related to
the orthogonal group

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.450
in three dimensions
where you rotate things

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.920
in three-dimensional space.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.990
It is here, the algebra of
operators and in a sense,

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.920
it's a deeper result
than the derivation.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.850
It is one of those cases when
you start with something very

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.170
concrete and you suddenly
discover a structure

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.780
that is rather universal.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.850
Because we started with very
concrete representation of L's

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.610
in terms of y P's
and all these things.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:49.660
But then they form a
consistent unit by themselves.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.890
So sometimes there
will be operators

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.880
that satisfy these
relations, and they

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:04.040
don't come from x's and P's,
but still they satisfy that.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.850
And that's what happens
with spin angular momentum.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.410
The spin angular
momentum operators will

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:21.740
be denoted with Sx,
for example, and Sy

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:27.040
will have i h bar spin
in the z direction,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.430
and the others will follow.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.880
But nevertheless
nobody will ever

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.810
be able to write spin
as something like that

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.680
because it's not,
but spin exists.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.030
And it's because
this structure is

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:53.650
more general than the situation
that allowed us to discover it.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.850
It's a lot more general
and a lot more profound.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:03.730
So in fact, mathematicians don't
even mention angular momentum.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.380
They say, let's study.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.950
The subject of Lie
algebra is the subject

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:17.100
of classifying all possible
consistent commutation

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.670
relations.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.780
And this is the first
non-trivial example they have,

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:27.298
and they studied the
books on this algebra.
