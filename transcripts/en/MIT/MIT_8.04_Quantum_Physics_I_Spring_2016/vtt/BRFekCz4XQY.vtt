00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.580
PROFESSOR: Important
thing to do is to just try

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.410
to understand one more thing.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.800
The creation and annihilation
operators-- what do they

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.030
do to those states?

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.490
You see, a creation operator
will I add one more a dagger,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.750
so somehow must change
phi n into phi n plus 1.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.920
A destruction operator with an a
will kill one of these factors,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.950
and therefore it will give
you a state with lower number

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.600
of phi n minus 1.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.290
And we would like to know
the precise relations.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.310
So look at this.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.270
Let's do with an A on phi n.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.171
And we know it should be
roughly phi n minus 1.

00:00:56.171 --> 00:01:01.080
This is one destruction
operator, but we can do it.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:08.620
Look-- this is 1 over
square root of n.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:16.340
A times a dagger to the n phi 0.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.041
A with a dagger to the n phi 0,
we can replace by a commutator

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:25.540
again.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:35.450
Commutator of a, a
dagger to the n phi 0.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.630
This is 1 over square
root of n factorial,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.700
and here we get a
factor of n times

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.300
a dagger to the n minus 1 phi 0.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.700
You know, it's all a matter
of those commutators we

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.960
on the left blackboard.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:10.190
But this state--
by definition, we

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.350
have n square root
of n factorial.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.280
That's state, by definition,
is phi n minus 1 times

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.160
square root of n
minus 1 factorial.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.360
See, by looking at this
definition and saying,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.230
suppose I have n minus 1, n
minus 1, this is phi n minus 1.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.980
So n minus 1 a
daggers on phi 0 is

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.610
n minus 1 factorial square
root multiplied phi n minus 1.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.750
And now we can simplify this--

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.660
square root of n
factorial and square root

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.450
of n minus 1 factorial
gives you just a factor

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.090
of square root of
n that with this n

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.206
here, this square root
of n, phi n minus 1.

00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:09.220
Sop there we go--

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.830
here is the first relation.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.320
A is really a lowering operator.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.600
It gives you an
eigenstate 1 less energy,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.510
but it gives it with a
factor of square root of n,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.180
that if you care
about normalizations,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.490
you better keep it.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.640
That factor is there because
the overall normalization

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.050
of this equation was designed
to make the states normalized.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.530
Similarly, we can do
the other operation,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.470
which is what is a
dagger acting on phi n.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.590
This would be 1 over
square root of n factorial,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.045
but this time a dagger to
the n plus 1 on phi n, phi 0.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.730
Because you had already
a dagger to the n,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.220
and you put one more a dagger.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.790
But this thing is equal to what?

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.490
This is equal to square root
of n plus 1 factorial times

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.270
phi n plus 1.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.640
From the definition--

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.210
I hope you're not getting dizzy.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.120
Lots of factors here.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.400
But now you see that the n
part of the factorial cancels,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.640
and you get that
a hat dagger phi

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.810
n is equal to square root
of n plus 1 phi n plus 1.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.310
OK let's do an application.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.020
Suppose somebody asks
you to calculate example.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.770
The expectation
value of the operator

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:34.880
x on phi n, the expectation
value of p on phi n.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.960
How much are they?

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.330
OK.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.440
This, of course, in conventional
language, at first sight

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.790
looks prohibitive.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.060
I would have to get those phi n
[? in ?] some Hermit polynomial

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.050
hn, for which I don't know
the closed form expression.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.000
It's a very large
polynomial, jumps 2 by 2,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.900
there is exponentials, I
will have to do an integral.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.090
That's something that
we don't want to do.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.710
So how can we do it
without doing integrals?

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.030
Well, this one's-- actually, you
can do without doing anything.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.950
You don't have to do integrals,
you don't have to calculate.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.940
The answers are kind
of obvious, if you

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.000
think about it the right way.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.620
That's not the obvious part,
to think about the right way.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.840
But here it is.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.830
Look, what is this integral?

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:53.780
This is the integral of x times
phi and of x, those are real,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.800
quantity squared.

00:06:58.978 --> 00:07:05.330
And the phi n's are either even
or odd, but the fight n squared

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.950
are even.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.220
And x is odd.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.182
So this integral should be 0,
and we shouldn't even bother.

00:07:15.182 --> 00:07:17.500
That's it.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.970
Momentum.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.570
Expectation value
of the momentum.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.480
All these are stationary states.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.920
Cannot have momentum.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.340
If it had momentum, here
is the harmonic oscillator,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.660
here is the wave function.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.980
If it has momentum, half
an hour later it's here.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.310
It's impossible.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.050
This thing cannot have momentum.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.510
This must be 0 as well.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.250
OK.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.590
Now this one is
something you actually

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.990
proved in the first test--

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.000
the expectation value
of the momentum operator

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.340
on a bound state with a
real wave function was 0.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.840
And you did it by integration--
but in fact you proved it

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.530
in two ways, in momentum
space, in coordinate space,

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.970
is [? back ?] the same thing.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.680
OK.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.410
So these ones were too easy.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.110
So let's try to
see if we can find

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.130
something more difficult to do.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:21.020
Well, actually, before doing
that I will do them anyway

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.500
with this notation.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.830
So what would I have here?

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:34.235
I would have phi n x phi n.

00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:37.330
And I say, oh, I don't know
how to do things with x.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.720
That's a terrible thing.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.539
I would have to do integrals.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.309
But then you say, no.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:48.630
X-- I can write in terms
of a and a daggers.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.520
And a and a daggers you
know how to manipulate.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.740
So this is a formula
we wrote last time,

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:03.410
and it's that x is equal to
square root of h over 2m omega,

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.200
a plus a dagger.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.860
So x is proportional
to a plus a dagger.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:18.910
So here is a square root
of h, 2m omega, phi n,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:23.135
a plus a dagger, on phi n.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:38.210
Now, this is 0, and why is that?

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:46.270
Because this term is
a acting on phi n.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.860
Well, we have it there--

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.930
is square root of
n, phi n minus 1.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:59.270
And a dagger acting on
phi n is square root of n

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.450
plus 1, phi n plus 1.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:14.790
But the overlap of phi
n minus 1 with phi n

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.410
is 0, because all these
states with different energies

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.210
are orthogonal.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.160
It's probably a
property I should

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.370
have written somewhere here.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.510
Which is-- not only
they're well-normalized,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:36.735
but phi n phi m is delta nm.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.560
If the numbers are
different, it's zero.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.880
And you see this is
something intuitively clear.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.110
If you wish, I'll just
say here-- these are 0,

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.650
and this is 0 because the
numbers are different.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.600
If you have, for
example, a phi 2

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:13.960
and phi 3, or let's do
the phi 3 and a phi 2,

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:21.730
then you have roughly a dagger,
a dagger, a dagger, phi 0,

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.430
a dagger, a dagger, phi 0.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:33.005
And then is equal to phi 0,
three a's, and two a daggers.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.050
Correct?

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.840
And now you say, OK,
this a is ready to kill

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.880
what is on the right hand side.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.090
On the right side to it.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.190
But it can't because
there are a daggers.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.250
But that a is going to kill
at least one of the a daggers.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.150
So an a kills an a dagger.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:03.810
The second a will kill the
only a dagger that is left.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.250
And now you have an a
that is ready to go here,

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.690
no obstacle whatsoever,
and kills the phi 0,

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.310
so this is zero.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.120
So each time there are
some different number

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:21.280
of eight daggers on the left
input and the right input,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.090
you get 0.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:29.020
If you have more a
daggers on the right,

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.915
then move them to
the left, and now you

00:12:31.915 --> 00:12:34.990
will have more a's than a
daggers and the same problem

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.100
will happen.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.060
The only way to get something
to work is they are the same.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.440
But this of course is
guaranteed by our older theorems

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.840
that the--

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.030
eigenstates, if
Hermitian operators

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.890
with different eigenvalues
are orthogonal.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:58.420
So this is nice to check
things, but it's not something

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.170
that you need to check.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:02.830
All right.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:07.210
So now let's say you
want to calculate

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:16.780
the the uncertainty
of x in phi n.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.280
Well, the uncertainty
of x squared

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.980
is the expectation
value of x squared

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:29.840
and phi n minus the expectation
value of x on phi n.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.720
On this already we know is 0,
but now we have a computation

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.300
worth our tools.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:45.160
Let's calculate the expectation
value of x squared in phi n.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.470
And if you had to do it
with Hermit polynomials,

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:55.890
it's essentially
a whole days work.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.870
Maybe a little
less if you started

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:02.160
using recursion relations and
invent all kinds of things

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.330
to do it.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.220
It's a nightmare,
this calculation.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.440
But look how we do it here.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:19.110
We say, all right, this is
phi n x hat squared phi n.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:28.140
But x hat squared would be h
bar over 2m omega, phi n times

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:34.620
a plus a dagger time
a plus a dagger phi n.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:50.890
Now I must decide what to
do, and one possibility

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:56.540
is to try to be clever and
do all kinds of things.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.420
Now, you could do
several things here,

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.540
and none is a lot
better than the other.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.120
And all of them
take little time.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.650
You have to develop
a strategy here,

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:20.710
but this is sufficiently doable
that we can do it directly.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.830
So what does it
mean doing directly?

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.200
Just multiply those operators.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:33.810
So you have phi n times a
a plus a dagger a dagger

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:40.660
plus a a dagger plus a dagger a.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.676
All that on phi n.

00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:50.415
I just multiplied, and
now I try to think again.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:16:00.150
And I say oh, the first term
is to annihilation operators

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.500
acting on phi n.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.440
The first is go give
you phi n minus 1.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:11.420
Second is going to give me a phi
n minus 2 by the time it acts.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:19.290
And a phi n minus 2 is
orthogonal to a phi n.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.730
So this term cannot contribute.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:29.740
You know, this term has
two more a's than this one.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.790
So as we just sort
of illustrated,

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.190
but it just doesn't match.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:39.810
These two terms acting on phi n
would give you a phi n minus 2.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.250
And that's orthogonal.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.790
So this term cannot do anything.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:49.210
Nor can this,
because both raise.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.570
So this will end up
as phi n plus two,

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:58.410
for example, using that
top property over there.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.900
Over there-- the
box equation there.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.290
If you have two a
daggers acting on phi n,

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.050
you will end up
with a phi n plus 2.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:11.160
So this term also
doesn't contribute.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.609
And that's progress-- the
calculation became half as

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:18.280
difficult.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.099
OK, that-- now we--

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:24.740
maybe it's a little
more interesting.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.200
But again, you should
you should refuse

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.030
to do a [? long ?] computation.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.160
Whenever you're looking
at those things,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.380
you have the temptation
to calculate--

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.990
refuse that temptation.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:41.100
Look at things and let it
become clear what's going on.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.680
There are two terms here--

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.320
a dagger and a dagger a.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.720
That's not even a
commutator, it's sort of

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.380
like an anti-commutator.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.470
That's strange.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:57.460
But this, a dagger
a, is familiar.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.115
That's n.

00:17:59.115 --> 00:18:00.650
The operator n.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.620
And we know the n eigenvalue, so
this is going to be very easy.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.954
This is n hat.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.440
The other one is not
n hat, because it's

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.720
in the wrong order.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.005
N hat has a dagger a.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:31.290
But this operator can be
written as the commutator

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.660
plus the thing in
reverse order--

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.990
that equation we
had on top-- ab is

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.660
equal to ab commutator plus ba.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:47.310
So this is equal to a a
dagger plus a dagger a.

00:18:50.538 --> 00:18:55.640
And this is 1.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.800
Plus another n hat.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.150
So look-- when you have
a and a dagger multiply,

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.561
it's either n hat or
it's 1 plus n hat.

00:19:10.267 --> 00:19:17.470
And Therefore x squared
expectation value has become

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:24.970
h bar over 2mw phi m, and
this whole parenthesis

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:31.280
is 1 plus 2 n hat phi n.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:42.210
And this is h bar over 2mw,
phi n, and this is a number.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.960
Because phi in is
an n hat eigenstate.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:52.300
So it's 1 plus two little
n, phi n phi times 1

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.544
plus two [? little ?] n.

00:19:55.544 --> 00:19:58.290
And here is our final answer--

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.130
expectation value
of x squared is

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:11.980
equal to h bar over and m
omega, n plus 1/2 phi n.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.010
This is a fairly
non-trivial computation.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:28.110
And that is, of course, because
the expectation value of x

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:33.420
is equal to zero, is the
uncertainty or x squared.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:41.800
It grows, the state is bigger,
as the quantum number n grows.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.710
By a similar computation,
you can calculate

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.320
that you will do
in the homework,

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.650
the expectation value
of b squared and phi n,

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:56.980
and then you will see how
much is delta x, delta p,

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.120
on the [INAUDIBLE] on phi n.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.240
How much it is.
