00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.488
PROFESSOR: Uncertainty.

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:12.020
When you talk about random
variables, random variable Q,

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.740
we've said that it has
values Q1 up to, say, Qn,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.532
and probabilities
P1 up to Pn, we

00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:28.090
speak of a standard
deviation, delta Q,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.910
as the uncertainty,
the standard deviation.

00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:40.030
And how is that standard
deviation defined?

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.190
Well you begin by
making sure you

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.500
know what is the
expectation value of the--

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.420
or the average value of
this random variable,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.300
which was defined, last
time, I think I put braces,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.900
but bar is kind
of nice sometimes

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.410
too, at least for
random variables,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.340
and it's the sum of
the Pi times the Qi.

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:12.220
The uncertainty is also
some expectation value.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.520
And expectation
value of deviation.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.215
So the uncertainty squared
is the expectation value,

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:31.530
sum over i, of deviations of the
random variable from the mean.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.710
So you calculate
the expected value

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.460
of the difference of your random
variable and the mean squared,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.860
and that is the square of
the standard deviation.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.230
Now this is the definition.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.760
And it's a very nice
definition because it

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.200
makes a few things clear.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.530
For example, the left hand
side is delta Q squared, which

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.180
means it's a positive number.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.470
And the right hand side
is also a positive number,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.680
because you have probabilities
times differences of quantities

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.100
squared.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.756
So this is all greater
and equal to zero.

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:23.880
And moreover, you can
actually say the following.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.080
If the uncertainty, or the
standard deviation, is zero,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.210
the random variable
is not that random.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.240
Because if this whole thing
is 0, this delta squared,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.990
delta Q squared must be
0 and this must be 0.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.480
But each term here is positive.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.400
So each term must be 0,
because of any one of them

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.420
was not equal to zero, you would
get a non-zero contribution.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.710
So any possible Qi that must
have a Pi different from 0

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.480
must be equal to Qbar.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.090
So if delta cubed
is equal to 0, Qi

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.164
is equal to Q as
not random anymore.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.070
OK, now we can simplify
this expression.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.220
Do the following.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.072
By simplifying, I mean
expand the right-hand side.

00:03:49.072 --> 00:04:02.360
So sum over i, Pi Qi
squared, minus 2 sum over i,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:15.710
Pi Qi Q bar plus sum
over i, Pi Q bar squared.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.040
This kind of thing
shows up all the time,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.870
shows up in quantum mechanic as
well, as we'll see in a second.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.720
And you need to be able
to see what's happenening.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.750
Here, you're having
the expectation value

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.925
of Qi squared.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.280
That's the definition of
a bar of some variable,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.910
you'd multiply with variable
by the exponent of [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.830
What is this?

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.360
This a little more funny.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.910
First, you should know
that Q bar is a number,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.375
so it can go out.

00:04:57.375 --> 00:05:01.280
So it's minus 2 Q bar.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.580
And then all that is left is
this, but that's another Q bar.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.070
So it's another Q bar.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.760
And here, you take this one
out because it's a number,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.950
and the sum of the
probabilities is 1,

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.620
so it's Q bar squared as well.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.240
And it always comes out
that way, this minus 2

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.350
Q bar squared plus
Q bar squared.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.190
So at the end, Delta Q, it's
another famous property,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:44.190
is the mean of the square
minus the square of the mean.

00:05:51.854 --> 00:05:57.630
And from this, since this
is greater or equal than 0,

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.370
you always conclude that
the mean of the square

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.420
is always bigger than the--

00:06:09.384 --> 00:06:11.854
maybe I shouldn't
have the i here,

00:06:11.854 --> 00:06:17.850
I think it's a random
variable Q squared.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.050
So the mean, the square of
this is greater or equal

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.522
than Q bar squared.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.040
OK.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.721
Well, what happens
in quantum mechanics,

00:06:36.721 --> 00:06:46.480
let give you the definition and
a couple of ways of writing it.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.730
So here comes the definition.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.660
It's inspired by this thing.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:07:01.210
So in quantum mechanics,
permission operator Q

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.500
will define the uncertainty
of Q in the state,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:15.110
Psi O squared as the
expectation value

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:29.890
of Q squared minus the
expectation value of Q squared.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.010
Those are things that you
know in quantum mechanics,

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.145
how you're supposed to compute.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.760
Because you know what
an expectation value

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.240
is in any state Psi.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.190
You so Psi star,
the operator, Psi.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.900
And here you do this
thing, so it's all clear.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.250
So it's a perfectly
good definition.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.990
Maybe it doesn't give
you too much insight yet,

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.620
but let me say two
things, and we'll leave

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.600
them to complete for next time.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:15.980
Which is claim one, one,
that Delta Q squared

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:21.240
Psi can be written
as the expectation

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:32.002
value of Q minus absolute
expectation value of Q squared.

00:08:32.002 --> 00:08:32.940
Like that.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.360
Look.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.780
It looks funny, and
we'll elaborate this,

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.159
but the first claim is that
this is a possible re-writing.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:49.390
You can write this uncertainty
as a single expectation value.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:56.950
This is the analog of this
equation in quantum mechanics.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:03.750
Claim two is another re-writing.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:14.150
Delta Q squared on Psi
can be re-written as this.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.427
That's an integral.

00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:29.470
Q minus Q and Psi.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.750
Look at that.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:39.200
You act on Psi with the
operator, Q, and multiplication

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.905
by the expectation value
of Q. This is an operator,

00:09:41.905 --> 00:09:44.280
this is a number
multiplied by Psi.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.670
You can add to this on
the [? wave ?] function,

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.460
you can square it,
and then integrate.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.590
And that is also
the uncertainty.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.890
We'll show these
two things next time

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:06.630
and show one more thing that
the uncertainty vanishes

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:13.400
if and only if the state
is an ideal state of Q.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.681
So If the state that
you are looking for

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:20.321
is an ideal state of Q,
you have no uncertainty.

00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:23.870
And if you have no
uncertainty, the state

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.500
must be an ideal state
of Q. So those all things

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.960
will come from this planes, that
we'll elaborate on next time.
