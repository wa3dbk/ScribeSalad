00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.870
PROFESSOR: Today's lecture
continues the thing we're

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.450
doing with scattering states.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.545
We send in a scattering state.

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:14.380
That is an energy eigenstate
that cannot be normalized

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.940
into a step barrier.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.040
And we looked at
what could happen.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.990
And we saw all kinds of
interesting things happening.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.500
There was reflection
and transmission

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.070
when the energy was
higher than the barrier.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.260
And there was just reflection
and a little exponential decay

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.410
in the forbidden region
if the energy was lower

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.180
than the energy of the barrier.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.780
We also observed when we
did the packet analysis

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.900
that a wave packet
sent in would have

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.490
a delay in coming back out.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.740
It doesn't come out immediately.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.550
And that's the property
of those complex numbers

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.270
that entered into the
reflection coefficient.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.250
Those complex
numbers were a phase

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.150
that had an energy dependence.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.810
And by the time you're done with
analyzing how the wave packet

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.870
is moving, there was a delay.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.800
So today we're going to
see another effect that

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.360
is sometimes called
resonant transmission.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.640
And it's a rather famous.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.630
Led to the so-called
Ramsauer-Townsend effect.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.950
So we'll discuss that.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.100
And then turn for the last
half an hour into the setup

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.740
where we can analyze more
general scattering problems.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.670
So let's begin with this
Ramsauer-Townsend effect.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:57.995
And Ramsauer Townsend effect.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.110
Before discussing
phenomenologically

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.970
what was involved
in this effect,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.460
let's do the mathematical
and physics analysis

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.510
of a [INAUDIBLE] problem
relevant to this effect.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.790
And for that [INAUDIBLE] problem
we have the finite square well.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.070
We've normalized
this square well.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.450
Having width to a.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.050
So it extends from minus a to a.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.930
That's x equals 0.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.100
And there's a number minus v0.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.230
v0 we always define
it to be positive.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.350
Therefore, v0 is the
depth of this potential.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.560
And the question, is what
happens if you send in a wave?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.170
So you're sending in a particle.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.950
And you want to know
what will happen to it.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.270
Will it get reflected?

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.360
Will it get transmitted?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.600
What probabilities
for reflection, what

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.810
probabilities for transmission?

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.990
So of course, we would have to
send a wave packet to represent

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.460
the physical particle.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.660
But we've learned that dealing
with energy eigenstates

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.040
teaches us the most
important part of the story.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.980
If a particle has some
energy, well roughly,

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.740
it will tend to behave
the way an energy

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.350
eigenstate of that energy does,
as far as reflection and as far

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.940
as transmission is concerned.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.050
So we'll set up a wave.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.150
And there's a coefficient A.
So there's an Ae to the ikx.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.710
That is our wave.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.120
And it's moving to the right.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.810
Because you remember
the time factor,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.310
e to the minus iet over h bar.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.980
And when you put
them together, you

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.610
see that it's
moving to the right.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.480
But presumably, there
will be a reflection here.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.560
The wave comes in, and
some gets reflected

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.790
and some gets transmitted.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.810
And the part that gets
transmitted probably

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.490
will get partially reflected
back here and partially

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.780
transmitted forward.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.230
But the part that is
partially reflected

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.790
will get again reflected here
and partially transmitted back.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.340
It seems like a
never ending process

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.050
of which, if you think
physically what's happening,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.210
there's a reflection
at the first barrier.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.630
Now you say, wait a moment.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.360
Why would there be a reflection?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.420
Classically, there would
never be a reflection.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.500
If the potential goes
down, the particle

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.280
would just be able to continue.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.010
We had reflection
when we had a barrier.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.650
Well in quantum mechanics,
any change in the potential

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.590
is bound to produce
a reflection.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.960
So yes, if you have a
potential like this,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.080
like a jumping board,
and you come in here,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.150
there's a tiny
probability that you

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.790
will be reflected as you come
into this potential drop.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.640
So OK, so this
will be reflection.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.940
So at the end of the day,
there might be many bouncings.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.100
If you imagine a
particle doing this.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.860
Some probability of reflection,
some of transmission.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.220
But the end of the day,
there will be some wave

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.410
moving to the left here.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.290
So we'll represent it
by Be to the minus ikx.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:00.230
So in this region,
we have A and a wave

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.670
with amplitude B going this way.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.670
In the middle region,
the same will be true.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.570
There will be some
wave going here,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.840
and some wave that bounces
due to this reflection.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.225
So there will be a--

00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:18.130
I don't know what
letters I used.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.420
I'd better keep the same.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.720
C in this direction and
D in this direction.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.140
And now I would
have Ce to the ikx.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.610
Well, that e to the
ikx is not quite right.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.120
Because k here, k squared
represents the energy.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.720
k is the momentum and
k squared is energy.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.350
So if you have an
energy eigenstate-- oh,

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.050
my picture is very crowded.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.420
So I'll do it anyway.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.740
A is here.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.205
Maybe I'll put C and D here.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:17.250
And now with A and B here I
can write this as the energy.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.095
You have a particle with
some energy coming in.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.375
And there is this wave
here and k squared.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.640
It's 2mE over h squared.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.140
E is positive scattering states.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:47.260
And indeed, E from that equation
is h squared k squared over 2m.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.070
What do you know?

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.850
But at this point,
the total energy,

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.530
kinetic energy of the
particle is bigger.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.810
If e is replaced
by e plus v0, which

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.720
is the magnitude of this drop.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:11.490
So here there will be a k2x
plus De to the minus ik2x.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:20.050
And k2 refers because it's
region two, presumably.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.610
People use that
name. k2 squared will

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:30.560
be 2me plus v0 over h squared.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.230
And finally, to the right
of the potential square

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.480
well there will
be just one wave.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.039
Because intuitively,
we should be

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.820
able to interpret
this as some wave that

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:52.250
goes through, but has nothing
to make it bounce or reflect.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.370
So we try to get
the solution, which

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.710
will have just some wave
going in this direction.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:04.250
And it's called Fe to the ikx.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:10.480
And I can go back to
the label k because you

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.750
have the same energy
available as kinetic energy

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.300
you had to the left
of the barrier.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.280
OK, so we've set up the problem.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.050
The wave function I
would have to write it

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.600
as three expressions.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.650
One for x less than a, one for
x in between a and minus a,

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.100
and one for x greater than a.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.165
And those are this one,
two, and three formulas.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.610
Any questions about
this setup so far?

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.620
OK.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:05.280
Well, at this moment
you will eventually

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.370
have some practice on that.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:12.530
The thing that you want to do is
relate the various coefficients

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:17.040
and define some reflection
and transmission coefficients.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.720
We saw we had to think in
terms of probability current.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.130
That's the better
way to get an idea

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.540
of what you should call
reflection or transmission

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.460
coefficient.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.020
So we have to be careful with
the case of the step potential

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.050
when we compared the
meaning of the wave that

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.790
was moving to the right.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.540
The amplitude divided
by the incoming wave

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.540
was not quite the
transmission coefficient.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.900
But in this case,
the nice thing is

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.760
that the wave to the left
and the wave to the right

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.740
are experiencing
the same potential.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.460
So they can be
compared directly.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:10.510
So I will be able to conjecture,
it's reasonable to conjecture

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.900
that we can define
reflection and transmission

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.640
coefficients as follows.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.830
We'll have a
reflection coefficient

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:25.720
should be B over A squared.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.225
B represents a reflected
wave, A the incoming wave.

00:11:30.225 --> 00:11:34.990
The transmission
coefficient you may guess

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:40.650
that it's F over A squared.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.680
And this all will
make sense if we

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.330
have the reflection plus the
transmission is equal to 1.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:12:00.010
So we have current
conservation, conservation.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:05.470
And the current, which
is the net probability

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:12.880
flow to the left of the barrier
or the depression over here,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:24.440
is J on the left is proportional
to A squared minus B squared.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.140
You remember, we
computed it last time.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.420
If you compute the probability
current to this Ae to the ikx

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:36.350
plus Be to the minus ikx,
you get two contributions.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.050
Essentially A squared
minus B squared.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:44.630
There's a factor of h
bar k over m in front.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:53.360
At any rate, this should be
equal to the current that is

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.490
flowing out in this direction.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:00.290
You see, whatever current
is coming in to the left

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.290
must be the current
going out to the right.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:09.700
So this is f squared.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.640
So current conservation
really tells you

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:20.390
that A squared minus B
squared is equal to F squared.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.990
And if you pass the
B to the other side,

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:31.210
you get A squared equal
B squared plus F squared.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.700
And dividing by
A squared you get

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:41.540
1 is equal to B over A
squared plus F over A squared.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:47.020
And that's the reflection
plus the transmission

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.870
So the way we've defined
things makes sense.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:57.040
Reflection and transmission
are properly defined.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:05.570
And this is because current
conservation works well.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:11.570
So reflection coefficient
is essentially

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:16.210
the flux in the reflected,
the probability current

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.760
or in the flux in the
reflected wave compared

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.610
to the flux in
the incoming wave.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.870
The transmission is the
probability current or flux

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.550
of probability in the
transmitted wave compared

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.470
with the one incoming wave.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.430
So you've done all
of this set up.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.890
Now you can't avoid,
however, doing

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:44.930
a little bit of calculation,
which is boundary conditions.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.520
You have one, two, three,
four, five variables.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:56.540
And somehow, you want to
calculate these ratios.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.850
So you have to say that the
wave function and the derivative

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.500
is continuous at this point.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.670
And the wave function
and the derivative

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.410
is continuous and this point.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.850
That would give you
four conditions.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.230
And that's reasonable.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.210
We have five variables.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.240
But you know, the
overall normalization

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.500
could never be determined.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.490
So things can be
determined in terms of A.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.330
So you can expect that
with four equations

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.340
you can solve for B, C,
D, and F in terms of A.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.120
But the overall scale of
this total wave function

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.140
is undetermined.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.900
Its boundary conditions
will give you constraints,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.360
but it will never
determine the magnitude,

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.420
the overall magnitude
of an energy eigenstate.
