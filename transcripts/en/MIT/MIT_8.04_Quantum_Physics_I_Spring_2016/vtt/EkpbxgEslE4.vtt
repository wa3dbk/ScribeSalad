00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.010
PROFESSOR: Let's do
E less than V not.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.660
So we're back here.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.470
And now of the energy e
here is v not is x equal 0.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.970
X-axis.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.710
And that's the situation.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.985
Now you could solve this again.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:29.310
And do your
calculations once more.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.530
But we can do this
in an easier way

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.320
by trusting the principle
of analytic continuation.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.920
In this case, it's very
clear and very unambiguous.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.250
So the big words,
analytic continuation,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.610
don't carry all the
mathematical depth.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.460
But it's a nice, simple thing.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.420
We first say that the solution
is the same for x less than 0.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.010
So for x less than 0, we
write the same solution.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.450
Because the energy
is greater than 0,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.540
or all what we said
here, the value of k

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.590
squared, a into the ikhd
e to the minus i k x.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.450
It's all good.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.570
And k squared is still
2 m e over h squared.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.360
The problem is the region
where x is greater than 0.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.490
Because there you
have an exponential.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.940
But now you must have
a decaying exponential.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.450
But we know how
that should work.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.850
It should really be an e
to the minus some kappa x.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.400
So how could I achieve that?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.120
If I let k bar replace--

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.060
everywhere you see k bar,
replace it by i kappa.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:13.160
Park then one thing
that happens is that--

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.130
you learn from here,
from this k bar squared,

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.250
would be minus kappa
squared equal to that.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:29.300
So kappa squared would be 2 m,
v not minus e over h squared.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.860
The sign is just the
opposite from this equation.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.310
That's what that equation
becomes upon that substitution.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.860
Now that substitution would
not make any difference, how

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.390
they put a plus i or minus
i, I wouldn't have gotten

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.060
my sine change, and this.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.350
But if I look at
the solution there,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.490
the solution psi becomes--

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:06.240
on the region x greater than
0, turns into c, e to the i.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.340
kappa bar is a i kappa x.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.870
Therefore, it's equal to
c, e to the minus kappa

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.880
x, which is the right thing.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.500
And that sine that I
chose, of letting k equal i

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.480
kappa proves necessary
to get the right thing.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.240
So it's clear that to get the
right thing, you have that.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.170
And now you know
that, of course,

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.310
if you would have written the
equation from the beginning,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.540
you would have said,
yes, in this region,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.880
there is a decaying thing.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.670
And looking at the
Schrodinger equation,

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.610
you have concluded that
kappa is given by [? that. ?]

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.610
But the place where
you now save the time

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.670
is that, since I just must do
this change in the equations,

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.580
I can do that change in
the solutions as well.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.920
And I don't have to write the
continuity equations again,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.960
nor solve them.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.020
I can take the solutions
and let everywhere

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.200
that was a kappa bar replaced by
i, that was a k bar, replace it

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.930
by i kappa bar.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.364
So what do we get?

00:04:22.364 --> 00:04:27.020
It should go here and
believe those circuits.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.900
OK, so b over a,
that used to be.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.790
Top blackboard there.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:48.180
Middle, k minus k bar
becomes k plus i--

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.260
no, minus I k bar,
minus i kappa.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.960
And k plus i kappa.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.880
so it has changed.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.900
Suddenly this ratio
has become complex.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.330
It's kind of interesting.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.910
Well, let's make it clearer
by factoring a minus i here.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.120
So this becomes kappa.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.200
And you need plus k, so this
must be plus i k over i.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.660
This would be kappa minus i k.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:36.460
So this is just minus kappa
plus i k over kappa minus i k.

00:05:43.555 --> 00:05:46.730
But when you see
that ratio, you're

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:53.370
seeing the ratio of two complex
numbers of equal length.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.900
And therefore, that
ratio is just a phase.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.580
It's not any magnitude.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.240
So this is just a phase,
and it deserves a new name.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.320
There is a phase shift
between the b coefficient

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.270
and the a coefficient.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.170
And we'll write it as e minus--

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.160
the minus I'll keep.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.930
e to the 2 i delta.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.180
That depends on the energy.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.050
I'll put delta of the energy,
because after all, kappa, k,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.030
everybody depends on the energy.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:38.380
So let's call it 2 i delta of e.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.235
And what is delta of e?

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.500
Well, think of the
number kappa plus i k.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.750
This is the k, i k here.

00:06:55.552 --> 00:06:58.800
The angle-- this complex
number has an angle

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.700
that, in fact, is delta.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.000
e to i delta is that phase.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.070
And delta is the arc
tangent, k over kappa.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:16.250
So I'll write it like that.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.150
Delta.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.495
Now you get a delta from the
numerator, a minus delta,

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:24.740
as you can imagine,
from the denominator.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.080
And that's why you get
a total 2 i delta here.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:36.010
So delta of e is 10
minus 1, k over kappa.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:45.060
And if you look at what k
and kappa were, k over kappa

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.120
is like the ratio of the
square root of the energy

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.390
over v not minus the energy.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:08:01.780
So delta of e is equal to 10
minus 1 square root of energy

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.040
over e v not minus and energy.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.940
Now I got the question
about current conservation.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.450
What happens to current
conservation this time?

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:28.510
Well, you have all
these waves here.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.919
But on the region x greater
than 0, the solution is real.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:38.720
If the solution is real, there
is no probability current

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.289
on the right.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:47.300
There's really no probability
that you get this thing,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.550
and you get current
flowing there.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.010
And you get this
pulse, or whatever

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.400
you send to keep moving and
moving and moving to the right.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.070
Indeed, the solution decays.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.810
And it looks like the one of
the bound state in this region.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.167
So eventually there's
no current here,

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:06.500
because there's no current here.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.250
No current there.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:07.958
No current there.

00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.920
Because the solution drops down.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.760
But it's a real solution anyway.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.780
So there's no current there.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:20.390
So Ja-- Jc is equal to 0.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.090
0.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:32.980
Solution is real for
x greater than 0,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.990
and any way goes
to 0 at infinity.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.970
So the fact that it's real
is a mathematical nicety

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.270
that help us realize
that it must be 0.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.470
But the fact that there's no
current far away essentially

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.780
telling you better be 0.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:57.835
So if the current Jc is
0, Ja must be equal to Jb.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.580
And therefore that means a
squared is equal to b squared.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.885
And happily that's what
happened because b over a

00:10:10.885 --> 00:10:14.410
is a complex number
of magnitude one.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:19.180
So the fact that b and a
differ by just the phase

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.790
was required by
current conservation.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:30.510
A over b is a number
that has norm equal to 1.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.350
So that's a consistent picture.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.300
This phase is very important.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.500
So what happens for
resolution for x less than 0?

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:48.960
Well, psi of x would
be a into the i k x,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:55.100
plus b all the way
to the left there.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.430
Your solution is a plus
b equal minus i k x.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:07.980
Of course, we now know what
the b is, so this is minus a

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.425
from the ratio over there.

00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:14.822
e to the 2 i delta of e.

00:11:14.822 --> 00:11:17.625
E to the minus i k x.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.470
For x less than 0.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:28.090
And for x greater than 0,
psi of x is going to c e

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.150
to the minus kappa x.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.380
And I'm not bothering
to write the coefficient

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:40.630
c in Terms of a.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:45.060
Now this expression
for x less than 0

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.040
can be simplified a little.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.200
You can factor an a.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.930
But it's very nice,
and you should

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.790
have an eye for those
kind of simplifications.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.840
It's very nice to
factor more than an a

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.770
and to factor one
phase like an i delta.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.840
I delta of e,
because in that way,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:19.040
you get e to the i k x minus
delta of e from the first term,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.500
where the two delta
appearances cancel each other.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.450
Because the first term
didn't have a delta.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.120
But then the second
term will have

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.170
the same argument here,
of the exponential

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.650
but with a minus sign.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.310
Minus i k x.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.970
And I claim also a
minus delta of e.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.790
And this time minus and
minus gives you plus.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.210
And the other e to the i
delta gives you back the 2.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.300
But now you've created the
trigonometric function,

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.760
which is simpler to work with.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:13:01.580
So psi effects is equal to
2 i a e to i delta of e,

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:07.710
sine of k x minus delta of e.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:23.750
And if you wish psi squared,
the probability density

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:30.980
is proportional to 4 a
squared, sine squared

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.450
of k x minus delta of e.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.980
So this can be plotted.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:47.580
Sine squared is like that.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.710
And where is x equal 0.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.545
OK, I'll say x equal
0, say is here.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.280
So this is not
really true anymore.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:15.710
But this point here is x 0.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:16.760
It vanishes.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:24.440
Would be the point at which
k x 0 is equal to delta of e.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.370
And the sine squared vanishes.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.700
So this is not a
solution either.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.290
Solution is like that.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.580
And then this is
for psi squared.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.640
And then it must couple to the
k exponential on this side.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.940
So that the true solution must
somehow be like this and well,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.570
whatever.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.060
I don't know how it looks.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:56.880
That is the e to the minus 2
kappa x decay and exponential.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.110
It must decay.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.160
There's continuity of the
derivative and continuity

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.340
of the wave function.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.505
So that's how this should look.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:20.110
A couple more things we can
say about this solution that

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.720
will play a role later.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.610
I want to get just a little
intuition about this phase,

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.700
delta of e, this phase shift.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:52.100
So we have it there.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.240
Delta of e, I'll write it
here, so you won't have to--

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:03.790
10 minus 1, square root
of e over v not minus e.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.700
So this is interesting.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:11.700
This phase shift just applies
for energies up to v not.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.550
And that corresponds to the
fact that we've been solving

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.640
for energies under the barrier.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.930
And if we solve for
energies under the barrier,

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.360
well, the solutions
as we're writing

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.460
with these complex
numbers, apply up

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.550
to energies equal to the
barrier, but no more.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.400
So we shouldn't plot
beyond this place.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.715
And here is delta of e.

00:16:36.715 --> 00:16:38.410
The phase shift.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.880
And when the energy is
0, when your particle

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.580
you're sending in, or
the packet eventually

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.340
is very low energy here.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:54.720
Then the phase shift is the
arctangent of 0, which is 0.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.060
As the energy goes
to the value v not,

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.350
then the denominator goes to 0.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.770
The ratio goes to infinity.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:10.010
And the arctangent is pi over 2.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:15.810
So it's a curve that
goes from here to here.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.910
And it's not quite
like a straight line.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.109
But because of the
square roots, it sort of

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:30.140
begins kind of vertical,
then goes like this.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.150
It's not flat either,
in the middle.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.820
So maybe my curve
doesn't look too good.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.665
Those more vertical here.

00:17:42.665 --> 00:17:46.570
Wow, I'm having a
hard time with this.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.530
Something like this.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.620
In fact, it's kind of
interesting to plug

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:59.810
the derivative, d
delta, d energy.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.430
A little calculation will
give you this expression.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:09.180
You can do this with
mathematica or v not minus e.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:15.470
And shows, in fact, that here
is v not, and here is v delta,

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.240
v e.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.810
We could call it
delta prime of e,

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:24.420
because we wrote the phase shift
as a function of the energy.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:30.960
So that the delta, d e is
really delta prime of e.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.690
And it sort of infinite--

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.300
goes to a minimum and infinite
again, in that direction.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.390
That's how it behaves.
