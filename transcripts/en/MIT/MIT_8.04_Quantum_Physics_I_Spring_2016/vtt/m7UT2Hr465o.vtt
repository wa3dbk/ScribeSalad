00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.845
PROFESSOR: This
is very important.

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:06.550
This is the beginning of
the uncertainty principle,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.325
the matrix formulation
of quantum mechanics,

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:10.200
and all those things.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.850
I want to just tabulate the
information of matrices.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.750
We have an analog,
so we have operators.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.110
And we think of
them as matrices.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.250
Then in addition to operators,
we have wave functions.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.600
And we think of them as vectors.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.050
The operators act on the
wave functions or functions,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.430
and matrices act on vectors.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.540
We have eigenstate
sometimes and eigenvectors.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.030
So matrices do the same thing.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.660
They don't necessarily commute.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.840
There are very many
examples of that.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.060
I might as well give
you a little example

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.310
that is famous in the
theory of spin, spin 1/2.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.090
There is the Pauli matrices.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.872
Sigma 1 is equal to 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:42.510
Sigma 2 is 0 minus i, i 0, and
sigma 3 is 1 minus 1, 0, 0.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.500
And a preview of
things to come--

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.010
the spin operator is
actually h bar over 2 sigma.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.630
And you have to think of sigma
as having three components.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.360
That's where it is.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.450
Spins will be like that.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.780
We won't have to deal
with spins this semester.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.900
But there it is, that spin 1/2.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.580
Somehow these matrices
encode spin 1/2.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.770
And you can do simple things,
like sigma 1 times sigma 2.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.490
0, 1, 1, 0 times
0 minus i, i, 0.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.560
Let's see if I can
get this right.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.220
i, 0, 0 minus i.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.900
And you can do sigma 2 sigma
1 0 minus i, i 0, 0, 1, 1,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:51.700
0 equals minus i, 0, 0, i, i.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.010
So I can go ahead here.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.550
And therefore, sigma 1
commutator with sigma 2

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.240
is equal to sigma 1, sigma
2 minus sigma 2, sigma 1.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.260
And you can see that they're
actually the same up to a sign,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.990
so you get twice.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:32.330
So you get 2 times
i 0, 0 minus i.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.740
And this is 2i times
1 minus 1, 0, 0.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.730
And that happens to
be the sigma 3 matrix.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.840
So sigma 1 and sigma 2
is equal to 2i sigma 3.

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.490
These matrices
talk to each other.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.560
And you would say, OK,
these matrices commute

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.050
to give you this matrix.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.220
This thing commutes to give you
a number so that surely it's

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.440
a lot easier.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.570
You couldn't be more wrong.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.220
This is complicated,
extraordinarily complicated

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.320
to understand what this means.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.490
This is very easy.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.580
This is 2 by 2 matrices
that you check.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.510
In fact, you can write
matrices for x and p.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.100
This correspondence is
not just an analogy.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.880
It's a concrete fact.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.080
You will learn-- not too much
in this course, but in 805--

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.400
how to write matrices
for any operator.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.470
They're called matrix
representations.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.520
And therefore, you could ask
how does the matrix for x look.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.600
How does the matrix for p look?

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.730
And the problem
is these matrices

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.370
have to be infinite dimensional.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.150
It's impossible to
find two matrices whose

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.390
commutator gives you a number.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.560
Something you can prove in
math is actually not difficult.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.980
You will all prove it through
thinking a little bit.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.920
There's no two matrices that
commute to give you a number.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.190
On the other hand,
very easy to have

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.800
matrices that commute to
give you another matrix.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.230
So this is very strange and
profound and interesting,

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.500
and this is much simpler.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.790
Spin 1/2 is much simpler.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.260
That's why people do
quantum computations.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.770
They're working with
matrices and simple stuff,

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.660
and they go very far.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.210
This is very difficult. x
and p is really complicated.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.220
But that's OK.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.020
The purpose of this
course is getting

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.880
familiar with those things.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:10.880
So I want to now generalize
this a little bit more

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.370
to just give you the
complete Schrodinger

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.710
equation in three dimensions.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.210
So how do we work
in three dimensions,

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.515
three-dimensional physics?

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.250
There's two ways
of teaching 804--

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.970
it's to just do everything
in one dimension, and then

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.930
one day, 2/3 of the way
through the course--

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.730
well, we live in
three dimensions,

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.430
and we're going to
add these things.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.750
But I don't want to do that.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.260
I want to, from the
beginning, show you

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.570
the three-dimensional
thing and have

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.520
you play with
three-dimensional things

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.980
and with one-dimensional
things so that you don't get

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.520
focused on just one dimension.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.310
The emphasis will be in
one dimension for a while,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.770
but I don't want you to
get too focused on that.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.710
So what did we have
with this thing?

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:09.540
Well, we had p equal
h bar over i d dx.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.330
But in three dimensions,
that should be the momentum

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.950
along the x direction.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.080
We wrote waves like that with
momentum along the x direction.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.380
And py should be
h bar over i d dy,

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.020
and pz should be h
bar over i d dz--

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.780
momentum in the x,
y, and z direction.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.230
And this corresponds
to the idea that if you

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.130
have a wave, a de Broglie
wave in three dimensions,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.840
you would write this--

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:53.190
e to the i kx minus
omega t, i omega t.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:04.250
And the momentum would be
equal to h bar k vector,

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.950
because that's how
the plane wave works.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.140
That's what de
Broglie really said.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.780
He didn't say it
in one dimension.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:21.245
Now, it may be easier to write
this as p1 equal h bar over i d

00:08:21.245 --> 00:08:32.789
dx1, p2 h bar over i d dx2,
and p3 h bar over i d dx3

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:37.539
so that you can say that all
these three things are Pi

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:42.210
equals h bar over i d dxi--

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.050
and maybe I should put pk,
because the i and the i

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.450
could get you confused--

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.840
with k running from 1 to 3.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.590
So that's the momentum.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.950
They're three momenta,
they're three coordinates.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:11.580
In vector notation,
the momentum operator

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.260
will be h bar over i
times the gradient.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.780
You know that the gradient is
a vector operator because d dx,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.430
d dy, d dz.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.840
So there you go.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.390
The x component of the
momentum operators,

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:31.760
h bar over i d dx, or
d dx1, d dx2, d dx3.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.260
So this is the
momentum operator.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:41.040
And if you act on this wave
with the momentum operator,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.930
you take the gradient,
you get this--

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.630
so p hat vector.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.630
Now here's a problem.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.960
Where do you put the arrow?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.900
Before or after the hat?

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.470
I don't know.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.520
It just doesn't look
very nice either way.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.370
The type of notes I think
we'll use for vectors

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:08.390
is bold symbols so there will
be no proliferation of vectors

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.050
there.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:15.680
So anyway, if you have this
thing being the gradient acting

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.070
on this wave function, e
to the i kx minus i omega

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.840
t, that would be h
over i, the gradient,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:33.560
acting on a to the i kx
vector minus i omega t.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.630
And the gradient acting on
this-- this is a vector--

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.560
actually gives you a vector.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.670
So you can do
component by component,

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:51.380
but this gives you i k vector
times the same wave function.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:00.230
So you get hk, which is the
vector momentum times the wave

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.730
function.

00:11:03.628 --> 00:11:08.960
So the momentum operator
has become the gradient.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.060
This is all nice.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.110
So what about the
Schrodinger equation

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.023
and the rest of these things?

00:11:19.023 --> 00:11:22.710
Well, it's not too complicated.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.250
We'll say one more thing.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:44.290
So the energy operator,
or the Hamiltonian,

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:53.680
will be equal to p vector
hat squared over 2m plus

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.850
a potential that depends on
all the coordinates x and t,

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.456
the three coordinates.

00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:05.900
Even the potential is radial,
like the hydrogen atom,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.590
is much simpler.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.350
There are conservation laws.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.360
Angular momentum works nice.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.880
All kinds of beautiful
things happen.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.560
If not, you just
leave it as x and p.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.280
And now what is p hat squared?

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:26.450
Well, p vector hat squared
would be h bar over--

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:34.380
well, I'll write this-- p vector
hat dotted with p vector hat.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:40.760
And this is h over i
gradient dotted with h over i

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.490
gradient, which is minus
h squared Laplacian.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.750
So your Schrodinger
equation will

00:12:52.750 --> 00:13:00.700
be ih bar d psi dt is equal to
the whole Hamiltonian, which

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.970
will be h squared over 2m.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:12.350
Now Laplacian plus v
of x and t multiplied

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.960
by psi of x vector and t.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.571
And this is the full
three-dimensional Schrodinger

00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:24.070
equation.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.190
So it's not a new invention.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.380
If you invented the
one-dimensional one,

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.920
you could have invented the
three-dimensional one as well.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:43.700
The only issue was recognizing
that the second dx squared now

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.720
turns into the full Laplacian,
which is a very sensible thing

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.580
to happen.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:55.600
Now, the commutation relations
that we had here before--

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.320
we had x with p is
equal to ih bar.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:05.490
Now, px and x failed to
commute, because d dx and x,

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.520
they interact.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.290
But px will commute with y.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.520
y doesn't care
about x derivative.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.350
So the p's failed to commute.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.280
They give you a number with
a corresponding coordinate.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:29.930
So you have the i-th component
of the x operator and the j-th

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.690
component of the p operator--

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.060
these are the components--

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:45.440
give you ih bar delta
ij, where delta ij

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.500
is a symbol that gives
you 1 if i is equal to j

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:56.110
and gives you 0 if i
is different from j.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.250
So here you go.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.130
X and px is 1 and 1.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.680
Delta 1, 1 is 1.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.450
So you get ih bar.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:09.100
But if you have x
with py or p2, you

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.340
would have delta
1, 2, and that's 0,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.630
because the two indices
are not the same.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.296
So this is a neat way of
writing nine equations.

00:15:19.296 --> 00:15:20.920
Because in principle,
I should give you

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.000
the commutator of x
with px and py and pc,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.530
y with px, py, pc,
and z with px, py, pc.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.170
You're seeing that,
in fact, x just

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:38.820
talks to px, y talks
to py, z talks to pz.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:46.080
So that's it for the
Schrodinger equation.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.650
Our goal is going to be to
understand this equation.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.320
So our next step is
to try to figure out

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.850
the interpretation of this psi.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:59.880
We've done very nicely by
following these things.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.950
We had a de Broglie wave.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.180
We found an equation.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.590
Which invented a free
Schrodinger equation.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.990
We invented an interacting
Schrodinger equation.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.890
But we still don't know what
the wave function means.
