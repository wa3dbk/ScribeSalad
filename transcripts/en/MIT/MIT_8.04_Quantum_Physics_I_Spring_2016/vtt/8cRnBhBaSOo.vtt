00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.090
PROFESSOR: What did
we have last time?

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:11.000
We had a constant copper
that reflected the energy

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.740
so a unit free
version of the energy,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.390
was greater than 0, because we
were looking at bound states,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.750
so the energies were negative.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.430
And we found that this
[INAUDIBLE] this quantized 1

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.360
over 2 copper was
N plus l plus 1--

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.160
something that we call n.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.960
And n was the principal
quantum number.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.300
So this is the principle
quantum number n

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.915
was the degree of a
polynomial in the solution.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.550
And l was an important
quantum number,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.190
because it gave you the
amount of angular momentum

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.700
the system had.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.680
And given that we think of it as
principal quantum number coming

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.780
first, once you have n and you
fix it because the energy just

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.760
depends on n--

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.980
Once you fix n,
you'll have that l

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.160
can go from 0 up to n minus
1, and those corresponds

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.200
to the various
values of capital N.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.506
But we don't have to focus
on it up to n minus 1.

00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:56.400
And at the same time in
terms of quantum numbers,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.370
m goes from minus l up to l.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.460
So the order of thinking
is fixed co-- at little m,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.890
and the principal
quantum number.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.240
Then fix an l can go
from up 0 to n minus 1.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.010
Once you fix a little
l, you fix the m.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.080
And m can go from my l to l.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.130
And those are the states
of the hydrogen atom.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.230
The energies in
terms of n are mine

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.921
z squared, e squared over
2 knot, 1 over n little n

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:35.421
squared.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:49.870
And the solutions-- psi nlm
that depend on r theta and phi

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.210
were of the form of a
normalization constant, A r

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.910
to the l that you can isolate.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:12.760
That's a behavior for small
r, then a polynomial n r

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.760
over a0 of degree,
capital N, which

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:30.400
is n minus L plus 1 times an
exponential decay with radius,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.500
which goes like z over r.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.380
It has to be
dimensionless, the argument

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.360
inside the exponential.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.930
And it turns out to
depend on a0, in fact na0

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.590
and finally, the
spherical harmonic.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.275
So that was the total solution.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.400
We didn't investigate
the polynomial in detail,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.770
because it takes time.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.930
It's not necessary
for many things.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.650
Only very detailed calculations
require this polynomial.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.959
And it's a Laguerre polynomial.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.232
And if you needed--

00:04:21.232 --> 00:04:26.020
if you needed to construct
the quadratic polynomial,

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.400
it would be a fight
between looking up

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.650
some table of
Laguerre polynomials

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.980
and spending time checking
that the conventions they use

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.110
are the same than
the ones you choose

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.270
versus taking the
recursion relation

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.520
and building it up yourself
of the third coefficient.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.910
So that's what it is.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.920
Now the hydrogen atom, there
is a classical description,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.660
a diagram, for the
hydrogen atom and in fact,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.090
for any central potential.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.360
So if you're looking
at bound states,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.450
the way we do bound
states and represent them

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.660
for central potentials
is by a diagram

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.630
in which you put the energy
on the vertical line.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.040
It's a negative energy.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.180
So you can put 0 in here.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.130
The way the hydrogen atom
works is better, of course,

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.790
as usual to use something
dimensionless here.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.830
And the thing we put is
minus 1 over n squared,

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.110
the integer the principle
quantum number n minus 1

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.230
over n squared,
because this ratio is,

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:52.390
in fact, equal to
the energy divided

00:05:52.390 --> 00:06:01.290
by this dimensionless quantity
z squared e squared over 2a0.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.640
So there is n squared,
and the levels go like 1

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.470
over n squared, indeed.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:22.430
So there is minus 1 here,
and then goes to minus 1/4

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.360
for n equals 2 minus
1/9 minus 1/16.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.300
And they crowd here.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.600
That's why I don't do
everything in scale.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.500
I cut the scale here, otherwise
the diagram is very long.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.370
And you can put
say the minus 1/4

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.790
here, though, 1/9 would be here.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.120
minus 1/9 minus 1/16--

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.497
somewhere here.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.990
Those are places where
you have energy levels,

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.110
and here it comes.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.450
Let's look at what we can get.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.750
Well, for n equals
1, you're in here.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.947
So what are we going
to plot in this axis.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.320
The idea is to plot
a quantum number.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:21.400
So actually to say here
is l, but we don't do it

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.440
in marking the values of l.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.610
We'll put here l
equals 0 and list

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.470
all the states that we get.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.650
So it's like a histogram
or something like that, l

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:38.740
equal 1, l equals 2, equals 3.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.430
And then we put dashes here,
and each dash is a state.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:49.140
If you look at it and you
say, what's the value of l?

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.680
So this corresponds to
the idea that you already

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.410
know that if you're solving
a central potential problem,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.570
you have to solve
a radial equation

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.030
for different values of l.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.350
Each time another l, l equals
0, l equals 1, l equals 2.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.550
You go on with them.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:15.270
So m, so when n is equal
to 1, l can be only 0.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.840
So you have 1 states here.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.300
l is equal to 0.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.460
And is equal to 1.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.250
And capital N is
it's equal to 0.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.750
So the only thing that I
cannot read immediately,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.659
I know that n is equal
to 1, because I'm here.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.780
I know that l is equal
to 0, because I'm here.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.919
But I put the extra information,
the capital N equal to 0 here.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.400
And that's it for this level.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.320
So this is that little
n equal 1 level.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.940
Then we go to that
little n equals 2 level.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:05.780
And when little n is equal to
2, l can be 0, or it can be 1.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.840
When l is equal to
0, capital N would

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:16.740
have to be 1 so that capital N,
which is 1 plus little l, which

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.430
is 0 plus 1 is equal to 2.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:24.360
And this is a level n,
little n equals to 2,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.780
principal quantum
number equal to 2.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.250
So here we have n equals to 2.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.800
Since l is 0, capital N is 1.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.730
Here you have capital
N is equal to 0.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:52.740
And then we go to the next
level little n equals to 3.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:59.880
Well, little l can now go
from l equals 0, l equals 1

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.290
and l calls 2.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.770
Since little l plus
1 plus capital N

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.180
is equal to the
principal quantum number,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:15.920
here you'll get N equal to 2,
N equals 1, and it goes down,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.600
N equals 0.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.310
These are the states.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.430
Let's do one more.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.950
Little n equals to 4.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:32.500
And, yes, there's a state
for l equal 0, 1 for equal 1,

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.650
1 for equal 2, and this
time we get to l equal 3.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.850
Each time you get
one more l, because l

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.990
can go up to n minus 1.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.800
And what is capital N?

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:52.090
Here is 3, 2, 1, and 0.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.080
So this is your diagram.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.250
This is a very nice diagram.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:05.470
And it has actually is some
sort of mystery in this diagram.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.740
Let me emphasize first one
point that is not mysterious.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.570
It's this growth from an equal
0 to an equal 1 to n equal 2

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.810
to n equal 3.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.940
There seems to be
a pattern here.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.601
Here n equals 0, 1.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:25.100
2.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.320
And it will go up.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.420
So why is that necessary?

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.240
Why did that happen?

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.430
Remember, that we were solving
a radial equation, which

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.380
was like a
one-dimensional potential.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.835
And if you are solving a
one-dimensional potential,

00:11:43.835 --> 00:11:46.020
the node theorem works.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:51.600
So there should be no
nodes for the ground state.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.940
And the fact that the wave
function vanishes at r equals 0

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.940
is not a node,
because that's the end

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.730
of the world at r equals 0.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.860
But then you're solving
this radial equation.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.450
And let's look at
this polynomial.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.470
Well, you're not going to
get a 0 of the wave function,

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.100
because of this factor.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.090
It's an overall factor.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.060
And the exponential never
vanishes just at infinity,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.430
but never doesn't
vanish at the point.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.580
So all the 0's of
the wave function

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.570
have to arise from
this polynomial.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:31.260
And there shouldn't be any
0 for the ground state.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.720
So good.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.510
N equal 0 means no nodes
here, no nodes for the--

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.460
this is a different problem.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.410
This is an l equals 1.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.150
It's again a new potential.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.140
So you solve the
radial equation again.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:53.720
Yes, the ground state, when l is
equal to 1 must have no nodes.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.590
So you should, remember, you're
solving the radial question.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.970
One's here for one potential,
here for another potential,

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.760
because the effective
potential depends on l, here

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.330
for another potential.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.290
There for another potential.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.470
So each time, it's a new
one-dimensional problem,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.370
which must have a
ground state and a state

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.810
with 1 node, which is
possible, because a degree 1

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.920
polynomial has one 0.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.120
A degree two polynomial
can have two 0's.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.000
Why it has another
degree n polynomial

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.930
may have n 0's But
it may have less

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.970
0's if the 0's are complex.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.600
But if better be that this
polynomials don't do that,

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.950
because they would
violate the known theorem.
