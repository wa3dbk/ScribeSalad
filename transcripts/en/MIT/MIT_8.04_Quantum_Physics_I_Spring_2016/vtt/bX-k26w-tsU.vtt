00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.880
PROFESSOR: We can write,
however, J left as J of A,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:21.410
minus J of B. Where J of A would
be h bar k over m A squared.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:31.090
And J of B would be h
bar k over m B squared.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.360
You see the current that exists
to the left of the barrier

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.760
has two components and--

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.180
it's very intuitive.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.610
It's the current that would
have been brought alone

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.780
by the incoming A-wave.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.320
Minus the current that
would have existed alone

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.530
from the reflected B-wave.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.510
B is the reflected wave.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.570
So that's very nice.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.330
There's no interference
between these two terms.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.850
We can really think
of a current that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.770
is associated to
the incoming wave,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.560
and a current that is associated
with the reflected wave.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.990
So this suggests how you
should define a reflection

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.430
coefficient.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:31.960
Reflection coefficient
R would give me

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.820
the amount of current
I get reflected,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.220
compared to the amount of
current that there is incident.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.810
You see, the incident
current is going

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.140
to be partially reflected
and partially transmitted.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.630
So an idea of a
reflection is the value

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.232
of the reflected current
divided by the incident current.

00:02:00.232 --> 00:02:06.270
It's a definition, but it's
a reasonable definition.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.200
And then, if it is this ratio--

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.180
because of these
expressions-- it

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.715
happens to be B over A squared.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.470
And that's an
interesting number.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.010
Now, there's some physics in it.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.380
It tells me how much
of the probability

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.560
gets reflected as a function
of the probability that

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.950
is incident.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.370
So that's a good measure.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.700
If you get a reflection
coefficient of 1/10,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.240
then you would expect 1/10 of
the particles to be reflected.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.130
Now we don't have particles yet.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.590
This is non-normalizable
solution.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.750
But, still, this will be
the intuition very soon.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.420
Now we could have a transmission
coefficient, as well.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.490
And here is something where
we sometimes make a mistake.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.699
T is going to be the
transmission coefficient.

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.920
Transmission coefficient.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.910
And how should we define it?

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.980
There is a temptation to define
it-- well, coefficient B over A

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.690
gives me this.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:37.760
Then maybe it should be
C over A. But actually--

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.070
while c over a
gives you some idea

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.890
of how big the wave to
the right is compared

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.480
to the wave of the left--

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.225
that's not what we should
call a reflection coefficient.

00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:53.930
And the reason is that--

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.480
I will call this
current J C. And that's

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.480
the amount of probability--

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.450
because it's a current
associated to the wave C.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.090
And that's the
amount of probability

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.350
that is being carried
by the transmitted wave.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.250
That is the probability.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.630
Not necessarily C over A.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.589
So the transmission
coefficient will

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:29.024
be defined to be J
C divided by J A.

00:04:29.024 --> 00:04:32.710
And then J C divided by J A--

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.550
J C has an h-bar, k-bar.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.570
And J A has a k.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.600
So this is not
equal to this ratio,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:58.900
but is actually k-bar
over k, C over A.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.970
So it's not just this number.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.480
The reflection coefficient--
and transmission coefficients--

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.000
really originate
from probabilities.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.900
And the probabilities
for this current.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.400
And, therefore, there is no--

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.440
it would have been very
hand-wavy, and actually

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.030
wrong to think it's C over A.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.510
These definitions--
because after all,

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.380
this is a definition--

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.320
makes some nice sense.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.940
Because you have J L--

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:41.410
we said is equal to J right,
but J L is J A minus J

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:49.740
B, is equal to J C.
And therefore R plus T.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.370
The reflection coefficient plus
the transmission coefficient--

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:04.850
which is J B over J
A plus J C over J A

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:12.020
is equal to J B
plus J C over J A.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:28.566
And you see here that J A plus
J C is indeed equal to J B.

00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:29.390
I'm sorry.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.890
I got this wrong.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.090
Yes.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.923
Where is the eraser.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.315
I should have passed
the B to the other side.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.510
This force implies J
A equals J B plus J C.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.080
And this ratio is equal to 1,
which is something you usually

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.580
want when you define reflection
and transmission coefficients.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.950
They should add up to 1.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.810
So now we've got an idea.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.770
Yes, with this solution I
can understand the reflection

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.060
and transmission coefficients.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.700
But do these apply to particles?

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.670
Well, the good news
is that it roughly

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.670
applies to particles-- as we
will see with the wave packets

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.480
soon.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.110
If you send the
wave packet, it's

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.270
going to have some
uncertainty and momentum.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.310
It's going to have some
uncertainty and energy.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.760
But for some energy--

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.270
suppose the wave packet doesn't
have that much uncertainty--

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.920
basically, the probability
that the wave packet bounces

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.250
is the reflection at that
energy, that is the main energy

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.250
that the wave packet sends.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.270
If your wave packet is
very broad over energies,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.440
then it's a more
complicated thing.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.310
But as long as the wave packet
is such that it basically

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:01.340
has one narrow band of energy,
the reflection coefficient

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.320
associated to this calculation
is the reflection coefficient

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.150
or reflection probability
for the wave packet

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.430
that you're sending in.
