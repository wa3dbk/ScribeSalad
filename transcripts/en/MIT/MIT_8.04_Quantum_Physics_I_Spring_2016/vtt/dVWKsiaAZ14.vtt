00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.770
PROFESSOR: We have the
hydrogen atom Hamiltonian.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.810
Hamiltonian.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.430
And that was given by
the kinetic operator

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.530
for the proton plus
the kinetic operator

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.070
for the electron plus
the potential, which

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.362
was a function of the
distance between the proton

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:35.070
and the electron.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.170
And what we achieved last
time was the introduction

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.830
of two new pairs of
canonical variables.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.340
We had the electron
position momentum, that's

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.230
a pair of canonical variables.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.690
The proton position
and momentum,

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.420
that's another pair of
canonical variables.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
They commute each
pair, the two operators

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.370
commute to give IH bar, but
the two pairs are independent.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.880
So we search for another
two pairs of variables,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.380
and we found another two pairs.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.610
One was the P and X associated
with the center of mass motion,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.620
and then we had the small
p and small x associated

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.905
with the relative function.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.600
And these four variables were
a function of the original four

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.060
variables, the X and
P of the electron

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.490
and the x and p of the proton.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.740
So we define these two pairs,
and they were canonical pairs.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.210
This x with this p gave
IH bar, this x with this p

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.670
gave IH bar, these p's and x's
commute with any combination

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.530
of p's and x's over there.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.330
But not only was
that pretty good,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.320
it simplified the Hamiltonian.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.810
So at the end of the day,
we had a Hamiltonian,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:30.140
which was as if the center of
mass moves like a free particle

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.610
plus a kinetic energy
for the relative motion,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.770
with a mass called
the renews mass,

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.500
and the potential for
the relative position.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.700
And here, the mass, capital M,
was the sum of the two masses.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.050
And the relative
mass was the product

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.790
of the masses over
the sum, which

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.450
has the property that
if one of the two masses

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.180
is much bigger
than the other, it

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.120
gives you a mass mu proportional
roughly equal to the lower

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.530
mass.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.370
So this is the hydrogen
atom reformulated.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.920
And now, we want to write
the Schrodinger equation

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.680
and just see effectively how the
central potential formulation

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.980
of the relative motion arises.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.280
Although, it starts to be
a little somewhat clearer,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.610
I think, that that's
going to happen.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.310
Another thing to
notice of course,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.320
is that if you're already
thinking of a Schrodinger

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.470
equation, in which
you will think

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.980
of the momenta as the
derivative operators,

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.100
the center of mass
momentum should

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.540
be thought as the derivative
operator with respect

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.260
to the center of mass position.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.770
So think of the center of
mass as three coordinates,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.750
and you differentiate
with respect to them.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.870
Similarly, for the
relative momentum,

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.150
we'll think of it as a
gradient with respect

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.000
to the relative
position, because that's

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.690
the canonical coordinate
that goes along with it.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.290
That's how we should think of
this operator as derivative.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.550
And before, we didn't have
to put those subscripts

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.100
in [INAUDIBLE],, because we
always had just one coordinate

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.550
to work with.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.200
But now, you have
two coordinates.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.760
What you've learned here
in doing this analysis

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.740
was that we have a wave function
that has coordinate dependence

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.960
on both the electron
and the proton.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.570
So let's do the separation
of variables that shows

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.680
how to deal with this system.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:16.260
So you want to write the wave
function for the whole system,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.100
so it depends on
the center of mass

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.030
and on the relative coordinates.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.540
Now, I don't put
time, because we're

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.110
discussing time independent
Schrodinger equation, where

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.180
the time you can
put it later, if you

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.575
wish, with the total
energy into the minus IET.

00:05:36.575 --> 00:05:41.670
So what we will consider
is a simple solution

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.960
that is of the product type.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.790
So there will be a wave
function associated up

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.790
factor, which is a wave function
associated with center of mass,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.985
and the wave function associated
to the relative motion.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.630
And we want to replace this
into the Schrodinger equation

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.850
into H psi equals E psi.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.910
So let's see how it would go.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.390
Each term of the
Hamiltonian is going

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.570
to act on this product of
functions that determines

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.300
the whole wave function.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.180
The center of mass
momentum, being

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.470
derivative, respect to
this x, will act just

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.520
on the first term.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:49.340
So we'll have p squared over
2 m acting on psi c m of x.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.420
And the relative wave
function in that term

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.780
just goes for the ride.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.660
So that's the first
term in the Hamiltonian.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.720
For the second term
in the Hamiltonian,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:16.010
we would have p
squared over 2 mu.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:26.050
We could add them psi
relative, and let's put

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:32.890
even the potential
here, v of x relative--

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.410
we don't put the relative
on the x, but they'll just--

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.350
it's a small x
psi relative of x.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.660
So we've looked at the second
term and the third term.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.540
The third term is
grouped with the second,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:01.050
because it uses the
little x, not the big X.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:08.250
And then you have psi
cm of x multiplicativly,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.060
it doesn't do anything to it.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:22.940
All this is equal to
e times the psi cm

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:28.350
of x psi relative of little x.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.520
OK, that's the
Schrodinger equation.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.070
And this should remind you,
it's very similar to what

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.510
you did months ago of having
motion's in say, in two

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.590
dimensions, and you wrote part
of the wave function dependant

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.560
on x, part of a wave
function dependant on y,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.320
and you separated the
Schrodinger equation.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.980
So the next thing to do is
to divide by the total wave

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.700
function, by the product.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:09.780
So divide 5 by the
total wave function.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.410
So what do you get?

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.720
From the first
term, you will get 1

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:25.520
over psi cm of capital X times
this p squared over 2 m psi

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:36.060
cm of capital X. And that's all
what comes of the first term.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:43.320
From the second, you get
plus 1 over psi relative

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:50.480
of x and this whole
bracket squared

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:59.860
over 2 mu psi relative
plus V of x psi relative.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.220
And the whole thing being equal
to E. The two wave functions

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.670
are divided there.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:19.460
So we have a situation
where a number

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.640
is the sum of two functions.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.820
Now, what is funny of
course, is the argument

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.650
you've heard several times.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:32.222
This first term depends just
on the capital X-coordinates.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:40.730
The second term depends just
on the lower x-coordinates,

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.464
small x-coordinates.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:50.020
I didn't write them in some
places, but here they are.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.610
And therefore, the only way
these two things can always

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:58.310
be true, is if the
first term is a number.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.580
And we'll call it Ecm.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:07.840
The whole thing must be a
number, we'll call it Ecm.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.370
And the second term
should be another number,

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.270
and I'll call it E relative.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.390
That's E relative.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:29.300
So our conclusion is that
if this first term is

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.490
a number equal to Ecm we
can multiply by psi cm

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:45.020
and get p squared over
to 2m psi cm of x is

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.660
equal to Ecm times psi cm of x.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.610
Which is a time independent
Schrodinger equation

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.980
for a wave function psi
cm that is moving freely.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.520
The next equation is
the one within brackets,

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:17.420
which is p squared over 2 mu
psi relative of x plus v of--

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:23.480
now I can put r, when I
say that r is the magnitude

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:32.376
of x psi relative of
x equals e relative--

00:12:32.376 --> 00:12:34.840
I should move this--

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.790
psi relative of x.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:44.170
And we said that r was this.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.800
So the second equation
comes from this term

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.870
identified with relative.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.610
And the last equation is to
say that the total energy is

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.720
equal to Ecm plus e relative.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.980
So the whole two body
problem has been reduced

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.630
to these three equations.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.370
This is what we aim to show.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:19.250
This is a gradient squared
on this wave function,

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:24.590
the central potential term,
and the rest of the Schrodinger

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.250
equation.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.440
So this is a
Schrodinger equation

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.950
for a particle in the
central potential.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:35.090
That particle happens to
be the relative distance

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:40.560
between these two particles,
but it obeys a central equation

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.690
potential.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.090
Here is the center of mass.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:49.730
Solutions of this is a plane
wave, momentum plane waves,

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.590
because this is like
a free particle,

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.210
and that's our intuition.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:57.590
The hydrogen atom can
move like a free particle.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.680
That's an overall
quantum system and then

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.790
there's the relative
degrees of freedom.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:09.940
The total energy of this system
must be the sum of the two.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:16.930
So that said for the
system, we are allowed now,

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.800
to consider the hydrogen atoms.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.410
So that's what we'll do next.
