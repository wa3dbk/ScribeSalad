00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.890
PROFESSOR: So far so good.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.420
So here is the kind of
very entertaining thing

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.740
that happens when you try to
do some physics with this.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.230
And this was done by two
physicists, Elitzur and Vaidman

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.820
in Tel Aviv, they
invented or fantasized

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.270
about some sort of bombs--

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.570
things that explode.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:37.740
So they're called
Elitzur-Vaidman bombs.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.040
And you could invent
different things,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.770
but here is what an
Elitzur-Vaidman bomb is--

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.490
some sort of bomb,
and the way it works

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.110
is with a photon detector.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.770
So there's a little
tube in the bomb,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.990
and there's a photon detector.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.220
And you have your
bomb, and you want

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.180
to detonate it-- you
send the photon in,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.260
you send the photon
in through the tube.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.850
And the photon, it's
detected by the detector.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.120
And the bomb explodes.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.870
On the other hand, if
the bomb is defective,

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.500
the photon goes in, and
the detector doesn't work.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.510
The photon goes out.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.470
Just goes through.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.100
So that's an
Elitzur-Vaidman bomb.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.550
And here is the puzzle for you--

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.370
suppose you have those bombs,
and unfortunately, those bombs,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.490
after time, they decay.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.730
And sometimes the
detectors go wrong,

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.630
and they don't work anymore.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.060
So you have 10
bombs, and you know,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.755
maybe five have gone wrong.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.300
And now, you have maybe
a very important mission

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.890
and you need the bomb
that really works.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.290
So what do you do?

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.440
Let's assume you cannot
break apart the detector--

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.220
it's just too complicated.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.830
So you have the bombs,
and you want to test them.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.700
If you send in a photon
and nothing happens,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.000
the bomb is not working.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.180
But if you send in a photon,
and the bomb is working--

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.060
explodes.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.140
So you cannot use it anymore.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.620
So the question that
Elitzur and Vaidman pose,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.690
is there a way to
certify that the bomb is

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.210
working without exploding it?

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.140
Can you do that?

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.830
The answer looks
absolutely impossible.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.260
And certainly, in
classical physics,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.570
it's completely impossible.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.260
You either do the measurement
to see if the detector works,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.410
and if it works,
your lab goes off.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.040
It's totally destroyed.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.700
And if it doesn't
work, well, OK,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.720
it's not a good bum anyways.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.620
So there's no way out.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.370
But there is a
way out, and it is

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.010
to insert this bomb in the mass
[? center ?] interferometer.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.401
So here we go.

00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:51.780
We put the mass
[? center ?] interferometer,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:00.140
and we insert the bomb here with
the detector along this place.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.750
D 0 and D 1 are still here.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:28.390
And now, you put this,
and you send in a photon.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.730
So let's see what happens
if you send in a photon.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.490
Suppose the bomb is defective--

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.800
bomb is defective.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.140
So what are the
possible outcomes?

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.100
Outcome and probability.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.580
Photon goes to D 0--

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.150
0.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.890
Photon to D 1, bomb explodes.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.000
Well, we said the
bomb is defective.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.660
So if the bomb is
defective, we said

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.510
it's like a detector that
doesn't work, and lets

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.790
the photons go through.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:38.630
So if the bomb is defective,
it's as if there no bomb here,

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.650
and you have the situation
where all is open.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.760
So there will be a probability
of 1 to get the photon to D 0--

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.930
a probability of 0 to
get the photon to D 1.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.120
And the bomb, of course,
doesn't explode--

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.240
probability of 0.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.790
On the other hand,
suppose the bomb is good--

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.712
bomb is good.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.130
And then, what are the outcomes?

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.140
And what are the probabilities?

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.820
Well, you know, more or less,
what's happening already.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.890
The bomb is good means there
is a detector that never

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.360
fails to detect the photon.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.340
And if a photon comes
in, it will capture it--

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.990
it will block it.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.380
The bomb will explode.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.290
So you have your mass
[? center ?] interferometer,

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.510
and you've really done
the equivalent of this--

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.280
if the bomb is really working.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.410
You've put a block
of concrete-- it's

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.960
going to absorb the photon.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:22.340
So if the bomb is
really working,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.470
the outcome are the following--

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:38.170
well, I'm sorry to say, your lab
will explode half of the times,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.850
because the photon
on the block happens,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:50.145
and bomb explodes
with probability 1/2.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.650
On the other hand,
in this situation,

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.755
it is possible that the photon--

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:11.102
photon-- at D 0, and
bomb doesn't explode--

00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:13.860
not explode.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.810
And there is a probability 1/4.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:25.020
And there is a probability,
1/4, that the photon is at D 1,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.065
and the bomb does not explode.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.960
But here is the catch now--

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.010
yes, half of the bombs exploded,
we're sorry about that.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.140
But if the bomb
doesn't work, there

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:50.690
is no way a photon can reach
D 1, because if a bomb doesn't

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.280
work, all photons go to D 0.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.990
So the fact that some
photons, a quarter percent

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.940
of the time, 1/4--

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.010
25% of the time--

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:09.470
reach D 1 implies
that photon is at D 1,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.070
and bomb did not explode.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.250
But the bomb is good.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.760
So look what has happened--
it's really strange.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:27.360
The photon went-- the bomb was
here, it was ready to explode.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.610
The photons kept the
bomb, and ended at D 1,

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.030
and you still know that
the bomb works now--

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.810
even though the photon never
went through the detector.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.400
It never touched here, it never
went inside and get detected.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.830
Somehow it went
through the other way,

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.660
but you know that the bomb is
working, with a quarter percent

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.160
efficiency.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.250
We will do exercises, and
it's possible to raise

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.890
the efficiency to 50%.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.980
And if you put the bomb inside
a cavity, a resonant cavity

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.540
with photons going around,
you can reach 99% efficiency.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.558
So the probability of blowing
up MIT goes down to 1%.

00:10:12.558 --> 00:10:13.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.750
I don't know if we
can live with that--

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.560
I don't think so.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.100
But anyway, this
is a true fact--

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.430
experiments without
bombs have been done,

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.170
and it shows that in
quantum mechanics,

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.480
you can do very
surprising measurements.
