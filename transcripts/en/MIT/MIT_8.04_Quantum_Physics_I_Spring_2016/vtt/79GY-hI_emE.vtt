00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.790
PROFESSOR: There's one more
property of this thing that

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.580
is important, and it's something
called the correspondence

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.775
principle, which is another
classical intuition.

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:16.880
And it says that
the wave function,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.100
and it addresses
the question of what

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.460
happens to the amplitude
of the wave function.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.700
It says that the wave function
should be larger in the regions

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.440
where the particle
spends more time.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.600
So in this problem, you have
the particle going here.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.320
It's bouncing and it's
going slowly here,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.500
it's going very fast here.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.450
So it spends more time
here, spends a lot of time

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.710
here, spends a lot of time here.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.450
So it should be better
in these regions

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.580
and smaller in the regions
that spends little time.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.950
So this was called the
correspondence principle,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.240
which is a big name for
a somewhat vague idea.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.720
But nevertheless, it's
an interesting thing

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.690
and it's true as well.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.230
So let me explain
this a little more

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.160
and get the key
point about this.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.660
So we say, if you have a
potential, you have x and x

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.230
plus dx, so this is
dx, the probability

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:47.400
to be found in the x is
equal to psi squared dx,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.220
and it's proportional
to the time spent there.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.170
So we'll say that it's--

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.230
we'll write it in
the following way.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:14.540
It's proportional to the
fraction of time spent in dx.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.795
And that, we'll call little t
over the period of the motion

00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:25.080
in this oscillation.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.188
The classical particle is
doing, the period there.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.300
That's the fraction of
time it spends there.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.360
Up two factors of
2, maybe, because it

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.010
spends going there and
there for the whole period,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.390
it doesn't matter, it's
anyway approximate.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.460
It's a classical intuition
expressed as the correspondence

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.450
principle.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:02.400
So this is equal to dx over
v, over the velocity that

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.700
positioned the
[INAUDIBLE] velocity T.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.460
And this is there for dx.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.280
And the velocity is
p over m, so the mass

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.720
over period and the momentum.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.600
So here we go.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.080
Here's the interesting thing.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.710
We found that the magnitude
of the wave function

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:37.490
should be proportional
to 1 over p of x,

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.415
or lambda over h bar of x.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.500
So then the key result is
that the magnitude of the wave

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.660
function goes like
the square root

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.030
of the position the [INAUDIBLE]
de Broglie wavelength.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:11.310
So if here the de Broglie
wavelength is becoming bigger

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.540
because the momentum
is becoming smaller,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.899
the logic here says that
yes indeed, in here,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.750
the particle is
spending more time here,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.815
so actually, I should be
drawing it a little bigger.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.210
So when I try to sketch a
wave function in a potential,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.910
this is my best guess
of how it would be.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.130
And you will be doing a lot
of numerical experimentation

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.480
with Mathematica and get
that kind of insight.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.515
They position the [INAUDIBLE] de
Broglie wavelength as you have,

00:04:55.515 --> 00:05:00.990
it is a function of the
local kinetic energy.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.980
And that's what
it gives for you.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:10.490
OK so that is one key insight
into the plot of the wave

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.090
function.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.700
Without solving
anything, you can

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.240
estimate how the
wave length goes,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.770
and probably to what
degree the amplitude goes.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.480
What else do you know?

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.870
There's the node theorem
that we mentioned, again,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.390
in the case of the square well.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.890
The ground state, the bounce
state, the ground state bounce

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.070
state is a state
without the node.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.130
The first excited
state has one node,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.950
the next excited state has two
nodes, the next, three nodes,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.110
and the number of
nodes increase.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.210
With that information,
it already

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.770
becomes kind of plausible that
you can sketch a general wave

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.320
function.
