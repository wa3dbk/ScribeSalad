00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
PROFESSOR: So we'll look at
the Schrodinger equation.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.400
We're going to work
for bound states.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.660
We could work with
scattering states

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.090
in spherical coordinates,
but it's usually

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.100
done in advanced courses.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.310
The most important
thing is the calculation

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.140
of the bound states.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.250
This is kind of a neat
part of quantum mechanics

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.530
because, in a sense, you get
accustomed in quantum mechanics

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.240
about uncertainties.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.830
You cannot predict the
probability that the photon

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.740
will go through this branch
of the interferometer or this

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.545
other probability.

00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:39.080
You can't be sure and all this.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.840
But here you get
the energy levels.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.930
And you get the
exact energy level.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.970
So it's a nice thing that,
in quantum mechanics,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.650
energy levels are things
that you calculate exactly.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.540
Of course, when
you try to measure

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.110
energy levels experimentally,
the uncertainties arise again.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.630
You get the photon
of some energy

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.606
and then there's some energy
time uncertainty or something

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:02.950
like that, that can bother you.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.740
But the end result
is that these systems

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.590
have beautifully the
term in fixed numbers

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.920
called energy levels.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.020
And that's what we're aiming at.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.770
It's a nice thing because it's
the most physical example.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.270
It has many applications.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.850
The energy levels
of hydrogen atom.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.400
The more you study,
the more complicated

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.550
they are because you can
include fine effects,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.980
like the effects of the
spins of the particles.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.670
What does it do?

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.630
The specs of relativity.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.760
What does it do?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.370
All kinds of things
you can put in and do

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.510
more and more accurate results.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.720
So it's really
unbelievable how much

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.730
you can learn with the fine
spectrum of the hydrogen atom.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:53.760
Our equation is minus h squared
over 2m, d second dr squared--

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.980
the radial equation--
plus h squared l times l

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:09.340
plus 1 over 2mr squared
minus ze squared over r,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.730
u is equal to Eu.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.680
So this is the radial equation.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.510
Remember it was
like the Schrodinger

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.150
equation for a variable u.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.440
And the wave function was u
over r times psi lm or Ylm,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.540
actually, a spherical harmonic.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.240
Here I could have
labeled u with E and l

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.440
because could
certainly u depends--

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.850
u is u of r.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.130
And u depends on the energy
that we're going to get.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.710
And it will depend
on l that is there,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.540
in the differential equation.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.890
This is the effective potential
that we discussed before.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.210
It was the original
potential to which you

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.590
add the centrifugal barrier.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.630
And what are you
supposed to solve here?

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.240
You're supposed to
solve for l equals 0.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.640
To find some states
for a, go one, two,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.010
three, four, infinity.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.730
You should find all the
energy levels of this thing.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.830
So the wave function is
psi of r theta and phi

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:31.980
will be this u of r over r
times Ylm of theta and phi.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.580
And, in fact, plugging that
into the Schrodinger equation

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.120
was what gave us
this radial equation.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.020
So this was called
the radial equation,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.690
which we talked about,
but never quite solved it

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.135
for any particular example.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.500
OK.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.190
As you know, we
like, in this course,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.990
to get rid of units
and constants,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:05.730
so our first step is to
replace r by a unit free x.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.710
And we have the right quantity.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.930
a0.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.130
a0 would be the perfect thing.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.769
So you-- if you
do that, you will

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.220
be able to clean up the units.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.090
But if you do that,
you might not quite

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.810
be able to clean up the
z from all the places

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.720
that you would like
to clean it up.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.250
So we can improve that--

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.720
maybe it's not too obvious.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.770
--by putting a 2 over z Here.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:50.180
z has no units, of course,
so that you would probably

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.520
do by trial and error.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.970
You would say, well I want
to get rid of the z as well.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.020
And I have it in this form.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.260
And you will see
how it works out.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.940
So at this moment, I have
to plug r into this equation

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.160
and just clean it up.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.520
And what should happen is that
everything, all the units,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.800
should give you a factor
with units of energy.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.330
Because at the end of the--

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.420
whatever is left, it's
not going to have units.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.270
Everything out must
have units of energy.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.510
So this takes about
one line to do.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.620
I'll skip some algebra
on these things.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.000
I'll try to post
notes soon on this.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.100
So if you leave a
line you could do

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.020
that calculation for yourselves
and it might be worth it.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.760
The claim is that
we get 2z squared e

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.710
squared over a0,
multiplying minus d second,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:24.980
dx squared plus l times l
plus 1 over x squared minus 1

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.270
over x, times u, equals Eu.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.650
That will be the
common factor that

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.660
will come out of everything
by the time you solve it.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.105
And it has the units of
energy, as you can imagine.

00:06:50.105 --> 00:06:53.360
e squared over a0
has a unit of energy.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.480
So might as well move
that to the other side

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.150
to get the final form
of the equation, which

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.290
would be minus d second,
dx squared plus l times l

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:11.830
plus 1 over x squared,
minus 1 over x, u

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:23.040
is equal to minus
kappa squared u.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:32.030
Where kappa squared is
going to be minus E over 2z

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.960
squared little e
squared over a0.

00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:41.900
OK.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.440
The trick on all
these things is to not

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.600
lose track of our variables.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.690
And that-- it's a
little challenging.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.840
So let me just re-emphasize
what's going on here.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.880
We've passed from r
variables to u variables,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.150
that we will still
do more things.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.440
And we have a0 in
there, z in there,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.970
and then the energy
is really encapsulated

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.490
by kappa squared here.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.140
And this kappa is unit free.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.890
So if you know kappa,
you know the energies.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.830
That's what you
should be looking for.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.460
Kappa is the thing you
want to figure out.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.730
Knowing kappa is the same
as knowing their origins

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.100
because this is just a
constant that gives you

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.190
the scale of the energy.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.690
So this is what
we want to solve.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.770
And the equation doesn't
look all that complicated,

00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:01.300
but it's actually not yet
that simple, unfortunately.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.340
So we have to keep
working with it a bit.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:12.710
So one reason you can see
that an equation like that

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.750
would not be too
simple, is to look at it

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.530
and see what kind of recursion
relation it would give you.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.380
And that's a good thing
to look at the beginning.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:30.980
And you say, OK here I'm going
to lower the number of powers

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.280
by two.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.880
Here I'm going to lower the
number of powers by one.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.440
And here I'm not going to
lower the number of powers.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.710
You're gonna have three terms.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.320
So it's not that simple
recursion relation,

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.630
which the next term is
determined by the previous one.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.470
So that suggests you
better do some work still

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.370
with this equation to
simplify the situation.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.130
And several things that
you can do-- one thing

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.450
is to look at the behavior of
the equation, near infinity,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:06.770
near zero, and see if you
see patterns going on.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.150
One thing we're
going to do is to--

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.650
which is not urgent,
but it's usually done.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.900
And people do it
in different ways.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:24.050
--is to look at x goes
to infinity and see what

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.160
the solutions may look like.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.920
So as x goes to infinity, the
differential equation probably

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:38.320
can be approximated to keep this
storm to see how things vary.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.860
And x goes to infinity.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.760
Throw this, throw
this, and keep that.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:49.920
So you would have d
second u dx squared is

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.525
equal to kappa squared.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:02.560
So this suggests
that u goes like e

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.670
to the plus minus kappa x.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.510
So exponential behavior.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.050
e to the plus minus kappa x.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.530
Ideally, of course,
for our solutions,

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.140
we would like the
minus one, but we

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.670
will see what the equations do.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.270
Now this suggests, yet another
transformation that people do,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.220
which is--

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.890
look, kappa is
dimensionless and we

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.610
had x that is unit free also.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:39.690
So kappa has no
units, x has no units.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.000
So let's move to yet
another variable.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.300
We started with r being
proportionate to x.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.370
And now we can put factors that
may help us without units here.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.220
So I'm not suggesting
that this is something

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.040
that would occur to me,
if I'm doing this problem,

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.210
but it's certainly a
possible thing to do.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:10.360
To say, OK, I'm going to
define now rho as kappa x.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.320
And with x being
given by this, rho

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.810
would be 2 kappa z over a0 r.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.400
So rho is going to
be my new coordinate.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.510
I'm sorry, we've gone to x.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:44.130
And now we've gone to rho,
a new variable over here.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:49.420
So what happens to the
differential equation?

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.960
Well, it's going to
be a little better,

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.720
but in particular the solutions
may be a little better.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.925
But here it is.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.590
If you look at the
differential equation.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.150
The differential equation here.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:22.580
Think of moving the
kappa squared here below.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.330
And then you see, immediately,
it fits perfectly well

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.660
in the first two terms.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:37.150
So you get minus d second, d rho
squared plus l times l plus 1,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.690
rho squared.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.290
And here it doesn't
fit all that well.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:51.800
You would have 1 kappa
leftover, so 1 over kappa rho, u

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.230
equals minus u.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:06.440
Yes it's kind of suggestive.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.940
The kappa has almost
disappeared from everywhere,

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.410
but it better not
disappear from everywhere.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.385
If it would have
disappeared from everywhere

00:14:15.385 --> 00:14:18.670
we would have been in problems
because the equation would've

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.500
not fixed the energy.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.520
You see we're hoping that the
differential equation will have

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.760
additional solutions for
some values of the energy

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.470
and for the others no.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.780
So the energy better
not disappear.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.840
It came close to
disappearing, the kappa,

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.850
but it's still here,
so we're still OK.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:46.410
And now, you will
say, OK, this is nice.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:52.050
If you look at rho
going to infinity again.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.550
It works as we wanted.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:15:00.960
You get d second u, d rho
squared is equal to u.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:10.030
And that means u goes to e
to the plus minus rho, which

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.030
is what inspired this.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.280
And the other part
of the solution

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.740
is the solution at
near r going to 0.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.580
Or your x going to 0
or near rho equal--

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.810
going to 0.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.530
So near rho going to 0,
you have these two terms.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.120
And we actually
did it last time.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:41.950
We analyzed what was going on
with this equation last time.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.850
Near rho equal to 0.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:50.970
And we found out that u must
behave like rho to the l plus 1

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.830
for rho going to 0.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.380
So it was from this two terms
the differential equation.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.650
And for rho going to 0.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.070
Remember the wave
function must vanish.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.990
And how fast it should vanish?

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:14.971
Should vanish to this
power to the l plus 1.

00:16:14.971 --> 00:16:15.470
OK.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.630
So you know lots of things
about this function.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.560
So first of all, that
this thing doesn't

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.630
have necessarily polynomial
solutions because it

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.000
behaves exponentially.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.180
Moreover, you know it doesn't
start with constant plus rho

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.070
plus rho squared.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.130
It starts with rho
to the l plus 1.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.440
So it is pretty important
to see all these things

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.180
before you try to do a recursion
relation because recursion

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.780
relation might lead
you to funny things.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.580
So here we go.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.670
What do we do based on all this?

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.360
We try something better.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.690
Which is-- we said u of rho, the
solution-- we're writing ansets

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.930
--is going to be rho
to the l plus 1, that

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:12.359
will have the right
behavior for rho going to 0.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:16.715
An unknown function
w of rho times

00:17:16.715 --> 00:17:23.010
e to the minus rho, which is
the right behavior we want.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.700
Now there is no
assumption, whatsoever,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.700
when you write in
ansets of this form.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.080
You're just expressing
your knowledge.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.590
Because at the end
of the day if rho--

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.030
if omega-- or w here,
actually, is undetermined.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.810
This w will have an e to the
rho that cancels this factor.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:47.130
And may be off with some
funny power that cancels this.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.910
This is just a hope
that we're expressing

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.600
that by writing this
solution in this form,

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.000
this quantity may be simple.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.190
Because we know this is present
in the solution for larger rho,

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:06.270
this is present for small
rho, well in between

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.120
we might have that.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.750
And when you write
analysis of this form,

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:31.070
you hope for a simple
differential equation for w.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.310
So what do we get?

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:43.280
We can plug that ansets into
the differential equation

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:49.470
that we already have
and see what happens.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.000
And indeed that's what we'll do.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.520
I'll skip the calculation.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.990
In my notes, it
took me half a page

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:04.690
and I write big, so
it's not too long.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.760
So what do we get?

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.130
You get an equation that
doesn't look that simple.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.080
I'm sorry.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.640
It just looks like a
step back, but it's not.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:28.370
d second w, d rho squared plus
2 times l plus 1 minus rho.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.830
Strange.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:42.059
dw, d rho plus, 1 over kappa
minus 2 times l plus 1,

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:44.160
w equals 0.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.890
OK.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.100
Aesthetically, it looks worse.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:57.000
Certainly that equation on
the left board looked nicer,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.830
but actually it's pretty
good because, again, now look

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.630
at your recursion relation.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.580
How will it be?

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.790
If you take some power--

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.140
fixed power.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.100
Here you lose one power.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.150
Here with the l plus 1 of
these, you lose one power.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.790
Here you lose nothing.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.470
And here you lose nothing.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:29.050
So you have either one
power less or your power.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:33.250
So it's a one step recursion
relation without the gap.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.120
It's not like the
two steps that we

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.960
had for the harmonic oscillator,
for the Legendre polynomials.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.660
Here is one step
recursion relation.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.950
ak plus 1 determined by ak.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.720
So we say, excuse
me to the equation,

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.320
you don't look that good,
but you're very solvable.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.940
So we can proceed.
