00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240
PROFESSOR: So let's
do an example where

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.340
we can calculate
from the beginning

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.490
to the end everything.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.750
Now, you have to get
accustomed to the idea of even

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.270
though you can
calculate everything,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.810
your formulas that you get
sometimes are a little big.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.470
And you look at them
and they may not

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.370
tell you too much unless you
plot them with a computer.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.570
So we push the calculations
to some degree,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.990
and then at some
point, we decide

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.840
to plot things using a
computer and get some insight

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.750
on what's happening.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.666
So here's the example.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.850
We have a potential up
to distance, a, to 0.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.750
The wall is always there, and
this number is minus v naught.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.250
So it's a well,
a potential well.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.140
And we are producing energy.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.050
Eigenstates are coming here.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.040
And the question now is to
really calculate the solution

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.020
so that we can really
calculate the phase shift.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.720
We know how the
solutions should read,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.840
but unless you do
a real calculation,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.110
you cannot get the phase shift.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.720
So that's what we want to do.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.220
So for that, we have to solve
the Schrodinger equation.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.710
Psi of x is equal to what?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.870
Well, there's a discontinuity.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.990
So we probably have to write
an answer in which we'll

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.420
have a solution in one piece and
a solution in the other piece.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.479
But then we say, oh,
we wrote the solution

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.070
in the outside piece already.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.090
It is known.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.590
It's always the same.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.670
It's universal.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.340
I don't have to think.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.890
I just write this.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.990
E to the i delta.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.980
I don't know what
delta is, but that's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.080
the answer, E to the i delta
sine kx plus delta should

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.870
be the solution for
x greater than a.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.640
You know if you were
not using that answer,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.610
it has all the
relevant information

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.850
for the problem, time
delays, everything,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.000
you would simply write
some superposition of E

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.790
to the i kx and E to the minus
i kx with two coefficients.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.680
On the other hand, here, we
will have, again, a wave.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.460
Now, it could be maybe
an E to the i kx or E

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.620
to the minus i kx.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.640
Neither one is very good
because the wave function

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.080
must vanish at x equals 0.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.070
And in fact, the k that
represents the kinetic energy

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.040
here, k is always related to
E by the standard quantity,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.300
k squared equal to mE
over h squared or E equal

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.560
the famous formula.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.340
On the other hand, there
is a different k here

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.880
because you have
different kinetic energy.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:02.200
There must be a k prime here,
which is 2m E plus v naught.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.180
That's a total kinetic
energy over h squared.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.195
And yes, the solutions
could be E to the ik prime

00:04:09.195 --> 00:04:14.740
x equal to minus ik
prime x minus ik prime x,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.769
but since they must vanish at
0, should be a sine function.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.690
So the only thing
we can have here

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:33.650
is a sine of k prime x for x
less than a and a coefficient.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.830
We didn't put the additional
normalization here.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.810
We don't want to put
that, but then we

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.210
must put the number here,
so I'll put it here.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.770
That's the answer, and
that's k and k prime.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.320
Now we have boundary
conditions that x equals a.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:04.780
So psi continues at x equals a.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.060
What does it give you?

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:14.680
It gives you a sine of ka
is equal to E to the i delta

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.500
sine of ka plus delta.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:27.020
And psi prime continues
at x equals a will give me

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:35.530
ka cosine ka equal--

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.800
I have primes missing;
I'm sorry, primes--

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:50.025
equals k E to the i delta
cosine ka plus delta.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.640
What do we care for?

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.330
Basically we care for delta.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.420
That's what we want to find
out because delta tells us

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.475
all about the physics
of the scattering.

00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:12.690
It tells us about the scattering
amplitude, sine squared delta.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:19.270
It tells us about the time
delay, and let's calculate it.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.150
Well, one way to
calculate it is to take

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.360
a ratio of these two
equations so that you get rid

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.770
of the a constant.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.710
So from that side
of the equation,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:40.090
you get k cotangent
of ka plus delta

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:46.210
is equal to k prime
cotangent of k prime a.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:58.660
Or cotangent of ka plus
delta is k prime over k.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.130
We'll erase this.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.700
And now you can do two things.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.820
You can display some
trigonometric wizardry,

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:21.415
or you say, OK, delta is arc
cotangent of this minus ka.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.670
That is OK, but it's not ideal.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.860
It's better to do a little bit
of trigonometric identities.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.140
And the identity
that is relevant

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:48.970
is the identity for cotangent of
a plus b is cot a cot b minus 1

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:54.760
over cot a plus cot b.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:01.990
So from here, you have
that this expression

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:18.990
is cot ka cot delta minus 1
over cot ka plus cot delta.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:27.430
And now, equating left-hand
side to this right-hand side,

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.870
you can solve for
cotangent of delta.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.740
So cotangent of delta
can be solved for--

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.230
and here is the answer.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:48.180
Cot delta is equal to tan
ka plus k prime over k cot k

00:08:48.180 --> 00:09:00.260
prime a over 1 minus k prime
over k cot k prime a tan ka.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.460
Now, who would box such
a complicated equation?

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.361
Well, it can't be
simplified any more.

00:09:10.361 --> 00:09:10.860
Sorry.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.640
That's the best we can do.
