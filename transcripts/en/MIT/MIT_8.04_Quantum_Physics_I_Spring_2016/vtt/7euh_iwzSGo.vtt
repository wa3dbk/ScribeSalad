00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.280
PROFESSOR: This is a wonderful
differential equation,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.030
because it carries a
lot of information.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.660
If you put this
psi, it's certainly

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.340
going to be a solution.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.190
But more than that,
it's going to tell you

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.300
the relation
between k and omega.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.680
So if you try your--

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.230
we seem to have gone
around in circles.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.660
But you've obtained
something very nice.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.200
First, we claim that that's
a solution of that equation

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.720
and has the deep
information about it.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:48.280
So if you try again, psi equal
e to the ikx minus i omega t,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.020
what do we get?

00:00:50.020 --> 00:01:02.750
On the left hand side, we
get ih minus i omega psi.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.640
And on the right
hand side, we get

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.270
minus h squared over 2m and two
derivatives with respect to x.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.510
And that gives you an
ik times and other ik.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.770
So ik squared times psi.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.480
And the psis cancel from the
two sides of the equation.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.890
And what do we get
here? h bar omega.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.040
It's equal to h squared
k squared over 2m, which

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.950
is e equal p squared over 2m.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.460
So it does the
whole job for you.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.530
That differential
equation is quite smart.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.170
It admits these as solutions.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.180
Then, this will have
definite momentum.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.920
It will have definite energy.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.640
But even more, when you
try to see if you solve it,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.490
you find the proper
relation between the energy

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.300
and the momentum that tells
you you have a particle.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.560
So this is an infinitely
superior version

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.450
of that claim that that is
a plane wave that exists.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.340
Because for example, another
thing that you have here

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.650
is that this equation is linear.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.990
Psi appears linearly, so
you can form solutions

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.800
by superposition.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.882
So the general solution,
now, is not just this.

00:02:42.882 --> 00:02:52.640
This is a free particle
Schrodinger equation.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.310
And you might say, well, the
most general solution must

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.980
be that, those plane waves.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.810
But linearity means that you
can compose those plane waves

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.380
and add them.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.160
And if you can add plane
waves by Fourier theorem,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.844
you can create pretty much
all the things you want.

00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:12.260
And if you have
this equation, you

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.700
know how to evolve
free particles.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.620
Now, you can construct a
wave packet of a particle

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.600
and evolve it with the
Schrodinger equation

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.960
and see how the wave packet
moves and does its thing.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.450
All that is now
possible, which was not

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.130
possible by just saying,
oh, here is another wave.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.390
You've worked back
to get an equation.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.540
And this is something
that happens in physics

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.140
all the time.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.390
And we'll emphasize it
again in a few minutes.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.110
You use little
pieces of evidence

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.800
that lead you-- perhaps not
in a perfectly logical way,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.000
but in a reasonable
way-- to an equation.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.660
And that equation
is a lot smarter

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.750
than you and all the
information that you put in.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.540
That equation has
all kinds of physics.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.080
Maxwell's equations were found
after doing a few experiments.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.750
Maxwell's equation
has everything in it,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.490
all kinds of phenomena that
took years and years to find.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.779
So it's the same
with this thing.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.690
And the general solution
of this equation

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.660
would be a psi of x
and t, which would be

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.210
a superposition of those waves.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.020
So you would put an e to
the ikx minus i omega t.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.760
I will put omega of k
because that's what it is.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.310
Omega is a function of k.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.930
And that's what represents our
free particles-- omega of kt.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.930
And this is a solution.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.520
But so will be any superposition
of those solutions.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.730
And the solutions are
parametrized by k.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.220
You can choose different
momenta and add them.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.800
So I can put a wave
with one momentum

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.340
plus another wave
with another momentum,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.450
and that's perfectly OK.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.290
But more generally,
we can integrate.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.870
And therefore, we'll write
dk maybe from minus infinity

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.060
to infinity.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.950
And we'll put a phi of k, which
can be anything that's not part

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.920
of the differential equation.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.820
Now, this is the
general solution.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.360
You might probably say,
wow, how do we know that?

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.280
Well, I suggest you try it.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.250
If you come here,
the ddt will come in.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.300
We'll ignore the k.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.070
Ignore this.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.240
And just gives you
the omega factor here.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.610
That ddx squared-- we'll
ignore, again, all these things,

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.840
and give you that.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.750
From the relation omega minus
k equals 0, you'll get the 0.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.500
And therefore, this
whole thing solves

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.811
the Schrodinger equation--
solves the Schrodinger

00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:10.310
equation.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.910
So this is very general.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.880
And for this, applies
what we said yesterday,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.140
talking about the
velocity of the waves.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.670
And this wave, we
proved yesterday,

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.470
that moves with
a group velocity,

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:42.300
v group, which was equal
to d omega dk at some k0,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.380
if this is localized at k0.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.540
Otherwise, you can't
speak of the group

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.860
velocity this thing will not
have a definite group velocity.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.310
And the omega dk--

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.280
And you have this relation
between omega and k,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.570
such a to way that this is
the evp, as we said yesterday.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:11.232
And this is ddp of
b squared over 2m,

00:07:11.232 --> 00:07:14.670
which is p over m,
which is what we call

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.540
the velocity of the particle.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:24.212
So it moves with the proper
velocity, the group velocity.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.510
That's actually a
very general solution.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.680
We'll exploit it to calculate
all kinds of things.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.320
A few remarks that come
from this equation.

00:07:42.075 --> 00:07:42.575
Remarks.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.970
1, psi cannot be a real.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.590
And you can see that
because if psi was real,

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.000
the right hand
side would be real.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.030
This derivative would be
real because the relative

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.730
of a real function
is a real function.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.380
Here you have an
imaginary number.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:12.080
So structurally, it is
forbidden to have full wave

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.820
functions that are real.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.120
I call these full wave
functions because we'll

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.010
talk sometime later about time
independent wave functions.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.790
But the full wave
function cannot be real.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.020
Another remark is that
this is not the wave

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.130
equation of the usual type--

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:41.140
not a usual wave equation.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.480
And what a usual wave
equation is something

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.690
like d second phi dx
squared minus 1 over v

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:56.150
squared d second phi
dt squared equals zero.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.640
That's a usual wave equation.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.800
And the problem with
that wave equation

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.590
is that it has real solutions.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:11.840
Solutions, phi that go
like functions of x minus

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.550
is vt, plus minus x over vt.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.690
And we cannot have
those real solutions.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:26.710
So we managed to get a wave, but
not from a usual wave equation.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:31.120
This, waves also all move
with some same velocity,

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.830
velocity, v, of the wave.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.770
These waves don't do that.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.830
They have a group velocity.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.660
It's a little bit
different situation.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.530
And what has happened
is that we still

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.260
kept the second derivative,
with respect to x.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.610
But in time, we replaced
it by first derivative.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.380
And we put an i.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.480
And somehow, it did
the right job for us.
