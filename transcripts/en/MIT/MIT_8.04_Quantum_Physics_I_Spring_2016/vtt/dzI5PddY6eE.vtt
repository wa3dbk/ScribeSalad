00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:14.880
PROFESSOR: We'll begin by discussing
the wave packets and uncertainty.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.500
So it's our first look into this Heisenberg
uncertainty relationships.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.600
And to begin with, let's focus it as fixed
time, t equals zero.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.809
So we'll work with packets at t equals zero.

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:43.731
And I will write a particular wave function
that you may have at t equals 0, and it's

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:50.719
a superposition of plane waves.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.180
So it would be e to the ikx.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.039
You sum over many of them, so you're going
to sum over k, but you're going to do it with

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.990
a weight, and that's 5k.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:16.869
And there's a lot to learn about this, but
the physics that is encoded here is that any

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:28.649
wave at time equals 0, this psi of x at time
equals 0, can be written as a superposition

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.219
of states with momentum h bar k.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:44.179
You remember e to the ikx represents a particle
or a wave that carries momentum h bar k.

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:52.370
So this whole idea here of a general wave
function being written in this way carries

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.859
physical meaning for us.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:03.840
It's a quantum mechanical meaning, the fact
that this kind of wave has momentum.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:15.610
But this phi of k, however, suppose you know
this wave function at time equals 0.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.280
Phi of k is then calculable.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.910
Phi of k can be determined, and that's the
foundation of what's called Fourier's theorem,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.310
that gives you a formula for phi of k.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.490
And it's a very similar formula.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.840
1 over 2 pi, this time an integral over x.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:50.110
So you take this of psi of x0 that you know
and then multiply by e to the minus ikx.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.470
Integrate over x, and out comes this function
of k.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:06.060
So if you know phi of x0, you know phi of
k.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.270
You can calculate this interval and you can
rewrite phi of x0 as a superposition of plane

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.790
waves.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.790
So that's how you would do a Fourier representation.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:26.460
So somebody can give you an initial wave function,
and maybe it's a sine function or a Gaussian

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:34.400
or something, then what you would do if you
wanted to rewrite it in this way, is calculate

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.650
phi of k, because you know this psi, you can
calculate this integral, at least with a computer.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.820
And once you know phi of k, you have a way
of writing psi as a superposition of plane

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.930
waves.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.329
So we've talked about this before, because
we were doing wave packets before and we got

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:04.550
some intuition about how you form a wave packet
and how it moves.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.940
Now we didn't put the time dependence here,
but that can wait.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:22.330
What I wish to explain now is how by looking
at these expressions, you can understand the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:31.460
uncertainties that you find on the wave function,
position, and momentum uncertainties, how

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.650
they are related.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.670
So that is our real goal, understanding the
role of uncertainties here.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:48.240
If phi of k has some uncertainty, how is the
uncertainty in psi determined?

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.150
So that's what we're looking for.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.350
So relationship of uncertainties.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:06.770
Now as before, we will take a phi of k, that
we've usually be in writing, that depends

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:13.640
on k and it's centered around some value k0.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.670
It's some sort of nice, centered function.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:26.410
And it has then, we say, some uncertainty
in the value of the momentum.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:34.530
That is this signal, this phi of k that we're
using to produce this packet.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:42.320
It has some uncertainty, it's not totally
sharp, it's peaked around k0 but not fully

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.420
sharp.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:51.980
So the uncertainty is called delta k and it's
some typical width over here.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:06:00.970
Delta k is then uncertainty.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.700
Now it's not the purpose of today's lecture
to make a precise definition of what the uncertainty

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.700
is.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.080
This will come later.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.650
At this moment, you just want to get the picture
and the intuition of what's going on.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.500
And there is some uncertainty here, perhaps
you would say, look at those points where

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:29.150
the wave goes from peak value to half value
and see what is the width.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.620
That's a typical uncertainty.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.909
So all what we're going to do in these arguments
is get for you the intuition.

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:43.670
Therefore, the factors of 2 are not trustable.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:49.120
If you're trying to make a precise statement,
you must do precise definitions.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.650
And that will come later, probably in about
one or two lectures.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.490
So at this moment, that's the uncertainty,
delta k.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:11.419
And let's assume that this phi of k is real.

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:18.540
And its peaked around k0 uncertainty delta
k.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:25.010
Now what happens with psi of x?

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:33.480
Well, we had our statements about the stationary
phase that you already are practicing with

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.050
them for this homework.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:46.050
If you want to know where this function peaks,
you must look where the phase, this phi--

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.830
we say it's real, so it doesn't contribute
to the phase-- where the phase, which is here,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:59.820
is stationary, given the condition that it
should happen at k0.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.180
The only contribution to the integral is basically
around k0.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.870
So in order to get something, you must have
a stationary phase, and the phase must be

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.320
stationary as a function of k, because you're
integrating over k.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:27.640
And the phase is kx, the derivative with respect
to k of the face is just x, and that must

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:36.459
vanish, therefore, so you expect this to be
peaked around x equals zero.

00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:52.170
So the x situation, so psi of x0 peaks at
x equals 0.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.600
And so you have a picture here.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:03.980
And if I have a picture, I would say, well
it peaks around the x equals 0.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.839
So OK, it's like that.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.360
And here we're going to have some uncertainty.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:19.660
Here is psi of x and 0, and here is x.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:28.269
And let me mention, I've already become fairly
imprecise here.

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:33.319
If you were doing this, you probably would
run into trouble.

00:09:33.319 --> 00:09:40.519
I've sort of glossed over a small complication
here.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:48.029
The complication is that this, when I talk
about the peaking of psi, and you probably

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:57.680
have seen it already, you have to worry whether
psi is real or psi is complex.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.920
So what is this psi here?

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.709
Should it be real?

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:08.699
Well actually, it's not real.

00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:15.540
You've done, perhaps, in the homework already
these integrals, and you see that psi is not

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.540
real.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:23.029
So when we say it peaks at x equals 0, how
am I supposed to plot psi?

00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:27.720
Am I plotting the real part, the imaginary
part, the absolute value?

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:38.230
So it's reasonable to plot the absolute value
and to say that psi absolute value peaks at

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.010
x equals 0.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:52.420
And there will be some width again here, delta
x, width.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:58.410
And that's the uncertainty in psi of x.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:06.709
So the whole point of our discussion for the
next 10 minutes is to just try to determine

00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:12.429
the relation between delta k and delta x and
understand it intuitively.
