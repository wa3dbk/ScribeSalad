00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.090
PROFESSOR: Last time we
discussed the differential

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.690
equation.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.200
I'll be posting notes very soon.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.300
Probably this
afternoon, at some time.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.510
And last time, we solved
the differential equation,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.500
we found the energy
eigenstates, and then turned

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.530
into an algebraic
analysis in which we

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.050
factorized the Hamiltonian.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.820
Which meant,
essentially, that you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.080
could write the Hamiltonian--

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.150
up to an overall constant that
doesn't complicate matters--

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.356
as the product of an a dagger a.

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:44.010
And that was very useful
to show, for example,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.960
that any energy eigenstate
would have to have energy

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.070
greater than h omega over 2.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.280
We call this a
dagger a the number

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.670
operator n, which is
a Hermitian operator.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.750
Recall that the dagger
of a product of operators

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.740
is the reverse order product
of the daggered operators.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.655
So the dagger of a
dagger a is itself.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.140
And then a was related to x
and p, and so was a dagger.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.370
Recall that x and
p are Hermitian.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.710
And there are overall constants
here that were wrote last time,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.200
but now they're not that urgent.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.590
And a and a dagger, the
commutator is equal to one.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.830
That was very useful.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.130
Finally, we also show that
while the energy of any state

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.600
would have to be greater
than h omega over 2,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.680
if you had a state that
is killed by a hat,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.040
it would have the
lowest allowed energy--

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.730
which is h omega over 2.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.610
And, therefore, that
is the ground state.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.280
And we looked at this
differential equation,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.460
and we found this
Gaussian wave function.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.220
And it's a first order
differential equation.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.710
And, therefore, it
has just one solution.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.280
And, therefore, there is
just one ground state,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.510
and it's a bound state.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.300
And, of course, you wouldn't
expect more than one ground

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.890
state, because there's no
degeneracies in the bound state

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.570
spectrum of a
one-dimensional potential.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.580
So we found one ground state was
phi 0, and it's killed by a--

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.690
which means that
it's killed by n-hat,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.710
because a is to
the right in n-hat.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.870
So the a finds phi
0 and just kills it.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.800
Now, the other thing to
note is that the Hamiltonian

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.640
is really, pretty much, the
same thing as the number

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.720
operator multiplied by
something with units of energy.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.070
The number operator has no
units, because a and a dagger

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.520
have no units.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.870
And that's very useful.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.760
So it's like a dimensionless
version of the energy.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.260
And, certainly, if you
have an eigenstate of h

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.960
it must be an eigenstate of n.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:31.610
And the eigenvalue of n--
if we call it capital n.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.760
Therefore, you can
imagine this equation

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.920
acting on an eigenstate--

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.770
which happens to be an
eigenstate of n or of h.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.880
On the left-hand side you
would read the energy,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.730
and on the right-hand side
you would read the eigenvalue

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.010
of the n operator.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.820
So that gives you a very
nice simple expression.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.260
You see that the energy is the
number plus a 1/2 multiplied

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.930
by h-bar [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.270
So that's pretty
much the content

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.510
of what we reached last time.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.110
And now we have to
complete the solution.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.660
And the plan for today is
to complete the solution,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.079
familiarize ourselves
with these operators,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.339
learn how to work with a
harmonic oscillator with them.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.390
And then we'll leave
the harmonic oscillator

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.840
for the time being--

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.480
let you do some
exercises with it--

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.640
but turn to scattering states.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.910
So the second part
of today's lecture

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.845
we'll be talking about
scattering states.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.650
OK.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.710
So when we look at this
thing and you have a number

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.950
operator-- which encodes
the Hamiltonian--

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.790
it's a good idea to
try to understand

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.220
how it interacts with the other
operators that you have here.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.460
And a good question,
whenever you have operators,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.452
is the commutator.

00:05:05.452 --> 00:05:10.400
So you can ask, what is
the commutator of n with a?

00:05:14.657 --> 00:05:17.430
And this commutator
is going to show up.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.080
But it's basically
that kind of thing.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.040
If you have a and a dagger, you
ask, what is the commutator?

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.910
If you have n, you ask,
what is the commutator

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:28.870
with the other thing?

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:36.790
So n with a would be the
commutator of a dagger with a--

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.530
a like that.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.780
And sometimes I will
not write the hats

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.430
to write things more quickly.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.400
Now, in this commutator,
you can move the a out,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.737
and you have a dagger a a.

00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:57.590
And a dagger a is minus 1.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.840
Because aa dagger is 1.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.690
So this is minus a.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.970
So that's pretty nice.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.940
It's simple.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.780
How about n with a dagger?

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.110
Well, this would be a
dagger a with a dagger.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.000
A dagger with a dagger commute.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:38.350
So this a dagger can go
out, and you get aa dagger.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.395
And that's 1, so
you get a dagger.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.570
So it's a nice kind of
computation relation.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.910
You would have
commutation reserve x

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.700
with p given a constant.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.170
Now n with a gives
a number times a.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.880
N commutated with a dagger
gives a number times a dagger.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.315
And those numbers are
pretty significant,

00:07:08.315 --> 00:07:10.640
so I'll write this again.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.314
N with a is minus a.

00:07:16.314 --> 00:07:23.305
And n with a dagger
is plus a dagger.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.380
This is part of the reason--

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.670
as we will see soon--

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.020
that the name of a--

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.360
which we call
destruction operator,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.750
because it destroys the vacuum--

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.450
it's sometimes called
lowering operator,

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.320
because it comes with
a negative sign here.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.070
And we'll see a better
reason for that name.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.430
A dagger is sometimes
called the creation operator

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.160
or the raising operator, because
it increases some number,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.430
as you will see.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.360
And here it's reflected
by these plots.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.070
But we need a little
more than that.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.950
We need a little more
commutators than this.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:28.180
So for example, if I would
have the commutator of a

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.730
with a dagger to the k--

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.020
you can imagine this.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.790
You have to become very
used and very comfortable

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.470
with these
commutation relations.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.860
And sometimes the only way to
do that is to just do examples.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.390
So I'm doing this with a k here.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.610
Maybe-- when you
review this lecture--

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.840
you should do it with k
equals 2 or with k equals 3,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.700
and do it a few times.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.680
Until you're comfortable
with these things,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.250
and you know what identities
you've been using.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.060
If this was a little
quick, then go more slowly

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.100
and make absolutely
sure you know

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.890
how to do those commutators.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.610
In here, I'm going
to say what happens.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.890
You have an a and
you have to move it

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.270
across a string of a-hats.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.930
Now, moving an a
cross an a-hat--

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.780
because of the commutator--
gives you a factor of 1,

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.790
but it destroys the
a and the a-hat.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.490
As you move the a
across the a-hats--

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.910
because this is a
with all the a-hats,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:10:01.840
here, minus the a-hats
times the a there.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.310
So if you could just move
the a all the way across--

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.530
then you cancel with this.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.900
What you get is
what happens when

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.620
you're moving it to across.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.930
And you're moving across
a string of those.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.140
So each time you try to
move on a across an a-hat,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.490
you get this factor of
1 and you kill the a

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.040
and you kill one a dagger.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.120
So this answer
will not have an a,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.760
and it will have
one less a dagger.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:41.840
So a dagger to the k, minus 1.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.650
And then I would argue-- and
you should do it more slowly--

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.970
that you have to go
across k of those.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.420
And each time you
get a factor of 1,

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.820
and you lose the a
and the a dagger.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.550
So at the end you get a k.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.340
You should realize
that this is not

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.810
all that different from the
kind of commutators you had.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.580
Like, with x to the n.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.140
This was very similar--

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.250
it might be a good time to
review how that was done--

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.570
in which that pretty much gives
you an x to the n minus 1,

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.690
times a factor of n,
because p is a derivative.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.730
You could almost think of a
as the derivative with respect

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.240
to a dagger.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.150
And then this
commutator would be 1.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.830
So this is true.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.250
And there is also--

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:53.220
if you want-- an a dagger
with a to the n or a to the k.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.930
This would give you--

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.380
if you had just one of them
you would get a minus sign,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.540
because a dagger with a is that.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.520
But the same thing holds, you're
going to get one less a-hat.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.980
So a-hat to the k minus 1.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.060
A factor of k--

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.340
because k times you're going to
move an a dagger across an a.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.120
And a minus because you're
getting a dagger commutator

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.810
with a, as opposed to a
commutator with a dagger--

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.940
which is 1.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.380
So these are two very
nice and useful equations

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.920
that you should be
comfortable with.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:46.790
Now, this implies that you can
do more with an n operator.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:13:09.820
So n with a-hat to the k, this
time will be minus k a-hat

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.375
to the k.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.780
It doesn't change
the number of a-hats,

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.950
because you're now making
commutators with a dagger a.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:26.730
So each time you have
this commuted with one

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.790
a-hat, the a dagger
and the a give you 1,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.470
but you have another a back.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.900
So the power is the same.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.130
The sign comes from this sign.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.490
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
the n there have a hat?

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.065
PROFESSOR: Yes, it
should have a hat.

00:13:45.065 --> 00:13:46.255
I'm sorry.

00:13:46.255 --> 00:13:46.755
Yes.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:14:02.550
And, similarly, n
a-hat dagger to the k.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:08.100
This is k a-hat dagger to the k.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:16.100
So what happened before,
that n-hat operator leaves

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.600
the a same but puts a number--

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.880
leaves the a dagger the
same and puts a number.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.890
Here, you see it
happening again.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.840
N with a collection--
with a string of a-hats--

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.770
gives you the same
string, but the number.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.230
And with a collection
of a daggers

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.410
gives you the same collection
of a daggers with a number.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:45.090
And the number happens to be
the number of a's or the number

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.890
of a daggers.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:51.610
So that's the reason it's
called the number operator,

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:56.180
because the eigenvalues are the
number of creation operators

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.580
or the number of
destruction operators.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:04.120
I was a little glib by
calling it the eigenvalue.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.300
But it almost looks like
an eigenvalue equation,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.590
which have an operator,
another operator, and a number

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.490
times the second operator.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.480
It is not exactly an
eigenvalue equation, though,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.790
because with eigenvalues
you would just have

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.040
this acting on the second one.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.660
But the fact that
this case appear here

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:31.000
are the reason these
are number operators.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.110
So it was a little
quick for many of you.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.880
Some of you may have
seen this before.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.020
It was a little slow,
but the important thing

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.130
is after a couple
of days from now,

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:49.750
or by Friday, you find all
this very straightforward.
