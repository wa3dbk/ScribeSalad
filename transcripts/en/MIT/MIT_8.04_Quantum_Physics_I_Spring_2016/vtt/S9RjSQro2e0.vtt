BARTON ZWIEBACH: Now
that we've introduce h,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.720
h is a very important
quantity in quantum mechanics.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.560
So let's talk a little
more about h, its units,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.600
and we already put one
number that I really

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.930
wish you will remember.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.470
Now let's talk
about the units of h

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.480
and some other things
you can do with h.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.800
So units of h.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.590
So if you have a quantity that
appears for the first time

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.620
and as it appears
here, E equal h nu,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.160
this is a good place to
understand the units of h

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.310
because the units of h
would be units of energy

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.270
divided by units of frequency.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.250
And I put this square
brackets to denote units.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.430
Now what are the
units of energy?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.370
We're going to work with
units that are characterized

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.950
by M, L and T--

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.390
mass, length, and time.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.500
So energy, you think kinetic
energy and you say, MV squared,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.360
so that's a mass
and velocity squared

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.940
is L squared over T squared.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.960
So that's units of energy.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.860
Frequency is cycles
per unit time.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.480
Cycles have a number of units,
so it's 1 over time here.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.490
So then you say that
it's ML squared over T.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.850
So that's the first
answer and that's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.820
a nice answer,
although it's never

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.870
quite that useful in this way,
so we try to rearrange it.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.140
And I will rearrange it the
following way to think--

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.340
you see, it's nice to think of
what physical quantity that we

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.910
are familiar, hats
units of h-bar.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.500
We know these units of h-bar
are energy over frequency,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.400
but that's not a single physical
quantity, so let's look at it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:31.280
and separate this as L times
MLT. That's the same thing.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.020
And then I see an
interesting thing--

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.770
this is the units of
position, or length.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.840
Length or radius.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.010
Distance.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.315
And this has the
units of momentum p.

00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:52.815
Momentum.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.885
So this product has the
units of angular momentum.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.550
And perhaps that's the
most important quantity

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.770
that has the units of h-bar.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.990
It's something that
you should remember.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.540
Of h-bar has units
of angular momentum,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.600
that's why when people talk
about a particle of spin 1/2,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.520
they say the angular
momentum is 1/2 of h-bar,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.400
and that has the right units.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.650
So spin 1/2 particle--

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.810
1/2 particle-- means
that the magnitude

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.600
of the intrinsic angular
momentum is 1/2 of h-bar.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.760
h or h-bar have the same units,
they just differ by a 2 pi

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.450
that--

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.750
unfortunately, we have to
be careful about that 2 pi,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.530
it affects numbers
and some formulas

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.120
are nicer without the bar,
some formulas are less nice.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.480
So OK.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.540
So another thing
that you could say

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.750
is that this h allows
you to construct

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.600
all kinds of new quantities.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.510
And that's a nice thing to do.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.680
Whenever you have a new constant
of nature that comes up,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.400
and we have the speed of
light, Planck's constant,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.880
Newton's constant-- seem to
be the three fundamental units

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.790
of nature--

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.470
you can do some things.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.760
And you can look
at this quantity--

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.470
h is proportional to rp
and get an inspiration.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.220
So you can think h has
units of r times p.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.810
And you can say, look--

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.730
if I have any
particle with mass M,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.300
I can now associate
a length to it.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.010
I can invent a length
associated to that particle.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.170
And how do I do it?

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.040
Well, this has units of
length, so all I have to do

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.495
is take h and divide by p.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.160
Well, that will be one
way to get the length

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.340
where p is the momentum, and it
will be called the de Broglie

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.370
wavelength.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.750
But there is another way.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.120
Suppose this particle
is just not moving

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.700
and you have the momentum
and you say, wow,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.870
momentum is not moving,
so what's going on here?

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.200
So think of it at
rest and then you say,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.250
well, you still can
construct a length.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.890
You can put h and divide by
the mass times the velocity

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.720
of light, why not?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.080
That's a velocity, it
is a constant of nature.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.990
So that way, you
associate a length

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.230
to any particle of a given mass.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.620
You don't have to tell
me what is the momentum.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.950
You can just know
the mass and it

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.440
has a length associated to it.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.150
So it's called the Compton--

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:43.420
Compton-- wavelength
of a particle.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.170
And I want to make
sure you don't confuse,

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.960
it's not the same as
de Broglie wavelength

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.158
that we will see later.

00:07:01.158 --> 00:07:03.590
It's not the same as the
de Broglie wavelength.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.330
This is the Compton
wavelength of the particle.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.480
And you can say,
all right, good,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.500
you give me a
particle of some mass,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.120
I can tell you what a
length associated to it--

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.680
why would it be important?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.440
It will be important
in two different ways--

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.120
through an experiment and
through a thought experiment,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.750
which I want to do right now.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:43.150
You see, I could ask
the following question--

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.750
I have this particle, has a mass
M. I use the speed of light,

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.760
so with that mass M, I could
associate out to this particle

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.045
a rest energy.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.280
MC squared.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.370
That's the rest energy.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.170
And then I could ask,
what is the wavelength

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:08.540
of a photon that has the
same energy as the rest

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.720
energy of this particle?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.770
So you translate the question
into a question of a length.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.940
Once you have some energy,
there is a natural length,

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.480
which is the wavelength of
a photon with that energy.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.110
So let's ask this question
independently of what we did.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:33.549
So what is the wavelength--

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:45.165
wavelength-- of a photon whose
energy is the rest mass--

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.780
rest mass-- of a particle?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.860
So the rest mass is
MC squared, and that's

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.800
the energy of this photon.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:11.670
And we know that energy of a
photon h nu or hC over lambda,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.710
and there, we can
calculate the lambda.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:20.720
Lambda is hC over MC
squared, and no surprise,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:27.080
it gives us h over
MC and that thing

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.030
is the Compton wavelength.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:34.380
So it's sometimes
called l-Compton

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.820
of the particle of mass M.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:45.780
So this is a way that you
can think of this particle.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.570
You think of a particle, you
have a Compton wavelength,

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.170
and that Compton wavelength
is the wavelength of light

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.470
that has that rest energy.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:59.970
And that actually has
experimental implications

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.240
in high energy particle physics.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.040
Because if you have an
electron and it has a Compton

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:14.490
wavelength, and you shine a
photon that has that size,

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.370
that photon is
carrying as much energy

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.980
as the rest energy
of the electron.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.700
And in particle theory
and quantum field theory,

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:29.010
particles can be created and
destroyed, so this photon maybe

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.430
can do some things and
create more particles out

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.000
of this electron, particle
equation could start.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.790
happening.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:43.230
So it will be difficult to
isolate a particle to a size

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.290
smaller than its
Compton wavelength,

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.820
because the photons could do
such damage to the particle

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.540
by creating new particles
or doing other things to it.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.970
So for an electron, let's
calculate the Compton

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:00.630
wavelength.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:07.920
So l-Compton of an electron
would be h over MeC,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.260
and you would do h--

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:16.480
you would do 2 pi h-bar
C over and MeC squared.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:32.280
And you've got 2 pi
197.33 MeV fermi,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:40.650
and here you would
have 0.511 MeV.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:56.460
So this gives you 2,426 fermi,
or about 2.426 picometers.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.400
Picometers is kind
of a natural length.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.510
Picometer is 10 to
the minus 12 meters.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.760
The Bohr radius is
about 50 picometers,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.900
so that's how big this thing is.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.580
Is it still much bigger than
the size of the nucleus?

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.780
The nucleus is a few fermis.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.900
A single proton is
about a fermi big.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.960
And nucleus grow
slowly, so you can

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.560
have a big nucleus with
200 particles maybe

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.860
of a radius of 7 or 8 fermi.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.920
So this is still a
lot bigger and it's

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:40.580
a very interesting quantity
that will show up very soon.
