00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.478
PROFESSOR: This is the answer.

00:00:02.478 --> 00:00:08.430
Tan of 2 k a plus delta.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.640
It's a little messy, no wonder.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.830
Just plotted this functions.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:26.290
[INAUDIBLE] Sin k plus a
cosh kappa a [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:37.720
plus a prime over kappa
cosh a prime a sinh kappa a.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.470
You have sin a prime a sinh.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.532
The sinh causes outer
[INAUDIBLE] the same

00:00:48.532 --> 00:00:50.740
but this one changes.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.270
Centered here, k prime
over kappa cos k prime

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.466
a cosh kappa a.

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:07.140
So it's a well-defined
expression,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.070
if you know the
number of kappa a,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.945
you can calculate everything.

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:15.555
Let me just make sure
you can see that.

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:22.904
If you know-- if you
said, for example, ka,

00:01:22.904 --> 00:01:25.284
this is a natural variable.

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:33.050
ka is just-- the k is related
to the energy direction.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.690
So ka has no limits, call it u.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:47.580
Then you have two parameters
of the square well [INAUDIBLE],,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.940
a depth we don't and
a height we want.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.730
So there's natural to
define just [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.920
would have z 0 squared
which is 2m v 0

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.400
a squared over h squared.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.830
You also define z 1 squared
[INAUDIBLE] as 2m v1

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.611
a squared over h squared.

00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:22.620
And then the energy--

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.046
we can do another
thing, we're going

00:02:29.046 --> 00:02:34.192
to find the energy divided
say, by v 1 to be little e.

00:02:37.168 --> 00:02:41.194
And that's reasonable
because these energies

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:45.630
is compared always with
v 1, and we're solving--

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.146
we've solved this
problem in the domain

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:51.730
when the energy
is less than v 1,

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.470
and that's why we'll
have kappas here,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.045
and if energy was
bigger than v 1,

00:02:56.045 --> 00:03:00.414
you would have trigonometric
functions everywhere.

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:04.670
Now you can switch from
trigonometric to hyperbolic

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.590
by analytic continuation,
letting and angle

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.740
become imaginary, a
trigonometric function becomes

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.674
a hyperbolic function.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.320
Most of us are
rather comfortable

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.110
doing this at the beginning,
because of the matter of sine

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.980
if you mess up a sine,
it's a big problem.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.790
But at the end of the day, it
actually saves a lot of work.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.840
So a little of that in
the homework you will see.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.425
But at any rate, this is
valued for e in this range.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.010
And therefore this ratio
is h squared k squared.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:05.722
You can put an a squared
over 2m v 1 a squared.

00:04:05.722 --> 00:04:10.266
And you can see
a u squared here.

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:16.010
And-- I'm sorry, not there.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.760
A u squared here, and
the h squared divided

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.519
here gives you a z 1.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.910
So this is u squared
over z 1 squared.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.990
A couple of extra things--

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.690
I'm just putting it
here because if you ever

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.940
have the curiosity of doing
this plots, this may help.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.370
k prime squared is
related to the energy,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.250
therefore u squared
and v 0 z 1 squared.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.360
This is-- c 0 squared,
[INAUDIBLE] 0.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.020
And for the other
one, kappa a squared

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.060
is equal to z 1 squared
minus u squared.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.590
So everything becomes a
function of u Wherever

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.350
you have a kappa prime a
you have a square root of u.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.900
Now, somebody has to give you
the values of z 0 and z 1.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.820
Those are the data of
the potential-- z 0

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.988
and z 1 are numbers
you know then.

00:05:19.988 --> 00:05:25.220
Therefore you know kappa a
is a function of u, kappa--

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.360
k prime a is a function
of u, and ka, which is u.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.380
Therefore this equation becomes
a function of u [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.330
this arc tangent here,
and so for delta.

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:46.435
It's messy.

00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:52.200
There's no-- remember I
mentioned the other day

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.070
the fact that you could do
trigonometric identities,

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.450
and so for tan delta here.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.275
But then this I don't think
simplifies when you solve that.

00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:03.840
It becomes just a bigger mess.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.590
You did solve for tan
delta, it's very messy.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.580
So anyway, let's leave it there.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.160
Are there any questions
in solving this problem?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.680
So in principle, we solved it.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.690
I didn't plot
anything, so you still

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.190
don't have any insight
as to what's happening.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.590
But you've learned in
principle how to solve it.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.612
Any questions?

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.458
OK, so let's plot this then.

00:06:47.802 --> 00:06:51.720
Maybe I should start here.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.010
OK.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.470
I'll start here.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.360
Oh, if I'm going to plot,
I have to choose things.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.500
So we'll choose z 0
squared equals to 1,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.183
or z 0 equals to 1.

00:07:04.183 --> 00:07:09.960
And z 1 squared equals to 5.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.440
So we put a big barrier there.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:22.434
And now let's go delta
as a function of ka or u.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:38.354
Now, from this equation, we
see that u and the little e

00:07:38.354 --> 00:07:43.650
must be at most 1 for our
formulas to be correct.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.690
So u must be up to square--

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:53.890
up to z 1, because you must
keep this ratio less than 1.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.540
So we can plot u up
to square root of 5.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.460
5, here's 2.

00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:09.338
And that's it.

00:08:09.338 --> 00:08:14.990
And here we're going
to plot delta of u.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:20.466
And here is minus
pi over 2 minus pi.

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:24.690
And so what does
it do, the phase?

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:29.040
There no way you can guess,
I think, from this formula.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.560
I could not guess
from this formula.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.590
So we could try to imagine--

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.340
it's possible to guess,
actually, after you've

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.169
solved this week's homework.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.450
You probably will
have a good guess

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:50.120
that the phase shift begins
with minus 2ka, as if

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.720
with very little energy
you reflect back here.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.995
So there will be a shift that
is calculable without doing

00:08:57.995 --> 00:08:59.080
any work.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.070
So it begins linearly.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.390
And it represents
a time advance.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.960
So it goes linearly
and negative.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.350
That's how it begins.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:17.070
Because for very little energy,
it's going to bounce back.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.894
And you know that the
delay is proportional

00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:21.550
to this derivative.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.270
So must be negative like that.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.040
So then what does it do?

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:34.052
It crosses this point,
which is almost pi,

00:09:34.052 --> 00:09:38.830
and here is what something
quite remarkable happens.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:52.855
That some value you star,
which is about 1.8523, I think.

00:09:52.855 --> 00:09:54.316
That's what I calculated.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.696
Let's see [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:02.504 --> 00:10:09.820
The face that is almost minus pi
suddenly jumps very, very fast,

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:16.851
crosses pi over 2, and then
about [INAUDIBLE] something

00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:18.535
like this.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.750
I don't know what else
it does, because we

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.210
haven't calculated it.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.300
But it jumps very fast.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.060
Almost a value of pi.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.070
Now, let me-- this
is quite interesting.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.280
If you think of what we
used to call the scattering

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:43.220
amplitude as squared
was sin squared delta.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.800
The amplitude of the
scattered wave, sin

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.630
squared delta, the amplitude
of the scattered wave

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.820
is going to be quite
large here, it's

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:58.920
going to be 1, which is the
maximum, as squared is here.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.162
So I want to keep these
two blackboards aligned.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.280
So here it goes like this.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:15.200
It's going to go up like this,
and do this, and broadly go

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:22.690
down, and then
very sharply go up.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.832
More sharply, at least.

00:11:24.832 --> 00:11:29.770
Go up and then
something like that.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.870
So here it is.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:40.880
This point over here has a
strong scattering amplitude,

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.640
but there's nothing too
dramatic happening here.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.810
This sine corresponds to
time advanced, the derivative

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.885
is negative.

00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:56.730
And time advanced cannot
be too large, as you know.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.780
On the other hand,
here is time delayed,

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.190
and apparently they
can't be very large.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.975
So we think this must
be the resonance,

00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:11.680
and this is not a resonance,
even though the scattering

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.260
amplitude is bigger.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:24.530
So we continue here,
and plot the time--

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.010
interestingly, the
amplitude inside the well.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.910
So here it is.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:39.753
How does the wave function
become, through this constant,

00:12:39.753 --> 00:12:41.820
inside the well?

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.675
And indeed, the this confirms
that nothing very special

00:12:45.675 --> 00:12:48.650
is happening here.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.945
What happens now is some
sort of behavior like this,

00:12:51.945 --> 00:12:58.766
and a big jump here, in which
the amplitude apparently--

00:12:58.766 --> 00:13:01.020
I have not quite
confirmed this number,

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.730
it's at least a value 3.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.702
[INAUDIBLE] very
large and short.

00:13:10.702 --> 00:13:17.630
I should have room for one more
plot [INAUDIBLE] the star plot

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.340
of this thing is--

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.240
I'll do it compressed here.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:29.060
The total delay, 1
over a d delta dk.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.500
Well, it begins
negative, and remember

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.720
that when we did the
1 over a, d delta dk,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.970
this is a pure number.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.622
It expresses the delay
in terms of the time

00:13:47.622 --> 00:13:51.080
that it would take to
travel the inside region.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.540
So how many-- if you would
get a 1, or a minus 1,

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.220
it's just a delay of
the size of the time

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.210
needed to travel back and forth.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.560
So actually this goes
a little negative

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.165
at the beginning-- we
know the derivative is

00:14:08.165 --> 00:14:10.410
like that-- and
when you plot this,

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.100
you see that it's
very sharp, and it's

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.690
a value of about fourteen.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.180
Fourteen times gets delayed from
what you would expect naturally

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.799
of the time that it should have
spent travelling back and forth

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.733
A gigantic time delay.

00:14:29.733 --> 00:14:33.190
A peak in the time delay.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.870
Peak in time delay.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:46.860
Peak in the amplitude
inside the well.
