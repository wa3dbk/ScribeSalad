00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.180
DENNIS FREEMAN: Hello Welcome.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.120
The good news, we're
basically done.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.189
We've covered all of the theory.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.960
The only thing
we're going to do,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.670
the remaining part
of the course,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.380
is to think through several
applications of Fourier.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.530
Today I'll do some just really
easy motivational things.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.130
I'll do another
example from filtering,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.980
just because that's
such an important idea.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.880
I'll talk about how Fourier
transforms show up in physics.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.940
And then, starting
next week, we'll

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.270
talk about sampling, which
is just a simple application

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.110
of Fourier.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.530
You've already sort of seen
it in the last lecture.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.710
And then we'll talk about
modulation, which is yet

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.020
another application of Fourier.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.730
So basically you
have the theory,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.446
and all we're going to do for
the remainder of the course

00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:17.070
is think about
applications of Fourier.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.600
So we already talked
about a filter.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.080
I motivated a filter by
thinking about Fourier series

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.880
because it's easy.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.910
If you think about
the system that's

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.610
comprised of a resistor
and a capacitor,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.200
and you have as an input
vi and an output vo,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.490
then you can think about
that system being a filter.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.700
The filter can be characterized
by a frequency response.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.220
You're all experts at that.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.840
And then if you can break the
signal into Fourier components,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.816
which was easy when we
had a Fourier series,

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:53.940
if you can break the signal
into Fourier components

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.180
then it's easy to calculate the
output as the sum of weighted

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.580
and possibly time
shifted versions

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.230
of the components of the input.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.890
So we can decompose the
signal, the square wave,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.610
into a bunch of
Fourier components.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.550
And then think about how
they pass through the filter.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.100
Where if they all pass
through the low frequency

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.540
part of the filter, so that the
gain is one and the phase is 0,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.470
the output looks
just like the input.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.550
And if they all pass through
the part of the filter that's

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.535
sloping down with
a slope of minus 1,

00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:31.230
with the phase
lagging by pi over 2,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.130
you turn a square wave
into a triangle wave.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.340
That was the simplest
example of a filter.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.440
We saw it again when we thought
about speech production.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.220
Because there the idea was that
the different kinds of sounds

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.820
that we make are partially
generated by the larynx,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.270
and partially generated
by the throat.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.950
And it's all the
musculature in your face

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.610
that enables you to make the
precise different sounds.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.620
And that was what we
called the source filter

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.120
model of speech production.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.270
The sources down here,
the filter is here.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.410
And we again, we can think about
it by thinking about filtering.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.270
Filtering comes up
all over the place,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.700
and it's one of the most
important applications

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.340
of Fourier techniques generally.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.860
And it's for all the
reasons you already know.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.870
If you can think of a
way of breaking down

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.000
a signal into
Fourier components,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.440
then you can thing about
an LTI system as a filter.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.930
And in filtering applications,
in signal processing filtering

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.550
applications, we
usually try to think

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.810
about high frequencies,
low frequencies,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.510
designing systems
that pass the lows,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.260
pass the highs,
that sort of thing.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.090
But the key is
breaking down an input,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.200
which might be
complicated in the pieces.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.350
That's where the Fourier
transform is so good.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.910
And so, I want to
illustrate that

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.940
by thinking about a hard
problem in signal processing,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.180
and that is an
electrocardiogram.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.220
So first off, it's
completely amazing

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.920
that you can measure an
electrocardiogram at all.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.280
The voltages
produced by cells are

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.930
on the order of 100 millivolts.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.040
That's true for all cells for
extremely fundamental reasons,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.310
which if you're interested in,
6021 has a lot of information

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.390
about why.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.880
There are fundamental
physical limits

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.750
on what kinds of a
voltage a cell can make.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.170
So the voltages are small, but
they're much worse than that,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.360
they're constrained to
the inside of a cell.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.207
You can't generally get access
to the inside of a cell.

00:04:33.207 --> 00:04:35.290
In fact, there's a big
technological breakthrough,

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.140
and people figured
out how to draw--

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.030
cells are little.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.820
It's kind of hard to
imagine how little they are.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.870
About two to three million
cells would fit in the length,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.032
in a one inch length
of a human hair.

00:04:52.032 --> 00:04:53.490
And that's a skinny
hair like mine.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.240
So blonde skinny hair.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.480
The rest is not necessarily
skinny, but they're skinny.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.400
So you can get about
a million cells,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.200
maybe two million cells in
one length, one inch of--

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.757
length of a human hair.

00:05:08.757 --> 00:05:10.590
To give you some idea
of how small they are.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.110
These tiny, tiny,
tiny little things.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.020
So it was a big deal
when people were

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.552
able to measure inside a cell.

00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:16.260
And when you put
electrodes on your chest

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.920
to measure an electrocardiogram,
you're not inside a cell.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.510
Cells are surrounded
by an insulator.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.760
So not much of that electrical
current is available to you.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.710
Furthermore, the cells in the
heart are surrounded by saline.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.600
What's important about saline?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.400
What is saline?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.621
Salt water.

00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:39.870
What's important about saline?

00:05:42.804 --> 00:05:44.220
What would be
different if we were

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.160
filled with distilled water?

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.810
Besides the fact
that we would die.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.590
Yeah.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.310
Conducts electricity.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.810
So the fluid that
bathes the cells

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.950
has a very high
ionic concentration.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.784
And that means that it
conducts electricity,

00:06:02.784 --> 00:06:04.200
which means most
of the potentials

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.866
are shorted out before they ever
get to the surface of the skin.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.900
Then there's another 20
layers of insulation,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.540
called your skin.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.760
So it's astonishing that you
can even measure these things.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.310
And when you do,
it's not surprising

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.850
that there's a lot of
signal in the waveform,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.750
other than the signal
that you intend.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.300
There's about 10 to the
13th neurons in your body,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.460
and they're all chattering away.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.850
So you see those.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.950
So that the idea of filtering
out the part of the signal

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.862
that results from the EKG
is completely non-trivial.

00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:40.320
And it's very useful to think
about it in a Fourier domain.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.870
And absolutely everybody
does it that way.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.220
If you were to take the Fourier
transform of this waveform,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.720
you would get a
wave form that looks

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.420
like this, which looks
perhaps more complicated.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.820
except that you can make
some sense out of it.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.130
Hearts beat about 60
or 70 times a minute,

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.340
depending on how athletic
and how old you are,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.480
which means that it's
the components around 1

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.020
or bigger that are
coming from the heart.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.007
Things significantly
lower than hertz

00:07:09.007 --> 00:07:10.590
probably aren't
coming from the heart.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.170
Things that are up in the
10 kilohertz region probably

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.390
are not from the heart.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:21.040
This enormous
spike, what's that?

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.510
That's the lights.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.680
That's the power.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.450
That's the-- we distribute
electrical power by modulating

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.670
it at 60 hertz because
that distributes better,

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.380
but then it radiates.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.300
And so some of that can be
coupled into everything,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.430
including me.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.520
So the big line is
the 60 hertz that's

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.720
being coupled from the
power distribution network

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.260
into the person
whose EKG this is.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.450
So what we'd like to
do then is generate

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.620
a filter that takes out
the stuff that isn't EKG.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.840
So we'd like to eliminate
this low frequency stuff,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.380
and we'd like to eliminate this
high frequency stuff, right?

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.710
So what we do is
we design a filter.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.870
Filter design Bode of course.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.370
Right?

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.060
Smile?

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.640
Everybody smile, you know?

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.270
There's nothing on a quiz
for weeks to come, right?

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.440
So Bode.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.580
So we would think about
passing the high frequencies.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.080
I didn't say that right.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.330
So we would like to
cut off the very lows,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.210
we'd like to cut
off the very highs.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.830
And we'd like to get rid of
that one glitch at 60 hertz.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.280
So the 60 hertz thing, that's
what this is intended to do.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.950
It's intended to be a
very narrow filter that

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.130
just wipes out the 60.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.220
So this is a kind of filter
that I'd like to design.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.410
And here is the design.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.110
Handful of poles and 0s.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:59.450
Your task, talk to your neighbor
and figure out which poles

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.550
and which 0s go with the
high pass, the low pass,

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.133
and the notch.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.745
Look at your neighbor,
say hi, smile.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.090
OK, so which of the poles and
0s contribute to the high pass?

00:11:00.295 --> 00:11:01.170
Rught, you can point.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.300
Like, there's up, and there's
left, and there's center.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.859
So which ones are high pass?

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.000
The ones near 0.

00:11:14.816 --> 00:11:16.986
The 0 or the poles?

00:11:16.986 --> 00:11:18.360
Or one of each,
or both, or what?

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.464
So what would the Bode plot
look like if you only had the 0?

00:11:29.464 --> 00:11:30.340
Yeah.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.740
So the 0 alone would cancel
out frequency components at 0.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.092
Which our Bode plot is
a way over there, right?

00:11:41.092 --> 00:11:42.050
What about these poles?

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.924
What's the poles for?

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.450
They flatten that it out.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.390
So if you think
about reading off

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.330
the effect of the poles
and 0s starting at 0

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.047
and going to bigger
and bigger radiuses,

00:11:57.047 --> 00:11:58.630
then the first thing
you have to worry

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.300
about going left to
right on the Bode plot,

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.090
is the 0s doing this.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.040
And then these poles
flatten out the 0s.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.310
So what's this doing?

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.570
That's the thing
that's attenuating

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.510
the high frequencies,
which leaves us with this.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.286
What's that?

00:12:21.286 --> 00:12:22.660
And how do you
know it's a notch?

00:12:25.366 --> 00:12:27.110
There's a 0.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.960
So the 0 on the
j-omega axis means

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.370
there's a frequency that
it completely wipes out.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.710
Why do I need to have
this stupid pole here?

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.860
Can't I just put the 0 there?

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.330
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Bring it back up.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.990
So the idea is that if you
put the pole close to the 0,

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.820
if you get to a frequency that's
pretty far away from those,

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.770
their effects
cancel, and there's

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.200
no effect of either of them.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.080
So their effect is
constrained to frequencies

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:03.620
that are very close measured
in terms of this distance.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.680
So you have to be at a frequency
that's very close in order

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.830
to have an effect.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.160
And when you do that, when
you design such a filter,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.570
you clean up the
wave form a lot,

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:19.580
and no one in their right mind
would generate an EKG machine

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.720
that didn't do this.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.660
I mean, that's just built
into the preamplifier that's

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.070
attached to the electrodes.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.970
So the point is that filtering
is very important application

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.590
of Fourier transforms.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.980
We can take an arbitrary signal
and often get a lot of insight

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.060
into what we would like to
preserve and remove by thinking

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.770
about the Fourier
transform, insights

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.061
that you wouldn't get by
looking at the time wave form.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.650
Next thing I want to think
about is a little bit different.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.080
I want to think about physics.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.960
This isn't, of course, in
physics, nor am I a physicist,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.410
but I do do optics.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.267
And the thing I want to
think about is diffraction.

00:13:59.267 --> 00:14:00.850
You can't understand
optics unless you

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.370
think about diffraction,
and honestly the easiest way

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:11.100
to think about diffraction
is Fourier transform.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.510
So a very simple
example of diffraction.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.870
So here is a
diffraction grating.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.230
So if I pass a coherent beam
through there, which I just

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.560
happen to have, if I
pass a coherent beam

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.650
through a diffraction
grating, what do you see?

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.490
The diffraction
grating split one beam.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.350
All term I've been
pointing with one.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.130
Well, if I put this in front
of it, now I get three.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.700
So somehow there's
something about this that's

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.365
breaking one beam into three.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.960
Can you think why?

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.750
Can you remember 802 where
they probably mentioned this?

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.515
What is this?

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.318
What's in here?

00:15:08.318 --> 00:15:10.070
AUDIENCE: Slits.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.170
DENNIS FREEMAN: Slits.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:11.770
Close.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.420
Yeah.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.430
So the simplest
experiment where you

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.385
could illustrate this kind of
a diffraction phenomenon is--

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:22.425
goes by the name--

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.020
yes.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:27.650
Shout the name.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.775
Young.

00:15:33.775 --> 00:15:35.619
AUDIENCE: Double
slit experiment.

00:15:35.619 --> 00:15:37.940
DENNIS FREEMAN: Double
slit experiment.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.090
So if you pass light
through two slits,

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.470
something phenomenal happens.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.370
And it's very closely
related to this.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.120
What's in this?

00:15:49.862 --> 00:15:51.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.470
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Something like a slit.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.790
It's actually something
like a whole bunch of slits.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.310
So, yeah?

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.196
AUDIENCE: Polarizer.

00:15:59.196 --> 00:16:00.370
DENNIS FREEMAN: Polarizer.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.560
Close.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:06.286
It's one of those neat words
from physics, but not quite.

00:16:06.286 --> 00:16:07.660
Polarized has to
do with the fact

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.540
that the light has an
e field and an m field,

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.280
and they are perpendicular
to each other,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.580
and sources like this one
actually keep them separate.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.120
So this actually does
generate polarized light,

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.230
but you can't really tell
because if I spin the laser

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.940
pointer, you can't
really see anything.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.065
But if I spin the grating--

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.840
I just said something.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.311
So what did I just call this?

00:16:33.311 --> 00:16:34.060
AUDIENCE: Grating.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.380
DENNIS FREEMAN: Grating.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.136
So what is it?

00:16:37.136 --> 00:16:38.260
It's a diffraction grating.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.880
It's got a bunch of little
horizontal structure.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.770
So the idea is here.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.460
The grating, you can think
about it as an array,

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.410
big array, big
compared to the size

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.360
of the point that
I was eliminating,

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.040
big array of scatterers.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.010
So you think about
having a material that

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.200
transmits light
and a material that

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.109
scatters light and a material
that scatters light is arranged

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:08.890
in lines.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.619
And the lines are separated
from each other by some kind

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:16.329
of a distance, here
represented by a capital D.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:20.440
And the reason that you
see the far-field pattern,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.329
we call that the far-field
pattern as opposed

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:23.440
to the near-field pattern.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:30.601
If I were to do this
and put it very close,

00:17:30.601 --> 00:17:32.350
then I would think
about the pattern being

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:36.830
the near-field pattern if
I get close compared to D.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.940
So if the slits are D apart,
the near-field is D close,

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.920
and the far field is when
I'm far away compared to D.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.450
So if I'm far away
compared to D,

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:52.050
then you can imagine that the
light is coming in this way,

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.680
and each one of these
generates scatter.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.230
So there is a spherical
wave coming way out

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.207
from each of these.

00:18:00.207 --> 00:18:01.290
That's Huygens' principle.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.300
Right

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.870
So the idea then is that
there are contributions

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.430
from each one of
these scatterers

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.620
out here in the far field.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.450
Each point in the
far field picks up

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.340
a little bit of light from
each of the scatterers,

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.070
but they're in different
phase relationships.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:26.430
They were in phase when the
coherent light struck these.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.230
But now if I were to
think about a point here,

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.505
the phase that you get is
different from the point here.

00:18:34.505 --> 00:18:41.150
So here the phase from two
points would be about the same.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:46.220
Here they would be different
because the distance traveled

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.220
from this scatterer
is that much longer.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.280
So if I look at a
particular angle,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.560
then each of these scatterers is
a different optical path length

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.290
from the source.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:14.020
That means that if I arrange the
angle so that this is lambda,

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.480
the light that
scatters off of here

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.610
will constructively
interfere with the light that

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.540
scatters off of here and here.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.080
Everybody see that?

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.130
So that means that there's a
funny angle, the sign of which

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.090
is lambda over D in which you
get constructive interference,

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.800
and that's what's going on
with the diffraction grating.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.640
And you can see that.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.380
There are several illustrations
of that all over the place.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.930
Here I have a CD and a DVD.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.300
Which one is which?

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.380
I'm showing you the
backside of a CD and a DVD.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.890
AUDIENCE: DVD is
in the left side.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.536
DENNIS FREEMAN:
DVDs is this one.

00:19:54.536 --> 00:19:55.410
How do you know that?

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.710
AUDIENCE: Because it looks blue.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.293
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Because it looks blue.

00:19:58.293 --> 00:19:59.700
Why does it look blue?

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.740
Not a clue.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.752
It's just they always do.

00:20:03.752 --> 00:20:05.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.050
DENNIS FREEMAN: Smaller.

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:11.340
So somehow this one reflects
better, the bluer lights,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.140
so you see more of
that, and this one

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.790
reflects better longer lights.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.090
This one has got a
greenish twinge maybe.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.130
Kind of like all colors.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.110
I like to call it green.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.390
Maybe it's because
I know the answer.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.500
So if I take these guys, I can
get the same sort of thing,

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.110
so I'll take the CD first.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.629
Now, of course, this
has a coding on it,

00:20:37.629 --> 00:20:39.670
so if I try to shine a
laser straight through it,

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.950
not much will happen.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:46.180
I don't really want
to blind somebody.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.680
So I'm going to
take this and I'm

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.050
going to attempt to hit this
while watching back here,

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.330
which for somebody my age
it's pretty hard to do.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.720
But the idea is going to be
that instead of using this

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.690
as a transmission grating, I'm
going to use it as a reflection

00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.810
grating.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:00.925
So if I do this--

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.880
so that's kind of cute.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.680
So my laser is green.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.795
What's lambda?

00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:14.785
AUDIENCE: 530.

00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:16.030
DENNIS FREEMAN: 530.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:16.930
So let's round off.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:17.941
Let's say 500.

00:21:17.941 --> 00:21:18.440
Yes.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:25.900
So I've got a green
laser, and what

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.954
will happen if I move
the laser back and forth?

00:21:29.954 --> 00:21:31.120
How will the pattern change?

00:21:35.072 --> 00:21:37.050
It won't change.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.960
So if I do this, which I can't
do while I'm watching it,

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.730
no change.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.669
What will happen if I
move this way this way?

00:21:50.122 --> 00:21:51.455
Well, the angle is what matters.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:58.760
So as I move it farther away,
the pattern gets bigger.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:08.720
So if I do this, if I were at
all coordinated, which I'm not,

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.190
I'm trusting that
it's doing what

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:14.150
I'm telling it to because I
can't look at the same time.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:21.110
So let me put this at a
precise 1 meter away, 3 feet.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.560
And let me shine this
in here, and let me

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.690
do a very precise measurement.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.255
And those are now one-foot
apart by my precise measurement

00:22:30.255 --> 00:22:30.755
skills.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:39.420
So what I'd like you to do
is figure out the pitch.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.860
The information on a CD
is written will spirally.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.700
That's the reason there
is an apparent color.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.220
I just measured the pitch.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.290
How far apart are the tracks?

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.780
So take the data.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.330
So if I'm three feet
away from the screen,

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.100
the dots are
separated by one foot

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.640
and figure out how closely
spaced the tracks are on a CD.

00:24:25.045 --> 00:24:25.920
So what's the answer?

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.560
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.310
None of the above.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:41.210
A very small number of
votes, but about 90% correct.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.900
So what do I do?

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:42.858
How do I figure it out?

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:50.600
Yeah.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.830
So we just made a
big deal out of how

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.270
the distance, which
was D sine theta

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.281
had to be an integer
multiple of lambda.

00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:04.280
So all we need to do is
think through some trig.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.520
So if I think about
the dots being

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.320
a foot apart when I'm three feet
away, then the tangent is 1/3.

00:25:21.528 --> 00:25:26.749
So the small angle
approximation is about 1/3,

00:25:26.749 --> 00:25:27.790
so the sine is about 1/3.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:37.960
So lambda is about 500
nanometers divided by 1/3.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.410
And if I carry that out a little
more precisely, I get 1,613,

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.900
and the manufacturer's
specification for CDs

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.670
is 1,600 nanometers.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:51.070
So it's 1.6 micrometers.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.729
Yeah.

00:25:51.729 --> 00:25:55.082
AUDIENCE: [? What ?] is the
precision on [INAUDIBLE]??

00:25:55.082 --> 00:25:58.670
DENNIS FREEMAN: Oh,
they're pretty good.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.410
In fact, we'll talk about
this a little later.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.690
They do this by an
embossing process.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:09.450
So you make a master
out of aluminum,

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.090
and then you stamp it.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.370
And the stamping is
actually very good.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.680
So probably the biggest
manufacturing problem

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.090
is the thermals.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:24.360
So you stamp it in heated
polystyrene, so there's

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.314
a little bit of a coefficient
of shrinkage as it cools,

00:26:27.314 --> 00:26:28.230
but it's not very big.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.300
It's fractions of a percent.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:38.140
So what will happen then
if I switch to the DVD,

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.330
how many tracks are on a DVD?

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.540
So we can do the same
kind of an experiment.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:48.174
Now if I try to do
the DVD, in order

00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:50.590
to get them to be a foot apart,
I have to get much closer.

00:26:53.674 --> 00:26:56.340
So now to get D space at about a
foot, I have to be about a foot

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.420
away.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:03.140
So what's the spacing on
the DVD, smaller or bigger?

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.760
So it's smaller because
the angle got bigger.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.510
So it's the same sort of deal.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:20.140
If you think about the one foot,
so you get one-foot spacing

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:20.995
with about one foot.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.830
So then the tangent is about 1.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.910
It's not quite a
small angle anymore.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:35.980
So theta is 0.78.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:41.410
And so the experimental value
comes out about 704 nanometers,

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:46.730
so it's about a factor of 2.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.710
Smaller.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.540
So we got about
700 nano, so it's

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.837
a fraction of a micron,
rather than 1.6 microns,

00:27:53.837 --> 00:27:55.670
and that's why they
look a little different.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:59.930
So we get about a factor of 2
in terms of information density

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.941
in terms of track count.

00:28:01.941 --> 00:28:04.190
Of course, the information
is also stored more closely

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.660
within a track as well.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.680
So instead of being about
a factor of 2 better,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.020
it's maybe a factor of 4
better because the track

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.290
is based about a factor of 2.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.850
You can do more
interesting things.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:20.474
That's kind of the
most degenerate case

00:28:20.474 --> 00:28:26.800
because that's one D.
So here is a fancier

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.970
grating from my lab, which has
the property that if I shine

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:37.070
the light through
it, I get more dots.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.660
So what's inside this?

00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:46.470
AUDIENCE: A 2D grating.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.900
DENNIS FREEMAN:
It's a 2D grating.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.858
So instead of having just
lines going this way,

00:28:49.858 --> 00:28:54.050
it has lines going this way
and lines going that way.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:59.150
And in fact, back about
5 or 10 years ago,

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.250
when laser pointers
were a novelty,

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.780
they became all the
rage to put them

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.960
right into your laser pointer.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.950
So here's another laser pointer.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.640
So here is a thing
that you screw

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.660
in the end, which has a fraction
grating built right into it.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:23.390
And so now if I mean to say
some graphics reading off

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.910
the cursor, so there is a
cursor now in my laser pointer

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.550
rather than being a dot.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:36.990
Or if I'm more chintzy,
now I can circle things.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.200
I'm not sure why I want to do
that, but in case I wanted to,

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.740
I can do it.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.859
If I wanted to underline
things, I guess.

00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:49.400
I'm not sure.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.660
The point is that these things
are just a diffraction grating.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.321
All that's in there is a little
piece of glass that's got--

00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:00.320
it's not actually glass.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.970
It's actually plastic that was
made with an embossing process,

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.620
same as they make CDs with.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.054
So if you're into--

00:30:09.054 --> 00:30:09.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:10.490
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.989
Who knows.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:19.950
And if you go backwards in
time, they get even chintzier.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.930
So this is an even
older laser pointer.

00:30:33.391 --> 00:30:33.890
They're fun.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.090
You can tell it's older because
it's red and it's dimmer.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.560
If you think the click
art is kind of still--

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:00.990
this is my favorite.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.662
Save the favorite for the end.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.360
Dark side.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.780
I don't know.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:15.150
Anyway, so that's
kind of the idea.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.350
The way you can think
about diffraction grating,

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.380
so now I want think about
a more general theory.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.240
I've worked out
a specific theory

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.510
for a one-dimensional
diffraction grating,

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.540
now I want to think
about the general theory.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:31.440
What if I simply told you
some pattern in space?

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.190
What if I told you your job is
to make the diffraction grating

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.890
to project a dollar sign.

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.410
How would you do it?

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.690
Take a wild guess.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:46.175
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:46.175 --> 00:31:48.470
DENNIS FREEMAN: Take the
Fourier transform, of course.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:53.451
So the idea.

00:31:53.451 --> 00:31:55.700
So what would happen if the
target is more complicated

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.460
than a grating, the
way to think about this

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.760
is the think about just like
in the case of the grating,

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:07.130
if you collect the light
that hits the far field,

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:10.050
the far field bit has a
point in the far field,

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:14.780
came from all over the target
just like in the grating.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.230
In the grating, the
point in the far field

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.300
came from every one
of the lines and there

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.605
was a simple relationship
among the phases that

00:32:22.605 --> 00:32:24.230
came from each of
the lines, and that's

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.410
what gave rise to the
pattern in the far field.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.280
Well, the same thing
is always true.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.780
All the points in the image
in the far field came from--

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.580
each point, had contributions
from every point in the target.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:44.030
And if you think about
points in the target,

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.240
now I'm going to think
about just one point

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.880
so this is the target space.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.870
Way out there is the far field.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:56.560
So in the target space,
there's an x-coordinate,

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.770
there's a y-coordinate,
there's a z-coordinate.

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:03.130
Let me just worry
about x for the moment.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:08.440
This point that is x
displaced in this direction

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:13.090
contributes a different
phase to the far field

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.980
than a point that's at 0.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.420
Because the point is at x,
you get a different phase.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.610
And that phase relationship
depends, not just

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.600
on x, but also on the angle.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.290
And this is the relationship,
the phase generated

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.840
by a scatterer at the point, x.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.470
Just like the
one-dimensional grating,

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.560
if you take x and
multiply by the sine,

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.460
that tells you the
delay in meters,

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.710
but then you can convert
that into radians

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:51.630
by dividing by the wavelength
and multiplying by 2 pi.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:57.020
So the phase that is
generated by scattering

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.170
from this point
displaced a distance, x,

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:04.264
when measured in angle,
theta, in the far field,

00:34:04.264 --> 00:34:04.930
looks like that.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:11.179
That's supposed to be just
a simple reiteration of what

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.420
we just did.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:17.050
Now the tricky part is
that all of the light that

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.409
hits a particular
point in the far field,

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:24.010
a point in the far field
is characterized as theta.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:26.320
Where is my laser pointer?

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.810
So if you go to the
far field at a place,

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:34.620
theta, the total amount of light
that hits the point, theta,

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:39.150
is the sum, the integral, of
all the different scatterers.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.159
So f is x represents
how much light gets

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.859
scattered as a function of x.

00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:46.900
x is the target.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.040
So this is integrating
over how much

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.850
light gets scattered at each
x, and at a particular x,

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.179
you get this phase delay.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.650
So there's a coherent sum then.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.030
So you add up all of
these complex numbers

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.870
by the integral.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:10.660
Now imagine that the sine
of theta is about theta.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.730
That was true all of the
examples I've done so far.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.780
So here I'm what, 15 feet
away, and it's a foot,

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.250
so that's small
angle approximation.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.800
So now let's replace
sine of theta with theta,

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.190
and let's think about this
number, 2 pi theta over lambda.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.730
That's just frequency omega.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.920
So I'm thinking about
now the far field,

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.560
which we had previously
called dependent on theta.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.890
Theta is just omega.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:45.520
So I've got a relationship now
between how much scattering

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:51.430
happens at each x in the target
and what does the picture

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:53.650
look like in the far field.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.970
And that's a Fourier transform.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.360
So there is an exact Fourier
transform relationship.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.080
Well, exact is a little
bit of an approximation

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.270
because I'm using a small
angle approximation.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:07.380
I'm ignoring a few things.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.250
Not only am I making a
small angle approximation,

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.380
but I'm assuming that if
the light goes straight

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.950
and if the light goes up, they
have the same intensity when

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.780
they hit the board.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.770
That's not quite true.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.950
That's with Fraunhofer
approximation blah, blah, blah.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:23.840
Fancy names for a bunch
of approximations.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.170
The point is that if you make
reasonable approximations,

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:29.150
you get a Fourier
transform relationship

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:33.320
between the scattering in the
target and far field image.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.600
So now we have a
very convenient way

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.380
of thinking about what
happened whenever I shot

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.050
my laser through this thing.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:54.390
I get a bunch of spots in
the far field because--

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.210
everybody shout.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.000
This is the aha.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:11.610
So we've got an impulse train
in the Fourier transform, which

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:17.670
means that the thing that was
down here was an impulse train.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.400
because we know that the Fourier
transform of an impulse train

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.010
is an impulse train.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.620
So this is an impulse
train in space.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.920
The scatterers represent
an impulse train.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.810
So whenever I illuminate
it, I getting impulse train

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.470
in the free transform
because the Fourier

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.519
transfer on an impulse
train is an impulse train.

00:37:37.519 --> 00:37:38.560
Well, that's pretty cool.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:47.620
So you all know why an impulse
train is an impulse train.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.940
So this two dimensional grating
then, the interesting thing

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.460
about that then
is that it must be

00:37:54.460 --> 00:38:02.470
the case that the Fourier
transform of a 2D impulse train

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.390
is a 2D impulse train.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:07.450
So I want to think just
a minute about that.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.900
What will we mean by a
two-dimensional Fourier

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.557
transform.

00:38:12.557 --> 00:38:14.140
So two-dimensional
Fourier transforms.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:20.440
I want x j omega 1, j omega 2.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:25.150
So it's a lot like
a 1D transform.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:29.410
I am going to think about having
x except now there's two time

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.046
variables, time 1 and time 2.

00:38:33.046 --> 00:38:34.420
And I'm going to
have to have two

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.730
of these funny
exponential things.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.500
So I'm going to have
e to the minus j

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:49.980
omega 1 t1 plus
omega 2 t2 d t1 d t2.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.040
It's almost like a 1D transform
except I have two d's now.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.400
And the way to think
about that, probably

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.780
shouldn't distract
you with this.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.696
That's the next slide.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:12.130
So the way to think about
this is this separates.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:16.750
e to the j sum is e to
the j1 plus e to the j2.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:24.550
So I can write this more simply
as x of t1, t2 e to the minus j

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:28.960
omega 1 t1 d t1.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:34.080
So then I can integrate that,
e to the minus j omega d t2.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.940
This is the integral
over the t1 variable.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.930
So if I think about doing
the transform in steps,

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:49.580
this is the integral
I might say--

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:57.250
so let's say that I had
my original 2D thing

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.090
was a square that I'd
like to characterize

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:04.470
as a t1 dependence
and a t2 dependence.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.590
The way I think about
the 2D transform,

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:14.170
this thing says, for each
t2, treat t2 as a constant,

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:16.870
for each t2, that's
for each row.

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:20.080
Treat t2 as a constant and
just take the Fourier transform

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.470
of the t1 direction.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:32.190
So what I do is I take the
Fourier transform of this,

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.460
and I put it here, but
when I've done that,

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:39.810
I've changed the t1 axis
into an omega 1 axis

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.210
because the result of
integrating over t1

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:44.640
throws away the t1, but
I'm left with an omega 1.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:52.980
If I repeat that for
all the different lines,

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.160
I didn't really change
this axis, which was t2,

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.310
so it's still t2.

00:40:59.914 --> 00:41:01.330
All I've done now
is taken a bunch

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:02.620
of integrals in the middle.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:06.670
Now, if I take the outer
integral, what I need to do

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.340
is integrate over t2.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:19.481
So if I integrate over t2, now
I want to integrate this way.

00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:20.980
Now, I want to
integrate out the t2.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.930
The t2 goes away.

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.290
So I take Fourier
transforms this way.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.530
For each column in
this space, I generate

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:33.520
a new Fourier transform
over here, and I repeat.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.780
That doesn't change this one.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.640
This one is still omega 1.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.460
But then when I take the
transform this way, I had a t2.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.820
That turns it into an omega 2.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:48.580
So I started with t1-t2 space,
take all the transforms row

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:53.440
wise, make a new array, take
all the transforms column wise,

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.840
make a new array, and I end
up with omega 1, omega 2.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:10.360
So if I do that, what's the
two-dimensional transform?

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.010
What if I started
with a vertical line?

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.380
What if my spatial dependence
had a vertical line in it?

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.960
What would be the
two-dimensional transform

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:20.770
of a vertical line?

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:31.730
Well, the rule says
transform all the rows.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.942
What's the transform?

00:42:33.942 --> 00:42:35.150
What do I call that function?

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.161
Shout.

00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:40.660
I'm deaf.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.308
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:42.308 --> 00:42:45.890
DENNIS FREEMAN: So let's say
the line has a height of 1,

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:49.610
and the background
has a height of 0.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:53.620
So as I read across here
it's, 0 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.021
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:57.823 --> 00:43:00.390
DENNIS FREEMAN: Exponential.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:01.260
Impulse.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.450
Impulse in left.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:06.660
So when I take the
transform, I get 1.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.860
I get constant.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:13.920
So I get a constant over here,
and then I take this one.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.240
Same thing.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.250
Same constant, same
constant, same constant.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.990
I end up with a
constant over here.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:24.790
So this started out
being delta of t1.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.070
This is a constant everywhere.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:34.550
So now if I take the
column-wise transforms,

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.474
what's the transform
of a constant?

00:43:40.694 --> 00:43:41.360
It's an impulse.

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.526
Where should the impulse be?

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.670
0.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:52.790
So I end up when I do the
omega 2, the t2 transforms.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.890
I get a delta in omega 2.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:59.270
So I have omega 1 here,
and I have omega 2 here.

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:04.320
So I end up with a delta
function like that.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.030
Then I do it again,
and I get one here.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.840
And then I do it again,
and I get one here.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.000
So I end up with a line.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.070
So vertical line in t1-t2 space
turns into a horizontal line

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.270
in omega 1-omega 2 space.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.470
Got it?

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:20.110
It's all very simple.

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:23.680
And if I do the same thing,
if I did a horizontal line,

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.060
it will come out vertical.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.530
And if I do a diagonal
line, it will rotate 90.

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:33.240
Very cute.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.710
Y'all got it?

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:39.660
So the idea then is that there's
a very natural generalization

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.390
from a 1D transform
to a 2D transform,

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:46.180
and that's kind of fun, but
it's also kind of important.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.820
So now for the important part.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:57.570
So this is a picture, a
diffraction photomicrograph

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:02.880
done by Rosalind Franklin
back about 50 years ago.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.192
She had taken DNA.

00:45:04.192 --> 00:45:04.900
I can't remember.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.410
I think it was from Drosophila,
but I don't really remember.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:09.660
She had purified DNA.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:14.700
And at that time, lasers
were not this size.

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:15.900
Actually, she used x-rays.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.170
She used a source of
coherent light from an x-ray,

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:22.140
so it's not even a
laser, it was x-rays.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:27.960
She fired coherent
x-rays at DNA--

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.990
so she had just a
big glob of DNA--

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:34.330
and took this picture.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:37.870
And it was pretty
and pretty confusing.

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:40.270
By the way, just so you
know, this is an artifact.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:45.100
This is a hole in the
photographic film.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:49.660
So the idea was coherent source
of x-rays, sample of DNA,

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.720
into a photographic emotion.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.334
Develop it, you get this.

00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:55.750
So it's very similar to the
diffraction grating experiment

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:59.050
that I did except that the
target was not a diffraction

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:04.030
grating, it was not a CD,
it was not a DVD, it was DNA

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:06.220
That cute thing
is that she showed

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:09.460
this to Watson and
Crick, who were

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.150
geniuses at so many
different levels it's absurd,

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:17.440
and especially Watson knew
all about Fourier transforms.

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.600
And so he saw that
and immediately

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.240
was able to interpret
it as telling him

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.950
something about the
three-dimensional structure

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.920
of DNA.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:32.200
In particular, if you think
about our modern view of DNA,

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.540
you can make an association
between the structure

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:39.150
of the DNA and this picture.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.950
So there's a
high-frequency band.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.710
So if you imagine that
what you're seeing

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:49.390
is three bright points
from a diffraction pattern

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.660
like I showed
previously, this and this

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.880
represents a high frequency.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.100
This represents DC.

00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:00.010
So the distance between
DC and the high frequency

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.970
is telling you something
about the inverse distance

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:06.710
between base pairs.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:16.530
The highest frequency
in the x-ray picture

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.740
is inversely related to the
distance between the base

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.960
pairs.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:26.675
The fact that there is these
closer-spaced frequencies,

00:47:26.675 --> 00:47:28.670
those are actually
lower frequencies

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:31.160
because they're closer to 0--

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.550
we're in the far field, so
we're in the frequency domain.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:37.550
Big frequency, small frequency.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:41.450
The fact that we're seeing these
smaller frequency things here

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:45.000
and there are periodic, that
means there some structure

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.610
at bigger spacing, which
Watson and Crick interpreted

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:55.450
as the pitch of
the double helix.

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.220
So the helix is twisting.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.230
This is the modern
picture, and it

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:03.770
fits very nicely
with the picture

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:09.140
that Rosalind Franklin made.

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:15.700
And the angles, the fact
that there is an axis here,

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.450
the reason for going
through all this junk

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.130
was to motivate the
idea that there's

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:22.870
an angle transformation in a
two-dimensional transform too.

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:28.040
In fact, angles in space
get rotated 90 degrees

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.780
when they're in frequency.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.740
So the angle between
these solid lines

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.630
tells you something
about the angle

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:39.750
that the helix makes as
it's wrapping around.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:44.150
So you can easily make 003
model of this experiment,

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:45.560
and that's what this is.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.400
Here all I've taken
is a trivial model.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:53.990
I just made a wire
frame that had

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:59.540
base pairs arranged as
a rotating spiral, just

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:02.130
like a spiral staircase.

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:04.380
Then that was a
three-dimensional picture.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:08.180
Then I just flattened
it, and then I

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.180
took the two-dimensional
Fourier transform and got that.

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:15.670
Got it?

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:20.010
So the idea was I made a trivial
model for what DNA should look

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:22.110
like according to a
modern conception,

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:23.910
took the two-dimensional
Fourier transform,

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.190
and what you can see there
is all of the features

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:30.750
that you see in Rosalind
Franklin's picture.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:35.250
You can see the big band that
corresponds to the base pairs,

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:38.100
you can see the smaller bands
that correspond to the twist,

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.990
and you can see the
angle that corresponds

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.780
to the angle of
the double helix.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.030
So the point then
is just that there's

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:47.040
a lot of physical phenomenon.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.690
Besides the signal
processing things

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:50.370
which we're very interested
in, there's actually

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:51.745
a lot of physical
phenomenon that

00:49:51.745 --> 00:49:55.082
also have intrinsic meaning
within a Fourier domain,

00:49:55.082 --> 00:49:57.040
and optics is a very
important example of that.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:00.840
See you later.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.720
Have a good day.
