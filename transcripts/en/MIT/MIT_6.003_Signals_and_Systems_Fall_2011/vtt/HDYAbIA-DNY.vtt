00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.505
DENNIS FREEMAN: Hello.

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:29.890
So there's almost certainly
no need to show this,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.160
but the good news is this
is the last time I'll ever

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.420
show a slide like this.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.626
It'll never happen again.

00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:37.750
At least not to this crowd.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.110
So you can all rest assured
this is the last time you'll

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.780
see something like this.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.675
Any questions on this,
everybody's happy?

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.210
Those are two separate
questions, I guess.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.590
Any questions on this?

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.940
OK, good.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.390
So today I want to
finish up talking

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.450
about Fourier transforms by
comparing a lot of stuff we've

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.129
already done.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.840
So there's nothing new today.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.370
This is intended,
if anything, to be

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.010
a bit of a review
in light of things

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.740
that might happen tomorrow.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.250
And also just to make
things look simpler.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.860
Now, the best way to
make things look simpler

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.220
is to start with something that
looks incredibly complicated.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.020
OK, so this is my thing
that looks very complicated.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.581
This is simply a summary
of the transforms

00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:32.830
that we've talked about today.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.420
We've talked about four of them.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.980
And the point of
the slide is first,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.020
it looks a little complicated.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.930
But much more importantly,
by the end of the hour,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.500
it's supposed to
look very simple.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.000
Yes?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.445
AUDIENCE: Could we
increase the volume?

00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:50.570
DENNIS FREEMAN: Could we
increase the volume a bit?

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.860
Well, I know that
I can shout more.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.580
And if they notice me, they'll
turn the volume up, too.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.870
So I will try to shout more.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.190
So if I don't, please
tell me to do so.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.639
So the idea, then, is to try
to look for some structure.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.530
Not only within one
of the transforms,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.660
but also across all
of the transforms.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.470
And to start this off,
let's just think about it

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.120
at the most basic level.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.480
What were the kinds of
signals that we thought about?

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.980
The kinds of signals
that we thought

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.850
about when we did DT
Fourier series, DT Fourier

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.940
transforms, CT Fourier series,
and CT Fourier transforms?

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.570
The kinds of signals
look different, right?

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.290
So in the top ones,
we had discrete time.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.470
In the bottom ones, we
have continuous time.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.070
In the left we have
things that are periodic.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.047
In the right we had things
that were not periodic.

00:02:54.047 --> 00:02:55.380
Four different kinds of signals.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.463
Not surprising there would
be four different kinds

00:02:57.463 --> 00:02:59.590
of transforms.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.210
An interesting thing happens if
you look at the Fourier domain.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.770
I haven't switched
around the order.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.720
It was DT Fourier, DT
Fourier transform, CT series,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.974
CT transform.

00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:11.640
It's still that.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.750
I've drawn a sort of
iconic view of how

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.510
we would draw a picture of the
Fourier transform of interest.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.150
Where is discrete?

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.760
So discrete in the
previous picture--

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.220
which was a picture of time--

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.762
NNTT.

00:03:33.762 --> 00:03:35.220
Where was discrete
in this picture?

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.300
Up.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.290
Where is discrete
in this picture?

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.910
Left, that's weird.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.695
Where is periodic
in this picture?

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.130
Left.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.800
Where is periodic
in this picture?

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.531
Is there a periodic
in this picture?

00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.030
Top.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.760
Why do you say top?

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.950
Ah, unit circle!

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.050
Unit circle is periodic.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.490
So there's discreteness and
periodicity in both pictures,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.890
but they're not
at the same place.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.050
Well, that's kind of
interesting, right?

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.049
Somehow, discrete
and periodic map

00:04:25.049 --> 00:04:26.590
to things like
discrete and periodic,

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.110
but they don't map directly.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.380
That's kind of interesting.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.960
So part of the goal
today is to try

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.168
to get to the bottom of that.

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:35.380
To understand why that's true.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.670
You already know a lot about how
different transformations are

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.210
related.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.000
So let's think of
a simple example

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.690
of the relation between Fourier
series and Fourier transforms.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.148
Imagine that we have one of
those signals that was periodic

00:04:48.148 --> 00:04:51.400
in time, continuous in time.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.870
Then there'd be a
Fourier series--

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.360
represented this way.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.220
So I'd end up with a
Fourier series that has

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.620
a bunch of coefficients, a, k.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.870
Can somebody tell me, what
would the Fourier transform

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.370
look like?

00:05:05.322 --> 00:05:06.780
Fourier transform--
are you allowed

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.863
to take the Fourier transform
of a periodic thing?

00:05:14.054 --> 00:05:14.554
Yeah?

00:05:14.554 --> 00:05:17.637
AUDIENCE: Could we take the
same thing with impulses?

00:05:17.637 --> 00:05:19.720
DENNIS FREEMAN: Take the
same thing with impulses.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.650
OK, I like lots of those words.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.182
Could you put them together
in slightly a different order?

00:05:25.182 --> 00:05:26.515
Where should I put the impulses?

00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:30.758
Yeah?

00:05:30.758 --> 00:05:33.166
AUDIENCE: At the k omega not.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.247
DENNIS FREEMAN: At
the k omega not.

00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:36.080
How do you get that?

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.800
That's exactly right.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.591
How'd you get that?

00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:41.324
AUDIENCE: Because
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.170
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
there's some kind

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.999
of a relationship between the
k's, in the ak's, and frequency

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:02.790
that ought to be
represented as an impulse,

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.250
is what you're saying?

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.410
One way you can see that
is to take the Fourier

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.710
transform of this expression.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.876
What would you get if you
took the Fourier transform

00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:12.420
of x of t, x of j omega?

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.500
That's pretty easy.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.083
What would you get if you took
the Fourier transform of a sum?

00:06:18.675 --> 00:06:20.175
What do you always
get when you take

00:06:20.175 --> 00:06:22.387
the Fourier transfer of a sum?

00:06:22.387 --> 00:06:24.095
The sum of the Fourier
transforms, right?

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:25.850
It's within your operator.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.880
That's one of the most
powerful reasons we like it.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.780
So sum of the functions, take
the transform of each one.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.160
Add them back up.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.980
How do you take the Fourier
transform of e to the j omega

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.510
not t?

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.170
What's the Fourier
transform? e to the j omega

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.570
not t transforms to what?

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.840
Fourier transform-- impulse.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.000
So how do I know that?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.700
So impulse-- what
else, anything?

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.230
Am I done?

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:01.880
Where should I put the impulse?

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.260
What should I put--

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.800
how should I indicate
where I put it?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.640
So I need to say omega minus
omega not, or something

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.510
like that, right?

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.940
So how do I know that?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.970
And am I done?

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:24.606
Yeah?

00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:25.500
AUDIENCE: Multiply by 2 pi.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.910
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Multiply by 2 pi.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.285
And a good way to
do that is just

00:07:28.285 --> 00:07:31.684
to memorize an absurd
number of equations, right?

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.600
Let's think about how
you would remember that.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.700
So if you wanted to take the
Fourier transform of anything,

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.200
right?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.111
You would say, h of j omega
is some integral of anything e

00:07:43.111 --> 00:07:47.550
to the minus j
omega t dt, right?

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.620
What happens if I plug x of
t equals e to the j omega

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.433
not t into this expression?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.554
Can you close the integral?

00:07:58.554 --> 00:08:00.470
I mean, that's the way
you would do it, right?

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.803
I want to take the Fourier
transform of e to the j omega

00:08:02.803 --> 00:08:04.340
not t.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.800
You stick it in the formula,
and it should come out, right?

00:08:10.862 --> 00:08:12.820
So how many of you can
integrate this function?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.080
No one, good.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.137
That's good, because
I can't either.

00:08:22.137 --> 00:08:23.970
What's hard about
integrating that function?

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.300
That was a much easier
question, right?

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.880
Can you integrate
was a hard question.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.870
Well, maybe not.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.760
It's binary.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.409
What's difficult
about integrating

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.330
that function of time?

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.169
What if I try to integrate
e to the j omega not

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:47.339
t e to the minus j omega t dt?

00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:49.380
What's difficult about
integrating that function?

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.460
What do we do when we see
these sorts of things--

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.870
e to the j omega not t?

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.050
How do you think
about e to the--

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.680
complex exponential.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.696
You can name out things like
Euler's equation, right?

00:09:08.696 --> 00:09:09.820
So e to the j omega not t--

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.903
you might want to say,
well, that's the same thing

00:09:11.903 --> 00:09:15.190
as cosine omega not t
plus j sine omega not t.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.550
If I took just the first
term-- cosine omega not t,

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.081
does it have a
Laplace transform?

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.790
Doesn't have a Laplace
transform, hmm.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.770
How about a Fourier transform?

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.020
Why does it have a Fourier
transform and not a Laplace

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.856
transform?

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.600
So Laplace transforms-- there's
only a Laplace transform

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.600
if there's some kind of
a multiplicative kernel--

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.760
e to the minus st--

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.920
that has some values that
make the integral converge.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.960
There's no value of s for
which e to the j omega

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.380
not t will converge.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.417
The amplitude of e to
the j omega not t--

00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:05.750
the real part has an amplitude
that fluctuates like this

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.700
and never decays.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.980
Goes on forever and
ever in both directions.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.230
There's no exponential
function that you

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:17.510
can multiply times that
function to make it converge.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.635
There is no Laplace transform.

00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:22.120
Is there a Fourier transform?

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.882
Yeah.

00:10:23.882 --> 00:10:24.590
What's different?

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.780
What makes us be able to
do a Fourier transform

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.700
and not a Laplace transform?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.660
Delta functions.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.675
We never write a
Laplace transform

00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:37.830
with a delta function, ever.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:47.450
If you write on your exam h of s
is some function of delta of s,

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.390
that's definitely wrong, right?

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.490
We just never do that.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.800
We're much more liberal
about using delta functions

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.320
in Fourier transforms.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.130
That's one of the
reasons they're powerful.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.280
And one of the ways you
can think about that

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.930
is that delta functions
are easy to integrate.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.129
That's not quite enough.

00:11:09.129 --> 00:11:10.920
The other thing that's
important to realize

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.580
is that we've got
this integral here--

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.150
it's either going to
be zero or infinity.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.230
There's going to be
certain values of omega

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.730
that when we multiply
this together,

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.063
we're going to get something
that goes on and on forever

00:11:26.063 --> 00:11:28.156
and ever and never decays.

00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:29.530
That's going to
give us infinity.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.260
And there's going
to be other values

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.970
that the long-term integral's
going to go to zero.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:40.540
And that information is
summarized by the impulses,

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.340
right?

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.310
So if we choose omega not--

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:48.220
if we choose omega
to be omega not--

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.470
then when we do the
integral, which comes out

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.645
a function of omega, we're
going to get something

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:54.074
that goes to infinity.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.129
OK?

00:11:58.129 --> 00:12:00.670
The easy way to think about that
is to do the inverse Fourier

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.950
transform, right?

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:08.660
The inverse Fourier
transform is x of t

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:14.440
is 1 over 2 pi in the integral
x of j omega e to the j omega t

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.500
d omega.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.470
Now, if we put the delta
function in this, it's easy.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.900
Because the delta
function over here--

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.222
if we say that--

00:12:27.222 --> 00:12:28.997
it's x over here and
it's h over there.

00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:29.580
But who cares?

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.580
That should have been x.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.160
If we put over there
that the x of j

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.700
omega is 2 pi delta
omega minus omega not,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.980
then we can see that the
function of the delta

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.095
is just to sift out a
particular value of e

00:12:49.095 --> 00:12:53.490
to the j omega t,
the one at omega not.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.860
And the 2 pi's obvious, too.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.039
The 2 pi came from the
1 over 2 pi, right?

00:12:58.039 --> 00:13:00.330
We had to have a 2 pi out
front so that the 1 over 2 pi

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.620
killed it.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.630
OK, anyway-- so
the idea, then, is

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.390
that simply by taking the
Fourier transform of this,

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.300
we can get an expression
for the Fourier transform.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.270
And that tells us something
about the great utility

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.730
of using impulses, right?

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.980
Because we use impulses
in the Fourier transform,

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.080
we can represent
a lot more signals

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.810
than we could have represented
in the Laplace transform.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.535
That's one of the
utilities of a Fourier.

00:13:24.535 --> 00:13:26.910
And there's a big relationship
between the Fourier series

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.980
and the Fourier transform.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.040
So in particular, if we have a
signal that's periodic in time,

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.084
it'll have both a
series and a transform.

00:13:36.084 --> 00:13:38.250
The transform is a bunch
of delta functions weighted

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:43.110
by the Fourier series
coefficients and 2 pi.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.600
And what that says
is, had we been

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.600
willing to put in
impulses to begin with,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.030
we would never have had
to define the series.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.940
We did the series just
because it was easy.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.500
Convergence issues
were more clear.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.690
But if we had been willing to
think about delta functions

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.060
in the transforms-- which
would have been an extremely

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.780
foreign concept coming
straight from Laplace, where

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.090
you would never see that.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.190
Had we been willing to
accept delta functions

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.780
in the transforms
from the outset,

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.969
we never would
have needed series.

00:14:14.969 --> 00:14:17.010
So the relationship between
series and transforms

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.510
has to do with the fact
that the series represents

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.440
periodic signals.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.500
Periodic signals go on forever.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.160
There's never a
Laplace transform,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.210
and that means that--

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.830
there's never a
Laplace transform.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.455
That means the Fourier transform
has a bunch of delta functions

00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:38.600
in it, OK?

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.340
OK, so what I want
to do, then, is

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.840
think through
other relationships

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.145
that are on this table.

00:14:43.145 --> 00:14:45.020
And in particular, I
want to think about them

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.780
by thinking about the underlying
structure of the signals.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:15:05.890
So think about having
DTFS, DTFT, CTFS, and CTFT.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.470
So what I want to do is
think about the relationships

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.640
among those four transforms
by thinking about how

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.300
they differ in time, right?

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.790
So the top guys are
discrete in time.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.590
The bottom guys are
continuous in time.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.670
The left guys are
periodic in time.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.830
The right ones are
aperiodic in time.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.480
So what I want to do
to think about how

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.650
they relate to each other,
is think about a base case.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.927
Think about a signal that's
down here-- aperiodic CT.

00:15:36.927 --> 00:15:39.260
And think about what you would
have to do to the signal,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.540
and therefore what would you
have to do to the transform.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.370
If you wanted to move this way--

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.470
I'll do that one first.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.090
If you move up--

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.430
I'll do that one second.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.810
Or if you move that way--

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.070
I'll do that one third.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.150
So really, the rest of the hour
is just doing three examples.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.320
Well, four examples.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.290
What's the transform
of a base case?

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.730
Then what would happen as
I move through this table?

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.530
OK, everybody's
with the game plan?

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:10.917
So here's my base case.

00:16:10.917 --> 00:16:13.250
I want to think about the
Fourier transform of a signal,

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.760
x of t, that's a triangle.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.657
We could calculate the
Fourier transform just

00:16:18.657 --> 00:16:19.490
from the definition.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.730
That's trivial, right?

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.360
Good way, bad way.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.135
Good way.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.780
Smile.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.320
Better.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.140
OK, bad way--

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.352
I can think of a
better way to do it.

00:16:35.352 --> 00:16:36.560
What's a better way to do it?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.060
Yeah?

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:59.837 --> 00:17:01.420
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
one way is to think

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:06.614
about turning straight lines
into constants via derivatives

00:17:06.614 --> 00:17:08.030
and integrals and
stuff like that.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.988
That's a very good way.

00:17:08.988 --> 00:17:10.994
Can somebody think
of a different way?

00:17:10.994 --> 00:17:12.160
That'll work, it'll be fine.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.400
Yes?

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.585
AUDIENCE: Is that the
convolution of two square

00:17:14.585 --> 00:17:15.460
pulses?

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.501
DENNIS FREEMAN: Convolution
of two square pulses,

00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:18.880
that's wonderful.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.530
So a different way we can do it
is to convolve a square pulse

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.510
with a square pulse.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.560
That's particularly
good for this example,

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.886
because a square pulse is
one of our canonical forms.

00:17:30.886 --> 00:17:32.510
So if we think about
what's the Fourier

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.676
transform of a square pulse?

00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:36.200
We all know that it's something
that has the form sine

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.030
omega over omega.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.660
So all we really need to do
is fill in the constants.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.040
Filling in the
constants is easy,

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.410
because we know the
moment theorems.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.060
The moment theorem
says that whatever

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.670
the area is under
this curve, it has

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:54.810
to be the height
of that curve at 0.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.400
Whatever is the area
under this curve,

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.900
it has to be the
height of that one.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.524
Except that you have
to divide by 2 pi,

00:17:59.524 --> 00:18:02.260
because the annoying
2 pi factor.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.950
The annoying 2 pi
factor is something

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.690
that's in the inverse
transform and not

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.800
in the Fourier transform.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.830
That makes it asymmetric.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.910
So in order to choose the
constants-- the area under this

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.610
is 1, so that height must be 1.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.740
The area under this,
by magic, turns

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.980
into the area of that
triangle, which is 2 pi.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.750
Divide by 2 pi is 1.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.480
So that means that this
frequency must be 2 pi

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.900
in order to make
that constant be 1.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.160
So we're done.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.250
So we know, then, that the
transform of this signal,

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.400
which is the convolution
of this signal with itself,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.570
is just the product of
this function with itself.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.830
Convolution in time maps to
multiplication in frequency.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.550
OK?

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.550
So that's the base case.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.260
Now what I want
to think about is

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.000
how I would march
through the table.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.580
That's my case down here.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.330
So what I want to do
first is think about,

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.180
how would I convert
that this way?

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.430
And what's the implication
for that conversion

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:11.260
in terms of time, and
in terms of frequency?

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.520
So one way to think about the
transformation from a transform

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.690
to a series--

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.891
you can only series with
things that are periodic.

00:19:17.891 --> 00:19:19.890
The transformation that
we talked about in class

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.170
was periodic extension.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.300
So you think about taking
the base case, which

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.250
was a single triangle
wave, and turning it

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.670
into a sequence
of triangle waves.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.800
There's lots of ways
to think about that.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.870
But the way I want to motivate
is to think about it--

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.260
well, no, backing up.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.480
So if we think
about the triangle

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.000
wave and transformation and
make it into a periodic triangle

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.770
wave, we could just
substitute this

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.660
into the definition
of transform.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.760
That's ugly, why?

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.270
For the same reason
that one was ugly.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.310
What's ugly about this?

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.916
The signal goes on and
on and on and on and on.

00:20:02.916 --> 00:20:04.290
There will be
certain frequencies

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.330
where it'll blow up.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.160
Those will be infinity.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.190
There will be other
frequencies where it is 0.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.470
There could be frequencies
where it's minus infinity,

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.047
and those are the
only three options.

00:20:17.047 --> 00:20:18.630
Since it goes on and
on and on and on,

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.046
if it's anything
different from 0,

00:20:20.046 --> 00:20:24.057
it has to be either
infinity or minus infinity.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.390
It's going to be a train of
impulses for the same reason

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.670
that thing was some kind
of a train of impulses.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.795
So we want to have a good
way of thinking about it.

00:20:30.795 --> 00:20:32.900
I told you one way
to think about this--

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.650
by taking the inverse transform.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:40.440
This is a little harder
to guess the transforms,

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.040
so you can verify
it with the inverse.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.950
But you can form
this by thinking

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:55.350
about convolving the base
waveform with an impulse train.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.225
So what if I had
an impulse train?

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.130
So I'm-- oh, it's
on the next slide.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.910
What if I had an
impulse train like so?

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.860
If I think about having
an impulse train,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:14.400
if I had the base waveform and
an appropriate impulse train,

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.550
how could I manufacture the
signal of interest, which

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.440
is this periodic extension?

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.940
So if I have these
two signals, what

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.520
would I do to get that signal?

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.270
Convolve.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.000
So if I knew the
transform of this,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.902
which I do because this is the
base case which we just did.

00:21:36.902 --> 00:21:38.610
If I knew the transform
of the base case,

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.550
and if I knew the transform
of the impulse train--

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.360
impulse train is something
that goes to function of time.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.390
0-- let's say that
they're separated by t.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.450
Let's say each one
has a height of 1.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.620
What's the Fourier transform
of an impulse train?

00:22:00.232 --> 00:22:02.190
I can see you're all on
the edge of your seats.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.640
How do you find the Fourier
transform of an impulse train?

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:13.330
OK, ask your neighbor.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.310
So how do you find the Fourier
transform of an impulse train?

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.430
Look it up in the tables!

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.045
Boo, hiss.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.420
How do you find the Fourier
transform of an impulse train?

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.970
Is there anything easy
about an impulse train?

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.700
What a horrendous thing, right?

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.010
It has an infinite
number of impulses, yuck.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:41.790
Each impulse is
horribly misbehaved.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.652
How would I find the
Fourier transform

00:24:43.652 --> 00:24:44.610
of a train of impulses?

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:44.950
Yes?

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.200
AUDIENCE: So if you
actually just plug

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.950
that in to the
formula, then you get

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.100
different exponents
and like, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.780
and then, since there's
negative infinity to infinity,

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.750
they add up to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.980
DENNIS FREEMAN: So you're
saying that somehow I

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.510
should stick it into--

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:05.520
so I'm thinking about finding
the Fourier transform by going

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.860
back to the direct formula.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.910
So if I put an infinite train of
impulses here, what would I do?

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:19.740
So I'd have a sum
of delta of t minus,

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:27.020
say, n times t sum over n e
to the minus j omega t dt.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.590
That's a good step.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.850
So now, what I might
do is interchange

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.780
the order, because that's
what everybody does, right?

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.990
And it's a little dicey
doing that, right?

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.680
You're always safe to do that
if the integrand is absolutely

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.400
summable.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.430
That's not precisely
absolutely summable.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.310
Everybody knows what
absolutely summable means?

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.200
So it means if you
took the absolute value

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.730
and you summed it
over all of time,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.521
you would get something
less than infinity.

00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:06.720
That's not quite the
truth here, right?

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.810
So some of the sums in Fourier
series and Fourier transforms

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.210
can be hard, OK?

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.830
But throwing
caution to the wind,

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.390
we would probably get
something like that.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.270
And then we could say,
well, that just samples it.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.815
We could sample this
thing at t equals nt.

00:26:27.815 --> 00:26:33.210
So that would be e to
the minus j omega nt.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.650
Then I end up summing
a large number

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.320
of complex exponentials--

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.948
large being infinite.

00:26:43.948 --> 00:26:46.235
It's kind of ugly.

00:26:46.235 --> 00:26:46.735
Yes?

00:26:46.735 --> 00:26:49.705
AUDIENCE: Could you
now [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.310
So I could split
this into two sums--

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.170
n less than 0, and a similar
sum-- n bigger than 0.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:06.414
And then throw in the 0
term, just for good measure.

00:27:06.414 --> 00:27:09.495
AUDIENCE: And then we can see
you have a bunch of sines--

00:27:09.495 --> 00:27:11.870
actually, in this case, you
have a bunch of cosine terms.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.838
So you know that-- by having
the cosine terms, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.600
DENNIS FREEMAN: So you just
said something that seemed

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.725
to take a left turn, there.

00:27:21.725 --> 00:27:23.990
What was the thing about series?

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.752
AUDIENCE: So if you
take your Fourier

00:27:25.752 --> 00:27:30.570
series of a sum of cosines,
it's just the coefficient

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.030
of the same sign?

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.300
DENNIS FREEMAN: So,
that sounds good.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.610
Could we use that idea of
taking a Fourier series

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:38.990
a little earlier in the proof?

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.810
How would I take the
Fourier transform of that?

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.900
How would I take the
Fourier series of that?

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.358
Yeah?

00:27:51.358 --> 00:27:54.760
AUDIENCE: All 1's.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.260
All 1's.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.020
DENNIS FREEMAN: All
the 1's, yes, yes.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.010
This is periodic.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.170
It has a series.

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.840
Trick?

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.590
No, no, no-- clever
observation, not a trick.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.450
So it's a periodic waveform.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.730
It has a series.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.470
OK, why is that good?

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.680
Periodic waveform series, I
only need to look at one period.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.850
I reduce an infinite
number of impulses to one.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.890
That's a good move.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.880
So all I need to do is--

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.430
to find the series,
all I need to do

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:32.600
is think about the
Fourier series sum.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.420
Which is almost the same
thing, except that now I've

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.450
got something that
has k's in it, right?

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:43.024
Because a series only
has harmonic frequencies.

00:28:43.024 --> 00:28:44.690
So what I can do is,
instead of thinking

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.630
about a Fourier series--

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.620
so now I can say, instead of
finding the Fourier transform,

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.610
let's find the Fourier series.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.050
That's find a sub k,
which would be 1 over t

00:28:56.050 --> 00:29:01.630
to the integral on t of x
of t e to the minus j 2 pi

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.210
kt by t on t, OK?

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.990
So now I only need
to find the series.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.850
And by integrating over t--

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:12.469
OK, well I'll do
the easy one, right?

00:29:12.469 --> 00:29:13.760
Never do something that's hard.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.380
I can choose any interval of t.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.140
Let me take that one.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.240
So the only thing
that persists, then--

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.770
so if I do minus--

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:27.190
whatever, t by 2 to t by 2,
then this becomes delta of t.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:35.815
And delta of t sifts out
the 0 value of this guy.

00:29:35.815 --> 00:29:38.760
But e to 0 is 1.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:43.800
So this is 1 over t for all k.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.090
We knew that, right?

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:49.950
The Fourier series for a
unit impulse is 1 everywhere.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.320
All the harmonics
have the same size--

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.580
same size, same magnitude,
same phase everywhere.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.010
Then, since we
know the series, we

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:02.490
can trivially convert it into
a Fourier transform, right?

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.540
Using the deep insight from
a few slides ago, right?

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.680
So how do you take a series
and turn it into a transform?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.090
Substitute for every k.

00:30:14.725 --> 00:30:18.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.970
DENNIS FREEMAN: Put an
impulse in place of every k

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.070
at the frequency-- omega--

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:26.560
that corresponds to that k, OK?

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.242
The k's-- 0, 1, 2, 3, are
the 0, 1, 2, 3 harmonics.

00:30:30.242 --> 00:30:32.200
The harmonics are harmonics
of the fundamental.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.460
The fundamental is 2 pi over t.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.890
So you put one impulse
at every multiple of 2 pi

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:45.730
over capital T. And you
multiply them all by 2 pi.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.226
So here's your answer.

00:30:47.226 --> 00:30:48.850
You start with this
thing you recognize

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.500
as a periodic waveform.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.400
You turn it into a series.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.310
Then you convert every
one of the harmonics

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.340
into a continuous
frequency representation

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:05.250
so that the spacing is the
base period 2 pi over cap T.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.020
The height of these
guys was 1 over T,

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.030
because of the annoying
1 over T factor in front

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.590
of the Fourier series formula.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.380
And you get an extra 2 pi,
because the annoying 1 over 2

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:21.390
pi in the inverse
Fourier formula, OK?

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.625
So what we see, then, is
that the Fourier transform

00:31:23.625 --> 00:31:27.190
of an impulse train
is an impulse train.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.820
And so we can use that, then,
to find the Fourier transform

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.260
of this mass, remember?

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.760
Oh, I've got-- oh, here it is.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.320
I was taking my
base waveform, which

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.290
was a triangle,
trying to figure out

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.780
what would happen if I did an
infinite extension of that--

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.970
an infinite periodic extension.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:45.390
I think about the extension
as being convolving the base

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.520
waveform.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.460
Cover that up.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.684
If I think about convolving
the base wave, form--

00:31:52.684 --> 00:31:54.450
oh, no, it's gone.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.700
If I think about convolving
the base waveform

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.750
with periodic train
of impulses, that

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.700
means that-- so the
time waveform is

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.390
the convolution of two things.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.900
That means that the
Fourier transform is

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.420
the multiplying of two things.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.620
So I write down the transform
of the base waveform--

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.690
thing that we did
a long time ago.

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.170
I write down the Fourier
transform of the impulse train.

00:32:25.804 --> 00:32:27.220
The period of the
impulse train is

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.511
the same as the period of
the periodic extension, which

00:32:29.511 --> 00:32:30.560
is capital T.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.350
It was 4.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.050
So that means the
impulses are separated

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:39.330
by 2 pi over 4 pi over 2.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.480
And the height of
the impulse is always

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.600
equal to their separation.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.200
So they're also pi over 2.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.600
So then all I do is
multiply this times this,

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.400
and that gives me the transform.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.700
Convolving time,
multiplying frequency.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.980
The important thing that
I found is that the effect

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.540
of periodic extension--

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.230
I took a base
waveform and turned it

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.820
into a string of
waveforms, right?

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.930
So over here, I
took a base waveform

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:16.940
and turned it into a repeated
thing, like so, in time.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.610
The effect of the
periodic extension,

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:25.720
which we understand trivially
in time, is to sample frequency.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:30.640
What I get in the frequency
representation is samples.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.720
The samples being
controlled by how long

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.160
is the periodic extension.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.050
So what I get is samples.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.270
Instead of getting all of
these, I just get part.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.340
I just get a uniformly-spaced
sample set separated by pi

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.320
over 2.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.260
So then the effect of
the periodic extension

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:58.940
was to sample the Fourier
transform of the base waveform.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.380
And that's the reason we can
think about the Fourier series

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.070
as being just a
sequence of numbers.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.930
In fact, those
numbers are the same.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.310
Or, they differ by 2 pi, right?

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.370
So I have to multiply
these guys by 2 pi

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.150
to get the Fourier
transform coefficients,

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.310
because the Fourier transform
of cosine of e to the j omega

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:25.290
not t, I should say,
is 2 pi delta, OK?

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.989
So the reason the Fourier
series coefficients

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:33.270
are related the way they
are, the reason they sample

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:35.280
the Fourier transform,
is because we

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.940
can regard the periodic
extension, which

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.420
was convolved by
an impulse train

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.840
as being equivalently
multiplying by an impulse

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.433
train and frequency.

00:34:44.433 --> 00:34:45.906
OK?

00:34:45.906 --> 00:34:47.239
That's what I wanted you to see.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:50.020
I wanted you to see
that if you think

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:54.639
about periodic extension--

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.437
which is moving left
in this diagram.

00:34:56.437 --> 00:34:58.770
If you think about moving
left, what you're really doing

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.750
is sampling in frequency.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.490
So that's the reason it came out
having a sampled representation

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.030
on the left.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.610
The periodic extension
convolving with an impulse

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.610
train was the same as
multiplying by the impulse

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:17.690
train and frequency, which
has the effect of sampling

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.990
the frequency response.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:24.440
OK, so now the effect
of moving this way

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.090
was the same sampling
in frequency.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.506
Well, what happens
if you actually

00:35:27.506 --> 00:35:30.211
sample in time, which is
what you do when you go up?

00:35:33.182 --> 00:35:35.140
It's got to be an
[INAUDIBLE] like this, right?

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.885
So, the most useful thing
about the Fourier transform

00:35:40.885 --> 00:35:42.760
is that the Fourier
transform and the inverse

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.490
transform look almost the same.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.230
That's the most useful
property of the transform.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:51.610
Now, the Fourier transform has
a simple inverse relationship,

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:56.520
and is almost precisely the same
except for the annoying 2 pi

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.470
and except for a
change of sign--

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:03.790
e to the j omega t, compared
to e to the minus j omega t.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:05.420
Except for those
trivial differences,

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.760
they're the same thing.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:10.270
So we might expect that if we
understood the effect of moving

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:16.210
that way, which is convolve in
time, multiply in frequency,

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.330
you might expect an analogous
thing to happen this way.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:21.730
And of course, it does.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.760
So here, let's think
about the base waveform--

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.575
same base waveform.

00:36:26.575 --> 00:36:28.450
But now what we're doing
is sampling in time.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.100
And I'll just
arbitrarily, for the sake

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:34.480
of illustration, sample it
with capital T equals a half.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:38.380
Question is-- what would
that sampling in time

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.180
do to the Fourier transform?

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.200
OK, sampling is time.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.480
That's something we understand
completely in the time domain.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.146
What would happen in
the Fourier domain?

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:49.730
OK, well that's a
little hard to compare,

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:52.810
because the domain of
these two signals--

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:56.920
this is continuous domain,
T. This is discrete domain.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.917
And that's kind of annoying.

00:36:58.917 --> 00:37:01.000
So it's kind of hard,
because they're not on equal

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.890
footing to compare them.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:05.170
So what I can do is map
the same information

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:09.670
that was here into a
representation over here that

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.630
is continuous in time.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.970
The information over
here was 0 everywhere,

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:18.790
except one half-and-half.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:22.240
Here it's 0 everywhere
except one half-and-half.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.810
Anyone know why I used
impulses instead of just

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.150
making the function different?

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.850
Why didn't I, instead of using
the complicated-- wouldn't it

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:34.760
be much easier if I
didn't use the impulses?

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:42.490
And if instead, I just
said, OK, my xp of t--

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:46.300
why didn't I say xp of
t is almost everywhere

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:53.565
0, except at that point, at
that point, and at that point?

00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:54.440
Why didn't I do that?

00:38:03.136 --> 00:38:03.636
Yes?

00:38:03.636 --> 00:38:05.088
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.480
DENNIS FREEMAN: Right, let's
assume that it is continuous.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:19.240
And that there's exactly
three points that differ

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.690
from the straight line at 0.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:23.150
Yes?

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:25.320
The integral's 0.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.610
That never works.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.590
In fact, the most
trivial representation

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:35.830
that only has energy at three
places is three impulses.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:39.390
That's the only way to
get non-trivial energy.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:41.230
OK, so I can't do that.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.190
I'm forced to do
something like this.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:44.312
So now the idea is--

00:38:44.312 --> 00:38:46.020
I switched to this
kind of representation

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:50.260
that has the same information,
but has the same domain--

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.887
CT, continuous time.

00:38:52.887 --> 00:38:54.970
So that now I can think
about-- what's the Fourier

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.140
transform of this guy?

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.350
Well, it's the same idea.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:05.620
The way I can think
about computing

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.147
this thing from that thing is to
multiply in time by an impulse

00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:10.794
train.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.300
What's the effect of multiplying
time by an impulse train?

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.570
What's the effect in frequency?

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:21.670
Multiply in time by
an impulse train,

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.600
what are you doing to frequency?

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.130
Convolving frequency.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.320
So we take the
original base waveform,

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.380
but now we convolve it.

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:34.970
And lo and behold, we
convolve this signal--

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.470
which could be anything-- with
this signal-- which is always

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:38.310
periodic.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:42.630
If you convolve in anything with
a periodic, what do you get?

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:46.240
Periodic, inevitable.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.380
So the fact that
I sampled in time

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.630
leads to periodic in frequency.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.980
That's the point.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.460
Sampling in time leads
to periodic in frequency.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.750
That's always going to be true.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.870
So we end up with a
relationship here.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.600
The sampled waveform is
going to be periodic.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.300
In here it's periodic, and 4 pi.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.670
That's a little different
from what we've seen before.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.130
If we had looked
at the x of n, we

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:14.830
would have seen something
that was periodic in 2 pi,

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:19.250
but that's because the
frequencies are different.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.320
One

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.580
The first one I
showed is a function

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:27.420
of little omega, which has
the units radians per second.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.130
This one is a function of cap
Omega, which has the units

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.750
radians, they're different.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.610
One's frequency
in discrete time.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:39.350
One's frequency in
continuous time.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.660
And there's a relationship,
and that relationship

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.510
is always this.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:48.420
That's the reason I write the
two frequencies differently.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:52.100
One way to relate the two
frequencies is via sampling.

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.470
That's a way of taking
a continuous time signal

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:56.300
and turning it into a
discrete time signal.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.480
When you do that, if you
sample by the sampling

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.120
interval capital
T, that dictates

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.350
that this relationship's
going to be like that.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.400
And it's very general.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.350
All you need to do is
look at the definitions.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:16.220
If you look at the definition
of the DT Fourier transform--

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:22.465
that's this-- the CT Fourier
transform-- that's this--

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:28.370
and just remember that
we form this thing

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:30.710
by samples of that thing.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.750
So now, if you think
about flipping the order--

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:40.272
and again, not worrying
about whether or not

00:41:40.272 --> 00:41:40.980
it will converge.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.380
You just assume it will
for the time being.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:47.340
Just flip the order of the
summation and the integration.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:55.340
This then sifts out the value
of little t equals n cap T,

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.550
and we get a formula for
the continuous time Fourier

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.000
transform that looks
just like the formula

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.100
for the discrete time
Fourier transform.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.120
The only difference
in the two is that one

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.800
has discrete domain, n.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.200
The other has
continuous domain, time.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.020
And by sampling, we convert
continuous domain, time,

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.840
into discrete domain, n.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.930
So we're always going to end
up with this relationship that

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:26.770
the discrete frequency--
that's generated by sampling--

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.180
the discrete
frequency is related

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:31.110
to the continuous frequency
multiplied by capital

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:33.970
T. Capital T has the
units of seconds.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:39.080
So that takes radians per second
and turns it into radians.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.840
OK, almost done, one more.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.860
So I've gone from here to here.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.960
What happens if I do
a periodic extension?

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.740
The answer was that
you convolve in time,

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.380
which is the same as
multiply in frequency

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.230
by an impulse train, which
is the same as sampling

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:01.740
in frequency.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.200
Convolving time,
sampling frequency.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.450
That's what happened
when I did this one.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:09.270
I just now did this one.

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:12.910
What happens if
you sample in time?

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:16.976
Sample in time is multiplied
by an impulse train.

00:43:16.976 --> 00:43:19.225
Multiplied by an impulse
train is the same as convolve

00:43:19.225 --> 00:43:21.880
in frequency.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.640
Convolve in frequency
makes it periodic.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.290
Sample in time,
periodic in frequency.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:32.620
The last example is just
to do this direction.

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:36.210
What happens if I
take the DTFT and try

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.252
to turn that into a DTFS?

00:43:39.252 --> 00:43:40.710
Not surprisingly,
what I have to do

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.110
is the same thing I
did in continuous time.

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.270
If I want to change
this DT signal-- which

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:48.210
is aperiodic-- into
a periodic DT signal,

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:51.360
I do periodic extension.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.090
I can think about the
periodically-extended waveform,

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:58.850
here extended by
multiples of 8, as being

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:03.180
the original waveform convolved
with that unit sample train.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:10.420
And so if I convolve by
the unit sample train, what

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.410
do I do in frequency?

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.520
Convolve by unit
sample train in time,

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.590
gives [INAUDIBLE] and frequency.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:26.220
Multiply-- so I'm expecting
that the answer will be sampled,

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.290
and that's what happens.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:34.880
So I take the Fourier
transform of this case.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.800
Which, like all
Fourier transforms,

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:41.860
is periodic in 2 pi.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.800
And now I think
about convolving it

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:49.850
with this unit
sample train, which

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:52.300
has the same relationship
as the impulse train.

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.950
And the impulse
train-- the train

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.710
of impulses separated
by capital T, turned

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:01.040
into a train of impulses
separated by 2 pi over t.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:06.080
Here separated by capital
N, turns into impulse trains

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.090
separated by 2 pi over n--

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:10.230
same thing.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.820
So if this is 8
over here, I do 2 pi

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.850
over 8, which is pi over 4.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:20.780
So convolving in
discrete time is the same

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.335
as multiplying by this
impulse train, which gives me,

00:45:24.335 --> 00:45:29.410
then, a string of samples
from that waveform.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.410
So the effect of
going this way, which

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:34.860
is periodic extension, which is
the same as convolving in time,

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:38.410
is sampling in frequency.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.820
OK, so the idea,
then, is that that's

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.860
a way of rationalizing how
the Fourier series would

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:44.360
have worked.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.400
So the Fourier series was
a discrete set of numbers

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.475
exactly for that reason.

00:45:51.475 --> 00:45:52.850
I started out with
something that

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:56.030
was continuous in
frequency, but I sampled it

00:45:56.030 --> 00:46:02.440
because I was multiplying
by an impulse train.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:07.257
So what I hope this
did, OK, was dragged you

00:46:07.257 --> 00:46:09.340
through a couple of examples
that will make things

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.542
a little bit easier tomorrow.

00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:13.000
But I also hope
that you understand

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.490
how we went from a
diagram that looks kind

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:18.310
of complicated an arbitrary--

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:21.490
here we had DT on the
top and CT on the bottom,

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:25.640
periodic on the left and
not periodic on the right.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.930
The transforms had all that
things turn 90 degrees.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:33.760
We ended up with discrete on
the left instead of on the top,

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.790
and we ended up with
periodic in the top

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:39.260
rather than on the left.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:46.180
And that's entirely because
of the relationships

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.460
between the various
Fourier transforms.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.689
So the idea is--

00:46:49.689 --> 00:46:51.730
and you can understand
all of those relationships

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:54.880
by simply thinking
about impulse trains.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.810
We take an aperiodic signal,
turn it into a periodic

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.190
by convolution in time, which
is the same as multiplying

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:03.570
frequency, which is
the same as sampling.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:06.570
We sample in time by multiplying
by an impulse train, which

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:08.340
is the same as
convolving in frequency,

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.530
which makes it periodic.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:15.360
So the hope is that this
looks like more than just--

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.450
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--
eight independent equations,

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:20.000
they're not.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.730
It's really two equations--
the transform and the inverse

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:27.710
transform-- and they're
almost the same equation,

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:30.250
except for taking into
account the special properties

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.950
of the different domains.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:35.716
OK, have a good time,
and see you tomorrow.
