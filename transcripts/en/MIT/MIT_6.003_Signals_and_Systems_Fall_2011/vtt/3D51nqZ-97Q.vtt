DENNIS FREEMAN: Hello, welcome.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.500
As you expect, the big news is
that there's a quiz next week.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.010
So hopefully, that's all square,
everybody knows everything.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.640
Questions, comments?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.790
Everybody's pretty
comfortable with what's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.950
going on with the quiz?

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.410
If you have a conflict,
please contact me shortly,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.000
because I have to arrange
rooms and proctors.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.740
No questions?

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.090
Good.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.470
So last time we looked at
discrete time frequency

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.180
responses.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.530
Lots of things were similar.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.140
A few things were different.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.420
The first difference we saw
was that in discrete time,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.040
we like to think about complex
geometric sequences rather than

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.410
complex exponential sequences.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.940
And the effect of that is
that the frequency response

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.660
lives on the unit circle.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.530
So if you try to think about
a discrete time system,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.005
say, characterized
by a z-transform

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.130
and think about what would
be its output when there

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.500
is a sinusoidal
input, just like CT,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.270
if you have a sinusoidal
input, there's

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.674
going to be a sinusoidal
output at the same frequency.

00:01:38.674 --> 00:01:40.465
But the amplitude and
phase can be shifted.

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:44.950
But to compute the amplitude
and the phase for a DT system,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.510
you look at the unit
circle of the z-transform.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.690
That's as distinct from the
Laplace transform in CT,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.320
we looked at the j omega-axis.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.710
So now, everything we used to
say about the j omega-axis,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.930
we say about the unit circle.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.100
Other than that, things
are extremely similar.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.550
And just to boost
your confidence

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.220
so you know exactly what's
going on, here's a question.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.900
What if I gave you
a system that had

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.560
a single pole and a single zero,
and say the pole and zero are

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.140
related that way?

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.000
How would you think
about that system--

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.300
Low pass, high pass, all
pass, band pass, band stop,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.720
high stop, low stop, all stop?

00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:38.945
AUDIENCE: I say low pass.

00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:39.923
AUDIENCE: Low pass.

00:02:39.923 --> 00:02:41.390
AUDIENCE: Band pass.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.310
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
some very early votes

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.600
that are completely correct.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.200
You had the recitation, so
then there is no excuse.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.440
So if I see any wrong answers--

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.320
and I see wrong answers.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.320
Ah!

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.370
So maybe I should have the
recitation instructor-- well,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.900
no, no, OK, everybody votes.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.400
So high pass, low pass, band
pass, all pass, band stop,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.960
none of the above, vote.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.300
The vast majority
is 100% correct.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.660
The vast majority is correct,
but it's not quite 100%.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.120
So the answer is 4, all pass.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.616
Why?

00:03:33.616 --> 00:03:34.990
Can somebody make
an argument why

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.323
that should be all pass, other
than you saw it yesterday

00:03:37.323 --> 00:03:38.800
in recitation?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.494
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:40.660
I mean that's a good reason.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.650
Yeah.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.612
AUDIENCE: It can no longer go
through the axis below omega.

00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:51.859
The magnitude of the zero
divided by the magnitude

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.308
of the pole is pretty large.

00:03:53.308 --> 00:03:57.172
And then as you go to
infinite omega, it goes to 1.

00:03:57.172 --> 00:03:58.621
So I think it's going to pass.

00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:01.300
DENNIS FREEMAN: So I'm a little
bothered by infinite omega.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.640
Where should we be--

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.287
when we think about things as
low pass, high pass, whatever,

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.870
what are we thinking
about when we say

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.161
something is a low pass filter?

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.267
So somebody says this.

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:14.100
So what's that mean?

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.140
That's correct.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.040
So a large fraction
of this class

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.370
is learning to interpret
sign language in the air.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.610
And so what's it mean
if a system is low pass?

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.256
What do I look for when
I look at this diagram

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:29.630
to see that
something's low pass?

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:34.190
AUDIENCE: Look for
lower frequencies.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.302
DENNIS FREEMAN: Where is low
frequencies on this diagram?

00:04:37.302 --> 00:04:39.186
AUDIENCE: If you cut in half--

00:04:39.186 --> 00:04:46.397
DENNIS FREEMAN: Cut it in half,
top and bottom, take that side.

00:04:46.397 --> 00:04:47.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.610
So low frequencies are there.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.100
So we're thinking
about frequencies

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.140
being e to the j omega,
because what we're

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.640
thinking of or
thinking about, we'd

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.460
like to think about
cosine of omega n.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.650
But we want to make that
look like an eigenfunction.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.280
So we want to make that
look like e to the j omega n

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.950
plus e to the minus j omega
n, that kind of thing--

00:05:16.464 --> 00:05:18.030
then divide by 1/2 probably.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.762
So the question is--
so this is all pass.

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:27.220
And that's actually
kind of tricky,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.219
if you think about how
it would become that way.

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.838
Yes.

00:05:29.838 --> 00:05:32.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] at any
point on the unit circle--

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.543
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yes.

00:05:33.543 --> 00:05:36.896
AUDIENCE: It stems
from the [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:38.800
DENNIS FREEMAN: That's
precisely right.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.290
So somehow, if you took this
distance and that distance,

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.909
which is intended in this
figure not to look the same,

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.200
but if you took the ratio--
because this one is a zero,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.970
so it's in the top, and
this one is a pole, so it's

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.940
in the bottom-- and if you took
that ratio, somehow if you took

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.820
that ratio divided by
that ratio and compared it

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.970
to this one divided by
that one, those numbers

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.590
would be the same thing.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.280
That's what would
have to happen.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.550
You would compute the magnitude
of the frequency response

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.460
by taking the ratio of the
magnitudes of the vectors

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.690
that connect the zero
to the point of interest

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.270
and the pole to the point
of interest-- the point

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.811
of interest being
on the unit circle.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.720
It's not at all obvious to me
that that ratio is a constant,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.040
if you move along a circle.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.456
That's another one
of those things

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:32.540
that I think I need
Greek to convince me.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
because he figured it out.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.998
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Oh, somebody knows.

00:06:35.998 --> 00:06:37.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the
guy [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.180
DENNIS FREEMAN: Wonderful.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.523
So you should explain it to me.

00:06:40.523 --> 00:06:41.022
[LAUGHS]

00:06:41.022 --> 00:06:42.870
AUDIENCE: He explained it to me.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.585
DENNIS FREEMAN: [LAUGHS]
Putting you on the spot.

00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:47.240
AUDIENCE: Like right now?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.140
DENNIS FREEMAN: Oh, that's OK.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.820
If you want to, that's fine.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.325
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
So if you have

00:06:56.325 --> 00:06:57.750
any point on the unit circle?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.625
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:01.936
AUDIENCE: You draw like a line
from that point to the origin.

00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:06.720
DENNIS FREEMAN: So if you have
any point on the unit circle,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.555
say that one--

00:07:07.555 --> 00:07:09.821
AUDIENCE: So you
draw a line halfway--

00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:12.320
could you do it on the other
side, on that side [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.361
DENNIS FREEMAN: So you
like this side better, OK.

00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:17.930
AUDIENCE: So you draw a line
from that point to the origin.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.120
[INAUDIBLE] 1 over a
and a on the x-axis.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.950
DENNIS FREEMAN:
So 1 over a and a.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.695
AUDIENCE: And draw set of
lines from those to the point

00:07:26.695 --> 00:07:27.320
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.319
DENNIS FREEMAN: Up here?

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.546
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:31.170
So now like you have
two triangles that

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.883
have the same side
and the same angle.

00:07:34.883 --> 00:07:37.753
And if you just use
the law of cosines--

00:07:37.753 --> 00:07:39.510
DENNIS FREEMAN: You have two--

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.927
AUDIENCE: So you have a big
triangle and a small triangle.

00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:43.593
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
we have this triangle

00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:45.220
and we have this triangle.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.415
Those are the two you want?

00:07:46.415 --> 00:07:47.206
AUDIENCE: And yeah.

00:07:47.206 --> 00:07:49.290
So like they have--

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.266
the line of the leftmost
is like the same for both.

00:07:53.266 --> 00:07:57.154
And the angle at the center
is the same for both.

00:07:57.154 --> 00:07:59.376
DENNIS FREEMAN: So this
angle is equal to this angle?

00:07:59.376 --> 00:07:59.917
AUDIENCE: No.

00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:01.360
AUDIENCE: The central angle.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.150
The central angle with the--

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.104
AUDIENCE: You take the
whole be triangle and--

00:08:06.104 --> 00:08:07.900
DENNIS FREEMAN: Take
the big triangle--

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.941
AUDIENCE: And the origin.

00:08:08.941 --> 00:08:10.580
AUDIENCE: And then
the one you just--

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.996
AUDIENCE: The angle
at the origin.

00:08:11.996 --> 00:08:15.083
DENNIS FREEMAN: And the
angle at the origin.

00:08:15.083 --> 00:08:16.556
AUDIENCE: Yes, that one.

00:08:16.556 --> 00:08:18.909
AUDIENCE: So that angle is
in both the big triangle

00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:19.700
and the little one.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.750
DENNIS FREEMAN: That angle
is in the big triangle

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.541
and the little one?

00:08:21.541 --> 00:08:22.080
Yes!

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.470
Got it!

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.653
AUDIENCE: And the
size of the bottom

00:08:26.653 --> 00:08:29.196
are like 1/a and a
for the two triangles.

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:30.070
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.485
AUDIENCE: So you just use
the law of cosines and--

00:08:32.485 --> 00:08:33.860
DENNIS FREEMAN:
That's very good.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.790
AUDIENCE: Isn't that pretty?

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.185
DENNIS FREEMAN: What was that?

00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:37.120
AUDIENCE: Isn't that pretty?

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.411
DENNIS FREEMAN: That's amazing.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.848
So wonderful.

00:08:41.848 --> 00:08:42.514
Congratulations.

00:08:42.514 --> 00:08:46.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.747
So you're also working
on the triangle thing?

00:08:49.747 --> 00:08:50.580
Don't have that yet.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.100
OK.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.810
I'll keep checking in.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:59.030
So the way people who don't do
quite so well in trig do it,

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:03.620
so you can also just
empty-headedly substitute z

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.702
equals e to the j omega.

00:09:06.702 --> 00:09:09.160
And then if you want to make
the top look a little bit more

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.280
like the bottom, you could take
out the e to the j omega part.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.803
And then you see that these
look like complex conjugates.

00:09:21.447 --> 00:09:22.780
So this is kind of the math way.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.238
And what you said
was the trig way.

00:09:24.238 --> 00:09:28.480
I like the trig way much better,
the [INAUDIBLE] way, yes.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.320
So complex conjugates,
same magnitude done.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.790
So the whole point was
just to motivate the idea

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.170
of thinking about an all pass.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.094
Why would you build an all pass?

00:09:39.094 --> 00:09:40.260
What's an all pass good for?

00:09:43.669 --> 00:09:48.260
It's 6.003 exercises, of course.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.185
So an all pass doesn't
change the magnitudes.

00:09:50.185 --> 00:09:51.484
So what's it good for?

00:09:51.484 --> 00:09:52.650
AUDIENCE: Changes the phase.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.066
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Changes the phase.

00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:55.820
So if you were to
think about what's

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.530
the phase of the all
pass, you get a function

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.770
that depends differently.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.500
So you have to compute the
angles of these vectors.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.550
So this one-- the angle at
the zero starts out at pi.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.690
The angle associated with
the pole starts out at zero.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:18.710
There's actually a minus sign in
here, because I took 1 minus z

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.786
compared to z minus a.

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.160
So I put the z at
the two places.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.560
So there's a net minus sign in
the whole transfer function.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.050
So the pi cancels out the pi.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.587
So we start at zero at zero.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:30.920
Everybody know what I just said?

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.420
So the angle associated
with the zero is pi.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:44.390
But there's also a negative sign
associated with the transfer

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.470
function, because we would
normally like to write z

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.670
minus a 0 divided
by z minus a pole.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.070
And I didn't write it that way.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.730
The top one, I wrote backwards.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.790
So there's a net minus sign.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.870
Because of the minus
sign, the phase

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.230
starts out at zero
instead of pi.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.910
That's how that got to be zero.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.520
So this starts out at pi--

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.810
the angle starts out at pi.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.820
It becomes less, and then
it goes back to being pi.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.510
But the angle associated
with the pole starts at zero

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.580
and goes around the pi.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.850
So the net from the
pole is a pi shift,

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.530
which accounts for why this
goes from 0 to minus pi.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.530
You can all do that, right?

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.220
So the idea is that the all
pass would alter the phase.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.100
And that's one of the things
I wanted to talk about.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.440
What's the effect of
changing the phase?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.380
And I'll do a demo now, thinking
about how it affects audio.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.880
And at the end of
the hour, thinking

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.040
about how it affects video.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.240
So to think about this,
I took this fraction.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:04.490
And I used a equals 0.95.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:09.860
And I took a waveform that
I generated with Python.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.290
I just added together
three tones in the ratio

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.370
1, 3, 5 in frequencies, so
it sounds like more harmonic.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.520
And when you add those together,
you get a sound like this.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.160
[TONES PLAYING]

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.200
What you hear is a very dominant
tone-- a very dominant pitch,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.730
because I made the harmonics
be integer multiples.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.070
So I made the overtones
be integer multiples

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.750
of the fundamental.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.420
So the fundamental was at 8,440.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.880
And I put in some third harmonic
and some fifth harmonic.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:47.450
So you get something that
sounds very constant pitch.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:51.670
Then I took that waveform and
put it through this filter.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.980
And that changes this
looking wave form

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.000
into that looking waveform.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.550
Those are real waveforms.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.010
And then it changes
the sound, so

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:07.620
that instead of sounding
like this [TONES PLAYING],

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.332
it sounds like [TONES PLAYING].

00:13:12.332 --> 00:13:14.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.440
You can all hear the
enormous difference, right?

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.640
So even with headphones, I can't
hear any difference at all.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.190
And that's kind of a
property of the way you hear.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.080
You kind of hear--

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.820
I'll say some
caveats about this.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.290
This is not exactly true.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.100
So Ohm's law of hearing--

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:40.100
the same Ohm-- says that you
hear sounds by the frequencies

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.260
that they contain.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.381
Roughly speaking,
you hear sounds

00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:46.880
according to the magnitude of
the frequencies that you hear.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.120
Now, that's not quite true,
but it's sort of true.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.000
So let me do a more
complicated example.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.118
So the first sound is a
consonant vowel consonant.

00:13:57.118 --> 00:13:57.784

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.870
DENNIS FREEMAN: And then I put
it through the same all pass.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.800
So I screw up the phases.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.170
So it goes from looking like
this to looking like this

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.446

[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:33.467 --> 00:14:35.550
DENNIS FREEMAN: If I listen
to that on headphones,

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.140
I can actually
hear a difference.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.380
But I study hearing, and
I know what to listen for.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.450
It's still difficult
to tell the difference.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.400
Now, that's because
I kind of cheated.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.180
To let you know
how I cheated, let

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.010
me do something more
drastic to the phase.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.394

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.520
How does the phase
of the second signal

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.390
compare to the phase
of the first signal?

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.029
So look at each other so
you can blame each other.

00:15:32.029 --> 00:15:34.570

then I'll have to blame you.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:49.227 --> 00:16:51.060
DENNIS FREEMAN: So it's
a phase relationship

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.950
between the x signal
and the y signal.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:00.940
If I showed you the Fourier
transform for the x signal

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.640
and looked at the y signal,
which is x of minus n,

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.150
how would the two look--
the same or different?

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.710
I sort of gave it away.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.369
Flipping in time does what to
the magnitude of the Fourier

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.530
transform?

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.522
Flipping time--

00:17:18.522 --> 00:17:20.144
AUDIENCE: Change the magnitude?

00:17:20.144 --> 00:17:22.310
DENNIS FREEMAN: Doesn't
change the magnitude at all.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.662
What does it do?

00:17:24.662 --> 00:17:26.051
AUDIENCE: The phase.

00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:28.349
DENNIS FREEMAN: Flips
the sign of the phase.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.020
That's exactly right.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.560
So if you're into math-y
these sort of things,

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.510
you can think of representing
the two as Fourier series--

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.460
the ak's and the bk's.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.590
And if you think
about what happens

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.740
if you have x of minus n, you
can do a change of variable,

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.050
make that look like x of n.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.790
Then it looks more like the
Fourier series equation,

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.260
except that now I
lost my minus sign.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:57.080
So a sub k is the
same as b sub minus k.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.450
The effect is to flip
the sign of the phase.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.770
Why would that be so much more
audible than the other things

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:03.520
that I showed you?

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.110
Flipping the sign of a phase,
why would that be audible?

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:18.520
What would it mean if I flipped
the sign from 68 degrees

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.895
to minus 68 degrees?

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.531
Not a clue.

00:18:26.531 --> 00:18:27.030
Yes.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.880
AUDIENCE: For a total time,
it wouldn't change a thing.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.680
But for any sign terms, it
would invert that over that.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.950
DENNIS FREEMAN: So it'd invert--

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.700
Let's see, if you went
from plus 68 to minus 68--

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:46.940
so say I had cosine of
omega n plus 68 degrees

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:52.470
and cosine omega n
minus 68 degrees.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:56.360
So I change the phase by
flipping the sign of it.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.276
How would that change
the relationship

00:18:59.276 --> 00:19:00.275
between the two signals?

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.600
What's phase?

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.780
Intuitively, what's phase?

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:11.690
Yeah, it's this way.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.060
It's a time shift.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.244
So the problem with
this phase shift

00:19:16.244 --> 00:19:18.410
is that you're shifting all
the different components

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.180
by different amounts of phase.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.470
So you might have a little
bit of 68 hertz and 72 hertz

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.680
and 3 kilohertz and 512 hertz.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.500
And all of those are
getting their phase flipped.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.410
So whatever it came out--

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:37.380
13, 128, whatever--
it becomes minus that.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:42.170
All of those phase shifts
represent a time shift.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.000
All the components are
being shifted in time.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.180
So you're shifting
around things,

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.140
all the different
components, by some amount.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.240
And what your ear is
actually very sensitive to

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.380
is the low frequencies.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.330
When you shift the
low frequencies

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.930
by an amount of phase,
that's a big time.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.510
So if you think about the
fundamental frequency that

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.520
started when the
utterance began and went

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.800
to the end of the utterance,
that was like two seconds.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.300
So whatever that
phase is, it got

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.060
inverted, which is a large
fraction of two seconds

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.530
probably.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.820
You can easily hear a
time-shift of two seconds.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.319
Yeah.

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:20.327
AUDIENCE: Could you notice it,
if it was just a pure tone?

00:20:20.327 --> 00:20:22.160
DENNIS FREEMAN: If it
were just a pure tone,

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.796
you would have no clue.

00:20:23.796 --> 00:20:27.764
AUDIENCE: Or you can [INAUDIBLE]
overtones very simple.

00:20:27.764 --> 00:20:32.630
DENNIS FREEMAN: So to make
Ohm's law a little more precise,

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:37.640
what your ear really does is
it does band pass filters.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.890
If the components fall
very close to each other,

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.380
you can hear the phase shift.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.730
If the components are far
from each other, you can't.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:52.220
Even the second overtone
of a fundamental

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.840
is far enough away
that you can't

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.640
hear the relative phase of it.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.650
The frequency components have
to be very close together.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.515
So you can hear phase only in
a very particular case when

00:21:02.515 --> 00:21:03.890
there's frequency
components that

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.110
are very close to
each other and there's

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.690
a relatively big shift in the
phase of those two signals.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:12.780
Except for that,
Ohm's law is true.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.820
The point is just that the
Fourier series gives us

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.790
a way of thinking about a
very interesting dimension

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.530
of a signal--

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.320
one that separates things
that are audible from things

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.250
that are not audible.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.960
So when you're doing
signal processing,

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.050
you can pay less attention to
the thing that's not audible.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.500
You can go ahead and distort
that, and nobody will know.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.414
But you have to
pay close attention

00:21:35.414 --> 00:21:36.830
to the things
that's very audible,

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.050
which is the magnitude.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.600
We'll see at the end of the
hour that that situation is

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.010
completely flipped for video.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.086
But before we get there--

00:21:48.086 --> 00:21:49.460
so the first thing
to think about

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.540
was the idea of
circular frequency--

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.090
the fact that we're looking
at frequency responses living

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.950
on the unit circle, rather
than on the j omega-axis.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.100
The second big
difference with the DT

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.310
is the frequencies are cyclic.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.620
So rather than having
harmonics go the whole way up

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.000
to infinity, as we did in CT--

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.230
In CT, we would have a
Fourier series constructed

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.120
of the fundamental, the second
harmonic, the third harmonic,

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.370
the fourth harmonic, the
fifth harmonic, the whole way

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.710
out to infinity, in
principle at least.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:23.480
In DT, they rap, so that you
get a finite number of them.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.760
In fact, if you're taking a
sequence of length N, here

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.540
illustrated for 8, you get
eight possible frequencies,

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.400
half of which are negative.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.890
And you don't care
about those anyway.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:42.140
So the number of frequency
components for a DT signal

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.760
is finite--

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.250
for DT Fourier series.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.990
That has enormous implications.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.100
It means that when you do a
Fourier series decomposition,

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.570
there's a finite
number of terms.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.830
That's enormous, because that
means that, if you started out

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:03.260
with a sequence of
length cap N, say 1,024,

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.330
and you take the
Fourier series of it

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.450
in order to think about
the frequency content,

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:12.710
you can replace the
1,024 numbers in time

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.340
with 1,024 numbers in frequency.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.740
There's no-- well,
no is exaggeration.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.270
There is a factor of two
kind of explosion of data,

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:30.230
because I went from N
real-valued signals, samples,

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:34.920
to N complex-valued signals.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.950
That's not quite true either,
because of the reasons

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.630
about how information works.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.260
The-- how do I want to say it?

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.130
The resolution that you need
for the frequency domain

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.730
representation is
actually slightly smaller.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.864
To a first order, you're
replacing [? N ?] with [? n ?]

00:23:53.864 --> 00:23:55.280
That's really good,
because if you

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.530
think about the
alternative in CT,

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.987
you would be replacing a
signal with an infinite number.

00:24:00.987 --> 00:24:02.570
And that's just not
reasonable, if you

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.520
want to think about
processing signals

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.720
with digital electronics.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.261
There's no way that
you could process

00:24:07.261 --> 00:24:10.230
an infinite number of signals
in a finite amount of time.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:14.180
So the fact that you're
replacing n samples in time

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.630
with n samples in frequency
really lends itself

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:22.410
to doing signal processing
using digital techniques.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.410
Now, the problem is--

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.622
and just one way of thinking
about the finite length

00:24:27.622 --> 00:24:29.330
is that you can think
about it by matrix.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.770
That's just a mnemonic
that helps me a lot,

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.040
to think about how, if I
have a four-length sequence,

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.660
you go through some matrix.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.570
And what comes out is a
four-length frequency response.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.340
You have some
eight-length sequence,

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.540
you go through some matrix.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.560
And then comes out some
eight-length frequency

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.236
representation.

00:24:47.236 --> 00:24:48.860
And there's actually
a lot of intuition

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.950
that you can draw in making
the parallels between matrix

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.677
representations and the
Fourier representation,

00:24:55.677 --> 00:24:58.010
because it is a transformation,
a linear transformation,

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.800
just like the matrix implies.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:06.710
There is one problem with that
finite representation idea.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:10.790
And that is that
it scales poorly.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:16.340
If you think about having
a two-length sequence,

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.710
the two-length sequence has
a two-length representation

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:22.990
in frequency via
the Fourier series.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:26.970
And that representation
has how many coefficients?

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.190
Four-- two and two.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:35.770
Now, if I do of four, I get
four, how many coefficients?

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.810
4 by 4 is 16.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.340
Now, some of these are 1's.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.490
Right So all of these are 1's.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.800
As you make the sequence
bigger and bigger and bigger,

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.380
however, the number
of trivial entries

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.040
gets smaller and smaller
and smaller relative.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.870
So as you go from a
two-length sequence

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.290
to a four-length sequence
to an eight-length sequence,

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:03.820
now we're up to 64
multiplies in order

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.710
to convert a time-domain
representation

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.932
into a frequency-domain
representation.

00:26:07.932 --> 00:26:10.390
Well, that's bad, because the
kinds of things we want to do

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.720
are not two and four and eight.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.620
The kinds of things
we want to do

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.350
are manipulations
on signals of 10

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:20.500
to the sixth, 10 to the
eighth, 10 to the 12th.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.250
For my doctoral thesis, I did
some fluid dynamic problems,

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:29.290
where the calculations had
10 to the sixth unknowns.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.320
And I used frequency
domain techniques,

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.040
which I was able to implement
with things that I'll

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.460
talk about in a minute.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.260
If we had used this
scaling by the square,

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.680
it just wouldn't have worked.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.180
If you have 10 to
the sixth unknowns

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.320
and if you're
using a method that

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.960
converts from one representation
to another that involves 10

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.950
to the 12th operations,
that's just not a good idea.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.580
So that's bad.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.605
So by the theory of lectures,
what I'm about to tell you is--

00:26:59.605 --> 00:27:01.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.327
DENNIS FREEMAN: There's is
a great way to fix this.

00:27:05.327 --> 00:27:06.910
If there weren't, I
wouldn't tell you.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.840
I wouldn't pose the problem.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.520
So the question is how to
think about this scaling

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.250
in order to not have the
number of calculations

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:19.030
that you need to do
blow up with N square.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.510
So in order to
motivate this, I've

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:27.850
used a funny notation,
where the W represents

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:32.100
the N-th primary root of 1.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.910
That just saves me
from writing out e

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:38.660
to the j 2 pi over N 64
times, which when I did it,

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.080
it didn't fit on one slide.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.960
I had to compress it too
much, and you couldn't see it.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:48.820
So just to save space,
every time I say W8,0,

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:55.920
all I mean is compute the eighth
root of 1 and then raise it

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.960
to the 0-th power.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.960
Compute the eighth root
of 1 and then raise it

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.950
to the seventh power.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.530
That's all that means.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.360
So the idea is, is
there a way that we

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.840
can think about the structure
of this matrix more simply?

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.610
And in particular, is there a
way to use divide and conquer?

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.990
That's our best algorithm.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:21.540
It would be great if we could
take the eight-point sequence

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:25.740
and substitute in its
place finding the frequency

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:32.700
representations for two
four-point sequences.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.590
And by the theory of lecture's,
that's what I'm about to do.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.220
So the idea is, what
if I just simply took

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.970
the even entries in this
more complicated problem--

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.300
so I have eight entries, none
of which are necessarily 0.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.160
So I have x0 through x7.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.190
And I want to find the frequency
representation c0 through c7.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:56.430
What if I just did the evens
and the odds separately?

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.870
That'd be great.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.120
In order to do eight
in one fell swoop,

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.890
I need 64 multiplications.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.370
In order to do each of these
problems, I have 16 for each.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.830
That's only 32,
I have a big win.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:12.570
But now, I'm left with, is there
a way to relate these things--

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:18.750
these ak's and bk's
back to the original ck?

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.510
So the idea then
is, how would you

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.560
think about the
contribution of the evens,

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.660
as opposed to the odds in
the overall calculation?

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:40.429
So think about the even-numbered
entries in the signal,

00:29:40.429 --> 00:29:41.970
think about the
transformation if you

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.280
were to do a frequency
representation for that

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.230
via the Fourier series, so
that you get a0 through a3.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.180
The first thing you see
is that these numbers

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.910
have W sub 4, the fourth root.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:57.720
I need W sub 8, the eighth root.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.430
But there's a simple identity.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.040
If I know the eighth
root, I can just

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.680
square it to get
the fourth root.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.480
So I can rewrite
the fourth root guys

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.710
in terms of equivalent
eighth root guys.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:11.700
That was trivial.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.690
Nod your head,
completely trivial.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.240
And then I can say, well,
OK here's my problem

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.967
that I would like to solve.

00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:22.050
What if I was only thinking
about the contribution

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.960
of the evens?

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.020
If I'm only worried about the
contributions of the evens,

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.240
then I don't need to worry
about some of the columns,

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.360
because they don't
contribute to the evens.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.090
That's worth thinking about
things in terms of the matrix

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.000
helps us.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.037
We can visualize operations
as operations on a matrix.

00:30:41.037 --> 00:30:42.870
So now, if I'm only
worried about the evens,

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:46.110
I only need to worry about
four of these columns.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:51.960
And if I squint at this, I
can see that W8,0 0, 0 0,

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.440
that's the same row as up here.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.160
So this is the same as that.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.330
And this one, W8--

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.690
so those are all W8's, I
don't even to say that--

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:11.960
0, 2, 4, 6; 0, 2, 4, 6;
0, 4, 0, 4; 0, 4, 0, 4.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.440
These numbers are just
the eight coefficients.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.222
Furthermore, it repeats.

00:31:17.222 --> 00:31:20.260
0, 0, 0, 0 is the
same as 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.210
So that's 8,0, and that's 8,0.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.500
What I just found was that
the way the evens effect

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:31.700
the answer is precisely
by taking their Fourier

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.859
representation and
repeating it twice in time.

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:35.900
Well, that's pretty cute.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.550
So therefore, the contribution
of the four-length sequences

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.910
to the eight-length
sequences is showed this way.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:50.390
Stack up the frequency
representations for the four,

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:53.720
and that is their
contribution to the eight.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.200
The same sort of thing
happens when I do the odds.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.470
Now, if I only
look at the odds, I

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:04.010
throw away a different
set of four columns.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.110
And now, if I try
to compare that

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:10.380
to what I have up
here for the odds,

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.300
I don't quite get
something as easy.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.020
So if I look down this column,
they should have all been 0.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:22.474
But if I look down this column,
it's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:32:22.474 --> 00:32:23.640
If I look down this column--

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.460
0, 2, 4; 0, 3, 6--

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.910
I'm not quite getting
the right answers.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:36.960
But it turns out that, if I
simply factor this number out,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.867
so that I make the
first coefficient right,

00:32:38.867 --> 00:32:40.700
all of the other
coefficients are right too.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:49.220
So I got an easy rule now for
how the Fourier coefficients

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.460
for the odds contribute
to the answer

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.800
for the eight-length sequence.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.200
And now, all I need to do
is glue those two together.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.450
So the way I can calculate
the eight-length sequence

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:12.890
is to calculate the a's and
b's from four-length sequences

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:16.190
and then paste them
together this way.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.230
And I'll get the
eight-length answer.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:23.570
Now, pasting them together
takes some multiplies.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:28.400
So it took me 16 to
compute the a0 to a3.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:34.540
It took me 16 multiplies
to figure out b0 to b3.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.660
So I'm up to 32.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:43.740
Then I have to do eight more
to make the b's look right.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.940
So if I just count
multiplies, I'm now doing 40.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.750
But that's a win, because
that's compared to 64.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.000
And I get precisely
the same answer.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.850
That algorithm--
that's an algorithm;

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.849
that's a rule-based system for
how you take one set of eight

00:33:59.849 --> 00:34:01.890
numbers and turn it into
a different set of eight

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:05.760
numbers-- that algorithm
is called the FFT, the Fast

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.050
Fourier Transform.

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:11.500
That's mostly to confuse you,
because it's not a transform,

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.482
but it is fast.

00:34:13.482 --> 00:34:16.485
So it's really a
fast Fourier series.

00:34:16.485 --> 00:34:18.610
And in fact, the guys who
figured it out knew that.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.290
And I don't know why we insist
on trying to confuse you.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.090
That's perhaps our job.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.650
But the FFT, fast
Fourier transform,

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.350
is really the fast
Fourier series.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:32.580
And the idea is that it's
a divide and conquer thing.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.424
So if you think
about extending it--

00:34:34.424 --> 00:34:36.840
So I motivated it by thinking
about how to calculate the 8

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.190
by 8 from two 4 by 4's.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.480
But let's start from
0 and say, let's

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.639
like capital M represent
however multiplies

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.989
it took to get an endpoint FFT.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:53.639
How many multiplies does it
take to do a 1-point FFT?

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:56.025
If my signal is periodic in 1--

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.760
so what's the relationship
between the series

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.230
representation and the time
representation if the length is

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.550
capital N equals 1?

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.710
The relationship is identity.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:20.480
If my sequence was 17, 17,
17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17,

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:26.570
17, which is a sequence
that has a period of 1,

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:31.520
then the series representation
is 17, 17, 17, 17-- not

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.660
all that surprising.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:37.280
So it takes exactly 0 multiplies
to calculate that one.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.810
How many multiplies does it
take to calculate a length 2?

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:45.210
Well, you do two
length 1 problems.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.770
And then because
it's length 2, you

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:50.690
have to do those two
extra multiplies.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.147
Then take a length 2
and turn it into a 4,

00:35:53.147 --> 00:35:54.230
how many multiplies for 4?

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.510
Well, you have to
do two length 2,

00:35:56.510 --> 00:36:02.560
but now it's length 4, so
there's 4 gluing multiplies.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.630
To do 32, you have
to do two length 16.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.850
And then there's 32 gluing.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:14.510
When you're all done, it
takes eight N times log N.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.080
And the point is
that N times log

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.830
N can be a lot smaller
than N squared.

00:36:22.586 --> 00:36:24.460
So let's go back to the
motivational example.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:32.110
The idea was, what if I had
about 10 to the sixth unknowns?

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:36.359
So that's about 2 to the 20th?

00:36:36.359 --> 00:36:37.150
Yeah, that's right.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:40.120
So 2 to the 10th is
10 cubed roughly.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.880
1,024 is 1,000 in CS terms.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.190
So I have about 2 to the 20th.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:50.470
So what would be the savings
if I did the FFT rather

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.510
than the direct form N squared?

00:36:55.968 --> 00:37:02.610
AUDIENCE: That would be 2 to
the 20th divided by [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:06.110
DENNIS FREEMAN: So I need
to take 2 to 20th times 2

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:09.560
to the 20th would be
the N squared algorithm.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.316
And the other algorithm
would be 2 to the 20th--

00:37:12.316 --> 00:37:13.534
AUDIENCE: By 20.

00:37:13.534 --> 00:37:15.609
DENNIS FREEMAN: --divided by 20.

00:37:15.609 --> 00:37:17.400
It's enormous difference,
that's the point.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.540
So just a little bit
of historic context.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:29.160
That algorithm has been
repeatedly invented in time.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.410
So we usually cite
Cooley and Tukey.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.540
They wrote a classic
paper in 1965.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.100
The title of their
paper was "An Algorithm

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.990
for the Machine Calculation
of Complex Fourier Series."

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.060
They knew it was series.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.290
That was 1965.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.640
That was when computers
were starting to get big.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.060
They actually went on and solved
some very interesting problems,

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.080
including neuroscience.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.230
They were the first people who
solved Hodgkin-Huxley's model

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:56.700
for a propagated
action potential

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.160
and showed that the equations
that Hodgkin and Huxley had

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.690
found for biology actually work.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.350
So that was 1965.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:08.730
However, before them in
1942, Danielson and Lanczos

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:11.040
had independently discovered it.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.040
In 1903, Runge
had discovered it.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:21.600
And, in 1805,
Gauss described it.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.160
Now, there's a
good reason why all

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.330
these brilliant scientists--

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:30.210
so Gauss noted it
and even used it,

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.400
but he commented on
how useless it was.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.690
Why would Gauss
think it was useless?

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:37.953
He was kind of smart.

00:38:37.953 --> 00:38:40.780
AUDIENCE: Was
Fourier alive then?

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.840
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
Gauss actually died

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.780
before he published this.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.670
But it got published
posthumously

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.130
before Fourier started to work.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.966
So this came before Fourier.

00:38:52.966 --> 00:38:54.442
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:54.442 --> 00:38:57.890
DENNIS FREEMAN: So why did
Gauss think this was useless?

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:00.070
And that's 1805.

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.650
And now, we come around to
1965, and Cooley and Tukey

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:03.940
make this huge deal.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.720
And they're world-famous
because of their rediscovery

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.103
of something that
Gauss knew in 1905.

00:39:09.103 --> 00:39:11.518
AUDIENCE: I mean,
you're not going

00:39:11.518 --> 00:39:16.348
to be doing anything that's
like 128 by 128 by hand anyway.

00:39:16.348 --> 00:39:18.650
DENNIS FREEMAN:
That's exactly right.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:22.300
So when Gauss was thinking about
it, he was thinking about 16

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.550
by 16.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:28.360
And so, yeah, you
save two, big deal.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.620
He was much more actually
impressed with logarithms,

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.490
because he was doing
the multiplies by hand.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.020
And the log made it much
easier to do multiplies,

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.260
because you could
substitute addition.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.280
So he actually commented on
how useful logarithms are.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.590
And he didn't comment
on how useful this is.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.800
But now, we make a big
deal in the other order.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.110
And it's entirely
digital computation.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:56.493
So when we solve systems
of 10 to the sixth or 10

00:39:56.493 --> 00:39:59.860
to the 10th unknowns,
this is an enormous deal.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.300
And logarithms are good too.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:01.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.090
But this is an enormous deal.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.750
So one more piece of theory
and then one more ending thing.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.960
The piece of theory is
going from periodic signals

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.670
to aperiodic.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:18.530
And not surprisingly, that
works just the way it did in CT.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.920
In fact, there's
nothing new here.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:26.830
We can think about how would
you make a Fourier transform

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.150
compared to a Fourier series.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.080
With the CT, we developed
the theory for series first,

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.460
because it was easier.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.700
And then we derived the
theory for aperiodic signals.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.160
By something called
periodic extension,

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.370
we took an aperiodic
signal, like this CT signal,

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:46.690
made it periodic,
like that DT signal,

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:50.680
and then took the limit as
the period goes to infinity.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.930
Had we stayed in time
domain the whole time,

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.450
that would be a trivial no-op.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:59.290
But the trick was that after
we did the periodic extension,

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:03.580
we then took the series
of this and then passed

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.550
the limit onto the series.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:07.420
So that's the trick.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:12.130
So we think about generalizing
the aperiodic into periodic.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.300
Then we take the series.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.680
Then we pass the limit.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.480
And we ask whether
the series converges.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.200
And just like CT, the
answer for DT will converge.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.110
So you start with
a periodic signal.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.800
You write out the
DT Fourier series

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.680
just as we've been doing.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.010
And you get an answer that
for this square pulse looks

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.440
very much like the
answer we got before.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.780
The tricky thing
that I've done here

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.220
is I've written this series
on two axes, just like CT--

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.280
a k-axis, which is
the harmonic number,

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.730
and an omega-axis,
which is the frequency.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.010
The frequency
represents the position

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.580
around the unit circle.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:58.550
So capital omega is the
angle of the unit circle.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.590
Then if I change the
period, the effect

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:08.440
of making the period bigger is
to put the harmonics closer.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.590
But in a magical way,
because the envelope--

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.600
the thing showed by
the thin black line--

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.410
doesn't change as
I take the limit,

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.050
that's what enables me to think
about there being a limit.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.080
As you make the period
bigger and bigger,

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.440
you get more and more
lines in an envelope

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.360
that doesn't change.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.330
And then you can think
about the envelope

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.930
as being a function of the
continuous variable omega,

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.344
rather than the
discrete variable k.

00:42:41.344 --> 00:42:42.760
And then you can
think about, what

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.130
would happen if
you pass the limit?

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:50.410
And the idea is that, if you
do the synthesis equation,

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:53.980
there's an ak that
depends on 1/n,

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.830
which you can write in terms of
the fundamental frequency omega

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.280
0.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.770
And then as you pass
the limit, omega 0

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.260
is the spacing between
these harmonics.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.780
So if you multiply
by the spacing,

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.910
you get the area of that block.

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.440
So the area associated with
N equals 0 is this area.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.820
The area associated
with N equals

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.510
1 is that one, N equals
2, N equals 3, et cetera.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:24.370
And so by doing the sum,
the sum increasingly

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:27.190
converges to the integral.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.200
So you get precisely
the same kinds

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.630
of formulas we've
been using before.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.700
The one thing that's
a little bit weird,

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:39.490
in the DT Fourier series, we had
a sum in the synthesis equation

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:41.800
as a sum in the
analysis equation.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.710
Here, we get one of both.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:50.050
The DT Fourier transform--
that's this thing--

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:54.430
is a function of the
continuous variable-- uh--

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:58.360
discrete-time Fourier transform
has a continuous frequency

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.940
variable capital omega.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.190
Because it has a
continuous-- even though

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.370
it's a discrete-time
Fourier transform--

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:08.260
discrete-time Fourier transform
has a continuous frequency

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.800
variable cap omega.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.030
So when we do the synthesis,
we have to integrate.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:17.032
So one direction is a
sum, the other direction

00:44:17.032 --> 00:44:17.740
it's an integral.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.490
Other than that,
it's just the same.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.560
So there's a striking parallel.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.870
All of these things
are highly related.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.120
The CT Fourier transforms
are highly related

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.240
to the CT Fourier
series, as is the CT

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.427
transform to the CT series.

00:44:31.427 --> 00:44:32.760
And there's lots of connections.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.920
And we'll talk about
that more next week--

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.340
how you can infer how one of
these transform relationships

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:42.450
would have worked from
all of the others.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.100
For the time being,
the important thing

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:49.890
is just that, when you do
the DT Fourier transform,

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:53.400
you can think about that just
like the CT Fourier transform.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.330
The CT Fourier transform was
evaluate the Laplace transform

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:58.810
on the j omega-axis.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:02.400
Now, you evaluate the
z-transform on the unit circle.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.990
The unit circle is no surprise.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:06.690
That's what we've been doing.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:11.250
Because of the relationship
between the DT Fourier

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:18.900
transform and the z-transform,
the DT Fourier transform

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.460
inherits all the nice
properties of the z-transform.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.030
We'll make a bigger deal of
that in the upcoming two weeks.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:30.120
In fact, that's the next
two weeks of this course,

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.530
is to figure out
the implications

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:35.170
of all of those properties.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:37.140
But for today, what I
want to just close with

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.880
is one more example of how you
can think about these frequency

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.370
representations
helping you to imagine

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.110
the kinds of signal
processing that you

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.270
do or would like to do.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:52.470
And so the last example now
is one from image processing,

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:53.660
instead of audio processing.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.617
I started with audio processing.

00:45:55.617 --> 00:45:57.450
Now, I want to think
about image processing.

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.460
Image has the property
that I'm going to have

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.040
to do something with 2D.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.560
And in this class, we
primarily think about 1D.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.160
But you saw in the zebra problem
that sometimes extending to 2D

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.600
is not hard.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.830
And it certainly is the
case that the Fourier method

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:17.700
extending to 2D is
really easy, or at least

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:19.680
I'm going to say that.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.990
So the way you can think
about a Fourier series

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:27.660
in two dimensions is
illustrated by this picture.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.240
I took a picture
that 512 by 512.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.130
That's the boat.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:37.100
And I made a new picture
by taking this row,

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.780
calculating the Fourier
series for that row--

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.420
that had 512; so
it's 512 by 512.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.860
So I took these 512 numbers,
took the Fourier series,

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.820
and wrote them here.

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:55.700
Then I took these 512 numbers
and put the Fourier series here

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.980
and repeat--

00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.120
so fill the whole thing up.

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:06.200
So I took 512,
512-length sequences.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:13.862
Then I took that
string of numbers,

00:47:13.862 --> 00:47:17.565
took the Fourier series,
and put it there.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:24.060
And then that one, take the
Fourier series, put it there.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.980
Take that one, take
the Fourier series,

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:30.000
put it there, and build
up an image that way.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.520
So I, row by row, took
all the Fourier series,

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.844
pasted them together.

00:47:33.844 --> 00:47:35.760
Column by column, took
all the Fourier series,

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:36.840
pasted them together.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.298
When you're done
with that, you get

00:47:38.298 --> 00:47:41.580
what we call a two
dimensional Fourier series.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.470
And what you see
on the right then--

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.720
so here's my original
picture 512 by 512.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.761
Here's the picture of the
magnitude of the angle.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:55.950
You can clearly see the boat.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:59.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:03.490
And it's much clearer here.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:06.610
So the phase looks
kind of random.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.800
So to gain some insight
into what's in the magnitude

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.740
and what's in the
phase, what I can do

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.220
is generate a new picture by
setting the angle everywhere

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:15.790
to 0.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.430
So I took the picture,
the magnitude,

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:22.450
and I did this to it.

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.980
I got the magnitude and angle.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.470
I set the angles to 0.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.820
And that's the picture I got.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.800
So I was able to munge the
angle in the auditory thing,

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.150
and you could barely tell.

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:39.770
Can you tell that
I've munged the angle?

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.130
There's some distortion
caused by the angles.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:46.330
There are some things
that you can still see.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:50.947
So if you go back to this one,
there's these things here,

00:48:50.947 --> 00:48:52.780
and there's these things
here, and there's--

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.520
And if you go to
this one, there's

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.460
some lines here,
and some lines--

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.430
Maybe there's something there.

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:03.880
But to a first order, it
kind of messed things up.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.310
So then I did the opposite--

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:09.230
just throw away the
magnitude and substitute 1,

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:12.780
put 1 everywhere
there was a magnitude,

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.090
but put the angle back.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:16.750
Now, you can almost
see the ship.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.697
So throw away the
magnitude is better

00:49:18.697 --> 00:49:19.780
than throw away the phase.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.480
That's kind of cute.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.182
Can somebody think of why
throw away the magnitude

00:49:25.182 --> 00:49:26.890
might be better than
throw away the angle

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:28.556
when you're trying
to look at a picture?

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:32.960
Yeah.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.410
AUDIENCE: Angle
determines resolution.

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:37.890
Magnitude determines
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:39.780
DENNIS FREEMAN:
That's exactly right.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.770
So if you muck around
with the phase,

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:45.650
you're changing the position.

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:47.784
Even in audio, when you
muck around with the phase,

00:49:47.784 --> 00:49:49.700
you're changing when the
component comes out--

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.066
earlier or later.

00:49:51.066 --> 00:49:53.690
In the picture, you're changing
when the brightness comes out--

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:55.200
earlier or later.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.200
If you want to have
a nice straight line,

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.020
you better keep all
the phases lined up.

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:02.580
If you scramble them,
they end up scrambled,

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.890
and you don't see them anymore.

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:10.410
And as you said, the magnitude
is controlling the intensity.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.064
So my intensities
are all screwed up,

00:50:13.064 --> 00:50:14.730
but you can kind of
still see the lines.

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.140
You can almost even read--

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:17.300
if you know Polish--

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:22.340
you can almost read
what the title says.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.380
So one more manipulation--

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:31.340
I took a different picture
and substituted the magnitude

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.610
of that different picture
in place of the magnitude

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.210
of the boat picture.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:41.120
So angle with the boat,
magnitude of the mystery

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.270
picture, and it came
out pretty good.

00:50:47.822 --> 00:50:49.530
But by the theory of
lectures, of course,

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:51.390
you know that the
way I did this was

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:53.745
to get a picture of
a different boat,

00:50:53.745 --> 00:50:55.120
so that it would
be very similar.

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.350
And so that's what
the magnitude was.

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.150
So it doesn't
really matter much.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:10.410
So I started with this
magnitude and angle,

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:14.974
substitute the mandrill's
magnitude, and you get that.

00:51:14.974 --> 00:51:16.140
So it comes out pretty good.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.120
So the idea then
is just that we've

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.940
looked at Fourier
representations

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.500
as an alternative
way of thinking

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.240
about the content of a signal.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.880
And for many purposes,
like audio and video,

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:32.220
that alternative representation
is easy and insightful.

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.090
No class tomorrow.

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:35.130
It's Veterans Day.

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:37.760
Party next Wednesday.
