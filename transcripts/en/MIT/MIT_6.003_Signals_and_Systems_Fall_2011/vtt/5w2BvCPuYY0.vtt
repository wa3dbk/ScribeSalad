00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.950
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Hello, and welcome.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.480
So like last time, the
important announcement

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.090
is of course that we
have an exam coming up.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.480
So exam 2, Wednesday,
everything's

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.210
very similar, analogous to
last time, with the exception

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.040
that we are in Walker.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.420
Don't go to Building 26.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.370
Go to Walker.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.210
Other than that things look
very similar to before.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.030
The idea will be
that the exam will

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.070
focus on things since exam 1.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.800
However, this subject
builds on itself.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.970
So the official coverage is
1 the 12, lectures 1 to 12,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.800
recitations 1 to 12,
and homeworks 1 to 7.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.300
Questions?

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.260
Comments?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.244
All the logistical
issues are clear?

00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:12.732
AUDIENCE: I had one question.

00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:18.690
[INAUDIBLE] how much do we
have to know about [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.646
DENNIS FREEMAN: So there was
an introduction to root locus.

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:24.520
Sorry, so everybody
knows what root locus is?

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.810
You can find out after class.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.360
You know, it will just making
me feel a lot better if you

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.500
nod your head yes.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.730
Root locus is the way
you figure out the locus

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.880
of possible points that
a pole could move to.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.870
There is an enormous number
of rules for thinking

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.270
about how root locuses evolve.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.270
And if you're really good
signals and systems person,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.070
you know 50 rules.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.880
That's not the
point of this class.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.940
You should know that poles move
around when there is feedback.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.880
We'll have examples of
that in class today.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.510
You should be able to
calculate how they move around

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.770
for simple problems.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.680
You're not expected
to know the rules.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.210
OK, so you shouldn't be
surprised by the rules.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.390
If we ask you to derive one of
the rules, you probably could.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.300
But we don't expect that
you've memorized the rules.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.470
Does that sounds
roughly correct?

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.270
OK, other questions or comments?

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.460
Content, administration,
anything like that?

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.220
OK, so about a week
ago, Russ introduced

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.650
the idea of using feedback for
the purpose of controlling.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.880
And the example in lecture
was controlling a robot.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.050
You've seen that before.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.550
Right?

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.450
That's 6.01.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.730
And then in recitation
yesterday, he

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.890
ran over some more
ways of thinking

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.510
about more sophisticated ways
to do control with feedback.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.490
And the point of those
more sophisticated ways

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.140
to do control is
really performance.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.770
The idea is to
enhance performance.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.160
And that's the theme that
I want to build on today,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.440
today and on Tuesday.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.890
How do you enhance
performance by using feedback?

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.960
And we'll go through
a number of examples.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.690
You can use feedback to
increase speed and bandwidth.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.520
You can use feedback to change
the control variable from--

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.570
I'll do an example--

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.670
speed to position.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.520
You can reduce distortion,
reduce sensitivity

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.290
to parameter variation.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.180
You can stabilize
unstable systems.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.650
We'll do a bunch of examples.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.500
The point is that
you can use feedback

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.320
to accomplish a lot
of different tasks

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.550
that generally speaking
improve performance.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.504
So with that, let me
think about an op-amp.

00:03:51.504 --> 00:03:52.920
You all know about
op-amps, right?

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.620
That's also a 6.01
sort of thing.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.770
So an ideal op-amp would
have a bunch of properties

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.360
that we would like.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.890
We'd like it to have--

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.480
it we'd like it to
be very high speed.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.630
We'd like it to have a
very broad bandwidth.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.040
We'd like it to be fast.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.250
We'd like it to have a very low
output impedance so it works

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.500
like a perfect voltage source.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.900
We like it have a very
high input impedance so

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.399
that when we hook
it up to something

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.350
it doesn't change the something
that we hooked it up to.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.650
There's lots of things
we'd like it to have.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.345
Unfortunately, it's difficult
to build a circuit that

00:04:28.345 --> 00:04:29.345
has all of those things.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.340
And so here is an
example of that.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.170
Here's one of the world's most
popular op-amps, the LM741,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.260
invented eons ago
and still used today.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.000
The idea that's plotted here
is the frequency response.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.620
You remember frequency response.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.952
What's the frequency
response of an LM741?

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.720
Well, if you plot as a
function of frequency,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.280
how does the gain change?

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.250
Well, the gain is enormous.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.630
High gain, that's what
we'd like it to have.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.130
The gain is enormous
at low frequencies,

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.295
at 1 radian per second.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.550
But the gain becomes very
small out at high speeds

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.370
at the speeds we think we
think about when we're thinking

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.560
about communication systems
or when we're thinking

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.030
about computation or things.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.800
When we think about speeds
that are electronic speeds,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.260
the gain is actually
pretty small.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.670
Similarly, the phase changes.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.950
The phase of very low
frequencies is near 0.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.480
That's kind of ideal.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.990
0 would mean in phase.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.440
The output reliably tells
you what's the input doing.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.671
So that's good.

00:05:41.671 --> 00:05:43.170
But as you go to
higher frequencies,

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.090
you start to pick up
a phase delay, which

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.760
means the output is telling
you what the input did

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.800
a little while ago.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.020
OK, that's less good.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.140
So the performance in terms
of providing a lot of gain

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.790
is quite good for
some frequencies,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.810
but not for others.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.250
Unfortunately, the range
where it's not very good

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.947
is most of the range.

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:06.780
So if you thought about
an op-amp doing even

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.130
a very low frequency problem,
like audio signal processing,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.260
most of the frequencies that
are of interest to audio

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.710
are in the region where the
op-amp is not working too well.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.820
We hear sounds from about 20
Hertz to about 20 kilohertz.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.220
And that range is
indicated by the red arrow.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.470
And you can see that's not where
the op-amp is working ideally.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.040
Similarly, we would like
the op-amp to be fast.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.660
Fast is indicated
here by thinking

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.600
about the step response.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.950
So if you thought about having
an ideal step at the input,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.030
what would the output look like?

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.790
Well, we'd like it
to be an ideal step,

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.590
but it generally isn't.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.300
Generally, there's some lag.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.980
That's associated
with that phase delay

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.511
that I talked about.

00:06:55.511 --> 00:06:57.010
And in fact, what
I'd like you to do

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.384
is figure out exactly how it's
associated with that phase

00:06:59.384 --> 00:07:01.390
delay.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.630
Think about-- so figure
out-- it will turn out

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.150
that the step response
can be characterized

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.580
by a time constant tau.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.960
The time constant tau is the
time required for the signal

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.530
to get within 1 over e of
this final value determined

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.460
from this.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.920
I've already told you the
performance parameters

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.630
in terms of frequency.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.060
You should be able to
use 6.003 to figure out

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.660
what that implies about time.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.010
So look at your neighbor--

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.640
OK, look, look, look.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.920
And now, figure
out which answer--

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.380
what's tau for the 741 op-amp?

00:07:47.853 --> 00:07:49.841
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.230
OK, it's dead quiet.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.180
So I assume that
means convergence.

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:50.870
So what's the answer?

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.490
What's the time
constant tau of the 741?

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.309
Raise your hand with a
number between 1 and 5.

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:00.350
Don't look at other people,
just raise your hand.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.580
OK, I can see a couple
of answers I don't like.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.022
How do I think about
converting this representation

00:09:13.022 --> 00:09:13.980
to that representation?

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.938
What should I do first?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.711
Shout.

00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:22.210
I start with the
thing on the right.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.126
What should I do next?

00:09:23.126 --> 00:09:26.651
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] of like
doing a 2 over tau or something

00:09:26.651 --> 00:09:27.150
like that?

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.280
DENNIS FREEMAN: So we're
looking for something like e

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.449
to the minus t over tau.

00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:29.990
That's right.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.670
We're looking for
something like that.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.036
How do I get that starting
with the thing on the right?

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.030
AUDIENCE: It's like using poles.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.830
DENNIS FREEMAN: Poles,
what a good idea.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.440
How do I figure out poles
from the thing on the right?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.640
6.003, poles, that
should be like hard wire.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.480
Right?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.850
So when you hear the word 003,
you should think the word pole.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.320
How do you associate a pole?

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.930
Can somebody tell me what the
poles of the right-hand system

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.770
should look like?

00:10:03.554 --> 00:10:04.721
AUDIENCE: Where the line is.

00:10:04.721 --> 00:10:07.262
DENNIS FREEMAN: Where the line
is-- there's a couple of lines

00:10:07.262 --> 00:10:07.804
there.

00:10:07.804 --> 00:10:08.970
AUDIENCE: The vertical line.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.450
DENNIS FREEMAN:
The vertical line--

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.797
how many poles are on the right?

00:10:11.797 --> 00:10:13.630
How many poles are in
the system represented

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.671
by the right-hand figure?

00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:15.430
AUDIENCE: One.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.700
DENNIS FREEMAN: One.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.325
How many zeros?

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.260
Zero, wonderful.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.010
So we have to think about
a pole, just one pole.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.360
So we think about the s-plane.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.680
Right?

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.480
Where's the pole?

00:10:34.677 --> 00:10:35.510
You already told me.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.797
AUDIENCE: 80 halves,
so it was 40.

00:10:37.797 --> 00:10:38.630
DENNIS FREEMAN: 40--

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.990
OK, where's 40 over here?

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.570
Somewhere in there.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.070
Got it.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.240
Where's the pole over here?

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.270
It's at location 40.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.600
That's actually
correct, well, sort of.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.360
Negative 40, that's
exactly correct.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.460
So negative 40, so the
pole is right here.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.450
OK, so the pole is at minus
40 radians per second.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.380
How do you know that?

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.830
Well, that's that Bode stuff
we talked about last time.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:16.760
Right?

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.100
So if the pole were here, you
would think about a vector.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.500
So this is the j omega axis.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.657
Right?

00:11:22.657 --> 00:11:24.740
You would think about a
vector connecting the pole

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.440
to some location on
the j omega axis.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.395
If the location is omega small,
it's going to have some--

00:11:32.395 --> 00:11:34.520
that vector is going to
have some length like that.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.070
It's going to have
an angle of 0.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.910
And as frequency
goes up, the vector

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:47.060
gets longer, which means that
the magnitude gets smaller

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.920
because poles and bottom.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.000
Right?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.712
And the phase goes
increasingly toward pi over 2.

00:11:55.712 --> 00:11:56.670
But it's in the bottom.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.940
So it's minus pi over 2.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.860
Right, so the frequency at
which you get to pi over 4--

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.870
OK, 0pi over 2-- the frequency
at which you get to pi over 4

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.410
is--

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.230
so pi over 4 is here.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.560
Right?

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.970
So the distance here,
the critical frequency,

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.810
the frequency at which the phase
is pi over 4, minus pi over 4,

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.766
is going to be the same as
the frequency of the pole.

00:12:26.766 --> 00:12:28.390
So that's how we know
it's at minus 40.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.770
Right?

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.285
So we know that this then
is a characterization

00:12:34.285 --> 00:12:34.910
of that system.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.060
It's not quite done.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:42.170
So what's the h of
s for this system?

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.050
If I've got a pole at minus
40, what's h of s look like?

00:12:50.385 --> 00:12:52.325
Shout, shout.

00:12:52.325 --> 00:12:56.992
These answers coming up,
this is perfect practice.

00:12:56.992 --> 00:12:58.974
AUDIENCE: I've already
talked too much.

00:12:58.974 --> 00:13:00.640
DENNIS FREEMAN: What's
h of s look like?

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.600
AUDIENCE: Is this
something over s plus 40.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.810
DENNIS FREEMAN: Exactly,
something over s plus 40.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.476
What would you like
the something to be?

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.430
We'd like it to be some k.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.250
We'd actually like it to
be related, for example,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.320
to the open-loop gain.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.280
How big is the gain when
frequencies go towards 0?

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.500
What's the gain at 0?

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.690
Let's say the gain of 0--
let's define the gain of 0, k0,

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:36.070
let's define the
gain at 0 to be--

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.420
so what is the gain at 0?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.800
10 to the 5, 2
times 10 to the 5.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.300
Right?

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.540
It's a little bit above
the 10 to the 5 line.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.640
OK, so now if I define
k0 to be that gain at 0,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.050
what's the numerator over here?

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.190
If the numerator
over here were 1,

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:07.420
what would be the
low-frequency gain?

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.180
1 over 40, right?

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.160
To think about frequency,
we think about 1

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.720
over j omega plus 40.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.220
Right?

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:18.280
You substitute s equals j
omega to think about frequency.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.880
And if omega is very
small, you get 1 over 40.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.690
Right?

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.495
So if you wanted that to be
1, you'd have to make it 40.

00:14:28.932 --> 00:14:30.140
But we don't want it to be 1.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:30.980
We want it to k0.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.500
So you'd want it to be 40 k0.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.240
Or to be a little
bit more general,

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.340
we'd like this to be of
the form alpha k0 divided

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.650
by s plus alpha.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.850
Right?

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.220
So now, we've got the
Laplace transform.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.720
We can figure out
the time response.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.178
What's the time
response associated

00:14:51.178 --> 00:14:52.530
with that Laplace transform?

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.240
You remember the impulse
response of a system

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.640
is related to the system
function via the Laplace

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.210
transform.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.091
Right?

00:15:03.091 --> 00:15:05.090
So all we need to do is
take the inverse Laplace

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.410
transform of that thing.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.450
And we get h of t.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.350
So what's h of t?

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.020
OK, it's such a strain,
all those weeks ago.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.230
e to the minus t, e to
the minus something t.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.680
So we need something
like e to the minus what?

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.395
Alpha.

00:15:33.395 --> 00:15:35.140
e to the M alpha t u of t.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.952
And there's going to be that--

00:15:40.952 --> 00:15:42.660
that thing is going
to come out here too.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.951
And it's going to be like that.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.300
And then if you wanted
to find the step response

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.050
what would you do?

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.820
h of t is the impulse response.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.950
How would you find
the step response?

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:07.634
A step is related to the
impulse by integrating.

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.800
The step response is related
to the impulse response

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.630
by, surprisingly, integrating.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.481
So you would
integrate that thing,

00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:15.980
and you would end
up with something.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.480
Right?

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.540
So you would get
something like k0 1 minus

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.240
e to the minus alpha t u
of t, something like that.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.450
I think that's right.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.675
OK, the time constant
is given by alpha.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.840
Right?

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.580
So what is the
time constant now?

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.190
1 over 40, right?

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.410
So it's alpha t.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.170
But the time constant
is t over tau.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.520
So the time constant is
the inverse of frequency.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.090
Right?

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.290
Frequency is per second.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.040
Time constant is seconds.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.900
They're reciprocals
of each other.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.630
OK, so the idea then is that we
can associate a time response

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.410
with that.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.730
And that time response
is pretty slow.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.250
A 40th of a second, 40
things per second kind of.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.839
That's my speed.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.520
Right, that's not
computation speed.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.540
Right?

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.910
So that's pretty slow.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.500
So we'd like to improve that.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.531
And one way that
we can improve it

00:17:20.531 --> 00:17:21.780
is by thinking about feedback.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.807
So the idea would be we
don't use the op-amp just out

00:17:27.807 --> 00:17:29.140
of the package the way it comes.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.348
We put it in a feedback loop.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.980
So for example, here
you could put it

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.870
into a non-inverting
amplifier where

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:43.740
you take the output divided
by a voltage divider

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.260
and feed that back in.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.590
In 6.003, the way
we'll think about that

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.840
is that the effectiveness
plus and minus

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.330
input is to take the
difference between two signals.

00:17:56.697 --> 00:17:58.530
Right, we're going to
take a circuit diagram

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:08.621
and turn it into a integrator,
gain-adder diagram, a block

00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:09.120
diagram.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.290
We're going to take
a circuit and turn it

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.700
into a block diagram.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.890
So the way we think about
the plus and minus input

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.040
of the op-amp is
as a subtractor.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:23.670
And then this k of s that
characterized-- so this thing,

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:29.280
right, this thing here, we
plug-in there just as a box.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.730
And the effect of the resistors
is to divide the output signal

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.680
by some constant beta.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.930
So we can reduce the circuit
to a 6.003 equivalent.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.430
And then we can use
Black's equation

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.900
and all those other things
that we do in 6.003.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.760
So we can write an expression
for the closed-loop system

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.800
the looks like k of s
over 1 plus beta k of s.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.480
Make sense?

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.160
So then, as we've already
seen, the op-amp by itself

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.680
looks like a pole at minus 40.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.520
So we can substitute
this expression

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.760
into that expression
for the closed loop.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.530
And we get a new closed loop.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:17.030
So h of s, which had been alpha
k0 over s plus alpha becomes--

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:29.740
the new value is alpha k0 over
s plus alpha plus alpha beta k0.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.130
OK, so the point is that
we can think about the way

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.000
the feedback changes
the system function

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.060
by just formulating what's
the circuit look like in terms

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.610
of a 6.003 block diagram.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:50.250
So now, the effect of that, it
looks as though what happens

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:55.020
is the pole went
from here to here.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.740
How big of a change is that?

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.850
What's the biggest change in the
position of the pole that you

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.590
can achieve using feedback?

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.568
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] distance.

00:20:26.568 --> 00:20:27.721
DENNIS FREEMAN: I'm sorry.

00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:30.012
AUDIENCE: [? Is ?] [? beta
?] the [INAUDIBLE] distance.

00:20:30.012 --> 00:20:31.992
Or where are they located?

00:20:31.992 --> 00:20:34.200
DENNIS FREEMAN: I want a
factor by which you multiply

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.480
alpha to find the
biggest place that you

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.840
could have put the new pole.

00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:46.680
I didn't say that right.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.679
I didn't say that right.

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:49.630
I want to know where
is the new pole.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.780
Sorry, I confused myself.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.220
Where is the new pole?

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.200
How left can you put the new--

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.310
how left can you get
the new pole to be?

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.210
What's the furtherest--
left is good, right?

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.180
Left is good.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.880
Everybody knows that, right?

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.860
So right is bad.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.580
So small distances
in the s-plane

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.750
correspond to slow responses.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.180
Big distances correspond
to fast responses.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.630
That's what we saw in part one.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.154
So we're trying to push the
pole that way as far as we can.

00:21:23.154 --> 00:21:24.320
How far can we get it to go?

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.460
OK, everybody raise your hands.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.650
The answer is-- and again,
I see lots of answers

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.430
that I don't quite like.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.210
With a minor perturbation, all
those people who I don't like

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:41.910
can become right by saying--

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.580
so a lot of people have said
this, which I don't quite like.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.640
What's the biggest distance
that I can move it?

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.130
OK, new vote--

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.750
I didn't like tw0.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.060
And so therefore, I will
change my answer to four.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.810
Wrong, no.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.440
How big can beta be?

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.290
How big can beta be?

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.230
What's the biggest
possible value of beta?

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:20.549
One.

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:22.090
So how far can I
push it to the left?

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.670
So I can push it this far.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:29.470
Right?

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.170
So if I make beta 1,
that's as far as it goes.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.550
Beta 0 is kind of the
rightmost position.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.260
Beta 1 is the leftmost position.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.730
I can get it that high.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:38.810
But that's very good.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:39.740
Right?

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.250
1 plus k0-- k0 is a
number like 10 to the 5th.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.730
So I can get at like 10 to
the 5th bigger than it was.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.050
That's enormous.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.100
That means that I can stretch
the frequency response.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.530
If the pole is the thing
that determines the frequency

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.600
response by that
construction up there,

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.190
I can stretch the frequency
response by 10 to the 5th.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.550
That's huge.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.550
Pure win, right?

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.737
Well, that doesn't sound right.

00:23:06.737 --> 00:23:09.070
So I've stretched the region
where the gain is constant.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.720
I've stretched the region
where the phase is close to 0.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.650
It's a 100% win except
that I've cheated

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:20.330
when I drew the plot because I
normalized it by the DC gain.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.280
DC, I probably didn't
define that yet.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.855
DC is direct current.

00:23:23.855 --> 00:23:26.570
It has nothing to do
with current or direct.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.760
DC means zero frequency.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.770
I have no idea why we insist
on using that word, but we do.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.740
DC means zero frequency.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.930
OK, so you just do that
automatic mapping in your head.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.464
Every time I say DC,
I mean zero frequency.

00:23:42.464 --> 00:23:43.880
Everybody else
talks that way too.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:49.250
So the DC gain, I've divided
the magnitude by the DC gain,

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.960
h of j0.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.800
So this is the relative
frequency magnitude,

00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:02.160
h of j omega, divided by the
magnitude at omega equals 0.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.810
Had I not done that, the picture
would have looked different.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.460
If you think about
what happens--

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.500
so the top curve here shows
what happens when the--

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:18.970
shows the response curve for
a 741 op-amp with no feedback.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.591
It has a pole at 40.

00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:25.320
It has a pole at minus 40
to be a little more correct.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.600
So there's a single
pole at minus 40.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.980
That corresponds to beta 0.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.000
That's open loop, no feedback.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.920
OK, and what you can
see is the DC gain

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.700
is 2 times 10 to the 5th.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.160
And there's an AC gain defined
by the cutoff frequency.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.920
If you compare this expression
and that expression,

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.830
the interesting
thing that happens

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:54.580
is that the DC response
depends critically on beta.

00:24:57.554 --> 00:25:03.020
But the high-frequency asymptote
doesn't depend on beta at all.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:08.190
The high-frequency asymptote
of this is alpha k0 over s.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.850
The high-frequency asymptote
of this is alpha k0 over s.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.040
They're the same
high-frequency asymptote.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.430
What happened was that as
I increased the feedback,

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.800
I lopped off the
low-frequency gain,

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.500
which had the effect of
making the frequency look

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.850
like it got very big.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:28.360
So pure win?

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.030
No.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.050
Almost pure win?

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.030
Yes.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:37.130
OK, I've traded-- the trick is
I've traded gain for bandwidth.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.990
That's important
because the folks

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.550
who know how to
microfabricate things

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:45.060
know how to make things
with very high gain.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.910
Making things that
are fast is harder.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.890
This is a way that
we can take advantage

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.820
of the relative simplicity of
making things with high gain

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.870
to make them behave as
though they're fast.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.590
OK, you can see the
same thing if you think

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.860
about the response in time.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.540
If you think about
the response in time,

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.349
we're going to go from e
to the minus alpha t to--

00:26:10.349 --> 00:26:11.640
I guess I didn't write it down.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.264
It's going to be e
to the minus alpha 1

00:26:13.264 --> 00:26:18.620
plus alpha beta
k0 t, same factor.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.250
It's going to get 10 to
the 5th times faster.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.070
Again, it looks like pure win.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.320
But that's because I've
cheated because I'm

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.360
plotting via this
normalized final value that

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.440
depends on beta.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.520
If beta were 0, the final
value is 2 times 10 the 5th.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.240
If beta is anything else,
the final value is smaller.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.970
If I plot it not
normalized, you get

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.930
a kind of different picture.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:53.200
So if you were to use
the op-amp open loop,

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.600
the response has a time
constant of 1 over 40,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.260
as we said before.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:04.930
If you include feedback, it
decreases the final value,

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:10.660
but has the property that it
does not change this slope.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.760
So if you think about this,
this is an analytic expression

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.320
for the closed-loop
step response.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.776
I get that by integrating
one of these expressions.

00:27:22.776 --> 00:27:24.150
I didn't write
the beta one down.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.810
I need the beta
equivalent one of these.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.310
If you right the
beta equivalent one

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:34.060
of these, which is on a previous
slide, and integrate it, you

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.720
you get this expression.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.070
And the if you differentiate
this expression with regard

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.920
to time to find the
slope, the slope at 0

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:50.260
is unchanged by beta because the
exponent here, 1 plus beta k0,

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.550
has the same form as
the denominator here.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.540
So when you differentiate
it, this comes down.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.307
The two cancel.

00:27:55.307 --> 00:27:57.640
And you end up with a slope
that is independent of beta.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.550
The effect of that is that if
you change the final value,

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.110
it appears to go much faster.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.750
So pure win?

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.250
No.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:05.950
Apparent win?

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.300
Yes.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.630
We've traded gain for speed.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:15.550
OK, so that's ways that
we can use feedback

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.930
to improve the
performance of an op-amp.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.010
OK, the big
performance parameters

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:25.220
that I talked about today
were bandwidth and speed.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.170
You could do the
same kind of analysis

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.000
with many different
kinds of metrics

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.430
for op-amps like output
impedance, input impedance,

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:32.760
distortion reduction.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.150
We'll do distortion next time.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:40.490
| there's lots of other
things that feedback improves.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.250
I've illustrated it with two.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.000
In both of those, as will be
the case in all of the others,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.339
the effective feedback
is to trade gain

00:28:51.339 --> 00:28:52.630
for something else of interest.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.440
OK, the next example
I want to think about

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.240
is thinking about
a motor controller

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.790
where what I want
to think about is

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:10.230
changing the way we think about
the input-output relationship.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.550
So I take a motor.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.290
That's my motor.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.880
And what I want to do is
have it control position.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.310
So it's not too easy to
see probably because it's

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.720
such a tiny little motor.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.345
Actually, it's not
a tiny little motor.

00:29:23.345 --> 00:29:25.980
It's an enormous motor.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.600
So the red bar,
that's the shaft.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.600
Right?

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.890
And so the first question I
want to think about is what's

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.395
the relationship for the motor?

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.400
What's the relationship
for the motor

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:47.568
for the transformation from
voltage to angle of the shaft?

00:29:47.568 --> 00:29:49.526
So what's the relation
between v of t and theta

00:29:49.526 --> 00:29:52.340
of t for DC motor?

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.440
This is very much
the same problem

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.790
you worked in in the
head-turning problem in 6.01.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:01.460
So you should be able to
remember this answer from 6.01.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.680
What's the relationship
between the voltage into a DC

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.540
motor and the angle out?

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:10.764
Is it one, two, three,
four, or none of the above?

00:30:10.764 --> 00:30:11.680
Talk to your neighbor.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.846
Figure out the right answer.

00:30:15.923 --> 00:30:17.919
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:31:18.232 --> 00:31:20.440
So what's the answer-- one,
two, three, four, or none

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.040
of the above?

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.080
Everybody votes.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.120
You're on such a streak.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.690
More than half the answers,
I really don't like.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.730
OK, so we'll do a demo,
and we'll figure out.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.370
So the question is,
what is the relationship

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.680
between voltage and speed?

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.240
So I've got a
motor, and I've got

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.237
a knob that controls the
voltage that goes to the motor.

00:31:44.237 --> 00:31:46.070
OK, so now, I turn the
motor on, and nothing

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:50.390
happens because I preset
the voltage to be 0.

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:52.610
Now, I turn the
voltage to the right

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.800
to make the voltage
a bit positive,

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:08.930
more positive, back towards 0,
at 0, negative, more negative.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:15.444
OK, so what's the relationship
between voltage and angle?

00:32:15.444 --> 00:32:18.250
AUDIENCE: Is that
velocity or voltage?

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.350
DENNIS FREEMAN: v
is voltage, sorry.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:21.360
v is voltage.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.660
Theta is angle.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.220
So here's 0.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.590
Here's 90.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.110
Here's 0, pi over 2, pi.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.904
Right?

00:32:30.904 --> 00:32:32.570
The question is,
what's the relationship

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.287
between the voltage
input of the motor

00:32:34.287 --> 00:32:35.870
and the angle of the
shaft the output?

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.845
And now, the answer is--

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.415
OK, the number correct
has not changed.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.970
So tell me in words-- forget
the one, two, three, four--

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.640
what's the relationship
between voltage and angle?

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.060
What is [INAUDIBLE]
of the voltage?

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.176
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:05.176 --> 00:33:06.550
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Angular velocity.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:10.540
So how do I get
angular velocity?

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.082
AUDIENCE: [? Measure
?] of the angle.

00:33:12.082 --> 00:33:14.415
DENNIS FREEMAN: So I'm giving
you the angle, theta of t.

00:33:14.415 --> 00:33:15.740
How do I get angular velocity?

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.932
AUDIENCE: Derivative of
the angle-- the derivative.

00:33:18.932 --> 00:33:20.640
DENNIS FREEMAN: Take
the derivative, yes.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:28.287
So what I want is that theta
dot proportional to v. OK?

00:33:28.287 --> 00:33:29.870
Which of those
relationships say that?

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.790
None of them.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:36.020
OK, it was a trick
question of course.

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:40.970
So what do I want to have as
my model for the DC motor?

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:47.210
I want my model to take a
voltage in and give me theta

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.290
out.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.680
What should be in the model?

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.380
k, it's always good
to throw a k in.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.410
That always works.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:05.070
Excellent answer.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.750
k always works, sure.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.460
In any physical system,
you never get one, right?

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.135
Yeah.

00:34:10.135 --> 00:34:11.622
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:11.622 --> 00:34:14.080
DENNIS FREEMAN: You're going
to need an integrator, exactly

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:14.989
right.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.572
So it's going to
need something like I

00:34:16.572 --> 00:34:20.800
think I call it a gamma, a
being the accumulator guy.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.549
Right?

00:34:21.549 --> 00:34:24.239
A different way of
saying that would be--

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:25.719
or I write it in
terms of Laplace

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:29.130
transforms, I would
get gamma over s.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:37.710
So if I put v in, and I
want to get theta out,

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.937
right, I need to put it
through an integrator.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.949
So the idea is that if I put
a constant voltage in-- say

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:48.370
the voltage is 0--

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.000
theta was flat.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.770
But if I put a voltage
at the blue line,

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.820
theta increased at some rate.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.880
And if I changed it to
red, it increased faster

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.010
just like an
integrator would do.

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:01.380
So what I want to do is
think about the motor

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.310
being an integrator.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.570
OK, that lets me then
cast the motor, which

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:10.517
is a physical thing,
into 6.003 terms again.

00:35:10.517 --> 00:35:12.100
So now, I can think
about the problem.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.250
I'd really like it not
to be a speed controller.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.740
I'd really like it to be
a position controller.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.760
So feedback to the rescue--

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.235
what I'll do is I'll
put it in a loop.

00:35:25.235 --> 00:35:26.610
So the idea is
going to be that I

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:31.710
take my motor, which looks
like an integrator, gamma a,

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:35.550
feedback a signal that's
proportional to the angle,

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:40.290
which I derive by having
a potentiometer strapped

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.810
to the back of the shaft--

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:43.590
so there's a pot.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.886
I've taken off the little
stop so that it spins around

00:35:46.886 --> 00:35:47.760
doesn't hit the stop.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.090
Right?

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.298
Otherwise, it would be kind
of bad for the first part

00:35:50.298 --> 00:35:51.450
of the demo.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.940
So it's a surgically
altered potentiometer

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.860
that spins around forever.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.710
But over most of the range,
it's reporting angle.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.830
So that's the way I get
this feedback loop in.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.200
And then I put it
into this thing,

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.110
which is really
just a 741 wired up

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.980
like I showed in
the first example,

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.980
so that it would take the
difference between two

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:16.240
things, the desired input, which
is a potentiometer that I'm

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.509
turning here, and the
actual position, which

00:36:21.509 --> 00:36:24.050
is the potentiometer up here,
the same kind of potentiometer,

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.930
just one that I turn, the
other that the motor turns.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:29.420
And the op-amp figures
out the difference,

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.870
multiplies it by a gain, alpha,
and presents it to the motor.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.300
That's the idea.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.380
And if you just think about 003,
it's pretty easy to see that

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:43.940
you can represent this
relationship by a single pole.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.566
Right, there's some
annoying constants.

00:36:45.566 --> 00:36:47.940
Right, you have to worry about
the gain of the amplifier,

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.160
the gain of the motor,
and how much feedback.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.950
That's alpha, beta, gamma.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:55.960
But pretty much,
it's just a pole.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.890
So what happens then
as you change the gain?

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.930
Well, if the gain
is 0, the pole--

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:11.060
so if the gain, beta,
is 0, the pole is at 0.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:15.380
OK, it works just
like an integrator.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.190
That's what we said before.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.160
That's a sanity check
where you check something

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.451
you already know the answer to.

00:37:20.451 --> 00:37:21.320
Right?

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.740
So if you set beta to 0, you
get that the transformation

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.630
is an integrator, good.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.620
If you set beta and
anything else, what happens?

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.140
Well, the pole goes
screaming out that way.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:33.950
That's good, right?

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:37.250
Remember good is that way.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:38.120
Right?

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.550
That's not always true.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.080
But when you're trying to
make something work fast,

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:42.990
that's the rule.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.620
Right?

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.380
Fast is over there.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:52.769
So the idea then would be that
if I hook up this circuit--

00:37:52.769 --> 00:37:54.810
right, I take the feedback,
run it into an op-amp

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.390
and multiply it, use that
to control the motor instead

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:00.210
of my turning the
knob, then this thing

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:05.730
should have the behavior that
the pole goes from the origin

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.680
to the right.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:12.230
So the question is, if that
happened, what would happen?

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:18.040
OK, just doing the same kind of
analysis we did for the op-amp,

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.910
the step response
goes from being

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:24.510
the response of a pole, which
is an integrator, to being

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:29.890
this kind of a response,
which has a final value.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:34.180
That converts it from
being voltage to velocity

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.790
into voltage to angle.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.940
Does that make sense?

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:45.480
It used to when the feedback
was 0, the pole was at 0.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.070
So the output continuously rose.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.070
There was no
steady-state position.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:55.460
But now with feedback,
I get a step response

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.130
that has a final value.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.140
The effect of moving
the pole is the same

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.590
as the effect of
moving the pole.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.750
In the op-amp example,
I get a step response

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:10.450
that becomes
increasingly like a step.

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.840
It goes from being a
sluggish step to a fast step.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:18.520
OK, so that's the way I use
003 to use feedback to fix

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.360
the motor.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.280
And I've done that.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:26.650
So I have to move the input
to the amplifier from my pot

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:36.410
to the op-amp, which
is there hopefully.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:42.120
So now when I turn it on,
it becomes a position.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.390
OK, and I can test that
by turning the pot.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:49.200
And in fact, when I turn
the pot, the motor moves.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.380
Wonderful, voila, I won.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:50.880
Right?

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.410
Great.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.300
Yes, applause please.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:53.900
Come on.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:56.850
Exactly, exactly.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:00.000
OK, well, it's
pretty wimpy actually

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.520
because I've got this motor
that weighs about, I don't know,

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.600
three pounds.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.460
And it's exerting about a
quarter of an ounce of torque.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.399
It's not really very impressive.

00:40:10.399 --> 00:40:11.190
So how do I fix it?

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.090
What do I do?

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:17.990
How do I fix it?

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.500
I have a wimpy controller.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.030
Yes.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.863
AUDIENCE: More gain.

00:40:20.863 --> 00:40:22.870
DENNIS FREEMAN: More
gain, of course.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:26.660
So remember that response.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.020
So now, I turn off the
motor and increase the gain

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.100
by a factor of three.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:38.440
And the answer is much
better, well, maybe.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.170
So what do I do?

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.860
More gain, of course.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.060
So another factor of three--

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:51.340
much better, well, maybe.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.790
So another factor of three.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:57.970
OK, another factor of three.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.190
Hmm, another factor of three.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.920
Some of you close may hear that
there's a little buzzing sound

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.420
now.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.290
I can hear it.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:13.840
That's the op-amp
killing itself.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.580
OK, it's not working.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.420
Why is it not?

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.157
Is it working?

00:41:23.157 --> 00:41:23.990
I just gave it away.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.740
It's not working.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.480
How do I know it's not working?

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.740
Here's my theory.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.020
Here's my answer.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.840
How do they match or mismatch?

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.250
Is it an angle controller?

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.910
Yes or no?

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:36.555
Yes.

00:41:36.555 --> 00:41:37.930
AUDIENCE: Didn't
we just do this?

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:40.130
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yeah,
it's an angle controller.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.030
What's different about this
behavior and that behavior?

00:41:47.258 --> 00:41:48.540
AUDIENCE: There's oscillation.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.040
DENNIS FREEMAN:
There's oscillation.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.360
Right, this thing,
turn it back on.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.580
Let the thing kill itself.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.280
There's an oscillation.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.646
Turn the gain down so it doesn't
kill itself quite as quickly.

00:41:59.646 --> 00:42:02.570
It's oscillating.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.710
Watch the oscillation.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:09.190
Think about characterizing
the oscillation.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.950
Make the gain smaller.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:12.450
That's bad.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.080
Ignore that.

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:23.765
Think about the oscillation.

00:42:23.765 --> 00:42:25.770
It's still oscillating.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:31.322
Factor of three smaller,
it's still oscillating.

00:42:31.322 --> 00:42:32.280
That doesn't oscillate.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:32.821
What's wrong?

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.490
OK, so the $64,000 question,
what did I do wrong?

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.530
Right, the goal is to
make a model of the motor,

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.810
analyze the model, figure out
how to put feedback around it,

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:44.476
make it perfect.

00:42:44.476 --> 00:42:45.282
Yes.

00:42:45.282 --> 00:42:46.782
AUDIENCE: The model
on the board was

00:42:46.782 --> 00:42:48.275
created without any inertia.

00:42:48.275 --> 00:42:49.650
DENNIS FREEMAN:
I made too simple

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.510
of a model for the motor.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.280
I ignored inertia.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.880
I ignored all manner of things.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.470
I ignored friction.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:03.300
So how can you tell that
I ignored those things?

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.980
So one way you can tell--

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.240
let's see.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.350
Is it off or on?

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:07.850
It's on.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.390
Or turn it off.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:11.310
Go back to the
original configuration

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:14.320
where it's a speed controller.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.030
Turn the speed on a little bit.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:19.470
Turn it off.

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.020
Grab it with my fingers.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.190
Turn it on.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.950
Now, release it.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.338
What did you see?

00:43:29.338 --> 00:43:30.620
Grab it with my fingers.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.130
Turn it on.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:32.630
Let go.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.410
We're trying to
poke a hole in this.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:41.700
There is my model.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.130
My model is wrong.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:47.250
I claim I just told you the
key experiment for figuring out

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:48.360
why my model is wrong.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.030
Now you have to figure out how
to interpret that experiment.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:59.580
So what does my theory say would
happen if I turn on the power,

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.970
hold the bar, and release it?

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.642
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:07.642 --> 00:44:09.100
DENNIS FREEMAN: It
should instantly

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.500
reach the terminal velocity.

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.607
What's it doing?

00:44:12.607 --> 00:44:14.690
AUDIENCE: I has just like
a rise time [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.730
DENNIS FREEMAN: It's ramping up.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:19.510
That's what's wrong
with my model.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.950
OK, so the model is too simple.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.650
It's not just an integrator.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:27.150
It's a slow integrator.

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:30.210
OK, I can model that too.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:34.530
If I model the
slow integration, I

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:36.660
can think about the
motor doesn't really

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:37.980
behave like an integrator.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:43.330
It works like a
sluggish integrator.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:46.520
That might be a lot easier
to see if I write that in s.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:55.140
So that's the same as
gamma p over s plus gamma.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:58.790
No, s times-- no, close, wrong.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.290
So it used to be gamma over s.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.420
Now, it's gamma over s s plus p.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:18.960
OK, so I'm replacing what
had been an integrator here

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.540
with a sluggish integrator.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.640
Sluggish is another pole.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.230
So instead of representing it
by a single pole at the origin,

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:31.910
I represent it by two poles.

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:35.510
If you calculate
the step response

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:38.057
for the single
pole at the origin,

00:45:38.057 --> 00:45:39.140
you get the straight line.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.800
That was model one.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.140
If you calculate the step
response for the modified

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.420
model, that's this one.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.280
Ultimately, they
become parallel.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.760
So the speed becomes the same.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.830
But there's sluggishness
because of inertia

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:00.580
and so forth so that it takes
a while for the real motor

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:01.610
to achieve that.

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:06.940
So you can see that in the model
two response, because the angle

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:12.030
does not immediately
change when I let go of it,

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.950
it takes a while for
it to start to change.

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:15.910
That's inertia.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:25.000
So if I put that model, model
two, into the feedback loop,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.760
then I make a different
prediction about the way things

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.400
should work.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.790
That prediction is shown here.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:32.290
Right?

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:35.020
That's just thinking
about system functions,

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.189
saying that I've got two
poles, trying to figure out

00:46:38.189 --> 00:46:40.480
where the poles are, figuring
out where the time domain

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.979
response is, integrating it to
turn it into a step response.

00:46:42.979 --> 00:46:47.860
Do all those things,
and you get a response.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.820
The point is that the new
model looks like two poles.

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.810
And when you analyze
the root locus,

00:46:55.810 --> 00:47:00.870
those poles move when
you change the feedback.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:04.490
So as I change the feedback
number, beta, as beta

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:08.150
goes from 0 to big, the
poles go toward each other

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:10.490
and then split off.

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:12.620
That's just math.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.870
That's the math that
was showed over here.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:19.640
All I did was write the
second model up there,

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.690
figure out the system function,
find the poles of the system

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:25.440
function.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.125
They depend on beta.

00:47:27.125 --> 00:47:29.530
And that dependence
is shown here.

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:32.070
And so the response
then, that's where

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:33.570
the oscillations come from.

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:36.930
If the gain is big
enough, I get a pair

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:40.810
of poles that are
off the real axis.

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:43.900
The fact that they have an
imaginary component, the poles,

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.880
means that there's
an oscillation.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.870
And what happens is I
change the feedback is not

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.890
that the oscillation goes away.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:57.160
In fact, the real part of
the envelope doesn't change.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.200
That's roughly what
I was seeing here.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.750
If you watched what was
going on in the closed-loop

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:06.230
configuration, it always
oscillated for a couple

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.890
of seconds--

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:09.680
like a second or two
seconds or three seconds.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.290
That second or two
seconds didn't change.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.540
What did change was the bumps--

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.910
how many bumps there
were in the two seconds.

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:20.090
And that's what the theory says.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:25.910
Because the real part of
the imaginary pair of poles

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:29.190
doesn't change, the
envelope doesn't change.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.760
But because the imaginary
part does change,

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.740
the oscillation
frequency does change.

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.280
So the result then is something
whose envelope doesn't really

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:38.780
improve.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:45.410
So that model then to
a large extent does

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:48.720
predict the behavior
that I have measured.

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.810
And then what that
motivates is if I

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:53.120
want to make the
motor work better,

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:57.440
I need some even
better controller

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.960
because my simple proportional
controller, that's

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.500
as good as it's going to do.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:07.420
OK, so what I tried
to illustrate today

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.190
was ways of thinking
about feedback

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.020
to enhance performance.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.550
We looked at an
op-amp and saw how

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:15.040
you could think about feedback
increasing the bandwidth

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.720
or making it faster.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.220
We looked at a
motor and found out

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.511
how you could think about
changing the motor from being

00:49:20.511 --> 00:49:24.616
a voltage-controlled velocity to
a voltage-controlled position.

00:49:24.616 --> 00:49:25.990
And we saw how
the feedback could

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:27.400
be used for both of those.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.300
Next time, we'll look at
a couple other examples.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.850
Thanks.
