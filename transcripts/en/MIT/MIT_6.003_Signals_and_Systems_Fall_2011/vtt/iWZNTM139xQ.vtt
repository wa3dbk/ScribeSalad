DENNIS FREEMAN: So for
the last couple of times,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.740
we've been looking
at Fourier series

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.190
as a way of looking at signals
as a way of being composed out

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.140
of sinusoids, much the
way we had previously

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.990
looked at frequency responses as
a way of thinking about systems

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.970
characterized by sinusoids.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.600
And for the past two sessions,
we've looked at Fourier series

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.220
not because they
were terribly useful,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.170
but because they
were terribly simple.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.770
Today, I want to do the
much more difficult task,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.810
but much more interesting
task of thinking

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.180
about the general
case for thinking

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.560
about a sinusoidal decomposition
of an arbitrary signal, one

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.870
that is not
necessarily periodic.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.180
So I should say
upfront, what I'm going

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.790
to talk about is motivational.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.990
It's not a proof.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.450
Proving Fourier
series convergence

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.247
is actually very complicated.

00:01:11.247 --> 00:01:13.080
It's something that
mathematicians worked on

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.950
for about 100 years.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.730
So I am not going to
try to prove things

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.200
in any rigorous
fashion, but I am

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.290
going to try to
motivate things so

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.400
that you should at least expect
that such a thing should exist.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.580
So the idea, the
motivation is going to be

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.810
how can I think about
an aperiodic signal

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.030
within a periodic framework
because I already have

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.400
worked out all the details.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.090
The details for Fourier series
are relatively simple, well,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.700
at least compared to a Fourier
transform, which is harder.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.370
Fourier series themselves
are not that easy.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.820
But if I believe the
Fourier series idea,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.710
is there a way to
leverage that to think

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.300
about aperiodic signals?

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.840
And the idea is going to be
let's take an aperiodic signal.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.130
I've tried to choose
something terribly simple.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.230
It's the simplest thing that I
could think of it isn't zero.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.600
So it's one for a while
and zero most of the time.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.110
But I could make
that signal, which

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.950
is clearly not periodic, by
thinking about periodically

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.330
extending it.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.170
Copy it.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.800
Add it to itself
many times, each time

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.720
shifted by a capital T.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.770
This signal is
obviously periodic.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.640
This transformation
is obviously going

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.130
to take any signal
regardless and turn it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.550
into something that
is periodic in cap T.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.270
So if I did that, then I
could kind of trivially say,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.950
well, the aperiodic
thing is just

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.790
the limit when capital T goes to
infinity of the periodic thing.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.560
OK, that's pretty trivial.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.080
OK, that's obviously true.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.000
The trick is, what if I took a
Fourier series in the middle?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.760
What if I periodically
extended this thing

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.770
to get something
that is periodic,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.567
take a Fourier
series of this thing,

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:00.150
and then take the
limit of the series?

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.270
So that's the thing I'm going to
do over the next three slides.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.770
So think about a general,
aperiodic signal, periodically

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.605
extended so it's now periodic in
cap T, take a Fourier series--

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.090
just to motivate the kind
of math that happens,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.020
I've written out the math for
this particularly simple signal

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.416
that is one for a while
and zero most of the time.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:31.190
The Fourier series
coefficient, a sub k

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.227
is obviously 1
over t, the period,

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:35.310
integral over the period--

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.590
I took the symmetric period
because it's the easiest one--

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.965
signal of interest, basis
function integrated over time.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.140
And that's pretty trivially--

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.310
those integrals are easy.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.750
That was chosen that way.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.050
And so I get an answer
that looks like that.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.170
The thing I want you
to see about the answer

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.760
is that I can think about it
as a function of omega or k.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.610
And that's what
I've plotted here.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.630
In particular, if I multiply
a sub k by capital T,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.720
so as to kill this
1 over t thing,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:19.750
and if I plot t times a sub k, I
get a relationship 2 sine omega

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.790
S over omega, omega
being k 2pi over t.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.830
But for the Fourier series, that
only exists for k and integer.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.800
So that's what's represented
by the blue bars.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.670
But what I want you to
see is just from the math,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.250
the envelope
doesn't depend on t.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.880
OK, that's the trick.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.750
So the idea is I'm plotting
the Fourier coefficients a sub

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.570
k as a function of k.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.990
So k equals 0, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, et cetera.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.050
But I notice that the envelope
can be written strictly

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.320
as a function of omega where
there is a simple relationship

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.880
between omega and k.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.760
But omega is defined
across the entire axis,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.640
and it's represented by
this light black curve.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.990
That's more apparent if I
think about increasing capital

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.300
T. What if I were to keep
the base waveform the same,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.000
but change capital T?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.850
Say I double capital T.
The thing that happens

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.930
is the envelope stays
the same, but the spacing

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.740
of the k's becomes condensed.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.140
There's more k's in a
given number of hertzes,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.100
in frequency, than
there was before.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.890
And if I double it
again, it doubles again.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.480
The envelope didn't change.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.220
The k's did.

00:05:50.706 --> 00:05:52.580
The interesting thing
about that construction

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.330
is that it has separated out the
part that depends on capital T

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.180
from the part that doesn't
depend on capital T. Capital

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.390
T was this arbitrary
thing that I

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.640
used to take an aperiodic
signal and turn it

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.260
into a periodic signal.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.900
And it has an
effect on the answer

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.420
that can be separated from
the other part of the answer.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.070
Some part of the answer
depends on the base waveform.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.510
Some other part of the answer
depends on capital T. Well,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.000
that's nice because now if I
think about taking the limit

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.060
as capital T goes to infinity,
I have a prayer of interpreting

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.540
things because part of my answer
is changing with t and part

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.470
of it isn't.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.590
So all I need to do now is focus
on the part that is changing

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.420
with t and separate it
from the part that's

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.160
not changing with t.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.100
So now, I can think
about taking--

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.390
so I just plug in
this expression

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.950
here for this integral.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.960
And what I get then
is something that

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:00.180
looks a lot like a
Fourier series or even

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.820
a Laplace transform.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.570
I get an integral-- ignore
the limit part for a moment.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.030
I get an integral
of something times

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.000
some sort of a
weighting function.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.760
And I get something over
here where the integral

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.980
was over time, but
the function over here

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.690
doesn't have time in it.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.000
It only has omega in it.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.500
That's the sense
in which it sort of

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:30.100
looks like the analysis
formula for either Fourier

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.984
series or Laplace transforms.

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.400
It looks like the
analysis formula

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:40.020
because I'm calculating a T ak,
the components of the series,

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.530
or this new thing, E of
omega, that doesn't depend--

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.180
neither of those depended on t.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.340
OK, so the idea
is that when I do

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.200
this kind of a
limiting operation

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.750
on the periodic
extension, I get something

00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:01.590
that ends up looking like
a transform relationship.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.990
And if I think about
going the other way,

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.450
doing a synthesis
operation, I can

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.010
think about how
I would construct

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.077
x of t out of the
Fourier coefficients

00:08:11.077 --> 00:08:12.660
But now, there's a
simple relationship

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.630
between the Fourier
series coefficients,

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:24.230
a sub k, and this thing Ew,
which I've represented here.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.320
And I don't like the t.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.620
So I'll do a
substitution from here.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.740
t can be written as
omega 0 over 2pi.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.690
1 over t can be written
as omega 0 ever 2pi.

00:08:37.872 --> 00:08:39.330
And now, I've got
everything I need

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:44.760
to think about how that
sum approaches an integral

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.070
in a Riemann sum kind of sense.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.770
Think about as I
add more and more--

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.920
as I make capital T
get bigger and bigger,

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.630
omega 0 gets
smaller and smaller.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.020
As I make the capital
T bigger and bigger,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.720
the spacing gets
smaller and smaller.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.640
Increasingly, I can think
about this function E of omega

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.630
as being smooth and
increasingly constant

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.360
over the small interval
between the bars.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.820
So I can think about the
sum as a Riemann sum passed

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.970
to the integral as the limit.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.590
So when I do that,
omega 0 is the spacing

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.705
between the two adjacents.

00:09:29.705 --> 00:09:31.080
It's the region
over which I want

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.730
to think about that
integrand being constant.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:41.730
And so that in the limit, this
omega 0 passes to d omega.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.760
And I'm left with something
that looks like a synthesis

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.190
equation.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.410
So if I just write those
equations here and think

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.800
about this Ew thing being some
kind of a transform, which I'll

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.000
mysteriously write
as x of j omega,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.430
then the result for
the aperiodic case

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.250
has a structure that looks very
much like the Fourier series,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.140
or for that matter like
the Laplace transform.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:16.460
What it says is that I can
synthesize an arbitrary x of t

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.970
by adding together a
whole bunch of components

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:25.250
that already depend on omega
weighted by some weighting

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.750
function.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.910
s this looks like a
synthesis equation

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.160
very much like the synthesis
equation for Fourier series

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.700
or for Laplace transforms.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.900
And I get an analysis
equation that similarly

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.410
has the same form again.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.430
I take the x of t and
figure out the component

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.450
that should be at
omega by multiplying

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.980
by a complex exponential
and integrating.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.270
OK, I have to emphasize
this is not a proof.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.040
All I wanted to do
was kind of motivate

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.100
the way you can think
about an aperiodic signal

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.620
as being periodic in
some time interval

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.240
and passed to the limit.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.890
And if you do that,
you can sort of

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.900
see where the equations
are coming from.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.540
OK?

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.821
So the idea then--

00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:14.320
whoops.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.570
So the idea then
is that we will use

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.410
these relationships to define
an analysis and synthesis

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.810
of aperiodic signals.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.960
And we'll refer to that
as a Fourier transform.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.540
The Fourier
transform will let us

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.690
have insights that
are completely

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.030
analogous to the Fourier
series, except they now

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.450
apply for aperiodic signals.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.120
So in particular,
we'll be able to think

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.160
about a signal being
composed of a bunch

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.240
of sinusoidal components.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.240
And we'll be able to think
about systems as filters.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.390
OK, so I've already
alluded to the fact

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.350
that the Fourier
transform relations

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:03.840
look very similar in form to
the Laplace transform relations.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.010
And so I've illustrated the
analysis equations here just

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.130
to emphasize the similarity.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.750
The Laplace transform,
you'll remember, had the--

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.610
we integrated some
signal that was

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.670
a function of time times a
complex exponential integrated

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:26.010
over time to get a
Laplace transform that was

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:31.860
a function of s, not time.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.670
It was a way of having an
alternative representation

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.930
for the signal.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.214
There was no new information.

00:12:38.214 --> 00:12:39.630
The same information
was contained

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.910
in s of x as was
contained in x of t.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.880
Except now, where it
was organized by time,

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.959
now, it's organized by s.

00:12:47.959 --> 00:12:50.250
We get the same sort of thing
with a Fourier transform.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.470
And in fact, this gives
away the mysterious reason

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.882
for calling it x of j omega
in the previous slide.

00:12:58.882 --> 00:13:01.340
You can see that a different
way to think about the Fourier

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.490
transform is that it's simply--

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.100
a trivial way to think
about it, it's the value--

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:12.010
the Fourier transform is the
value of the Laplace transform

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.690
evaluated s equals j omega.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:20.270
All you do is you take this
expression for the Laplace

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.230
transform, and every place there
was an s, make s equal j omega.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.300
And you get this equation.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.670
So that's the reason
we like the notation.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.350
The Fourier transform
is x of j omega.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.120
There are confusions
that arise by that.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.839
And I'll talk about
those in a moment.

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:38.630
But for the time being,
the important thing

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.750
is that the Fourier
transform can

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.820
be viewed as a special
case looking at the j omega

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.040
axis of the Laplace transform.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.140
OK?

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.250
So that view points
out two things.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.900
There's a lot of similarities,
and there are some differences.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.620
First, the similarities--
because you

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.490
can regard the Fourier transform
as kind of a special case--

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.524
that's not really true.

00:14:07.524 --> 00:14:09.940
And I will say something about
that by the end of the hour

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.820
as well.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.420
But because it's kind of a
special case of the Laplace

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:18.004
transform, the Fourier
transform inherits

00:14:18.004 --> 00:14:19.920
a lot of the important
properties of a Laplace

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.270
transform.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.950
In particular, the two
things that we looked at most

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.750
has been linearity.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.000
Because the Laplace
transform is linear,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.120
we can do all manner
of things with it.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.240
The same as we use the
properties of linear systems

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.480
to simplify our view of how
to think about a system,

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.480
we could, for example,
because systems are linear,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.450
we can look at the
response of a system

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.690
to a sum of inputs as
the sum of the responses

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.710
to the individuals.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.830
That's a very important
property that we used of systems

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.300
as a result of linearity.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.870
We did the same thing
with Laplace transforms.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.785
The Laplace transform
of a sum is the sum

00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:04.340
of a Laplace transforms.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.676
And in conjunction with
the differentiation roll

00:15:07.676 --> 00:15:09.050
by which we knew
that the Laplace

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.610
transform of a derivative is
s times the Laplace transform

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:17.090
the function, the
combination of linearity

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.040
and the differentiation
role allowed

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.360
us to apply Laplace transforms
to turn differential equations

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.870
into algebraic equations.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:32.580
Precisely the same thing will
work with Fourier transforms.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.620
For reasons that
should be clear,

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.330
if the Laplace transform has
the property of linearity,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.530
so does the Fourier.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.560
And if the Laplace
transform is simply

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.964
related to the
Fourier transform,

00:15:44.964 --> 00:15:46.380
then there's a
simple relationship

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.690
between the Fourier
transform of a derivative

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.480
and the Fourier transform
of the underlying function.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.600
So in the Laplace transform,
you multiply by s.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.600
Not very surprisingly,
in the Fourier transform,

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.300
you multiply by j omega.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.850
So there's enormous similarity.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.670
And in fact, most of what
you know about Laplace,

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.420
you can immediately
carry over into Fourier.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.496
There are some differences.

00:16:12.496 --> 00:16:13.870
And if there
weren't differences,

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.090
we probably wouldn't bother
with talking about both of them.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:16.589
Right?

00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:19.030
There are some things that
will be easy to think about

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.110
with Fourier transforms.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.627
And that's the reason we do it.

00:16:21.627 --> 00:16:23.710
There are some things that
are easy to think about

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:24.760
with Laplace transforms.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.670
Otherwise, we would have just
skipped straight to Fourier.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:34.012
So there are some things that
Fourier and Laplace share.

00:16:34.012 --> 00:16:35.720
There are some things
that are different.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.744
One of the biggest
differences is the domain.

00:16:39.744 --> 00:16:41.410
When we think about
a Laplace transform,

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.860
we think about x of s.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:49.300
The domain or the Laplace
transform is the domain of s.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.510
The domain of s, s
is a complex number.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.060
For that reason, when we
thought out Laplace transforms,

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.560
we always talked about what
does the Laplace transform

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.590
look like in the s plane.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.770
And we thought about
the real part of the s

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.390
and the imaginary part of s.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.950
When we think about
Fourier transforms,

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:16.720
we're thinking about a
transform with real domain.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.369
Rather than thinking about
x of s as a complex number,

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.770
we're going to think
of x of j omega, omega

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:30.550
a real number that's a
little confusing, right?

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:35.620
Just sort of to confuse
you, we rewrite the one

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.500
that is a complex number as s--

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.474
no indication whatever
that it's complex.

00:17:43.474 --> 00:17:44.890
And the one that
is a real number,

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:49.070
we put a j in front of it to
remind you that it's real.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.930
I apologize, I don't
know why we do this.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.280
So just remember that s, which
looks kind of real isn't.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.830
It's complex.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.016
And j omega, which
looks kind of complex,

00:18:01.016 --> 00:18:02.640
well, it's the omega
part that matters.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.620
It's real.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.630
OK, so the important thing
is the Laplace transform,

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.680
the domain of a
Laplace transform

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.190
is complex number s,
real and imaginary parts,

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.330
characterized by a plane.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.880
The domain of the Fourier
transform is real.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.880
That's enormously important.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.110
And we'll come back to
that over and over again.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.430
But just to drive
home the point,

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.110
one of the things
we thought about

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:33.280
with the Laplace transform was
this idea of eigenfunctions

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.590
and eigenvalues.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.360
It was an idea of linearity.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.820
It was the idea that we
can think about a system

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.190
by how you put in a
function, like E to the st,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.580
and calculate the output.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.350
Well, if the output, if the
system is linear time invariant

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.970
and can be characterized by
a Laplace transform h of s,

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.970
what's the output of that system
when the input is e to the st?

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:04.630
Everybody shout.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.765
It will make me
feel much better.

00:19:07.765 --> 00:19:09.140
If you all shout
at once, I won't

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.520
be able to understand
a word you said,

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.228
and I'll assume you
said the right thing.

00:19:16.474 --> 00:19:18.140
OK I didn't understand
a thing you said.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:25.950
So I assume you all said
h of s e to the st. Right,

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:31.240
e to the st is an eigenfunction
of a linear time invariant

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.010
system.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.140
Eigenfunction means
the function in

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.420
is the same form
as the function out

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.740
except it could be
multiplied by a constant.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.500
The constant is the eigenvalue.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.640
The eigenvalue is h of s.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.180
If we wanted to know,
for example, if we wanted

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.690
to characterize a
very simple system,

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.910
we might have a system of
the form 1 over 1 plus s.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.444
We might have a signal of
the form 1 over 1 plus s.

00:19:57.444 --> 00:19:58.860
So let's say we
have a system now.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.930
Let's say that x represents
some kind of a system.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.270
Then we would have said
that that's a pole.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.490
Where's the pole?

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.410
Minus 1-- we would have
said we have a system

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.518
with a single pole at minus 1.

00:20:13.518 --> 00:20:16.440
I would never have drawn
this complicated picture

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.780
at the bottom because
it would be frightening.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.820
I would always draw
something friendly

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.830
like the picture over here.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:28.110
Right, the entire system can
be understood by a single x.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.650
OK well, if you were computing
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues,

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.185
you would like to know what's
the magnitude and phase.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.970
Sorry, the x of s
is a complex valued

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.100
function of complex domain.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.360
s is a complex number, and the
answer is a complex number.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.260
So we'd like to know the
real and imaginary parts

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.037
of h of s or the magnitude
and phase equivalently.

00:20:56.037 --> 00:20:58.370
If we want to know the magnitude
and phase, for example,

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.180
of h of s, in principle, we need
to know what magnitude could it

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.280
be for all the different s's.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.740
So what's plotted
here is a picture

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.987
of the magnitude
of this function

00:21:11.987 --> 00:21:13.570
as a function of all
the different s's

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:17.860
that can be an eigenfunction.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.470
Right, so for all
of the-- so any

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.420
s is an eigenfunction
of the system.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.000
And that plot
plots the magnitude

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.690
of the associated eigenvalue.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:35.460
The point is that I have
to tell you a complex plane

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.301
number of values.

00:21:38.301 --> 00:21:38.800
Right?

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.900
There a value for s equals 1,
s equals minus 1, s equals 2,

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:49.127
s equals minus 2, s equals j, s
equals 2j, s equals 17 plus 5j.

00:21:49.127 --> 00:21:51.210
All the different values,
all the different points

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.120
in the s plane have a different
associated eigenvalue.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.920
And to completely
characterize this system,

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.050
I have to tell you all of those.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.130
By contrast, if I think
about the Fourier transform,

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.910
the Fourier transform
maps a function

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:08.870
of time to a function of omega.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.280
The complete characterization
of the Fourier transform

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.220
is showed here.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.230
All I need to
worry about is what

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.630
are all the possible
values of omega.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.520
I'm thinking now
instead of thinking s,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.050
I'm thinking how
would I compose x of t

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.949
by summing together a
bunch of sine waves.

00:22:26.949 --> 00:22:28.490
The reason I want
to think about that

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.280
is because I want to think
about systems in terms

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.420
of frequency responses.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.200
So I want to know which
frequencies are amplified,

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.780
which ones are attenuated,
which ones are phase delayed,

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.690
which ones are phase advanced.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.060
And in order to do that
kind of construction,

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.030
all I need to know is
what's the magnitude

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:52.220
and angle of the system
function for all possible values

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:52.720
of omega.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.150
So that's an
enormous difference.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.340
Instead of having,
in the previous case,

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:05.640
I had a function of time turning
into a function of two space.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.030
Function of one space turned
into a function of two space.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.890
Here I have a function
of one space turning

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.990
into a function of one space.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.670
So that is conceptually
a whole lot simpler.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.890
Even more importantly,
it is going

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.430
to give rise to
something that we'll

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.330
spend most of the time for
the rest of the term on--

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:29.190
the notion of signal processing
where we can alternatively

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:35.010
represent a signal x
not by its time samples,

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.930
but instead by its
frequency samples.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.130
It would be very difficult
to use that technique.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:46.560
Although it would
work perfectly,

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.330
there would be an
explosion of information

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:53.070
if we tried to use a signal
processing technique with this

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.140
where we represent this
one-dimensional signal

00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:00.510
by a two-dimensional transform
because we would be exploding

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.950
the amount of information.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.140
We would be increasing
substantially

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.310
the amount of information
required to specify the signal.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:13.120
When we do the Fourier,
there is no such explosion.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.280
It was a one-dimensional
function of time.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.810
It is a one-dimensional
function of omega.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.067
OK, OK, I've been
talking too much.

00:24:26.067 --> 00:24:27.650
I would like you to
make sure that you

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.270
understand the mechanics
of what I've just said.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.590
So here's a signal, x1 of t.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.050
Which of these,
if any, represents

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.544
the Fourier transform?

00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:40.460
You're all very quiet.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.660
Look at your neighbor.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.590
Don't be quiet.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.430
And then start.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.195
And then you can go
back to being quiet.

00:24:45.195 --> 00:24:47.020
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.640
So it's quiet.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.220
So I assume that
means convergence.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:12.747
So which function represents the
Fourier transform of x1 of t?

00:26:12.747 --> 00:26:13.830
Everybody raise your hand.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.960
Indicate by a number of fingers.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.900
And it's overwhelmingly
correct, which is wonderful.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.230
That's the point.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.170
The point is Fourier
transforms are easy.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.820
And you've all got it.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:29.100
So it's trivial to run
this kind of an integral.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.590
It's not very different from
doing a Laplace transform.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.760
Here I've indicated
the Laplace transform.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.260
Right?

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.050
We do e to the minus
t. x of t is 1 or 0.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.860
We change the limits to
indicate the 1 or zeroness.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.990
Very trivial here, we
get a slightly different

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.330
looking answer because
instead of e to the st,

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.090
we have e to the j omega t.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.700
But otherwise, it's
pretty much the same.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.810
The big difference, though,
is again the domain.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.890
So if you think
about the answer--

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.234
so the answer is four
like all of you said--

00:27:00.234 --> 00:27:02.400
if you think about the
answer from the point of view

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.830
of eigenfunctions
and eigenvalues,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.390
you have to think
about a two space.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.380
The two space for even
that simple function,

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.990
sort of the least complicated
function I could think of,

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.460
is illustrated here.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.070
And what you're
supposed to see there

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.970
is if I were to integrate
x of t e to the minus st

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:36.670
dt to get x of s, if I think
about s as sigma plus j omega--

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:39.480
it has a real part and
an imaginary part--

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.000
the real part, as I make the
real part big, e to the st

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.780
becomes something that explodes.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.020
And you can see that manifest
here over in this region.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.030
So this is the
real axis this way.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.550
This is the imaginary
axis that way.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.220
You can see that
as you go to bigger

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.310
numbers in the positive
real direction,

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.480
the magnitude explodes.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.000
If you go in the
negative direction

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.242
because there was a sum here,
the magnitude explodes again.

00:28:09.242 --> 00:28:10.700
You get this horrible
function that

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.990
spends a lot of its
time near infinity.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.020
Right?

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.170
So that's a complicated picture
by comparison to the picture

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.314
that you get if you look
at Fourier transform.

00:28:20.314 --> 00:28:21.980
So if you look at the
Fourier transform,

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.530
you get something that's
relatively simpler.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.980
We're only looking along
the imaginary axis now.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.770
Furthermore, there's an
easy way to interpret this.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.830
This is explicitly telling us
if you put a certain frequency

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.800
into the system, say this
represented a system function,

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.420
if this represented
a system function,

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.570
it's telling you that there's
a simple way of thinking

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.150
about how it amplifies or
attenuates frequencies.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:44.780
Right?

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.240
It likes frequencies
near the middle.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.020
There's a lot of frequencies--

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.240
so if this represented
a system function,

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.834
it would pass with a gain
of two frequencies near 0.

00:28:56.834 --> 00:28:59.000
And the magnitude would be
smaller for these others.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.583
And there is a phase
relationship too.

00:29:00.583 --> 00:29:04.770
So there's insights that you
can get from this Fourier

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.920
representation that are less
easy to get from the Laplace.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.860
I mean the Laplace was
a complete specification

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.357
of a signal or a system, either.

00:29:14.357 --> 00:29:15.690
So all the information is there.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.326
It's just that it's
more apparent--

00:29:18.326 --> 00:29:20.700
some of the information is
more apparent-- in the Fourier

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.910
representation.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:29.960
OK, second question, what if
I stretched the time axis?

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:35.060
x1 was 1 between minus 1 and 1.
x2 is 1 between minus 2 and 2.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.460
So all I'm doing,
stretching the axis.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.760
What happens to the
Fourier transform?

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.720
Look at your neighbor.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.500
Choose a number.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.480
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:39.194
OK, which answer tells me what
happens when I stretch time?

00:30:39.194 --> 00:30:40.860
So everybody raise
your hand and tell me

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:46.140
some number between 0
and 5, 1 and 5 actually.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.190
OK, 20% correct.

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.890
S

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.180
So what's going to happen?

00:30:55.180 --> 00:31:01.440
Well, it's pretty easy to simply
do out the integral again.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.450
Right, so that's the sort
of most primitive way

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.100
you can think about it.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.810
If you simply run
the integral, I've

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.610
written it in a
kind of funny way.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:11.750
Right?

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.430
So a lot of you said
one for the answer.

00:31:18.804 --> 00:31:19.970
This kind of looks like one.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.314
Why is that not one?

00:31:22.314 --> 00:31:23.230
That's actually three.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.200
Why do I like to write it as--

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.180
instead of writing 2
since 2 omega over omega

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.460
I like to write 4 signed
2 omega over 2 omega.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.070
Why do I like that?

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.495
Because I'm completely random.

00:31:41.169 --> 00:31:42.710
AUDIENCE: Omega is
the same that way?

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.205
DENNIS FREEMAN: Excuse me.

00:31:43.205 --> 00:31:45.185
AUDIENCE: Omega can
be the same-- like you

00:31:45.185 --> 00:31:47.189
can have omega absorb the 2.

00:31:47.189 --> 00:31:48.730
DENNIS FREEMAN:
That's kind of right.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.050
So can you unscramble
the sentence slightly?

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:54.900
What is more-- yes.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.440
AUDIENCE: Aren't they the
same form that we use?

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.700
DENNIS FREEMAN: It's the
same form in what sense?

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.140
I mean what's the same about it?

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.330
Yes.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.152
Yes.

00:32:03.152 --> 00:32:06.104
AUDIENCE: Like I thought
I was going to say omega

00:32:06.104 --> 00:32:08.056
is near 0 when number two is 4.

00:32:08.056 --> 00:32:09.430
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Correct, correct.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:13.830
If you think about what
happens for omega near 0,

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.530
I've got the sine of
2 omega, which is--

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.540
what's the sine of 2
omega when you make it 0?

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.140
0.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.580
So I have 0 over 0.

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:25.984
Bad.

00:32:25.984 --> 00:32:26.650
So what do I do?

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.050
L'Hospital.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.120
So if I do L'Hospital's
rule, then I

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.490
can make this thing
look like one.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:39.510
And if I write it in the form
sine 2 omega over 2 omega,

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:43.350
that has a value near
0 that approaches 1.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.516
So the amplitude is 4.

00:32:45.516 --> 00:32:46.890
So that's a way
of separating out

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:50.400
the part that's unity
amplitude from the part that

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.750
is the constant that
multiplies the amplitude.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.230
So the amplitude is 4.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:59.790
And frequency, which had
been pi, moves to pi over 2.

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.660
So the point is that--

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.210
so the answer is number three.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:11.750
The peak increases, and the
frequency spacing decreases.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:17.650
But more generally, the point
is that if I stretched time,

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:19.782
I compress frequency.

00:33:19.782 --> 00:33:21.740
But I compress frequency
in a very special way.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:28.360
I compress frequency in
an area-preserving way.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.080
That's why the peak popped up.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.980
So what I'd like to do is think
about a general scaling rule.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:40.050
If I wanted to think
about scaling x1 into x2,

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:45.340
such that x2 is a scaled
version of time compared to x1,

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.460
so if I wanted x2
of t to be x1 of at,

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.160
and if I wanted to stretch
x1 to turn it into x2,

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.570
should I make a1--

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.810
should I make a
bigger or less than 1?

00:34:01.634 --> 00:34:03.800
I'm trying to generalize
the result that I just did.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.880
Right?

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.800
So I stretched x1 into x2.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:12.587
And what I saw is that frequency
shrunk, and amplitude went up.

00:34:12.587 --> 00:34:14.420
So now, I'm thinking
about what would happen

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.230
if I did that in general.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:19.850
If I took x1, and I
stretched it by setting

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.750
x2 equal to x1 of
at, would I want

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:28.219
a to be bigger or less than
1 if I want to stretch x1

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:30.324
to turn it into x2?

00:34:30.324 --> 00:34:31.710
AUDIENCE: Less than 1.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.530
DENNIS FREEMAN: Less than
1 because then the logic

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:40.050
is that if I wanted, for
example, x2 of 2 to be x1 of 1,

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.199
stretch x2--

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:48.690
stretch x1, sorry, so that
it's value x2 at the position 2

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:53.230
is the same as the
original function x1 at 1.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.000
If I stretched
it, then I clearly

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.070
have to have a equal
to a half in that case.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:00.890
And in general, stretching would
correspond to a less than 1.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.010
And now, I can think
about where that fits

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:07.300
in the transform relationship.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.990
Think about finding the
Fourier transform of x2,

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:18.350
and substituting
x1 of at for x2,

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.350
and then making this
relationship look

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.450
more like a Fourier transform.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:26.330
So I don't want
the at to be here.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.730
I want function of t.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.535
So I can rewrite at as tau.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.930
Now, this looks like a
Fourier transform except that

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.720
I've changed all
my t's to tau's.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.660
And the point is that
that transformation of tau

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.200
equals at shows
up in two places.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.230
There's an explicit time here.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.075
And there's a time
dependence in the dt.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.710
So the dt one is the one
that gives me the shrinking

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:01.280
and swelling of the axis.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.320
And the 1 over a from here
is the one that gives me

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.410
the changing amplitude.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:12.000
That's how you get the
area-preserving property.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.990
However much it got
compressed-- however

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:18.110
much it stretched in time
so that it became compressed

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:21.110
in frequency, whatever the
factor is that compressed it

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.694
in frequency, it also
makes, by the same factor,

00:36:23.694 --> 00:36:24.485
it makes it taller.

00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:29.370
We'd like to build up intuition
for how the Fourier transform

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:29.580
works.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.829
That's the reason for doing
these kinds of properties.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.680
So now, there's another way of
thinking about that same thing

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.475
by thinking about what we
call the moment theorems.

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:47.800
Here what we think
about is what would

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.270
happen if we evaluated the
Fourier transform at omega

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.610
equals 0.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:56.400
Well, omega equals 0 is
associated with a particularly

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.780
simple complex exponential.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.840
If the frequency is
0, e to the j0 t is 1.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.260
So what you see
is that the value

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.960
of the Fourier
transform at omega

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.335
equals 0 is the area
under the curve.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.640
So the idea then
is that if I took

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.270
an x of t, which was x1, which
was 1 between minus 1 and 1,

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:26.550
there's an area of 2.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.300
And that's a way of
directly saying, well,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.240
the Fourier transform
at 0 better be 2.

00:37:32.572 --> 00:37:34.030
And the intuitive
thing that you're

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.590
supposed to take
away from that is

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:38.620
when you look at a Fourier
transform, the value at 0

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.450
is the dc.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:46.500
How much constant is
there in that signal?

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.660
So there's a very
explicit representation

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.520
for the frequency content.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.770
I mean that's what the Fourier
transform is all about.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.200
And in particular, the
zero frequency is dc.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.240
It's the average value.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.870
That kind of a relationship
works both ways.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:06.150
If you were to use
the synthesis formula

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:11.565
and think about how do
you synthesize x of 0,

00:38:11.565 --> 00:38:12.940
well, it's the
same sort of thing

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:17.050
except now the t is 0
instead of the omega being 0.

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:19.660
And what we get is
1 over 2pi times

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:25.170
the area under the transform.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.310
So what that says is
whatever is going on

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:33.800
over in this wiggly thing, the
net area, the average value,

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.690
divided by 2pi has to
equal the value at x1 of 0.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.540
x1 of 0 is clearly 1.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:46.370
So that means the area under
this thing must be 2pi.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.026
That wasn't particularly clear.

00:38:48.026 --> 00:38:49.400
I mean I don't
know automatically

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.140
the area under that curve.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.840
But that's such a
frequently recurring thing

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:59.240
that it's useful to notice that
the area under this funny curve

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.285
happens to be precisely the
area of this inscribed triangle.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.910
So the height of
the triangle is 2.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:10.300
Half the base is pi.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.440
So the area is 2pi.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:20.400
I'm sure some Greek knew this.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.390
But I don't.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:22.800
So if somebody
can think of a way

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.760
to derive that answer without
using Fourier transforms--

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.630
I can do it with
Fourier transforms.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:31.350
And I can look it up in
books where the authors also

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.940
use Fourier transforms.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.030
But I'm sure some ancient
Greek can do this.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.160
So the question is if
anybody can figure out

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.320
how the ancient Greeks would
have come to that conclusion,

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.430
I would be very
interested to know.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:47.494
Does everybody get-- so
areas of inscribed whatevers,

00:39:47.494 --> 00:39:48.660
right, that's what they did.

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:49.170
Right?

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.780
So I would like
to know how to get

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.620
the fact that the area under
this wiggly function 2 sine

00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:00.450
omega over omega is 2pi without
knowing Fourier transforms.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:01.790
So that's an open challenge.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:04.620
So try to figure out how
to prove that without using

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.310
Fourier transforms.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:11.910
So if we use the moment idea,
and we think about this scaling

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:16.560
thing, we come up with a
very interesting result

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.110
that if you were to
stretch x1, which

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.330
had been 1 just
between minus 1 and 1,

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:24.960
to turn it into x2, which
was 1 between minus 2 and 2,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.222
and just keep stretching,
what would happen?

00:40:30.222 --> 00:40:31.680
Well, it gets
skinnier and skinnier

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.150
and skinnier and skinnier.

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:37.312
But in a very special
way, the area is the same.

00:40:37.312 --> 00:40:39.520
Even though it got skinnier
and skinnier and skinnier

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.030
and skinnier, the
area is the same.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:47.720
If you keep doing that,
it turns into an impulse.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.460
Well, that's pretty interesting.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.970
That's an alternative way
of deriving an impulse.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:55.935
An impulse, we think
about an impulse

00:40:55.935 --> 00:40:58.120
as a generalized function.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.250
Any function that
has the property

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:06.650
that in some kind of a limit,
the area shrinks towards 0,

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:10.030
but the area
doesn't change, that

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:11.339
turns into a delta function.

00:41:11.339 --> 00:41:13.630
That's a different way of
thinking about the definition

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:15.140
of a delta function.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.560
And so we just found
something very interesting.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:23.880
The Fourier transform
of the constant 1

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.680
seems to be a delta
function as 0 of area 2pi.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.030
Well, that's pretty interesting.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:31.446
What's the Laplace
transform of 1?

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:39.950
Too shocking.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.900
What's the Laplace
transform of 1?

00:41:44.738 --> 00:41:46.160
AUDIENCE: It's a delta function.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.844
DENNIS FREEMAN: Delta function.

00:41:48.844 --> 00:41:50.260
What's the Laplace
transform of 1?

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:54.980
And So Laplace transform,
right, so x of s,

00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:00.240
integral 1e to the minus st dt.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.070
What's the Laplace
transform of 1?

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.139
AUDIENCE: 1 over s.

00:42:13.139 --> 00:42:14.180
DENNIS FREEMAN: 1 over s.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.240
How about 1 over s?

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.415
Yes?

00:42:21.415 --> 00:42:21.915
No?

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.000
1 over s-- yes.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.800
1 over s-- no.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.710
Me.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:34.570
1 over s, no.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.345
Why not?

00:42:37.345 --> 00:42:41.170
AUDIENCE: You would just
use the su of 1 u of t.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:42.500
DENNIS FREEMAN: It's 1, yes.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:48.501
So the Laplace transform
of u of t is 1 over s.

00:42:48.501 --> 00:42:49.001
Right?

00:42:52.005 --> 00:42:54.380
You remember there was a region
of convergence associated

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.080
with Laplace transforms.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.180
The region of convergence,
we thought about

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:06.399
like if you had a time
function like u of t,

00:43:06.399 --> 00:43:07.940
then it would converge
as long as you

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:15.020
multiplied by some factor
that generally attenuated.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.050
So that bounded what
kinds of s's worked.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:22.340
We needed the real part
of s bigger than 0.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.790
Because if the real part
of s was the other way,

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.450
the interval would diverge--

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.180
bad.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:33.900
Right so we could find the
Laplace transform of u of t--

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.600
real part of s bigger than 0.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.260
Or we could find the Laplace
transform of a backward step.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:52.000
The region of
convergence would flip.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.240
And we got a sign change.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:59.430
But the Laplace transform
of 1 doesn't exist.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.940
There is no region of
convergence for the function 1.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:10.030
That's a big difference between
Fourier and Laplace as well.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:16.300
Even though Fourier, is in some
sense, a subset of Laplace,

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.730
there are some signals that
have Fourier transforms

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.980
and not Laplace transforms,
and so in that sense,

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.951
Laplace is a subset of Fourier.

00:44:23.951 --> 00:44:25.450
So in fact, you
better think of them

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:28.720
as Venn diagrams that overlap.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.470
So there are some
signals that have both,

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.880
but there are some signals that
have one and not the other.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:45.370
OK, so the final and maybe
most important property

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:48.010
of Laplace transforms
is that they have

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:51.620
a simple, inverse relationship.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:53.370
You may remember that
I talked about there

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.120
being an inverse
relationship for Laplace.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.930
So you can think
about x of t being

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:06.860
1 over j 2pi, the integral over
some sort of a contour of x

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:11.400
of s e to the st ds.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.240
And I told you don't
ever try to do that

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:17.710
without going over to math and
talking to those folks first.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:20.170
That's complicated.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.210
The interesting thing
about this relationship

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.690
is that it's really simple.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:29.560
So there's a very simple
relationship between a Fourier

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.860
transform and its inverse.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.380
OK, so I think I'll
defer talking about that

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:44.150
until next time, the
reason being that I want

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:45.690
to end a little earlier today.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:48.890
So I'll finish talking
about the rest of the slides

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:51.100
on the next lecture.
