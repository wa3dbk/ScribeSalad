00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.150
PROFESSOR: Hello and welcome.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.710
So today is mostly distinguished
by what happens tomorrow.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.650
Not surprisingly, but of
course, you all know that.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.100
So tomorrow we have
our first quiz.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.407
Tomorrow evening 7:30
to 9:30, no recitation.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:41.990
We've been through
this several times.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.320
I won't spend any time on it
other than to ask if there are

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.100
any questions, so if I
don't hear any questions,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.260
the idea is going to be at
the end of this lecture,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.470
the next time we'll see
you is in office hours,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.260
and, or tomorrow, Wednesday,
7:30 on the third floor,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.070
building 26.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.380
Questions or comments
about the exam?

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.050
Yep.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.910
PROFESSOR: So that one
page of notes, 8 and 1/2

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.680
by 11, front and back.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.790
You can write as
small as you like.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.780
In fact, later in
today's lecture,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.631
I'll show you how
a microscope works

00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:26.880
and you're welcome to use a
microscope because they're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.370
completely non-electronic.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.780
Oh, as long as you use
an optical microscope.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.150
Other questions about the exam?

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.020
OK, then for today, so
far, since the beginning

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.090
of the term, we
thought about a number

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.710
of different kinds
of representations

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.540
for both DT systems--

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.110
discrete time-- and CT systems--
continuous time systems--

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.660
and we saw that
we were interested

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.670
in that large number
of representations,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.720
because each of them had
some particular aspect that

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.630
made it particularly
convenient sometimes.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.229
So, for example, in both CT
and DT we looked at verbal,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.100
but not so much.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.500
That was mostly in the homework.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.380
We looked at difference
in differential equations,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.660
mostly because they were
so compact, so concise, so

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.320
precise, they told you
exactly what the system does.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.630
No fluff, this is it.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.040
So that was nice.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.226
Block diagrams, by
contrast, are less concise,

00:02:31.226 --> 00:02:33.100
but they tell you the
way a signal propagates

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.560
through the system on its way
from the input to the output,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.620
and that can be very
helpful for understanding

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.500
why certain behaviors occur,
especially when we talk

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.750
about things like feedback.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.340
We looked at operator
representations.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.950
They were nice because
we could transform

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.980
the way we think about
systems into the way

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.522
we think about polynomials,
so we reduced a college level

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:56.980
thing to a high
school level thing.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.820
That's always nice, and then
we looked at transforms.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.670
The distinguishing feature
of transform representation

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.550
was that we took an
entire function of time,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.890
and turned it into an
algebraic expression.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.900
So we turned a
differential system

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.390
that described a system
of differential equations

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.480
that describes a system into a
system of algebraic equations

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.160
that describes a system.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.050
All of those were useful
for different ways

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.640
and what I wanted to talk
about today is yet another way

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.580
to represent a system
and that is to represent

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.180
a system by a single signal.

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:34.690
So in some sense
we're going backwards,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.850
because we're taking
what we would normally

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.429
think of as an entire
system and reducing it,

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:42.970
getting rid of the
system altogether,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.830
so all we're going
to have is signals.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.230
That turns out to be a
particular powerful way

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.110
to do some sorts of
operations, and is actually

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.240
the first instance,
the first step,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.630
in that we will take
in a major field

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.820
thought of signal processing.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.670
When you reduce the entire
behavior of a system

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.970
to a signal, we then regard
the whole processing task

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.320
as a signal processing task.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.750
Signal processing
task, not system.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.750
So far, we have focused
on the responses

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.000
to the most elementary
kinds of signals--

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.120
unit sample signal,
unit impulse signal--

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.700
but generally speaking,
we're interested in much more

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.720
complicated signals.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.760
As you've already
seen, I've already

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.477
asked you to calculate things
like unit step responses.

00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:32.560
So generally, we're going
to be interested in much

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.780
more complicated signals--

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.800
the responses of systems to
much more complicated signals.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.930
That's not hard.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.760
The reason we
skipped over it was

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.030
that you can always
figure out the response

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.210
to a more complicated
signal at least

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.520
by falling back on some
of our more primitive ways

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.829
of thinking about systems.

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:55.120
So for example, if we think
about a difference equation

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.580
or a block diagram,
we can think about how

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.430
a more complicated signal
excites a response by simply

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.970
thinking about the system
operating on a sample

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.200
by sample basis.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.650
So you, of course,
all know that,

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.150
and to prove that
you all know that,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.190
answer the following question.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.215
Here is a system.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.700
Here is a signal that is more
complicated than just a unit

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.220
sample or unit sample signal.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.780
Figure out what is
the third response

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.280
of this system to that signal?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.310
You should be absolutely quiet.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.180
That was sarcasm,
just so you know.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.950
Lots of self-satisfied looks
so I assume everybody's done.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:29.870
So what's the answer?

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.000
Raise the number of
fingers that corresponds

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.136
to the answer y of 3.

00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:36.760
Raise your hand so
that I can see them.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.940
Drop the ones with
the wrong answers.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.730
I don't want to see those.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.430
OK, about 50%, so maybe
take another 10 seconds.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.105
Notice that I'm
asking for y of 3.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.970
So what's the answer y of
3, and raise your hand.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.670
Everybody has the right
answer, raise your hand.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.170
Much better.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.590
OK, so now the overwhelming
majority says the answer is 2.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.930
That's not very hard.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.906
If we think about the block
diagram representation,

00:07:43.906 --> 00:07:45.280
and if we think
about propagating

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.740
the more complicated signal
represented over here

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.280
through that signal,
through that system,

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.840
we start with the
system at rest.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.140
That means there's 0's
coming out of all the delays,

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.390
at time n equals
minus 1, x is 0,

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.580
combined with the initial
0's, we get the answer is 0.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:17.270
And then, at time n equals
0, the input becomes 1,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:24.290
so now the output goes to
1, at time 1, it goes to 2.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.350
At time 2, it goes to 3.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.770
Times 3, it goes to 2.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.930
This is obvious, right?

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.580
Et cetera.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.419
So the answer is 2.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:41.280
y of 3 is 2, and the point
is that it's very trivial

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.144
to think about by thinking about
the system in a sort of sample

00:08:44.144 --> 00:08:47.140
by sample way.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.080
Not surprisingly,
the point of today

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.940
is to not think of the
system sample by sample,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.710
but to elevate the conversation
from samples to signals.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.770
The first step in thinking
about it as signals

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.350
is to realize that you can
think about the response

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.850
of the system by decomposing
the input into additive parts.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.740
I can think about x which
is this 3 sample signal.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.730
I can decompose it
into single samples,

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.130
and then think about the
response to each of those,

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.440
and it may not surprise you
that if the system were linear,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.020
then the response
to the sum would

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.516
be the sum of the responses.

00:09:29.516 --> 00:09:30.890
So you can sort
of see that there

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.390
would be a way of
adding together

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.280
these rectangular pulses
to get a triangle pulse.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.930
So that works simply because
the system is linear.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.540
The system has the property
that the output for a sum

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.720
is the sum of the outputs for
the individual components,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.500
and we can write that this
way, so a system is linear.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.130
We can define linear in a more
rigorous mathematical sense

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.050
by saying that a
system is linear

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.840
if the response to a
weighted sum of inputs

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.200
is the similarly
weighted sum of outputs.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.650
So imagine that I
have a system whose

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.680
output when the
input is x1 is y1

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.970
and whose output when
the input is x2 is y2.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.900
We'll say the
system is linear if

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:27.480
and only if the weighted sum
of inputs alpha x1 plus beta x2

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.620
gives the same wakings
alpha y1 plus beta y2

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.650
for all possible values
of alpha and beta.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.960
If that's true, then we'll
say the system is linear.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.930
So then if it's
linear, then we're

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.467
allowed to do this
decomposition,

00:10:46.467 --> 00:10:48.050
because all we're
doing is decomposing

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.820
the input into a sum of inputs.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.292
We'll always be able to do that
operation of the decomposition

00:10:56.292 --> 00:10:58.500
if the system is linear
according to the definition I

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.480
already showed.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.220
If the system also
has the property

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.010
that we will call
time invariance,

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.810
then the response
to the parts will be

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.330
particularly easy to calculate.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.170
Time invariance has a
similar formal definition.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.420
We will call a
system time invariant

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.670
if given that the input--

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:23.200
the response to x of n is y.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.800
Given that, we'll say the
system is time invariant

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.480
if a shifted
version of the input

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.770
simply shifts the response.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.750
That seems like a kind of
gobbledygook sort of thing.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.010
It's a very simple minded
notion that you should all

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.330
have from common experience.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.990
All it says is that if
I do something today,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:50.430
and I get a response, if I
do the same thing tomorrow,

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.210
I should get the same response
just delayed by a day.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.200
That's all it's saying.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.350
So basically the system
behaves sort of the same

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.380
now as it did previously,
and as it will in the future.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.580
That's what time
invariance means.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.560
So if the response
is time invariant,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.920
then we can compute the response
to a shifted unit sample.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.750
Notice that this is the
unit sample response.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.650
This is a shifted unit
sample so if the system

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.080
is time invariant, then the
response to a shifted unit

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.290
sample is the shifted
unit sample response which

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.990
you can see from the picture.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.570
So the idea then is
that superposition

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.470
is a very easy way to think
about the response of a system.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.200
If the system is linear
and time invariant,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.290
linearity let's us break it up,
and think about the response

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.580
to each part.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.200
Shift invariance,
or time invariance,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.930
allows us to shift the
input, and know automatically

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.180
what's the response
going to look like.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.360
And there's a formal way we
can think about the way you

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.970
do that operation.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.470
How do you implement
this superposition thing?

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:05.650
You think about a system as
having a unit sample response.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.200
This is the unit sample signal.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.430
We'll call the unit
sample response h of n,

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.090
then a shifted unit sample
will give a shifted unit

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.130
sample response.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.340
That's time invariance.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:28.590
Then a weighted shifted impulse
gives the same weighted shifted

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:29.400
impulse response.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:42.260
Then the sum of such things
gives the sum of such things.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.100
That's just a formal
derivation of a process

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.990
that we will call convolution.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:54.290
So the response to an
arbitrary DT signal

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.460
that excites a linear
time invariant system

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.660
can be described by the
convolution of the input

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.680
with the unit sample response.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.510
We'll call that formula--

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.590
we'll call that
operation convolution.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.847
Convolution is completely
straightforward.

00:14:16.847 --> 00:14:19.430
For that reason, we try to make
it a little bit more confusing

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.610
by using terribly
confusing notation.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.140
That too is sarcastic, I mean.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.440
So the only thing
that's at all confusing

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.310
about convolution-- convolution
is completely trivial.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.270
Here's the way we would
write it. x convolves with h.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.995
The signal x convolves with the
signal h to give a new signal.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:50.030
Being a signal, I can ask
what's the nth sample look like,

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.920
and what that symbol
means is this sum.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.630
The confusing thing is that
most people in the field

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.190
write it this way.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.430
The signal x of n convolves
with the signal h of n.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.690
The reason that's confusing,
and the thing you will never do,

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.592
because you are here.

00:15:13.592 --> 00:15:15.050
The thing that you
will never do is

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.830
confuse the meaning
of that statement

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.613
with what looks like an
operation on samples.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.720
Had I said multiply,
you would have said,

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.420
if this were a multiply operator
instead of a convolution

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.270
multiplier operator--

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.000
if that were multiply
instead of convolve,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.360
you would have
said, oh, that means

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.200
the oneth sample multiplied
by the oneth sample

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.940
is the product of
the oneth samples.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.220
This is not true.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.990
This is not generally true.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.270
The convolution operation
means take the whole signal x.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.030
That's why we think about it
as an operation on signals,

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.390
not an operation on samples.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.990
Convolution means take
the whole signal x,

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.870
and convolve it with
the whole signal h

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.820
to get a brand new
signal x convolved h,

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.400
and then take the nth sample.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.720
So the only thing that's at
all confusing about convolution

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.140
is remembering the convolution
is an operation that is applied

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.580
to signals, not samples.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.987
So structure of convolution.

00:16:41.987 --> 00:16:43.820
So I just showed you a
mathematical formula.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.530
What I'd like you to
have is a little bit

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:50.270
of an intuition for what happens
when you convolve two signals.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.930
So let's think about the
structure of this operation.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.740
What are we doing?

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.467
Imagine that we're going back
to that original problem.

00:16:57.467 --> 00:17:00.050
What happens when you take x of
n and convolve it with h of n?

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.900
All we need to do is
this formula, right?

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.000
That's all we need to do.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.560
What's that formula say?

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:15.060
Well let's think about how you
would compute the 0-th output.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:20.280
According to that formula all
I did was substitute n equal 0

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.430
every place there
was an n, and what

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.240
I see is I have to multiply
x of k times h of minus k,

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.430
but I've got x of n in h of n.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.980
So the first thing I do is I
flip the axises and I make them

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.610
k's.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.260
That's not hard.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:39.570
Then the x looks OK,
but the h doesn't.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:45.800
I need h of minus k,
so I have to flip it.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.165
So I'm flipping about
the n equals 0 axis.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.870
So that positive
n becomes minus n,

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.880
positive k becomes
minus k, because I want

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.200
this to be minus k up here.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.780
Then generally, I have
some shift thing here.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.801
This 0, because I was
looking for the 0-th sample.

00:18:08.801 --> 00:18:10.300
In general, that
might be different.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.770
That might be 7 if I
wanted to find y of 7.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:21.530
Then I'd have a 7 over here, and
that number represents a shift.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.430
In the case of 0,
it's a 0 shift.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.860
Then I have to
multiply these two,

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.380
so I just place this thing
over here so I can multiply.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.510
I multiply down.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:39.400
You can see that there's only
one sample that in the two

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.280
is both non-zero.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.750
Therefore, I get a
single non-zero answer,

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.280
and then according
to the formula,

00:18:48.280 --> 00:19:00.420
I have to sum so the 0-th answer
is flip, shift, multiply, sum,

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.800
and you just repeat that for
all the different answers.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.390
So at time equals 0,
the answer at time 0

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:10.950
is flip, shift by
0, multiply, sum.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.030
The answer is 1.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:19.410
If I want to find the one answer
now the shift is shift by 1.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.960
So now instead of
having flip which

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.590
would have put the 3
samples here, I shift by 1

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.820
so now they're over there.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.500
So now when I do the multiply,
I pick up 2 non-zero answers

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.300
and the answer is 2.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.080
If I wanted y equals
2, I do the same thing

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.840
but now I shift by 2.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.280
Flip, shift, multiply,
sum, that's all I do.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.410
It's completely trivial.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.320
If I continue, the
shift becomes larger

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.950
and now it's
falling off the end.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:57.540
Continue, continue,
and I get in general

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.460
that's the prescription.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.430
So what I've tried
to show is two ways

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.370
of thinking about this
convolution thing.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.650
The first was by
superposition, where I just

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.364
think about breaking the
input into a bunch of samples,

00:20:11.364 --> 00:20:13.530
thinking about the response
to each of those samples

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.029
and adding.

00:20:18.528 --> 00:20:21.570
That's an input centric way
of thinking about things,

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.820
because I think of the
input being broken up

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.590
by a bunch of samples.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.380
This convolution formula
is an output centric way

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.120
of thinking about
things I tell you.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.450
I'd like to know the
output at time p,

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.760
and to compute the
output of time p,

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.290
you say, well that's easy.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:44.240
Flip, shift by p, multiply, sum.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.149
So input centric, that's
the superposition way

00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:49.190
of thinking about things.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.080
Output centric, that's
the convolution way

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.550
of thinking about things.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.180
So now that you know
about convolution,

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.920
find which plot below 1, 2,
3, 4, or none of the above

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.530
shows the result of convolving
the two functions shown above.

00:21:26.554 --> 00:21:27.659
You're so quiet.

00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:29.700
I assume you're practicing
for the exam tomorrow.

00:21:36.222 --> 00:21:37.180
You're allowed to talk.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.530
So which one's right?

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.377
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5?

00:23:03.377 --> 00:23:03.960
See if I know.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.430
It looks good.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:18.530
About I only see one wrong,
two wrong, so 95% or so.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.470
So how do I think about this?

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:25.220
What's the way that I should
think about convolving those?

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.890
Easiest, most straightforward
way, go back to the formula.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.890
That will always work.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.170
Can somebody tell me a more
intuitive, insightful way

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.350
of thinking about what will
be the result of convolving

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.060
those top two functions?

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.758
Tell me a property of
the result of convolving.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.190
Yes, yes, flip,
shift, multiply, sum.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.860
What's the answer at n equals 1?

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.990
1.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:09.850
So I've got two things that
look kind of like geometrics.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.890
Imagine for the moment--

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.230
that was intended to be a hint--

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.800
imagine for the moment that
the sequence looks like 1,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:25.180
2/3, 4/9, 8/27,
blah, blah, blah.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.030
Imagine that it's a
geometric sequence

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.260
with the base of about 2/3.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:36.590
How would I compute the answer
when I convolve that sequence

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.300
with itself at zero?

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.970
Flip, shift, multiply,
divide, so I started out

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.300
with two things that were
both starting at zero.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.580
You flip one of them.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.130
How much overlap is there?

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.690
Just the 1.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.660
Just the n equals 0, what's
the answer at n equals 0?

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.750
1, right?

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.650
So if I imagine that this is
the sequence after I flip it.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.750
There's a 1 under the 1.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.820
The 0's here kill
the terms down here.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.010
The 0's here kill
the terms up there.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.530
The only thing that
lives is 1 times 1 is 1,

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.570
so the answer at
y equals 0 is 1.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.970
What's the answer at y equals 1?

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.220
Flip, shift, multiply, sum.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:35.180
So I flip, shift.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:44.010
So when I shift, the new answer
looks like 1, 2/3, 4/9, 8/27,

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.130
et cetera.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.970
Multiply and sum,
what's the answer?

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:49.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.970
PROFESSOR: 4/3.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:57.095
So the only non-zero answers are
1 times 2/3 plus 2/3 times 1--

00:25:57.095 --> 00:25:57.595
4/3.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:08.320
If I want to compute y of
0 1 2, I shift it further.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:14.810
So I do 1, 2/3, 4/9,
8/27, blah, blah, blah.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.220
So flip, shift, I
shift 1 more, multiply,

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.900
sum, multiply 1 times
4/9, and I get 4/9.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.160
Multiply 2/3 times
2/3, I get 4/9.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.920
Multiply 4/9 times 1, I get 4/9.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.670
The answer to the
sum of those is 4/3.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.750
So I get one 4/3, 4/3.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.640
So you can see it's tracing out.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.340
This wave form so far,
this is the only one that

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.810
has up and then flat, and
if I continue that process

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.010
it will start to fall off.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.980
If you're exclusively
mathematically minded,

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.100
you can also just
do it with math.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.800
All you do is think about
a mathematical description

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.430
of the left signal.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:12.440
Say 2/3 of the nu of n and
the right signal, and now all

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.810
I need to do is think
about that formula.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.670
So do a sum, taking
this, the function of n

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:24.010
and turning it into
a function of k.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:27.460
The second one, I want to
make a function of n minus k.

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.740
I have to shift both.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:34.090
I have to change the
exponent as well as the index

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:39.350
into the unit sample signal,
same thing over here.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.910
Now when I think about
multiplying them, u of k

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.760
kills all the terms
for k less than 0,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.660
so I can start at 0
instead of minus infinity.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:57.170
This u kills everything for
which n minus k is less than 0.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.870
That means k less than n--

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.430
less than or equal to n.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.180
So I end up with this.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.180
This product is
particularly easy

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:10.060
because it's the the
k into the minus k,

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:15.590
so the answer is to the n,
and now I'm summing over k,

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:20.380
but there are no k's, so
that's summing over 1.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.000
And so my answer is
just n plus 1 and 2/3

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.170
to the nu of n which is the
same thing by thinking about it

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.650
intuitively.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:36.060
So the point is that the
operation is friendly,

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.200
and so the idea then the
big picture was convolution

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.400
is a different way to
represent a system.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:49.180
Using convolution, we
represent an entire system

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.120
by a single signal.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.670
That signal, the
unit sample response,

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.550
is sufficient to characterize
the output of the system

00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.930
for any possible input.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.950
We just saw how the operation
is called convolution,

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.230
so that enables us
the big picture.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:11.810
We've represented an entire
system by a single signal,

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.905
in this case h of n.

00:29:14.905 --> 00:29:16.030
That's what convolution is.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.710
It's a new representation.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:25.940
You can do exactly the
same thing for a CT system,

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.760
and the reason we use delta
to represent the unit sample

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.950
signal and the unit
impulse response.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.590
The unit impulse
signal is clear,

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:41.350
because the representation
of an arbitrary signal,

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.480
in terms of delta functions,
looks much the same

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.450
in CT and in DT.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:53.200
You can get there by thinking
about the limiting argument

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.020
for how to interpret
the unit impulse.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.110
The unit impulse
function was a function

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.030
that is easiest to
think about in a limit.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.500
Imagine that I
have a signal that

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:10.780
is a square pulse whose area,
regardless of width, is 1.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.130
That's what a unit
impulse function is.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.560
Imagine how you would construct
an arbitrary signal x of t

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.160
by having such a signal.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.920
You could take a signal and it's
shifted version, and come up

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.970
with a weighted sum
of impulse functions

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.900
or rectangular approximations
to impulse functions

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.900
to represent an
arbitrary signal.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.950
If you did that, you would get
an approximation to the signal

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:44.130
x which could be
written as a limit.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.080
So if you think about each of
these being of width capital

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.420
delta, then the height
has to be 1 over delta.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:59.780
So the area remains one.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.690
Then if I want to build
an arbitrary function x

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:06.710
out of such signals,
I need a sum of them,

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.950
and each one of these p's has
to be multiplied by delta.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:15.560
So that when I multiply
by the value of x at one

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.330
point k delta.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:22.860
I get the right height
independent of what is delta.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.330
So for a given delta, I get
a sum that looks like that,

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.280
and then in keeping with
the idea of thinking

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.440
about a unit impulse
function as a limit,

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.720
I take the limit of that.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.580
The result is a
function that looks

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:40.160
very much like the decomposition
of a signal in terms

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.070
of the unit sample.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:48.200
In the previous case, we sum
together a weighted version

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.050
of a unit sample signal.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.630
Here the sum is
replaced by an integral,

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:55.425
and is weighted just
like it was before.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:04.180
The point is that the
mathematics for CT and DT

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.220
look very similar.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:11.950
I decompose in the case of the
CT, and arbitrary signal x of t

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:19.670
into an entire row of weighted
unit impulse functions.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.830
Once I have it in that
form, the argument's

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:25.820
precisely the same for
CT as it was in DT.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.940
Imagine that I have a linear
time invariant system.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.530
Linear means that I can
compute the response to a sum

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.860
as the sum of the responses.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.950
Time invariant means
that shifting the input

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.680
merely shifts the output.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.820
Doing the experiment
tomorrow is the same

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:49.010
as doing the experiment today,
except it's now a day later.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:53.330
So if the response
of a system is

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.510
h of t when the
input is delta of t,

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.495
if the system is shift
invariant, shifting this by tau

00:32:59.495 --> 00:33:01.095
is the same as
shifting that by tau.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:10.970
A weighted sum of such things is
a weighted sum of such things,

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.780
and a sum of such things
is the sum of such things,

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.760
so I get an
expression which we'll

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.570
think of as convolution for
CT that looks just the same.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:28.120
So in DT, we thought about
if you convolve x with h,

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.030
you take the first
index, x of n,

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:34.750
and turn it into x of
k, a dummy variable.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.900
You take the second
one, and do n minus k.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.540
Here we do the same
thing. t goes to tau,

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.158
and the second one
goes to t minus tau.

00:33:46.158 --> 00:33:48.476
The sum up here turns
into an integral.

00:33:48.476 --> 00:33:50.100
Otherwise, it's
exactly the same thing.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:58.610
So to show your mastery of
such things, what signal would

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.930
result if you convolved e
to the minus tu of t with e

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.185
to the minus tu of t?

00:34:04.185 --> 00:34:05.840
1, 2, 3, 4, or none?

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.260
Well, the place is
quiet so I assume

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.940
that means you stopped
talking, so that

00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:01.400
means you've all agreed, yes?

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.980
So which wave form
best represents

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:08.350
the convolution of the top
two signals, 1, 2, 3, or 4?

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.650
Almost 100% correct.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:16.830
Most people say 4.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:17.720
How do you get 4?

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.040
Yeah?

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.470
AUDIENCE: Same
reason [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.144
PROFESSOR: So what would I do?

00:36:31.144 --> 00:36:32.310
What would be my first step?

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.530
So I imagine that
I want to think

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:44.490
of flip so this gets multiplied
by the flip of the other one.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.900
So at time t equals
0, the answer is--

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.729
AUDIENCE: 0

00:36:49.729 --> 00:36:51.520
PROFESSOR: --0, because
there's no overlap.

00:36:54.316 --> 00:36:55.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.730
PROFESSOR: OK so
that it starts at 0,

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:00.540
so that means that this is out.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.590
OK, OK, OK, fine.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.380
Now shift.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.330
What do I shift?

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.484
Which one do I shift which way?

00:37:09.484 --> 00:37:13.510
AUDIENCE: Why is there a
[INAUDIBLE] flipping is there

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.760
a value that equals 0?

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.940
PROFESSOR: That's
a valid question.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:22.170
So the question is
if I'm integrating

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:26.220
over a function that goes from
minus infinity to 0, and from 0

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.220
to infinity.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.780
Let's say the answer
right at 0 is 1.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:35.190
You could say that
there is a single point

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:38.250
whose value is non-zero.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.940
What would happen if I
integrated a function that is 0

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.460
everywhere except at a point?

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:49.800
So it's 0 everywhere up to here,
then a 0 everywhere after that,

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.540
and at zero it's not zero.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.360
What's the integral of
a function that differs

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.090
from 0 at a single point?

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.380
PROFESSOR: 0, it's a little
bit of a trick question,

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.290
because we will later have some
functions for which that's not

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.090
true.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.004
What kind of a function
would that not be true for?

00:38:09.004 --> 00:38:10.812
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:10.812 --> 00:38:12.620
PROFESSOR: Delta.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:19.870
If I were convolving
delta with delta,

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:25.560
then you can integrate over
an infinitesimal area region,

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.230
and get something that's not 0.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.810
So a little bit of
a caveat, so as long

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.570
as the function
that I'm convolving

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.540
doesn't have an
impulse in it or worse.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.730
We will talk later in the
course about things worse

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.650
than impulses.

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:46.110
If there's nothing as high
as an impulse or worse,

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.770
so that has a step in it.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:51.090
We would think of a step
as a singularity that

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:56.550
is better, less ill
behaved than an impulse.

00:38:56.550 --> 00:39:02.220
As long as the function does
not have an impulse or a worse,

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:07.160
when you flip it, you'll get
zero contribution at zero.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.780
That all makes sense?

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.860
So this is zero at zero, but
the reasoning is a little bit

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:13.820
complicated.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:18.170
So now what do I get when t
gets a little bit bigger than 0?

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:21.680
What's the result of
convolving when the time is

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.870
slightly bigger than time 0?

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:29.920
All flip, shift,
multiply, integrate.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.610
So I have to shift
one of those, so now

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.570
instead of having this one, I
might have shifted a little bit

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.370
to the right.

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:41.190
So it might look like that.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:44.636
So now what happens
when I multiply?

00:39:44.636 --> 00:39:47.360
Well you don't get 0 anymore.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:52.280
So as for small t for t
on the order of epsilon,

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:57.510
how does the
integral grow with t?

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:01.421
So if I want to make a
plot of the convolution,

00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:03.170
so if I want to think
about e to the minus

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:11.990
tu of t convolved with e to
the minus tu of t versus t,

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:15.800
I already know that that's
like that for t small.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.940
How will the function grow?

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:26.850
Linear so if this
is very small then

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:34.050
the deviations from the height
which is 1 is very small.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:36.600
So if this distance is
small, the deviation

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.870
is that little triangle
which goes like t-square.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:45.015
So for t small t-square is
very small compared to t,

00:40:45.015 --> 00:40:48.960
I can ignore it,
and so the function

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.940
is going to start
going up like t,

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.720
and if you work out the details
it will eventually roll off.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.830
Because as you shift
it further and further,

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:05.840
the one exponential is in the
tail of the other exponential,

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.610
so one of the exponentials
kills the other one,

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.110
and so the response
goes to zero.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.066
If you're more
mathematically inclined, yes?

00:41:15.066 --> 00:41:17.298
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you were saying

00:41:17.298 --> 00:41:20.026
that if both functions
are left sided [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:20.026 --> 00:41:25.494
right sided it always starts
out t equals 0 is always 0.

00:41:25.494 --> 00:41:27.910
PROFESSOR: That's not quite
right because right sided just

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:31.520
means that the left is 0.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.940
So if I tell you that a signal
is right sided, all I've said

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:38.430
is that all of the non-zero
values are on the right,

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:42.330
but I haven't told you whether
they're impulses or not.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.310
Right sided says
something about the left.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.620
The left is zero.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:50.025
Kind of weird, so
if I'm right handed,

00:41:50.025 --> 00:41:51.900
I might as well not have
a left hand when I'm

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.910
writing so the left is zero.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:58.200
So right sided
signals have zeros.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.430
The signals on the left of
right sided signals are zero,

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.305
but I haven't told you
what was on the right.

00:42:04.305 --> 00:42:06.300
The right could be
an impulse or worse.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.770
So I just inferred
some properties

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:13.750
of what this convolution
is going to look like.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.250
If you were
mathematically inclined,

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:17.450
you could do it by math.

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:18.950
The math doesn't
look very different

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:23.000
from the math for
the discrete version.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.950
You simply write this as a
function of tau rather than t.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:31.100
This one as a function of
t minus tau rather than t.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.240
Recognize that the u's cut
off parts of the integral.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:42.040
This u is 1 only if
t is bigger than 0.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.010
So that lops off the
t less than 0 part.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:49.210
This lopped off the part bigger
than capital, bigger than t.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:53.460
So that leaves the
integrals 0 to t.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.680
Putting these two
together results

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.120
in the tau parts
killing each other,

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.500
so I'm left with only a t
part but the integrals on tau.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.980
So just like the other
one, the integral

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.990
goes to the integral
of 1 over finite limit

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:11.910
0 to t, so the answer is t.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:15.180
So the overall answer is
te to the minus tu of t

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.170
which is plotted here.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.320
So the point of today
then is that this

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:27.370
is a different representation
for the way systems work.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.900
It's often computationally
interesting.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.820
This is the way.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.320
This is a perfectly
plausible way

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.740
of doing discrete time
signal processing.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:40.780
Represent the system
by a signal h of n,

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.610
and then compute the response to
any signal by convolving h of n

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:47.410
with that signal.

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:50.570
Perfectly reasonable
way to compute things.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:52.930
Honestly, we'll find better
ways of computing things

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.820
by the end of the course.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.710
The real reason for studying
convolution is conceptually,

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:01.540
you can think about
how a system ought

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.349
to work by thinking
about convolution,

00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:05.890
and I want to show
an example of that

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:09.430
by thinking about systems
that I'm interested in.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:10.370
I do work on hearing.

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:14.560
I do work with microscopes,
and we can regard a microscope

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.550
as an LTI system.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.700
A linear time invariant
system, and convolution

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.735
is a very good way of thinking
about such optical systems.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:30.040
So the idea is that
even the best microscope

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:36.306
gives blurry images, and that's
very fundamental physics.

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:37.680
It has to do with
the diffraction

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.549
limit of optical systems.

00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:41.340
If you're interested
in that sort of thing,

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.970
take an optics course in
the physics department

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:48.730
or come to my lab
and do a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.760
So the idea is that even the
best microscopes in the world

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.260
are blurred.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.470
We have the best microscopes
in the world in my lab,

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.240
and they fundamentally
blur things,

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.760
and we have to worry about that.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.580
The blurring is
inversely related

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.070
to the numerical
aperture which has to do

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.870
with the size of the optic.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.890
Big optics are good.

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:14.180
So if you imagine
that a target emits

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.900
a spherical wave of light.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.870
So every point on the target
emits a spherical wave,

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:22.915
then there's some optic that's
collecting all of those waves,

00:45:22.915 --> 00:45:26.590
, and relaying them back
to a different point.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.150
The resolution of
the picture goes

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.540
with how many of those rays
the optic system picked up.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.630
So if you make the
optics smaller,

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:40.420
the picture becomes blurrier.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.400
If you make the
optic even smaller,

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.620
the picture becomes
even smaller,

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:49.800
and the way we think about
that is by convolution.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.810
We think about the
microscope as an LTI system,

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:57.920
so we characterize it by
its point spread function.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.484
We don't like to
use any words that

00:45:59.484 --> 00:46:00.650
come from a different field.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:04.230
Just like every other field,
we like to invent our own.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:09.050
So in optics, the thing that
we will call a impulse response

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:11.450
is called a point
spread function.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:14.570
It just says if you had
an ideal point of light,

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:17.750
what would the image look like?

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.370
It's exactly the
same as convolving,

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:22.670
so you can think of the blurry
image as the convolution

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:25.760
of the effect of the microscope,
the point spread function,

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.655
the impulse response
with the ideal target.

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:35.450
So then as you change
the size of the optic,

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:38.810
it changes the size of
the impulse response,

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:40.490
the point spread function.

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:43.820
Crummy optics, fat
point spread motions.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:48.410
Fat point spread
functions, blurry pictures,

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:51.290
and so here's a picture
of how our system works.

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:55.610
This is a
representation to scale

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:59.910
of a tiny microscopic bead
a fraction of a micron.

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:03.660
So it's about six times
smaller than the image.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.960
So this is an image taken
with our microscope system,

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.990
and you can see that
most of the energy

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.620
fits inside a region
about half a micron.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.470
World's best microscope,
you can't do better

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:17.780
than this by physics.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.110
This is using 500 nanometer
light, and the size of that

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:24.800
has to do with the length
scale of the light.

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.500
So you end up with this
particular microscope

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:33.530
not being able to make images
with less blurring than that.

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:35.637
That's the point
spread function.

00:47:35.637 --> 00:47:37.970
Now of course, the point
spread function of a microscope

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:40.370
is three dimensional.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:44.240
In this class, we're only
talking about 1-D time.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.620
In a microscope is
3D, x, y, and z.

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:53.240
So the impulse response
has extent in x, y, and z.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.870
So here is a picture taken
by Anthony Patire, who

00:47:55.870 --> 00:48:01.040
was a student in my lab of
that same tiny little dot.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.210
When the in-focus
plane shows the dot,

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:06.350
and as you go out
of focus, the dot

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.060
gets bigger, smearier,
and blurrier.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.980
What you can do then is
assemble those pictures that

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.820
were taken one of the
time into a 3-D volume,

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.750
and that 3-D volume then
represents the point spread

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.490
function or the three
dimensional impulse

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:26.420
response of the microscope.

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.630
So the idea then is that
convolution is a very good way

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:31.770
to think about optical
systems because they

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:34.820
are very easy to relate
to the underlying physics.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:39.860
The blurring is a direct result
of a fundamental property

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:40.580
of light.

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:43.490
The diffraction limit, and
you can very accurately

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:45.350
represent the effect
of the blurring

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:48.590
as convolving with a point
spread function and impulse

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:50.150
response.

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:53.240
Same sort of thing applies
to optics at any scale.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.270
So going from the microscopic
to the rather macroscopic-- that

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:59.330
is to say the
universe and beyond.

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:02.000
We can think about the
Hubble Space Telescope.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.030
Same thing.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:08.030
Light, that's all that
matters, and here the issue

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.910
is-- the reason they wanted
to make a Space Telescope

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.520
is that there are two
principal sources of blurring

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.940
for a ground based telescope.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.340
One is the atmosphere
blurring, because we're

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.250
looking through an atmosphere
and other is blurring because

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:26.600
of the property of the optic
elements in the telescope,

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.630
and it turns out
pretty easy to show

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:33.410
that the combined effect of
the atmosphere and the lenses

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:36.650
is the convolution of
the individual parts.

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:39.350
You can think about
atmospheric blurring

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:41.510
as convolving with the
atmosphere's point spread

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:46.350
function, and you can
think of the blurring

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:50.690
due to the microscope as
convolving with the blurring

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.360
function due to optics.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.330
The combined is the
convolution of those

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:59.360
which means that if
you've got some amount

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:04.820
of atmospheric blurring
and a telescope made out

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:11.310
of 12 centimeter optics, then
the combined responses showed

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:16.360
here not very different
from each individual.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.620
But if you made
a big telescope--

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.870
a one meter type
telescope-- you might be

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:24.210
expecting this much blurring.

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:27.240
But because of the atmosphere,
you get much more blurring.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.600
So the deviation between
the small telescope,

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.780
and what you actually measure
is not very different.

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.970
The atmosphere makes
an enormous difference

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:40.500
when you start talking about
a high resolution telescope.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.250
That's the reason for
putting it in space.

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:43.830
You get rid of the atmosphere.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.190
The Hubble Space Telescope
was made principally

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.160
out of two big mirrors,
both were parabolic,

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.490
both were highly optimized,
both were enormous.

00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:00.390
This is the main lens.

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:05.110
The lens is 2.4 meters,
about eight feet in diameter,

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:07.930
and it was
astonishing the thing.

00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:12.470
So in order for a lens to work
perfectly like I illustrated,

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.400
it's important that
every reflection

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.610
remain in phase coherence.

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:21.660
So the length that
every ray travels

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.200
has to be precisely matched
to what it's supposed to be.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.910
In the case of the Hubble,
they matched the surface.

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:33.250
The surface was controlled
to within 10 nanometers.

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:35.280
That's absurd.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:40.540
So the blurring of my microscope
was about half a micron.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.050
So 50 times worse.

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:45.360
The best I could see
with my microscope

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.820
is 50 times worse
than was required

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.890
for making this mirror.

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:53.220
It was absolutely astonishing
feat to make the mirror

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:56.530
and they made a mistake.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.170
So when they put
this in space, they

00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:00.165
were expecting to see
pictures like this.

00:52:00.165 --> 00:52:03.090
This is a picture
of a distant star.

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:05.820
They were expecting the distant
star would look like this.

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.320
This is what they
actually measured,

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.680
and the reason was
that the feedback

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.230
system that they used
to grind the lens

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:17.980
made a mistake by 2.2 microns.

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:21.420
2.2 microns would have
been just barely resolvable

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:25.300
on my microscope, but barely.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.970
So the hair?

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:30.360
That's about 100
microns in diameter.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:35.310
They were off by 2.2
microns, and because of that,

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:38.560
it was like a complete disaster.

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:43.420
So that small error was enough
to make the images terrible.

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.770
So the solution-- it wasn't
very practical to ship up

00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:50.910
a new lens, so they
shipped up eyeglasses.

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:53.400
The eyeglasses was
another transformation,

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.530
just like your eyeglasses.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:59.190
Your eyeglasses work by changing
the point spread function that

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:02.100
is determined by your
retina and your lens

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.500
into a new point
spread function.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.840
They shipped up
eyeglasses, and the result

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.300
of putting the
eyeglasses into Hubble

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.090
was to turn this into
that, and to give

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:15.820
some of the most dazzling
pictures we've ever had.

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:19.710
So the point is that
convolution is a complete way

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:21.220
of describing a system.

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.690
It's a very intuitive way
for certain kinds of systems,

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:26.670
and it's especially
useful for systems

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.460
like light based
systems where blurring

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.930
is a natural way of thinking
about the way the system works.

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:34.890
Have a good time.

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:37.820
See you tomorrow at 7:30.
