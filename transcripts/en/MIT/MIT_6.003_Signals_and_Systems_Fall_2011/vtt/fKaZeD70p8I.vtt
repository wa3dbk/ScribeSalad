00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.640
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
hello and welcome.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.100
No particular announcements
today other than,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.186
in the unrelenting
tradition of MIT,

00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:36.060
we're going to forge
straight ahead, and keep

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.054
going with new material.

00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:41.220
Today, we're going to talk
about frequency response.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.760
And just to set the context,
remember that last time we

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.170
talked about a way to
characterize a system,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.980
in terms of a single signal.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.230
By knowing the impulse
response of a CTE system,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.010
you could characterize
the response to any system

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.820
by thinking about the
response to any signal

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.519
by thinking about the output as
the convolution of the impulse

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.510
response with the input signal.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.030
And that gave rise to a
very compact way of thinking

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.550
about the output of a system.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.380
We think about the
output y as being

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.940
x convolved with h, regardless
of whether it's dt or ct.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.210
And the way that you
carry out that convolution

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.420
is, in fact, very similar
in the two systems.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.980
That way of thinking
about a system

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.830
is particularly useful for
certain kinds of systems.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.070
The examples we looked at
last time were optical.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.170
In the case of an
optical microscope,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.480
it's very convenient to
think about the effect

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.070
of the microscope is
to blur the target.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.960
So whatever the target was,
it always comes out blurrier,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.210
and that blur function is
something that in optics we

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.501
call the point spread function.

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:59.520
The point spread
function in 6003 terms

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.960
is simply the three
dimensional impulse response.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.060
We can think about three
dimensions very similar

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.726
to the way we think
about one dimension.

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:09.900
And in fact, in the next
homework assignment--

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.840
which amazingly enough
is already issued.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.390
So in the next
homework assignment

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.147
we'll think about two
dimensional signal processing.

00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:21.480
And the difference between
one and two is not very much,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.146
and the difference
between two and three

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:27.910
is even less than the
difference between one and two.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.620
So we'll be able to think
about an optical system

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.790
purely in terms of
the impulse response,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.180
and that's particularly useful,
because it's so intuitive.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.210
Since the effect of the
optical system is to blur,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.197
the impulse response is a direct
measure of how much it blurs.

00:02:47.197 --> 00:02:48.780
That's true, not
only for microscopes,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.520
but it's true for
optics, in general.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.640
Imaging with light, it's
a fundamental principle

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.880
that derives from the
wavelength, the coherent nature

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.320
of light.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.650
And here's an example taken
from the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.050
where we see that there
is much more blurring

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.340
from a ground based microscope
than there is from the Hubble,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.150
simply because the blurring
is the result of two things.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.910
Generally speaking, if you
have a ground based system then

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.030
there's two kinds of blurring
that we usually think about,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.510
blurring to the atmosphere
and bouncing off

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.600
particles in the
atmosphere, and blurring

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.589
due to the optics, the same
as it was in the microscope.

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.880
By going to space, we completely
eliminate the blurring

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.350
in the atmosphere,
and so we're left

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.960
with what can be a much
sharper point spread function.

00:03:39.247 --> 00:03:41.580
Today, we're going to look
at a completely different way

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.010
of thinking about a system.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.210
Rather than thinking, what we
will call in the time domain,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.067
h of t was a function of time.

00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:52.900
The impulse response
was a function of time.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.540
We think about that as time
domain signal processing.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.290
Rather than thinking
about the time today,

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.110
we'll think about
the frequency domain.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.310
Frequency domain,
just like time domain,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.750
is very convenient for certain
kinds of signal processing

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.040
tasks.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.370
One very natural
example is audio.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.710
You all have lots of
familiarity with this.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.200
What I'm going to do
now, to prove to you

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.769
that you have
great intuition, is

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.470
I'm going to play
a clip followed

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.890
by the same clip processed
in four different-- in two

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.450
different ways.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.680
All right.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.060
Clip-- so original clip 2.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.090
And clip 1 and clip 2 will
have some transformation

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.650
applied to it.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.770
Either the high frequencies
HF or the low frequencies LF

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.550
will be increased up arrow
or decreased down arrow.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.820
OK?

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.740
Is that clear?

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.190
So I'm going to first play of
the original, then play clip 1.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.832
You should decide
whether the clip 1

00:04:57.832 --> 00:04:59.790
sounds like the high
frequencies are increased,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.140
the high frequencies
are decreased,

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.556
the low frequencies
are increased,

00:05:02.556 --> 00:05:06.990
the low frequencies are
decreased, or none of those.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.325
Then I'll play the original
clip 1, original clip 2.

00:05:11.325 --> 00:05:13.700
So there's going to be two
answers, what happened to clip

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.750
1, what happened to clip 2.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.250
OK.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.120
Nod your head yes, everybody
knows what's going to happen.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.250
OK, now everybody listen.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.160
So you're supposed figure out
two different answers, what

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.579
happened to clip 1, and
what happened to clip 2.

This is the part that you
blame on your neighbor.

00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:47.222
OK, no don't.

00:06:47.222 --> 00:06:48.680
Talk to your
neighbor, that way you

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.580
can blame it on your neighbor.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.621
Yeah, I forgot that part.

00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:53.267
OK, talk to your neighbor.

[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.465
OK, everybody raise your
hands what happened,

00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:40.590
and if you're wrong just
blame it on your neighbor.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.254
Just point to your neighbor
as you raise your hand, right,

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.670
and I'll understand
what you mean.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.622
OK, you're only
about a half right,

00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:52.080
you're supposed to
be young people.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.230
I'm old, I'm not supposed
to understand these things.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.420
So you're about half right.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.030
So now let's see maybe
I can do it again.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.750
So listen again.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.410
I know the problem.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.789
The problem is-- does
anybody know the title

00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:27.580
through this piece?

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.972
AUDIENCE: No.

00:09:28.972 --> 00:09:30.430
DENNIS FREEMAN:
That's the problem.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.410
It's 1970s, I wasn't thinking.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.160
This was new in 1970.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.960
I heard it when I was in--

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.495
but anyway.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:38.995
OK.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:39.828
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:09:39.828 --> 00:09:42.690
DENNIS FREEMAN: The answer was.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.800
The answer is that one.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.950
OK, so the high frequencies
in clip one were increased.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.470
If you heard sort of a
tapping in the background,

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.500
kind of a symbol
thing that was louder,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.560
because the high
frequencies were enhanced.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.990
In the second part, it
sounded sort of similar,

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.370
except the volume was lower.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.600
That's because I killed
the low frequencies.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.570
OK.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.090
So in the first part the high
frequencies were increased.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.240
In the second part the low
frequencies were decreased.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.500
And I'll assume that if I
had done the updated music,

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.499
you would have got that.

00:10:14.499 --> 00:10:19.740
So I assume that you all got
100% correct, and we'll go on.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.778
So the-- yes, please.

00:10:23.778 --> 00:10:25.694
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about when you say

00:10:25.694 --> 00:10:27.044
increasing degrees [INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:28.210
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yes, you do.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.683
AUDIENCE: And what that
include the amplitude

00:10:29.683 --> 00:10:31.046
when you say increasing degrees?

00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:32.920
DENNIS FREEMAN: Will be
a little more clear--

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.253
So the question was, when I
say increasing degrees, what

00:10:35.253 --> 00:10:36.620
exactly do I mean by that.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.550
What I meant was the
magnitude of the frequency

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.440
components was increased.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.740
We'll be saying-- we'll be
developing some language,

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.040
in the next 40 minutes, that
will make that statement more

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.040
precise, OK.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.449
So the idea here was to give
you an intuitive feeling

00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:55.240
for something that will
make mathematically

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.950
more rigorous as we go along.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.950
By the end of the hour it
should be completely clear

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.740
what I mean by high frequencies
increased or low frequencies

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.460
decreased.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.610
If it's not tell me.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.440
So the idea then, in
frequency analysis,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.504
is to think about the
input as frequencies.

00:11:12.504 --> 00:11:14.170
Think about the input
being cos omega t,

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.260
and then think about
what the system

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.910
would do to a signal that
was of the form cos omega t.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.680
We'll find out, as we
go through the hour,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.740
that the signal that comes out
of a linear time invariance

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.330
system, when the
input is cos omega t,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.180
is also cos omega
t of frequent--

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.740
it's a signal with
the same frequency.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.940
However, the amplitude
and the phase--

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.010
that which sort of
addresses your question.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.000
The amplitude and the
phase can be different.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.375
Linear time
invariant systems can

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:49.360
change the amplitude and
phase, but not the frequency

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.060
of a pure sinusoid.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.810
So then the trick in
thinking about what

00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.010
linear time the invariant
system does, to a sinusoid,

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.690
is thinking about how's
the magnitude to change,

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.910
and how's the frequency change.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.620
So motivate that a
little more, well, I

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.500
want to think about mass,
spring, dashpot system.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.164
We talked about this before.

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:13.830
If I think about the
input of the system

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.232
being the position of
the top of the spring,

00:12:18.232 --> 00:12:20.190
and if I think about the
response of the system

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:25.050
being the position
of the mass, then I

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.230
can characterize that system as
a linear time invariant system.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.830
And I can think about how
does the amplitude change

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:36.160
and how does the phase change,
as a function of frequency

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.060
of the sinusoid.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.860
OK, this is just like
the music example,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.420
but this time it's mechanical.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.050
And what I want to do
first is do a demonstration

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:51.000
of figuring out the frequency
response for a physical system.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.910
OK, so here's my
mass, spring, dashpot.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.800
Hopefully, you can all see that.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:01.080
It is 10 loops of a slinky
connected up to a bolt.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:06.540
And the idea is that
I want to characterize

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.910
how does the magnitude
of the response change,

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.740
as a function of
frequency, and how

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.870
does the phase of
the response change,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.970
as a function of frequency.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.560
So if I turn it on
to a low frequency--

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:27.700
[MOTOR BUZZING]

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.060
OK, so I've got a low
voltage going to the motor.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.340
The motor has got a cam on it.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.600
The cam's turning, that's
giving the sinusoidal motion

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.500
up and down.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.550
If you have very
good eyes, you should

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.508
be able to see this a
little knot in the string

00:13:37.508 --> 00:13:40.440
is going up and down,
that's my input.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.830
Because the cam is not
changing physically,

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.510
as I change the
speed of the motor,

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:48.510
the amplitude of the
sinusoid won't change,

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.710
but the frequency will.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.540
That's the idea.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.070
OK, so what you're
supposed to do

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.910
is this is x and that's y,
how would you characterize

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.609
the magnitude of the response
as the ratio of the magnitude

00:14:00.609 --> 00:14:01.650
of the input, the output?

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.540
They're the same.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:11.190
So the magnitude for this low
frequency, the magnitude is 1.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.550
How about the phase
relationship between the two?

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.319
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:16.319 --> 00:14:18.360
DENNIS FREEMAN: They're
in phase with each other.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.730
Right, when one goes up,
the other one goes up.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:25.500
So at these low frequencies,
the magnitude starts out at 1,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.100
and the phase starts out at 0.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.760
Now I'll increase the speed.

[MOTOR BUZZING]

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.270
Now what?

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.476

it's up a little bit.

So the magnitude
is up a little bit.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.583
How about the phase?

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.979
How about the phase?

kind of similar.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.720
I'll just put a big dot.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.808
OK, so now I'll turn up
the speed a little more.

DENNIS FREEMAN:
Yeah, went way up.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.840
So it came up here
someplace, right.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.888
How about the phase?

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.035
DENNIS FREEMAN:
It's totally-- it's

00:15:54.035 --> 00:15:55.284
going completely out of phase.

00:15:55.284 --> 00:15:58.190
So the phase-- in fact,
we will call that a lag,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.870
but that's not
perfectly clear now.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.810
We'll see later why I'm
going to call it that.

this is 4 1/2 volts.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.140
If I go to a higher frequency--

[MOTOR BUZZING]

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.580
Ooh, funky.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.200

of sync of what?

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.220
It's only got one input.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.618
How can it be out of sync?

00:16:28.618 --> 00:16:30.052
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:35.352 --> 00:16:36.810
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
it's remembering

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.200
some of the response
that it had before.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.854
Right, so I really have to wait
for the old response to die.

00:16:42.854 --> 00:16:44.520
If I were to kill the
input, it wouldn't

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.700
stop moving right away.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.810
Right, so it's-- so the response
to the previous input is

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.960
interfering with the response
to the current input.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.040
If I wait long enough,
it ought to settle down.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.670
OK, magnitude up or down?

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.780
DENNIS FREEMAN: Compared to one?

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.589
It's still down.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.849
It's down even compared to one.

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:08.574
How about phase?

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.700
DENNIS FREEMAN: So it's
almost out of phase.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.760
Out of phase would be
the top is going up,

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.720
while the bottom is going down.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.670
So it's almost out of phase,
so there's even more delay.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.200
OK, so that's the idea.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.500
So that's-- what this is
supposed to motivate is why we

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.530
like to think about systems in
terms of frequency response.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.760
It's a natural way to think
of certain kinds of systems.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.870
Just like the time response,
the impulse response,

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.360
the time domain
thinking convolution,

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.450
was a convenient way to think
about some kinds of systems,

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.040
the optical system.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.780
Frequency response is
a good way to think

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.580
about some kinds of systems.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.687
Here's one.

00:17:54.687 --> 00:17:56.520
The reason it's a good
way to think about it

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.060
is that this particular
system had a big response

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.640
at a certain frequency.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.390
OK, now for something that
has nothing to do with 003.

Yes.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.641
DENNIS FREEMAN: It keep
it-- so it somewhat

00:18:16.641 --> 00:18:17.895
stabilizes it, that's correct.

00:18:17.895 --> 00:18:19.110
AUDIENCE: See it better?

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.860
DENNIS FREEMAN: See
it better that's true,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.720
but then I should've
put one up here too.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.020
But of course, who
knows, I make mistakes.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:26.590
Yes.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.320
DENNIS FREEMAN: Damping.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:28.945
What's damping?

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.710
So damping controls
how big the amplitude

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.020
got at the resonance frequency.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.850
Without the CD, it went crazy.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:43.350
Right.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.650
In order to get the
response to be less

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.340
than the elongation
of the spring,

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.980
I had to make the
displacements tiny, tiny, tiny

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.910
without the CD.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.040
So the CD was putting
some damping--

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.950
air resistance.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.980
OK.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.210
Loss-- So in physics terms,
the mass and the spring

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.420
are lossless, no
energy goes away.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.360
I'm continuously pumping
energy into it from the motor.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.180
The response gets bigger and
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:17.620
With the CD, there's loss,
because of viscosity loss

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.210
to the air.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.990
And so that means that it
doesn't reach as high a peak,

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.800
as it would have otherwise.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.080
OK?

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.860
OK.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.080
So now what I want
to do is think

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.470
about having measured it, let's
think about calculating it.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.184
Let's calculate the
frequency response.

00:19:35.184 --> 00:19:36.850
We have a number of
ways we could do it,

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.455
because we have
all those boxes, we

00:19:38.455 --> 00:19:39.830
have all the
different methods we

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.120
thought about for
characterizing systems.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.990
So for example, we could figure
out the differential equation

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.590
for the system, and
we could solve it

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:54.480
with a particular
input, cos omega t.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.570
That's one way to do it.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.486
Another way we could do
it is find the impulse

00:19:57.486 --> 00:19:58.222
to the system--

00:19:58.222 --> 00:20:00.180
the impulse response of
the system, and then we

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.740
could convolve.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.600
Right, we're all very familiar,
we could do all those things.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.810
So rather than doing something
we know how to do, what I'll do

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.610
is something that we
don't know how to do.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.280
I'll use a different
method, which

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.802
has to do with eigenfunctions
and eigenvalues.

00:20:13.802 --> 00:20:15.510
And we'll see why
that's a convenient way

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.002
of thinking about frequency
response in just a minute.

00:20:19.002 --> 00:20:20.460
So we'll be define
in eigenfunction

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.450
to be sort of the same thing
as we do in linear algebra.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.240
So it's very much
the same concept.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.050
We think about if
we have a system

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.440
and if we put in an
input, and the output

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:37.470
has the same shape as the input,
just changed in amplitude,

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.580
then we will say the input
was an eigenfunction.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.880
And the change in amplitude
was the eigenvalue.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.720
So you put in x of t,
you get out then x of t.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.490
Same idea that we have in
linear algebra for eigenvalues.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.720
OK?

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.540
So that's the idea.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.030
And it turns out that
certain very common functions

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:05.190
are eigenfunctions of linear
time invariant systems.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.210
Consider this system,
y dot plus 2 y is x.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.470
Figure out if any of these
functions, e to the minus c,

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.020
e to the t, e to the
jt, cos t, or u of t.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.945
Are any of those functions
eigenfunctions of that system?

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.440
And the answer is
yes, and so the answer

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.314
is really which ones?

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.267
So how do I think about
is e to the minus t

00:23:17.267 --> 00:23:18.600
an eigenfunction of that system?

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.308
What should I do?

00:23:22.862 --> 00:23:24.570
Let's think about--
how many think it is?

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.330
How many think it isn't?

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:30.940
OK, it must be, right.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.360
Crowdsourcing, it
has to be true.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.740
So how do I think about that?

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.320
How could I set that up to
convince somebody else that it

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.790
is or is not an eigenfunction?

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.611
What would I do?

00:23:43.611 --> 00:23:44.110
Yes.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:50.110
DENNIS FREEMAN: Close.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.525
So what should I make x be?

00:23:52.525 --> 00:23:55.171
AUDIENCE: So you make
x be either negative t

00:23:55.171 --> 00:23:59.610
or make y be
[INAUDIBLE] negative t.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:00.610
DENNIS FREEMAN: Exactly.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.688
So then y dot would be--

00:24:03.688 --> 00:24:07.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.810
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
now if I plug that in,

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.610
I get y dot minus
lambda e to the minus--

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:17.740
e to the minus t plus 2 y plus
2 lambda e to the minus t,

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.450
should be e to the minus t.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.520
Is that true for any lambda?

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.290
What should lambda be?

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:24.040
1.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.070
So the answer is
yes, this is true,

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:30.440
and lambda would have to
be 1 for that to be true.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.380
How about this guy?

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.000
Same thing, lambda
comes out the same?

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:41.050
What's lambda for
the second line?

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:41.950
AUDIENCE: 1/3.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:43.510
DENNIS FREEMAN: 1/3, yeah.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.600
So now we have to use
x is e to the t lambda

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.757
e to the t lambda e to the t.

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:52.590
Did I do that right?

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.090
Yeah.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:57.040
So now we have lambda
plus 2 lambda e to the t,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.870
should be e to the t.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:03.030
So lambda's going to
have to be 1/3 this time.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.480
OK.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.160
How about this guy?

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:07.760
What's lambda?

00:25:12.657 --> 00:25:13.740
AUDIENCE: 1 over 2 plus j?

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.980
DENNIS FREEMAN: 1 over
2 plus j, exactly.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.167
Everybody see that?

00:25:19.167 --> 00:25:19.875
How about cosine?

00:25:23.429 --> 00:25:32.200
Yes, no, I'd like
to break the tie.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.480
So there's a tie, the yes's
and the no's are equal.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.220
So what do I do?

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:40.942
You do the same thing,
right, no difference.

00:25:40.942 --> 00:25:42.810
Oops, a little too hard.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:49.290
So I want to say
that x is cos right.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:54.270
So y should be lambda cos.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.590
So y dot should be--

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.680
lambda sine minus, right.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.250
So then I need y dot
minus lambda sine

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:13.060
t plus twice, this
one, lambda cosine t,

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.290
should be that one, cosine t.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:17.414
What should lambda be?

00:26:20.318 --> 00:26:22.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.100
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Complex exponentials.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.720
So if you're willing to somehow
think about something over here

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.540
is imaginary, maybe
you can do that.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.910
If you think about these
as purely real functions,

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.410
there's no real--

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.780
there's no way to take a
cosine and turn it into a sine.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.320
That's actually why we like
the complex numbers, right.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.820
Had we thought about the
cosine as the sum of these,

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.905
if we had thought about cosine
t as e to the j t plus--

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.490
minus j t by 2, if we had
thought about it that way,

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.900
it would have
actually turned out

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.900
that we could think about
the complex exponentials

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.120
as being eigenfunctions.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.570
But the cosine function
itself, thought of it

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.290
as a strictly real
function, there's

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:12.090
no way you could choose
the constants to get rid

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:16.180
of the phase shift that would
be introduced by the sine.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.920
OK, if we call the
phase of this 0,

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.574
this is phase shifted 90
degrees relative to that,

00:27:21.574 --> 00:27:23.740
and there's no way that I
could choose a real number

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.750
lambda to make that
come out with 0 phase.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.160
OK.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.716
How about u of t?

00:27:33.716 --> 00:27:34.550
Im function?

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.720
Same thing, right.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.060
I would think of
the input is u of t,

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:47.360
the output is lambda u of t,
the derivative of the output.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:53.440
If the output is lambda u
of t, what's the derivative?

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.330
Lambda delta.

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.380
So I'm left with trying
to make a lambda--

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.000
left with trying to
make a u function out

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.730
of the sum of a delta
and a u, and there's

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.710
no way you can do that.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:11.620
So the answer is that the
first three are eigenfunctions,

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:15.510
and the last two are not.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.870
OK.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.419
So now what's this have to do--

00:28:18.419 --> 00:28:19.960
I mean, I set this
all up by thinking

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.400
about frequency response.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.660
So what we want to do is make
the connection between the two.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.390
The first step in the connection
is complex exponentials,

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.600
just like I'm
motivated here, right.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.970
So the complex exponentials--

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:41.840
so it turns out that
all complex exponentials

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.110
are eigenfunctions to all
linear time invariant systems.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.780
That's kind of amazing.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.720
That follows very directly
from what we did last lecture.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.270
If we think about a linear
time invariant system

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.790
as having an impulse
response, then we

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:59.840
can find the response
to the system,

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.290
with the impulse response h
of t, by convolving h of t

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.900
with the input, which is
a complex exponential.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.480
So if I say that my
input is e to the st,

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.460
and that my response
is characterized

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.650
by the impulse response h of t,
all I need to do is convolve.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.630
So I convolve h,
whatever it is, with x,

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.060
which is e to the minus st.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.560
You remember that
when you convolve,

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.690
you do the funny
things with the axes.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.230
So instead of thinking about e
to the s t as a function of t,

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.714
I think about it as the
function of t minus tau.

00:29:32.714 --> 00:29:34.880
Instead of thinking about
h of t as a function of t,

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.200
I think of it as h of tau,
and I run an integral.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.710
And because of the special form
of the exponential function--

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.984
which is no coincidence.

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:47.900
Because of the special
form of the exponential

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.650
function the e to
the st factors out.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.240
So then I'm left with something
that the integral, the function

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.550
of tau, the taus all go away.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:03.000
I'm left with purely
a function of s.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.460
And in fact, it's
extraordinarily friendly.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.310
If I put in e to the st into a
linear time invariant system,

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.550
characterized by h
of t, then the output

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:17.340
has the shape e to the st,
and the eigenvalue is h of s.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.890
Amazing.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.080
It's the value of the system
function, the same thing we've

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.520
been doing since
week two, evaluated

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.890
at the s that is the exponent
in the complex exponential

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.990
of interest.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:37.710
In my opinion, that's
wholly remarkable.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:42.150
Then, knowing that we
can form sinusoids out

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:46.080
of complex exponentials,
the problem is done.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.210
All complex exponentials
are eigenfunctions

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:51.180
of all LTI systems.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.510
And I can write--

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.540
I can always write
an eternal sine wave

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.970
in terms of a
complex exponential,

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.430
by using Euler's expression.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.320
And so I'm done.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.990
Furthermore, the eigenvalues
that I need to do this

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:08.400
are trivial, they're the
value of the system function.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:15.690
That's even easier in the
case that the LTI system

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:20.250
can be written as a system of
partial differential equations

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.160
with constant coefficients.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.350
When that is true-- that
is not all-- that is not

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.230
true for all LTI systems.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.520
What I've said with
the convolved part,

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.850
that's true for all LTI systems.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.790
If I specialize it to the
case that the system can

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.680
be represented by a
linear differential

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.520
equation with
constant coefficients,

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.830
then the system
function is always

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.690
a rational polynomial in s.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:52.950
It's always the ratio
of two polynomials in s.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.280
The reason that's interesting
is that we can factor it.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.750
The reason that's interesting
is that each of those factors

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:07.700
has a very simple
geometric interpretation.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.140
So what-- so if I can represent
the LTI system in terms

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:15.160
of a system of linear
differential equations

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.580
with constant coefficients,
then the transfer-- then

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.760
the system function
has to shape,

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.512
has the form of a
rational polynomial in s.

00:32:23.512 --> 00:32:25.720
By fundamental theorem in
algebra, and by the factors

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.710
here, I can factor it.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.980
Makes it look like that,
and then each of these terms

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.215
looks like a vector
in the s plane.

00:32:37.187 --> 00:32:39.520
Difference between two complex
numbers, that's a vector.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.820
So for example, if I
wanted to think about--

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:53.210
here's a system, a
single pole at minus 2.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:58.870
Say I wanted to find the output
when the input is e to 2 j t.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:02.120
E to the 2 jt is a
complex exponential.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.840
The system is linear
in time invariant,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.930
therefore I know that
the complex exponential

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:09.840
is an eigenfunction.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.990
Therefore, all I need to
do is find the eigenvalue.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.120
The eigenvalue is the
value of the system

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.930
function at the s in question.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:20.330
So all I need to do is
look at this diagram,

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.940
and I have the entire picture.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.880
The system is a single
pole at minus 2.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.830
That's the x.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:35.500
I want to know the response when
the input is e to the j 2 t.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:41.020
So the s in question
is s equals 2 j.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.680
So it's that point right there.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.060
So all I need to know is
the length and direction

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.070
of the vector that
connects the pole

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.380
to the frequency of interest.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:58.090
The length of that vector is 2
route 2, the angle is plus 45.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.430
It's a pole, so
that contributions

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.560
in the denominator.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.010
So the eigenvalue
is 1 over the length

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:11.690
of the vector, because it's
a pole, and minus the angle,

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:13.699
because it's the denominator.

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:15.800
Is that clear?

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.570
Point is it's really easy
to do, that's why we do it.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:22.790
We only do things in this
class that are easy to do.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.219
And you can then
divide and conquer.

00:34:27.759 --> 00:34:30.050
If you have a system that's
linear time invariant, that

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.750
can be represented by a
system of linear differential

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:38.370
equations constant coefficients,
rational polynomial s factor,

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.230
do it for each factor.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.537
Do the same thing I just
did for each factor.

00:34:42.537 --> 00:34:45.120
The magnitude of the response
is the product of the magnitudes

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.078
of each of those parts.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.159
The angle of the
response is the sum

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:55.260
of the angles of
all of those parts.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.100
So the idea is that
it's very simple.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:04.140
One last step-- if I'm
interested in eternal

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:08.840
of sine waves, like I was
for the motor example, then

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.210
I'll always be interested,
according to Euler,

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:17.320
in two complex exponentials.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.257
So if I were interested
in cos omeganaut t,

00:35:19.257 --> 00:35:21.340
I would be interested in
the complex exponential e

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:25.660
to the j, omeganaut
t, and e to the minus

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:31.180
j omeganaut t, because I need
both of those in order to sum--

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.195
to get the purely real
function cos omeganaut t.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:39.030
So that means then, I
can write the response

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:46.260
to this eternal cosine wave as
simply the sum of the system

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.450
function evaluated at j omegnaut
times e to the j omeganaut t,

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.170
and the system of
function evaluated at s

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:58.045
equals minus j omeganaut times
e to the minus j omeganaut t.

00:35:58.045 --> 00:35:59.130
Done, I have the answer.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:11.020
It's even easier, because
the system function

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.780
has a symmetry that we
call conjugate symmetry.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:18.820
That's easy to show
also by convolution,

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.470
that's why we did
convolution before we

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:21.880
did frequency response.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.640
You can prove the properties
of a frequency response

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.350
by resorting back
to convolution.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.620
Convolution is a very
powerful thought tool.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.300
Less powerful as a
computational tool,

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.560
very powerful thought tool.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.490
So here again, if we think
about the system function

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.870
is the Laplace
transform of h of t--

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.170
you remember that
from two lectures ago.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:48.850
System function is always the
Laplace transform of h of t.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:50.980
If I have a physical
system, like the mass spring

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:56.560
dashpot, h of t is real,
how could it be complex.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.600
H of t is the response when
I have a particular input.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.930
The response of a
real system is real.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:06.830
So if I have a system that
is real, then h of t is real.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.720
If I'm interested
in frequencies that

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.910
are the negative of each
other, plus or minus

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:20.970
j omeganaut in order to
form cos omeganaut t,

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.640
then I'm interested in two
different system functions,

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.810
h of j omega and h of
minus j omega, which

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.560
happen to be complex
conjugates of each other.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.550
Since the h of t is real--

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:36.930
I just argued that for
a physical system h of t

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.610
has to be real.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:43.340
If h of t is real, then the only
j in this equation is that one.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.460
It's negative here, so
therefore negating j

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:51.820
is the same as taking
the complex conjugate.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.990
So I don't really have to
compute two different system

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:57.900
functions, two
different eigenvalues.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.170
One is the complex
conjugate of the other.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:08.300
That means that the response
to the sum simplifies.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.490
So if I want to
think about the input

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.060
for-- if I want to think about
the input as an eternal cosine

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.800
wave, cos omeganaut
t for all time,

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.340
I write that by Euler, this way.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:28.060
I know from this eigenvalue
eigenfunction idea

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.320
that the response to this
guy can be written this way.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.760
It's a complex exponential.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.219
Complex exponentials are
eigenfunctions of LTI systems,

00:38:38.219 --> 00:38:40.135
so it has the same shape
in an eigenfunction--

00:38:40.135 --> 00:38:43.610
in an eigenvalues, sorry.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:45.350
This one can be
written similarly,

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:48.850
except there's a minus sign.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.890
Because this is the
complex conjugate of this,

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.900
and this is the complex
conjugate of that,

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:58.550
I've got the sum of a number
and its complex conjugate.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.620
The sum of a number and
its complex conjugate

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.610
is just the real
part of that number.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:11.190
Then this h, this eigenvalue,
the system function

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:15.030
evaluated at j omeganaut, has
a magnitude and then angle.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.440
If I write the system function
in terms of its magnitude

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.300
and angle, I can factor the
magnitude out of the real part,

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:31.270
and combine the angle by Euler
with the angle that generates

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:35.730
the cosine wave, j omeganaut t.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.750
And I'm left with
my final answer,

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.070
that you can compute the output
as the magnitude of a system

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:45.980
function evaluated
as j omeganaut,

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.270
with a phase shift on the cosine
that's equal to the angle of h

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.490
of j omeganaut.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.980
So this is the final answer.

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.160
If I want to think about
the frequency response--

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.760
if I want to think about how
this system has a response that

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:08.820
depends on frequency, I think
about the cos omega t going in,

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:13.260
and what comes out
is also cos omega t--

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.480
cos omega t.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.240
Except the magnitudes change
by the magnitude of the system

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.290
function, and the phase
is changed by the phase

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:23.820
of the system function.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.390
That's this thing I
said back on slide 2.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:32.430
Sine in, sine out, however the
magnitude can possibly change,

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.280
and the angle, the phase
can possibly change,

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.560
but the frequency cannot change.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:42.060
Omega went in, omega comes out.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.920
OK?

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.680
So that leads to a very
easy way of thinking

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:51.135
about frequency responses, in
terms of pole-zero diagrams.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:58.610
The idea is if you think
about the pole-zero diagram--

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:02.060
if the system can be represented
by a linear differential

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.610
equation with
constant coefficients,

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.590
then the system
can be represented

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:10.290
by a collection of poles and
0s, a handful of numbers.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:12.290
How many poles are there,
how many 0s are there,

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:15.680
and where are they?

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.040
So if I have that
representation,

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.080
how many poles are there,
how many 0s are there,

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.560
where are they, I can think
about the frequency response

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.800
just by thinking
about the vector that

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.480
connects each pole and each
0 in turn, from the pole

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.150
and 0 location to the
point on the j omega

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:38.470
axis at the frequency
of interest.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.950
So if I have a system
that has a single 0,

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:45.670
here I have a 0 at z
1, at s equals z 1.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:52.210
Let's say that 0 is at the
point z 1 equals minus 2.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:58.190
Single zero at the
point s equals minus 2.

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:02.180
Then I only need to
think about one vector.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.430
If I'm interested in
the response for very

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:07.250
low frequencies,
very low frequencies

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:11.330
are at omega equals
0, I only need

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.260
to think about the vector that
connects the 0 to the point j

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.940
omega equals 0.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.720
So j 0, which you
say is at zero.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.380
So the eigenvalue is the
length of this vector, that's

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:28.950
the magnitude, and the angle of
this vector-- we always measure

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.370
angle relative to the x-axis.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:35.030
So the angle of
this vector is 0.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:39.320
So I get a magnitude
which is that big,

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.830
and an angle which is 0.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.590
And that's plotted over here.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:46.940
That's my result
for a low frequency,

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.240
a frequency close to 0.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.342
Then if I think about a slightly
higher frequency, what happens

00:42:54.342 --> 00:42:55.425
to the magnitude of the 0?

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:59.630
Bigger.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:04.900
Bigger, it's the magnitude of
a 0, the 0s are in the top.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.200
Bigger is bigger,
so the bigger arrow

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.340
translates to a slightly
bigger magnitude.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.740
The angle that's
made with the x-axis

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.200
is now slightly positive, so
that's illustrated by the fact

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.350
that the angle is
deviating from 0.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.860
And in general, I can think
about the frequency response

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.620
is just how the
length of this vector

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.330
changes as I change omega.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:33.400
The change in length
tells me the magnitude,

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.260
the change in angle
tells me the phase.

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:41.690
Same thing happens
if I do minus omega.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:45.780
What on earth is minus omega?

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.580
So omega was cos omega t.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.320
Omega, right, it had to do with
how fast the motor was going.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.210
What's minus omega?

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:54.980
Why am I drawing
minus omega here?

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:04.950
Yes?

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.476
Why am I interested in
these negative frequencies

00:44:07.476 --> 00:44:08.475
that don't really exist?

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:14.610
Because I have an hour to
fill, and I don't have enough

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.980
stuff to fill the hour.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:17.480
No.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.680
Why am I interested in
negative frequencies?

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:28.320
Why am I interested in
negative frequencies?

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.834
I'm interested in negative
frequencies because--

00:44:35.834 --> 00:44:37.329
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:37.329 --> 00:44:39.620
DENNIS FREEMAN: --they let
me create sines and cosines.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:43.970
Euler-- I invent
negative frequencies,

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:47.520
because I like complex numbers.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.820
I like complex numbers,
because they're eigenfunction--

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.300
because the corresponding
complex exponentials are

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.390
eigenfunctions.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:59.630
Cos omega t was not an
eigenfunction, I don't like it.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:03.990
E to the j omega t is an
eigenfunction, I like it.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:09.410
I invent negative frequencies
so that I can construct cos out

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.410
of the sum of two complex
things, one of them

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:15.680
happens to be this
imaginary frequency thing.

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.830
Who cares, it's just a
number, it's just math.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.580
So in general, we will think
about positive and negative

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:23.480
frequencies.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.330
Negative frequencies
don't exist,

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:31.380
we simply invent them
to make the math easy.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.950
OK, so generally
speaking, because

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:37.350
of the complex
conjugate symmetry,

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:40.370
you can predict what
the negative frequency

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.890
part of the system
function will look like,

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:44.501
if you know the positive part.

00:45:44.501 --> 00:45:47.000
So generally speaking, we'll
only look at the positive parts

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.317
when we know the
system is real, right.

00:45:50.317 --> 00:45:52.650
This symmetry only comes about
when the system was real.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:57.624
I proved it, because I knew
the h of t was real value.

00:45:57.624 --> 00:45:59.790
OK, so now I can think about
the same sort of thing,

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:02.150
but this time with a pole.

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:03.800
The vector diagram
looks the same.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.390
The shape of the
curve's upside down,

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:08.840
because the pole's
in the bottom.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.310
Longer arrows now make
smaller eigenvalues.

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:16.480
So now as you go to
higher frequencies,

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.990
the idea is that a
single pole gives you

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.670
a frequency response,
whose magnitude

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:26.890
decays as you deviate from 0.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:29.080
And you get
increasing phase lag.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.290
You get increasing phase lag,
because this angle increases

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:36.869
with omega, but
it's in the bottom.

00:46:36.869 --> 00:46:38.910
Increases in the bottom,
that means it decreases.

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:41.100
That's why the angle
goes down, in this case.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.670
And if you have a pole
and a 0, the answer

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:48.450
is easily derived from
the previous two answers.

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:52.710
You think about two vectors, one
connecting the 0 to the point

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:56.990
at the frequency of interest,
the other connecting the pole.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:59.490
And the magnitude is the product
to the lengths of those two

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:02.400
vectors, and the angle is the
sum of the angles of those two

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.660
vectors.

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.440
So you can see that the
0 is slightly shorter

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.270
at low frequencies, and becomes
asymptotically the same length.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:13.860
That means that at
high frequencies

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.860
the magnitude goes to
1, except, of course,

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.730
I've got a constant
here, so it goes to 3.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:23.520
And at low frequencies,
this length

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.800
is shorter than that one,
so it's slightly smaller.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.010
The magnitude smaller
lower frequencies.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.250
Similarly for the angles, the
angles both start out at 0,

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.939
so the angle starts out at 0.

00:47:34.939 --> 00:47:36.480
If you go to a high
enough frequency,

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.470
both angles go 2 pi over 2.

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.390
So they both angle--
so the difference

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:45.421
goes to 0 at high
frequencies, as well.

00:47:45.421 --> 00:47:46.920
There's a little
blip in the middle,

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:51.210
because the angle of the
zero increases more rapidly

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:53.560
than the angle at the pole.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.780
0's in the top, so there's a
little blip for positive phase.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.680
Same sort of thing works if I
think about the mass, spring,

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.400
dashpot system.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:09.510
Now if I write the-- so if I
just write the differential

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.340
equation, figure out
the system function,

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.720
I get a simple form that
looks like so, second order.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.320
If I imagine very
low damping, you

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.810
can see that the poles are
going to have the form s

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:26.810
squared m plus k must be 0.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:30.240
So they are complex.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.810
OK?

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:36.220
So if you factor this, if
you set this equal to 0,

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:39.160
you're going to get that
squared m plus k must be zero

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.590
if b were small.

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:44.740
So the poles are
going to be complex.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.300
So for example,
if the poles were,

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:51.610
as indicated here, about
minus 1 plus or minus j 3,

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.860
all you do is the same
thing we did before,

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.350
consider the length
of the vectors,

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:57.160
consider the angle
of the vectors.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.320
Here you get sum
product, and you

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.570
get angles that are
complimentary, so

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:04.330
plus and minus.

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.630
So the angle starts out at 0.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:11.110
As you increase the
frequency, one of the pole--

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.990
one of the arrows
gets longer and longer

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:18.610
by about a factor of 2, and
the other gets shorter--

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:22.540
gets shorter by a lot
more than a factor of 2.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:28.680
So that means that the product
of the lankes becomes small,

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:33.070
but they're in the bottom, so
the eigenvalue becomes large.

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:36.150
So that's what's going on here.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:38.730
So that's the idea.

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.960
I've written two check
yourself questions.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.660
Those are intended to just be
practice with complex numbers,

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.210
because you need to know
how to do complex numbers.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:54.480
But the point-- so
the point of today

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.970
is just that there's a
very natural way-- that's

00:49:56.970 --> 00:49:59.370
completely complementary to
thinking about convolution

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:00.570
in time.

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.450
There's a different natural way
to think about some systems,

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:05.430
in terms of the
frequency response.

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:08.850
How does the system respond
to an eternal sine wave?

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:11.130
It's a very easy
thing to compute.

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:12.960
It follows very
naturally from the things

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.730
that we thought about
with convolution,

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:17.160
and the results quite amazing.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.680
The result is that the
magnitude of the angle

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.850
can be computed from the
Laplace transform of the impulse

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:27.130
response, which just happens
to be the system function.

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:29.010
So the point-- so
hopefully, what you see

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:30.870
is that we have lots
of representations,

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:34.724
and now we're seeing even
more connections between them.

00:50:34.724 --> 00:50:35.580
OK.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.400
Have a good day.
