DENNIS FREEMAN:
Hello, and welcome.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.320
So before starting
today, there's

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.010
one of those kind of required
announcements for events

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.640
coming up.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.690
So even though it seems
like we just did exam 1,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.700
next week is exam 2.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.440
So next Wednesday
evening, 7:30 to 9:30.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.940
Same as before other
than it's Walker.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.850
So don't go to Building 26.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.010
Go to Walker.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.690
OK.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.420
Other than that, the rules
are pretty much the same.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.900
No recitations on
the day of the exam.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.680
Coverage will be up until
the end of this week.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.860
That includes Lecture
12, Recitation 12.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.260
It includes Homework
7, but Homework 7

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.640
will be handled the
way Homework 4 was.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.500
So Homework 7
won't be collected.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.520
It won't be graded.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.700
There will be solutions posted.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.560
We'll post previous exams.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.790
You'll be allowed to use two
pages of notes, presumably

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.640
the page you used last
time and one more.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.280
Although, we are not going to
check whether it was the page

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.250
you used last time.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.030
This is supposed to
be a convenience.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.250
No calculators.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.470
No electronic devices.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.610
Just like last time--

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.440
I hope you all found
it to be this way--

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.540
the exam was designed
to be done in one hour.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.550
And you have two hours,
so there's not supposed

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.760
to be any time pressure.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.970
Review sessions during the
normal open office hours.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.440
And conflicts,
please let me know

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.440
so that I can arrange to
get somebody to proctor.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.340
And so that I can get a room.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.780
So for those two
reasons, try to tell me

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.384
about conflicts before Friday.

00:02:11.716 --> 00:02:13.090
I guess the other
important thing

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.850
is remember that the theory
of the exams in this class

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.590
is that they ramp up.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.050
The first exam only
counted 10%, with the idea

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.210
that that's to let you
get acclimated to things.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.460
You're sort of walking in
the shallow end of the pool

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.080
is the idea.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.310
This one will count 15%.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.410
So it's coming up.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.210
The next one will count 20.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.760
And the final one will count 40.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.920
So this one counts slightly
more than the last one,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.660
but you're still kind of in the
not-so-deep end of the pool.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.240
Questions?

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.740
Comments?

00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:45.100
Questions on the exams?

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.000
Good.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.120
So I want to start talking
about a new topic today, which

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.250
is really an elaboration
of what we talked about

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.776
with frequency response.

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:57.900
But I want to start by
telling you the big picture,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.930
the sort of 30,000-foot view.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.460
We've been focusing
in this class

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.560
on multiple representations
for thinking

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.440
about how linear systems work.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.330
Differential equations, block
diagrams, impulse responses,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.430
frequency response-- all
kinds of different ways

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.200
of thinking about it, with
the idea that if you know all

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.240
of them, then you can use the
one that's the easiest to solve

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.610
your particular problem.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.380
In almost all of
the cases, we've

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.740
tried to find
representations that are

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.465
small in conceptual complexity.

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:34.090
So for example,
differential equations.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.010
In principle, differential
equations could be complicated.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.430
In fact, we're only interested
in linear time invariant

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.860
differential equations,
which means that they always

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.090
have a simple form.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.650
They always look something like
y plus some coefficient times y

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.750
dot plus some other
coefficient times y dot.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.770
y double dot plus a whole bunch
of things turns into say b0

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.560
x plus b1 x dot plus b2 x dot--
double dot plus a whole bunch

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.400
of things.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.490
Point being that although the
differential equations could,

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.140
in fact, be arbitrarily
complicated,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.640
we only focus on
the ones that have

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.329
a simple representation in terms
of a small number of constants.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.490
There they are-- a1,
a2, a3, b0, b1, b2.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.960
Small number of constants.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.410
So that's the way of
managing the complexity.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.360
There's only a small
number of constants

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.620
you need to worry about.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.320
Similarly, when we think about
things like poles and zeros,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.610
the whole point of a pole-zero
diagram is that you reduce.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.290
So say we're doing s-plane.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.190
So say we're doing some
continuous kind of a problem.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.190
We reduced the whole system to
thinking about a small number

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.830
of singularities.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.740
Again, we're trying to think
about the system in terms

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.650
of a small number of numbers.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.820
We like this one because the
numbers are in some sense more

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.220
intuitive or help us to
solve problems better

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.290
than perhaps these numbers did.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.330
Both of these representations
are characterized

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.538
by a small number of numbers.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.070
But for certain purposes,
one set of numbers

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.730
is easier to work with than
another set of numbers.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.230
Last week, we started to think
about frequency responses.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.040
Frequency responses
were really good

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.210
for thinking about
systems, like audio.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.370
I did some examples with audio.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.726
Or just other kinds of systems.

00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:37.350
It's very good to
think about this kind

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.030
of a system as a
frequency response

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.150
because there's a certain
frequency at which

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.010
a very small input--

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.480
you can barely see
my hand moving.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.610
Or, if I weren't shaking,
it wouldn't move so much.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.510
And in fact, the
mass moves a lot.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.670
So that's some unique property
of a particular frequency

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.550
that's interesting
for us to know about.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.140
The problem with
frequency responses

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.840
is that when we start to think
about a frequency response,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.660
we're now thinking about,
say, the magnitude of a system

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.660
function as a function
of omega, which

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.030
might be horribly complicated,
and an angle which

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.400
might be horribly complicated.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.045
So we've kind of
lost the modularity.

00:06:28.045 --> 00:06:29.670
We've kind of lost
the ability to think

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.086
about the whole
frequency response

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:32.340
by a handful of numbers.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.080
That's what Bode plots are.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.870
Bode plots are a way of thinking
about the entire frequency

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.810
response in terms of
a handful of numbers.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.550
That's why we like it.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.820
We like frequency response
because it's a very good way

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.790
to think about certain systems.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.850
Audio because we like to
think about bass differently

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.040
from the way we
think about treble.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.240
Mass-spring dashpots because
there are certain frequencies

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.150
at which the system goes crazy.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.290
Airplanes because you don't
want it to do that, right?

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.250
So there are certain reasons why
frequency responses are good.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.100
And Bode plots are a way of
getting back to this idea

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.530
that we can think about a
whole function of frequency

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.390
with just a handful of numbers.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.720
That's what we're doing.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.220
OK.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.630
So just to get things
going, remember

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.310
where we're coming from.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.970
We think about
frequency responses

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.880
by thinking about
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.640
We think about how if your
system is linear and time

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.770
invariant, last week we showed
that complex exponentials are

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.730
eigenfunctions for
all such systems.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.980
You put in any complex
exponential and what comes out

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:49.020
is a weighted version of the
same complex exponential.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.740
Property of linear time
invariant systems Furthermore,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.210
the eigenvalues are really easy
to find from vector diagrams.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.620
The eigenvalue is the value of
the system function evaluated

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.080
at the frequency of the
complex exponential.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.939
Really easy.

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:11.230
And you can calculate that
from a vector diagram, which

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.780
capitalizes on the small number
of numbers representation

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.780
of the pole-zero plot.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.690
So it's all easy.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.540
We only do easy things.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.700
And then, we're
really interested

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.280
in these sinusoidal responses.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.350
So we think about a sinusoid
by using Euler's formula

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.380
as the sum of two
complex exponentials.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.020
And that lets us see
that all we need to do

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.370
is evaluate the system
function at j omega 0,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.610
j times the frequency
of interest,

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.560
the magnitude, and phase.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.870
And that lets us
compute, how much

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.850
is the amplification
at that frequency

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:57.150
and how much is the time delay
associated with that frequency?

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.290
And so that motivated
us to look at, how

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.560
does frequency response
map to pole-zero?

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.140
There's a simple mapping,
the vector diagram.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.920
Think about for example, if
you have an isolated zero,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.675
a single zero in your system.

00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:17.030
A Single zero here at minus 2.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.640
The magnitude can be determined
by the magnitude of the--

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.880
by the length of the
angle that goes from the 0

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.380
to the frequency of interest.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.060
Frequencies are on
the j omega axis.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.320
Angle can be found--

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.870
this angle can be
computed from the angle

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.760
that this vector
makes with the x-axis.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.680
And that always works.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.101
Here it's illustrated
for a single zero.

00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:43.850
If you think about the
magnitude and angle

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.090
as a function of
frequency, you map out

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.190
features that look like so.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.760
As the frequency goes
from 0 to very big,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.610
the arrow goes from
short to very long.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.790
That's manifested by this.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.410
And the angle changes
systematically

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:06.341
from being near 0 to
being up around pi over 2.

00:10:06.341 --> 00:10:06.840
OK.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.510
And the same sort of
thing works for a pole,

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.968
except now a pole
is in the bottom.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.690
So when it used to get
big, now it gets small.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.510
The angle, which used to go
positive, now goes negative.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.580
But it's the same idea.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.970
And you can compose
more elaborate functions

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.670
by thinking about the
individual arrows that

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.885
correspond to factors.

00:10:29.885 --> 00:10:33.020
That's using the factor
theorem to reduce the system

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:38.750
function, which is always a
polynomial in s, into factors.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.250
OK.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.722
So that was what we
talked about last time

00:10:41.722 --> 00:10:43.180
what I want to talk
about today now

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.550
is how to reduce the
frequency response, which

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.470
looks like a lot of numbers--

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.410
one for every frequency-- to
thinking about it in terms

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.840
of a small number of numbers.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:58.257
So the idea is that this
magnitude response is simple

00:10:58.257 --> 00:10:59.590
if you look at it the right way.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:07.310
In particular, it has a simple
value at low frequencies.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.860
If we think about the smallest
frequencies you can have,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.840
that's omega equals 0.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.570
And the smallest
frequencies, the magnitude

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.700
response asymptotes becomes
arbitrarily close to the line

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.590
that you would get
by substituting omega

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.900
equals 0 here.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:29.070
If omega were 0, then h of
j omega would be minus z1.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:34.910
The magnitude of minus z1 is z1.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.820
So at very low frequencies,
the response-- so

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.650
when you get to
frequencies near 0,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.690
the response asymptotes
to that line.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.080
And if you get to very high
frequencies, then the fact

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.330
that you're adding a small
constant to a number that's

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.260
already very big, if omega
were large, then that little

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.600
constant, z1, wouldn't matter.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.900
So the magnitude becomes very
close to the magnitude of omega

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.450
shown by the green dotted line.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.380
So you can think
about the blue line

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.615
being some kind of an
interpolation between those two

00:12:10.615 --> 00:12:13.360
dash lines, the
low-frequency behavior

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.920
to the high-frequency behavior.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.060
And the relation looks
even simpler if you plot it

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.980
on a different kind of axis.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.280
If you make it
log-log, then you can

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.840
think about frequencies going--
so the log of frequency.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.590
Well, there's some--
if the frequency

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.320
were 1, whatever that means.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.370
Or in fact here, it's
important to note

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.580
that I'm plotting here
versus a normalized version

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.160
of frequency.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.750
I'm normalizing by z1.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:46.090
What That has the effect that
when omega is the same as z1,

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.456
I get the log of 1, which is?

00:12:48.456 --> 00:12:49.170
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.850
DENNIS FREEMAN: 0, right?

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.030
That's a way of shifting
the axis to make

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.770
the interesting
stuff happen at 0.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:56.700
That's all.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:02.130
So if you scale frequency by
the singularity-- in this case,

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.740
a 0--

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.490
then the critical frequency
becomes the frequency zero.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.580
We all like 0, right?

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.980
So what you can see then
if you plot it this way--

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.060
and I also scaled the
magnitude the same way.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.510
So if you realize that
there's a simple asymptote,

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.970
you can see very clearly
on this log-log plot

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.290
that you get a good
approximation to the function,

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.110
which is showed in blue.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.320
That one's calculated exactly.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.280
And you get a good approximation
by the low- and high-frequency

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.010
asymptotes.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.360
So instead of thinking about
the whole function of frequency,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.570
what we do is we think
about just the asymptotes.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.550
That's the simplification.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.340
We don't think about this
complicated function.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.855
We only think about what
happens at low frequencies

00:13:51.855 --> 00:13:52.730
and high frequencies.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.100
Of course, this was
too simple, right?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.110
This is what happens
with a single zero.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.580
The point is that
a similar thing

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.010
happens with a single pole
or when you combine them.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.890
Let's look at the
case of a pole.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.680
Here, the pole idea is a
little bit more complicated.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.840
If you go to very
low frequencies,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.630
think about s being j omega.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.110
The frequency response
lives on the j omega axis.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.720
Always look at s equals
j omega if you're

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.030
interested in the
frequency response.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.840
If you think about s
equals j omega, then

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.940
if you go to small omega,
this term goes away.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.760
And we're left with,
again, a constant at low

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.220
frequency showed
by the red line.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.820
If we look at high
frequencies, now the curve's

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.880
a little more funky.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.960
The curve at high
frequencies-- the real answer

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.290
is showed by this sort
of bell-shaped curve.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:57.312
If you plot for different values
of omega where s is j omega,

00:14:57.312 --> 00:14:59.020
plot out the magnitude,
you get this sort

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.510
of funky, bell-shaped curve.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.940
The point is that--

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.400
and the high-frequency
asymptote.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.190
If you just say, what
if j omega were so big

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.800
that the p1 wouldn't matter?

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:18.860
Then, you would get 9 over
omega being the asymptote.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.410
So that's this hyperbolic
sort of thing here.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.910
OK.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.740
Well, that's ugly.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.650
But if you go to log-log,
it's very simple.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.890
That's why we like log-log.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:35.990
If you think about the function
y' equals 1 over omega and plot

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.190
that function on
log-log axes, reciprocal

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.630
turns into a straight line.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.560
We like straight lines.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.590
They're easy.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.260
So what happens then-- again,
I've normalized things.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.100
I've normalized
frequency by the pole.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.360
That makes the critical
frequency be omega equals pole.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.850
The critical
frequency comes out 1.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.890
The log of 1 is 0.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:05.860
So the interesting behavior
happens at log equals 0.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:12.340
Below that frequency, the
frequency response magnitude

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:17.440
is well approximated by the
constant whose log divided

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.180
by some funny number
that was put there

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.430
for normalization is 0.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.140
And at high frequencies,
it falls off

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.300
with a slope of minus 1.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.090
So again, for the
case of the pole,

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:37.610
we get this simple behavior
if we focus on the asymptotes.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.960
OK.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.140
So now, that's kind of the
theory behind everything.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.702
Make sure you're all up
to speed on the theory.

00:16:44.702 --> 00:16:47.380
So compare log-log
plots of the frequency

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.630
response magnitudes of the
following system functions.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.810

And s2, 1 over s plus 10.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.750
Pole is?

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.920
Minus 10.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.440
Compare the magnitude.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.880
Compare their
magnitude functions

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.300
when plotted on log-log and
answer the following question,

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.930
which of these best describes
the transformation between H1

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.250
and H2?

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.540
You should shift horizontally.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.730
You should shift and
scale horizontally.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.770
You should shift
horizontally and vertically.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.410
You should shift and scale
horizontally and vertically.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.050
Or, it's something
completely different.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.600
OK, turn to your neighbor.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.740

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.530
Right now, say hi.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.080
And now, figure out
what answer best

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.404
classifies that transformation.

Let me make sure
I know the answer.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.960
I think I know the answer.

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:28.435
OK.

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:31.000
It's about 90% correct.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:38.590
If I plot the magnitude
response for H1 on log-log axes,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.490
what will it look like?

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.650

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.060
OK.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.730
Maybe that didn't work.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:59.230
OK.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:05.160
What I want to do is plot the
magnitude of H1 of j omega

log versus the log of omega.

00:20:10.145 --> 00:20:13.590
But I only want to think
about the asymptotes.

Where should I draw the
low-frequency asymptote

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.600
for that function?

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.550
What's the
low-frequency asymptote

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.360
for the log magnitude of H1?

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.270
What's the low-frequency
asymptote--

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.300
forget the log part.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:46.982
Yes.

00:20:46.982 --> 00:20:49.877
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:49.877 --> 00:20:50.960
DENNIS FREEMAN: I'm sorry.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.380
I can't hear.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.796
AUDIENCE: Why is
it not symmetric?

00:20:52.796 --> 00:21:00.165
So if you look at the amplitude
of the system function, j

00:21:00.165 --> 00:21:01.516
omega, it's symmetric.

00:21:01.516 --> 00:21:05.432
But the Bode plots
are not symmetric.

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.390
DENNIS FREEMAN: The Bode
plots are unsymmetric.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.556
Why are the Bode plots
unsymmetric and the frequency

00:21:09.556 --> 00:21:10.930
response was symmetric?

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:11.770
Somebody--

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.020
AUDIENCE: I get why, if you
have a negative frequency.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.210
DENNIS FREEMAN: Negative
frequency, exactly.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.875
Why do we have
negative frequencies?

00:21:18.875 --> 00:21:19.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.696
DENNIS FREEMAN: Because
time runs backwards.

00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:26.070
Negative frequency corresponds
to running time backwards,

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.850
right?

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.150
The argument, it gets bigger
when time gets smaller.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:30.780
OK.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.550
That's not the reason
we do it, right?

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.798
Why do we use
negative frequencies?

00:21:36.798 --> 00:21:38.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.752
DENNIS FREEMAN: Why do we
consider negative frequencies?

00:21:41.752 --> 00:21:42.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.033
DENNIS FREEMAN: To make it real.

00:21:44.033 --> 00:21:45.166
To make what real?

00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:46.812
AUDIENCE: A system.

00:21:46.812 --> 00:21:49.270
DENNIS FREEMAN: Why do we think
about negative frequencies?

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.770
Come on.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:50.348
Yeah.

00:21:50.348 --> 00:21:52.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.590
DENNIS FREEMAN: We
want sines and cosines.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.320
It's easy to find
complex exponentials.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.930
We like Euler, right?

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:00.800
We like Euler.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.910
We like that cosine
of omega t can

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.115
be written as 1/2 e to
the j omega t plus 1/2

00:22:08.115 --> 00:22:11.060
e to the minus j omega t.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.502
That's what we like.

00:22:12.502 --> 00:22:13.770
Whoops.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.050
I shouldn't put the
parentheses there.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.410
That's what we like.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.357
We invent the
negative frequencies.

00:22:21.357 --> 00:22:23.190
They are completely an
invention of our own.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.940
When we do the Bode
plots, we throw them away.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.610
We know that we can
always figure them out

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.980
because it was an
invention of ours,

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.480
so we don't need
to write them down.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.370
If we ever needed them,
we could figure them out.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.740
So we don't bother to write
them down on the Bode plot.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.850
What's the low-frequency
asymptote of H1?

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:48.120
If omega 0 goes to 0,
what's the value of H1?

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.130
1.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.130
s equals j omega,
omega equals 0.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:53.920
1.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.520
What's the log of 1?

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.380
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.280
DENNIS FREEMAN: 0.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.310
So the low-frequency
asymptote for H1 is 0.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.150
What's the high-frequency
asymptote of H1?

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:11.168
If you put a high frequency-

00:23:11.168 --> 00:23:14.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.810
DENNIS FREEMAN: We're
thinking about H1 of j omega.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:22.790
H1 of j omega is 1
over j omega plus 1.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.800
What happens when
you make omega high?

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.900
What happens to the magnitude?

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:33.660
DENNIS FREEMAN: 1 over omega
for the amplitude, right?

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.159
You could say it approaches 0.

00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:37.200
That's kind of right, but
we're interested in how

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.120
it approaches 0.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.950
On a log plot, 0
is very far away.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.190
So we never think
about being there.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.480
We think about getting there.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.380
So we get there with
a slope of minus 1.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.250
So it's like this.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.770
What's the crossover point?

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:56.400
Omega equals?

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.960
What's the omega at
the crossover point?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.190
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.940
DENNIS FREEMAN: 0.

00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:12.860
AUDIENCE: We're plotting
for negative [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.510
And I would think
that since we're

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.315
taking the absolute
value [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:17.315 --> 00:24:20.780
and not having it just be 0.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.255
Because you're talking
about as omega goes to 0,

00:24:23.255 --> 00:24:25.740
but not necessarily as
omega goes to negative.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.190
DENNIS FREEMAN: We're
thinking about the limit

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.200
as we go towards
0, because we're

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.420
plotting on the log of omega.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:39.170
0, omega equals 0,
is way over there.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.442
Way, way, way off
the blackboard.

00:24:41.442 --> 00:24:42.650
So we don't think about that.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.380
We think about how it got there.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.360
And it got there
by being constant.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.770
The trend-- if you start
at the critical frequency

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:57.990
in the middle, the value
becomes closer and closer to 1

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.400
as you go to the left.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.280
That's why we say the
asymptote is at log equals 0.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.450
Log of 1 is 0.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.500
The answer goes to 1.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.490
The log of 1 is 0.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.850
Does everybody know
what I'm talking about?

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.540
I'm getting a lot
of blank stares.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.020
Then, if you try to
go to a high frequency

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:23.290
and think about
the magnitude, you

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:24.670
can go to a high
enough frequency

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.128
where the magnitude
of this doesn't

00:25:26.128 --> 00:25:29.020
matter that that's there.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.900
The magnitude never matters
that there's a j there.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.380
So the magnitude goes
like 1 over omega.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.480
If you plot the
function, 1 over omega,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.670
a reciprocal function
on log coordinates,

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.510
it turns into slope of minus 1.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.280
So that gives us
this region where

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.687
it has a slope of minus 1.

00:25:48.687 --> 00:25:50.395
What's the frequency
at which they cross?

00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:56.446
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:56.446 --> 00:25:59.320
In log scale, it's
only [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.630
DENNIS FREEMAN: On a log
scale, it's omega equals 0.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:06.770
On a linear scale,
it's omega equals 1.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:10.970
So the crossover point
where 1 over omega--

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.460
the high-frequency
asymptote is 1 ever omega.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.920
The low-frequency asymptote's 1.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.480
They are equal when 1
over omega equals 1.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.350
Omega equals 1, right?

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.860
Log 0.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:29.600
So they cross at a point
where the log is 0.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.640
Now, how about H2?

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.040
What if I plot H2
on top of this?

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.180
What's the low-frequency
limit of H2?

00:26:39.568 --> 00:26:40.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.790
DENNIS FREEMAN: 1/10.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.760
What's the log of 1/10?

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.000
Minus 1.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:57.160
So now, H2, if I do log
of H2, it's going to--

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.800
so the low-frequency
asymptote is 1/10.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.290
It's minus 1 on a log plot.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.510
What's the high-frequency
asymptote for H2?

00:27:07.365 --> 00:27:10.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:11.870
DENNIS FREEMAN: 1/s.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.210
1 over omega.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.960
It's the same.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.710
If you go to a high
enough frequency,

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.470
the fact that there
is divide by 10--

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:27.220
the fact that you've added
10 or added 1 doesn't matter.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.770
If omega gets sufficiently
high, the thing you added to it

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:31.810
has no relevance.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.880
You get the same
high-frequency asymptote.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:43.830
So to transform the asymptotic
view of the magnitude function

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:48.375
from H1 to H2, what should
you do to the curves?

00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:49.770
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.660
DENNIS FREEMAN: Shift and shift.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.640
No scaling.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.930
That's why we like Bode.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.850
That's why we like log-log.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.770
Every pole looks the same.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.050
Every pole is straight
across and down.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:09.382
Every zero looks the same,
straight across and up.

00:28:09.382 --> 00:28:10.590
There's a critical frequency.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:13.920
That frequency is the
frequency equal to the position

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.780
of the pole or zero.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.941
That's all of the rules.

00:28:18.941 --> 00:28:19.440
OK.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.060
That's why we like this.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.940
Does that make sense?

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.900
So the answer here
was that we want

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.900
to be able to shift
horizontally and vertically.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.390
We don't need to scale.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.080
The shape of the curve is
invariant to the position

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.670
of the pole and zero.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.600
That's what we like.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.780
It's an invariant.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.820
We like invariant things.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.550
OK.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:48.290
Then, if you wanted to construct
a more complicated system,

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.205
it's also easy.

00:28:50.205 --> 00:28:52.330
If you want to construct
a more complicated system,

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:56.920
you can use the factor theorem
to convert the system function,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.140
which for a system that's built
out of integrators, adders,

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.210
and gains.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.730
If you build a
system out of that,

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:10.600
the system function will always
be a ratio of polynomials in s.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.180
We proved that a while back.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.780
You can always
factor such things.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.030
We just found out a
rule for how you think

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.350
about the individual factors.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.290
And so all you need
to worry about is

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.870
the rule for combination.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.880
If you multiply a bunch
of zeros and divide

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:34.240
by the product of a bunch of
poles, that's pretty easy.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.829
If you take the magnitude--

00:29:37.829 --> 00:29:40.370
the magnitude of a product is
the product of the magnitudes--

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.590
that's also pretty easy.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.160
Everybody's with me?

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.910
And if you take the
log, it's even easier.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:57.670
The log of a product
is the sum of the logs.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.490
OK.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:01.150
Sum's easier to multiply.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.210
That's another reason we
like this log-log thing.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.880
So all you need to do is
think about each singularity.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.730
Each one of them can be
represented by this and down

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.770
or this and up.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.300
And compose them by adding.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.710
So it's really easy.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.840
So say I had this system
function, a 0 at 0,

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.655
a pole at minus 1, and
a pole at minus 10.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.680
Think about the
Bode representation.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.951
Bode's just a word that means
think about the asymptotes.

00:30:31.951 --> 00:30:34.760
Think about the Bode
representation for the top.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.060
Well, that grows
linearly with omega.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.640
A function that grows
linearly with omega

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.150
has a log that grows
with a slope of 1.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.440
So that's this.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.250
So that's the zero.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.240
That's the contribution to the
magnitude function of the zero.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.430
The contribution to
the magnitude function

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:01.450
of the pole at minus 1 is this.

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:04.090
The pole at minus 10 is this.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.770
All pole's look the same.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:09.880
So all you need to
do is add them up.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.750
So you add the first
two, you get the--

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.060
so backing up.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.020
0.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.350
Pole.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.900
Add them.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.690
In this region, the
sum of a constant

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.240
and a straight line sloping up
is a straight line sloping up.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.890
In this region, the sum of
a straight line sloping up

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:35.576
with this sloping down is flat.

00:31:35.576 --> 00:31:36.700
So that's why you get that.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.880
Then, we add in
this contribution.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.211
Add a constant to this.

00:31:43.211 --> 00:31:44.460
It just shifts it up and down.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:44.959
Who cares?

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.510
That's easy.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.760
The important thing is
that it breaks down.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.204
So the result of summing
that is that it breaks down.

00:31:53.204 --> 00:31:55.889
Easy.

00:31:55.889 --> 00:31:57.930
So instead of thinking
about a frequency response

00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:59.638
as something that's
horribly complicated,

00:31:59.638 --> 00:32:02.100
we think about it
as having parts that

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.470
came from each pole and zero.

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:06.990
So instead of thinking about
it as a collection of arbitrary

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:08.364
numbers at different
frequencies,

00:32:08.364 --> 00:32:09.900
we think about it
as a little part

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.150
that comes from the first
pole, another part that

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.100
comes from the second
pole, another part that

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.450
comes from the first zero--

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.950
blah, blah, blah.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.290
It's a way of thinking
about it, reducing

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:23.672
the complexity, the
conceptual complexity,

00:32:23.672 --> 00:32:24.755
of the frequency response.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:33.700
So the angles are the same.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.370
If we think about
the low-frequency and

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:39.660
high-frequency behavior of
the angle starting with a 0.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.730
For low frequencies,
the angle is 0.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.520
So that's the dot.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.004
For high frequencies,
as frequency

00:32:48.004 --> 00:32:49.420
goes higher and
higher and higher,

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.710
the angle stands straighter
and straighter up.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.060
The asymptotic value is?

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.980
Pi over 2.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.040
So we have two asymptotes,
0 and pi over 2.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.710
If we plot that on
log-log axes, we

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:11.710
get something slightly
more complicated.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.105
The blue line shows
the calculated value.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.110
The red line shows
a way of thinking

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.560
about that from a straight line
approximation point of view.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.100
Very nice construction
is put a straight line

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.700
starting one decade--

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:33.870
a factor of 10, minus
1 on a log scale.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:39.520
Draw a line from minus 1
to plus 1, a straight line.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.000
And you actually get a
very good approximation

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.004
to the angle function
over the whole range.

00:33:45.004 --> 00:33:46.920
Notice that there are
two critical frequencies

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.572
associated with the phase.

00:33:48.572 --> 00:33:51.030
There was one critical frequency
associated with magnitude.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.120
What was the crossing point
of the low- and high-frequency

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.000
asymptotes?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.130
In phase, we think
about that same thing,

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.830
but then we bump
it up and down 1.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.400
So there are two
critical frequencies.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.170
The same critical frequency
we use with the magnitude

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.380
plus or minus 1.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.560
The same sort of thing
happens with a pole,

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.260
but now it's upside down.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.850
Other than that, it's identical.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.139
Same thing.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:31.400
Having calculated the phase
for a single pole or zero,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.679
it's easy to think about
how you would generalize

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:36.440
to multiple poles and zeros.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.420
The angle of a product
is the sum of the angles.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.806
Don't need to take
the log this way.

00:34:43.806 --> 00:34:45.389
This time, when we're
doing the phase,

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:46.330
we don't need to take the log.

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:48.000
There's a way of
thinking about phase.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.960
Because it's in the
exponent, e to the j angle

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.639
by Euler's equation.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:56.219
There's a way of thinking
about the logs already

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.170
in the angle function, right?

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:02.650
The angle was in the
exponent, e to the j omega.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.040
So since the angle is
already up in the e,

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.320
it's kind of like an--

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.650
it's already a
logarithmic function.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.530
And that shows up here.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:16.080
The angle of a product
is the sum of the angles.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.739
So same sort of thing happens if
we had a complicated function.

00:35:21.739 --> 00:35:24.280
Just think about the angle that
results for each of the poles

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.830
and zeros and add them.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:37.180
The angle associated with
the zero at 0 is pi over 2.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.900
j is the same as e
to the j pi over 2.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.100
e to the j pi over 2.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.310
The angle's pi over 2.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:50.040
So the angle associated with
this is always pi over 2.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.780
The angle associated
with the pole at minus 1.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.980
Poles in the left-half plane
cause the angle to start out

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.560
at 0 and go negative.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.690
So we start out at
0 and go negative.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:07.845
We find the critical frequency
labeled in this axis by 0.

00:36:07.845 --> 00:36:11.740
s equals 1 is the
critical frequency.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.880
So we go up and
down 1 unit and we

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.950
draw the straight-line
approximation.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:20.360
s equals 10 is the same
thing, except now it's

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.860
shifted to a higher frequency.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.910
Factor of 10, units
shift on a log plot.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.240
And now all we do is sum them,
add the first to the second,

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.380
add the third.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:35.070
That's our angle approximation.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.780
Again, the idea is
to take something

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.647
that's conceptually hard--

00:36:38.647 --> 00:36:40.230
what's the value of
the angle function

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:44.090
as a function of frequency-- and
turn it into something simple.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:45.830
A few straight line
segments associated

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:46.940
with every pole and zero.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.820
So this is just a summary.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.090
Because we can represent
a system that's

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:03.430
composed of integrators,
summers, and gains

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.957
by a linear
differential equation

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:07.540
with constant
coefficients, it follows

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:18.490
that the system function is a
quotient of polynomials in s.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.450
Because of the fundamental
theorem in algebra,

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.930
there's n roots.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.614
Because of factor theorem, you
can break it up into factors.

00:37:24.614 --> 00:37:27.030
Because of all that, we can
think about them one at a time

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.950
and glue them together.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.101
Gluing them together in
the case of the magnitude

00:37:31.101 --> 00:37:33.600
works best if you use the log
because then the product turns

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.330
into a sum.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.100
In the case of the
angle, it's for free

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.930
because the angle
is, in some sense,

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.672
already a logarithmic function.

00:37:43.672 --> 00:37:45.670
OK.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.710
OK, we'll see if you got it.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:49.544
So here is a complicated
frequency response.

00:37:49.544 --> 00:37:51.876
This is the straight-line
approximation to the frequency

00:37:51.876 --> 00:37:53.020
response of a system.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:53.850
Which system?

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.660
So which of the
system functions--

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.780
1, 2, 3, 4, or
none of the above--

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:29.160
is represented by the
Bode straight-line plot

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.360
showed above?

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.010
Raise your hands,
which one is better--

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.755
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5?

00:39:37.395 --> 00:39:38.510
Ah, 100%.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.070
That's exactly the right answer.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.240
Wonderful.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.620
The idea is that Bode is easy.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.690
That's why we do it.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.280
It's easy.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.270
So tell me a rule.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.830
How do I think about this one?

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:49.820
What would happen here?

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.804
What's this saying?

00:39:51.804 --> 00:39:53.470
What would be the
Bode plot of this one?

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.344
Sketch it in the air.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.610
Exactly.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:02.841
You start at 0, right?

00:40:02.841 --> 00:40:03.340
OK.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.420
So start at 0.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.210
Then what?

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:10.480
What do you run into first?

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.590
You start at 0.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.840
What do you run into first
when you're doing this guy?

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:21.820
You run into this factor, or
that factor, or that factor

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.090
first?

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.220
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Yeah, the left one.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.440
So think about the order.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.070
By how close were
they to the origin?

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:34.710
Think about them in
order from the origin.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:37.010
So you hit the first one
first, the one at 10,

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.350
then the one at 100.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.600
This would start
flat, break down at 1,

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.995
break down again at 10,
break down again at 100.

00:40:43.995 --> 00:40:45.120
That's not the right shape.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:51.880
This one starts with a 0.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.600
That's a break up.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:59.870
The 0 happens at frequency 1.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.060
So that's log frequency 0.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.610
That's right.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:07.920
Then, you break
down, break down.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.230
OK.

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.840
So break up, break
up, break down.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.850
Except that it would
actually break down first.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:16.310
So the way to think
about this one

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:20.090
is break down,
break up, break up

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.090
ordered from going
away from the origin.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.050
OK.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:26.900
So the point is it's very
easy to take a system function

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.060
and immediately draw
the frequency response.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:36.010
That lets you take a pole-zero
representation, which

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:39.070
can be very concise in terms
of the number of numbers

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:41.890
you need to know, and
quickly map out the frequency

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:44.200
response, which can be
very intuitive for thinking

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.449
about how the system responds.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.260
OK.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:54.650
So one more issue.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.220
We don't really like log
plots when it gets down

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:03.560
to talking about the frequency
at which the log was 7.129.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.590
We just don't like that because
nobody measures frequency

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:10.010
in the frequency whose log is x.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.920
So what we usually do,
instead of plotting

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:18.901
versus the log of omega, we plot
versus omega on a log scale.

00:42:18.901 --> 00:42:19.400
OK.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.600
Very reasonable.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.710
We just put tick marks and we
just label them exponentially.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:29.660
So the tick mark associated
with omega is labeled 1, not 0.

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:34.920
That's frequency 1.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.960
The tick mark associated with
frequency 10 is labeled 10.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.350
What that means, though, is that
the growth inside that interval

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:45.074
is on a log scale.

00:42:45.074 --> 00:42:46.490
That's why we write
log scale here

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:50.030
to keep reminding ourselves that
the ticks between 1 and 10--

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:53.330
1, 2, 3, 4, 5--

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:54.710
are not uniformly spaced.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:56.427
They're log spaced.

00:42:56.427 --> 00:42:58.760
The distance between 1 and 2
is bigger than the distance

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.710
between 9 and 10.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:03.350
That's the way logs work.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.080
OK.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.230
So we think about frequency
on a log scale rather than

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:08.460
log frequency.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:12.510
Similarly, we think about
amplitude on a dB scale

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:14.330
rather than log amplitude.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.220
dB is for Alexander Graham Bell.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.970
It's decibel.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:24.510
A bell is a factor of 10.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.560
It's a little unintuitive,
a factor of 10

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.110
is labeled 20, because Bell
was really thinking energy.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.520
And you have to square energy.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.260
You have to square
voltage to get energy.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.000
Bell was thinking a
factor of 10 in energy.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.990
We like to think amplitude.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:46.471
Therefore, a factor of 10
for us would be 20 decibels.

00:43:46.471 --> 00:43:46.970
20.

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.720
OK, so that's a little weird.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.190
So we will think about
this axis in decibels

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:56.940
and we'll think about
that one in decades.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:59.390
And so what that means
is that the slopes are

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:01.880
no longer minus 1 and 1.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.270
The slopes are 20
decibels per decade,

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:08.344
or minus 20 decibels per decade.

00:44:08.344 --> 00:44:10.010
Now, this is all
completely meaningless.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.170
It's a slope of 1.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:17.190
And you could equally have
labeled this axis in dB

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.110
and this axis on a log
scale, and then you

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:24.600
would have the slope
of 1 decade per 20 dB.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.550
And that, too, would be 1.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.350
We just don't do it that way.

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:29.850
OK.

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:30.433
What do we do?

00:44:30.433 --> 00:44:34.680
What we do do is
frequency on a log scale.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:40.440
So therefore, the unit of
frequency is the decade.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.300
You have a frequency
and a decade

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:45.750
higher and a decade higher
and a decade higher.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:49.050
The unit of frequency
is decade or octave.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:51.780
Octave is a factor of 2.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.130
Octave higher, factor of 2.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:54.180
Octave higher.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.790
Octave makes more sense if
you're a musician, right?

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:01.220
The distance between
two C's is an octave.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.300
So that's a dB scale.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.265
And that results in a
little bit of funny math.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.520
So if you convert linear
measures of amplitude

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:19.390
to decibel measures, a
factor of 1 in amplitude

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.000
is a factor of 0 dB.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.602
A factor of 10 is 20 dB.

00:45:24.602 --> 00:45:25.810
We already talked about that.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.150
There are some convenient
middle grounds.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:30.424
2 is 6 dB.

00:45:30.424 --> 00:45:31.880
That's a little weird.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.112
So we'll go around saying
it's 6 dB and we mean 2.

00:45:35.112 --> 00:45:39.240
But every engineer in the
world will call it 6 dB.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.670
Half of that is the square
root of 2, which is 3 dB.

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:46.280
It's just convenient,
at least it

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.710
is after you spend
30 years doing that.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.420
The other point
from the slide is

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.550
that the asymptotic responses
are really quite good.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.490
The magnitude for a
single pole deviates

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:01.750
from the straight-line
approximation by only 3 dB.

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:05.260
I can hear sounds
that range 120 dB.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.290
That's the sense in
which 3 is small.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.080
The kinds of signals
we work with every day

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.110
have ranges that are
big compared to 3.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:16.540
So we think of 3
as a small thing.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.890
The phases are within 6 degrees.

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:24.130
And for a lot of applications,
6 degrees is a small number.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.950
Again, we're thinking
6 out of 180.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:30.240
So it's a small
fraction of a cycle.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.320
OK, this is a good thing--

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.320
especially the fact that
it's a trick question--

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.140
for you to practice
for the exam.

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.890
So let me skip it in
the interest of time,

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:41.730
because there's one
more important thing.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:44.480
Don't look at the answer.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.470
Use this as practice.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:50.890
There's one more
important thing in trying

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:56.820
to reduce poles and zeros
to a frequency response.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.610
And that is that when you
use the fundamental theorem

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:04.590
of algebra, even though
the polynomial can

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:08.980
have real-valued coefficients,
that does not mean the roots

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.250
are real.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:16.090
Right

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:19.210
The roots to a polynomial
with real value coefficients

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:23.460
can have complex parts.

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.650
So the remaining thing
I want to talk about

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:30.910
is, what do you do with these
poles that have complex parts?

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:37.740
The imaginary part has
to do with oscillations.

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:41.110
And so we want to think about,
what's a Bode plot looks like?

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.040
What's the asymptotes
look like when

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.000
you have a system like this?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.041
This was a system that has
a mass spring, and dashpot.

00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:51.915
You should have done
this by homework by now.

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.160
The differential
equation is second order.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:03.500
It has real-valued coefficients,
but the holes are complex.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:06.290
What happens with complex roots?

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:10.460
Well, if the com--

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:14.840
if the polynomial had
real-valued coefficients,

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.530
complex roots come in pairs.

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:21.560
That's the only way to
take a complex number

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.870
and end up with a
product that's all real.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:25.190
You take the complex number.

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:27.410
It has to be paired with
its complex conjugate.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:34.550
So that when you pair them, the
result has real coefficients.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:36.920
So we only need to
worry about the case

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:42.830
when the poles or zeros
come in complex pairs.

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:45.800
And for that purpose, it's
convenient to think about--

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.045
you might think that if you
had mass-spring dashpot system,

00:48:50.045 --> 00:48:52.580
you might be expecting
something like s

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:57.350
squared m plus sb plus
k, something like that.

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:59.090
Mass-spring and dashpot.

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:00.980
Three parameters.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.594
Well, you don't
really need three.

00:49:03.594 --> 00:49:05.760
Three is nice because it
has an association with how

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.460
stiff is this thing
and how massive

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.862
is that thing, et cetera.

00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:10.820
But in terms of thinking
about poles and zeros,

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.650
you don't need to
think about all three.

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:18.140
First off, you could divide
the top and bottom by k

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.770
and the 1/k then is
just a gain factor.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:22.830
Gains are easy.

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:24.420
They don't affect shape.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:24.920
OK.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.370
We don't care about that one.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:29.330
So we went from 3 to 2.

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:31.970
Now, there's another
simplification

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:35.970
because all of these are
going to be oscillatory.

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:39.330
Pole pairs work in an
oscillatory fashion.

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:43.170
This has a natural frequency
that if I didn't shake it,

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:45.240
it has a preferred frequency.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:50.250
If I divide by that
preferred frequency, omega 0,

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:52.500
I can get rid of
another parameter.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.610
So don't think about s.

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.940
Think about s over omega 0.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:00.591
Now, frequencies
are normalized to 1.

00:50:00.591 --> 00:50:01.090
OK.

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:03.010
So by dividing by
omega 0, I turn

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:06.220
every frequency-dependent
system into something

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:10.360
whose best frequency
is near omega equals 1.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.990
Then finally, for
my third parameter,

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:16.406
if I write my third
parameter as 1 over q,

00:50:16.406 --> 00:50:18.280
something very magical
and wonderful happens.

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:25.280
The roots fall on a circle.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.140
So what I want to show
here then is as I change q,

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.790
I don't need to
think about omega.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:34.266
I can plot this on an
s over omega 0 plane

00:50:34.266 --> 00:50:35.390
and it works for all omega.

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:40.300
I do need to worry about q.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:47.630
So if I change q, here q is 1/2.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.470
So there's q of 1/2.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:53.970
1/4.

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:54.936
1/8.

00:50:54.936 --> 00:50:58.570
Excuse me, I'm
doing it backwards.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:02.190
I want 1/q to equal--

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.070
I want 1 over 2q to equal 1/2.

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:06.750
I need q equals 1.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:07.600
OK, that's better.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.585
That's q equals 1.

00:51:10.585 --> 00:51:15.900
q equals 2 in order to half
the distance to the origin--

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.445
4, 8, 16.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:23.390
Notice that as I change--
now watch this side.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.294
So q equals 1.

00:51:26.294 --> 00:51:28.660
So q equals 1, q equals 1.

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:33.380
Low-frequency magnitude is flat.

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.110
High-frequency is slope of 2.

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:37.590
Sloping down with minus 2.

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:51.060
As I change q from 1 to 2, 4,
8, 16, the peak gets bigger.

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.280
In fact, if you do a
little bit of math,

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:59.310
you can show that the
peak gets bigger with q.

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:02.800
The peak value, if
you measure how big

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.430
is the peak compared to
where is the crossover,

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:10.620
that distance is a factor of q.

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:13.480
Similarly-- and you
can reason about that

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.470
with vector diagrams.

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:17.230
And we'll do homework
problems to practice that.

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:19.900
Similarly, it got peakier.

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.120
It got sharper.

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.040
If you do the
vector story to try

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.160
to figure out why
it got peakier,

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.030
the width turns out to be 1/q.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.130
So that's kind of impulse-y.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:34.100
The height got bigger with q.

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.280
The width got bigger with 1/q.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.599
The product always 1.

00:52:39.599 --> 00:52:41.140
So that's a way of
thinking about why

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.760
it got peaky that way.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.940
And finally, if you think about
the angle, the angle changes.

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:51.750
As you make q bigger and bigger,
the angle changes very quickly.

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:55.300
And it turns out that the
angle changes abruptly

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:56.950
over the same bandwidth.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:59.080
Bandwidth is how many
frequencies are there

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.430
between the low-frequency part
and the high-frequency part.

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:07.480
The phase change over the
bandwidth is always pi over 2.

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.020
OK.

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.460
So that's the whole story then.

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:12.070
Think about isolating the
poles on the real axes.

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:13.090
They're just this.

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:16.000
Isolated zeros,
they're just this.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.400
Pairs can be more complicated
because they can be peaky.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:19.900
OK.

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.450
Thanks.
