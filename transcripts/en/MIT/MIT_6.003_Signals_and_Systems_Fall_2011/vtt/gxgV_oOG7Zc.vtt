00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.020
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Hello and welcome.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.330
As before, as you
might be expecting,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.030
the big new news is, of
course-- well it's not new news.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.640
The big news is
exam, tomorrow night.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.980
This should be very
familiar stuff to you.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.470
I apologize, a couple
people asked me right before

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.770
lecture about Fourier
because there was Fourier

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.670
on one of the previous exams.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.310
There is no Fourier.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.620
I should have probably
axed that problem.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.850
So in my head I was trying
to be complete disclosure.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.400
This is what the
exam looked like.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.200
I didn't mean to send the false
message that there is Fourier.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.099
There is no Fourier.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.650
Next time we'll have
lots of opportunities

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.930
to ask Fourier questions,
so no Fourier this time.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.800
On the other hand, yes, Bode,
Root Locus, that kind of stuff,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.880
yes.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.960
So, that kind of stuff
you should get on top of.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.750
Questions or comments
about the exam?

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.360
I guess the one thing to
remember is it's in Walker.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.460
It's not on the
third floor of 26.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
Other than that, you should
be kind of in a good position

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.912
to know roughly what to expect.

00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:31.412
Yes?

00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:33.450
AUDIENCE: When you say
two pages of notes,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.270
do you mean two separate
8 and a half by 11 cards?

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.680
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yes.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.010
So the idea is if you made
one 8 and a half by 11 front

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.280
and back for the last exam,
please just bring that.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.387
Don't bother making a new one.

00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:48.720
But you might want to make a
new one that contains stuff

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.190
that we've done since then.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.330
That's the idea.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.730
But we of course don't
care what you do.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.420
Micro, you know, if you want
to bring-- so, no electronics.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.854
But optical
magnification is fine.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.020
If you want to bring a
little microscope, it's fine.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.480
We don't mind.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.420
If you can have an all optics,
no electronic, microfiche

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.120
reader, fine.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.960
So the idea is just
to send the message

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.540
that you shouldn't be
spending a lot of time

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.100
leafing through 300 pages.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.364
That's what we don't
want you to do.

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:21.340
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.550
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yes

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.530
AUDIENCE: Can we bring our
abacus, or is that not allowed?

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.400
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Can you bring your?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.349
AUDIENCE: Abacus.

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.890
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Abacuses are welcome.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.620
In fact, I would love to
race somebody with an abacus.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.900
I will take you on
with a slide rule.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.587
Okay, so I learned with a slide
rule and the question was--

00:02:36.587 --> 00:02:38.170
Well, no, you don't
want to know that.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.810
I don't want to tell
you that, actually.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.860
Okay, other questions, comments?

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.090
Abacuses, fine.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.755
Non electronic devices.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.060
So today is the final
lecture on feedback.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.910
What we've done over the
course of the last week

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.730
and a half or so is looked
at a variety of applications.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.100
Last time we looked
at how to perform--

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.900
how to improve
performance with feedback.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.316
We looked at how you could
increase the bandwidth of an op

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:13.390
amp, increase the
speed of an op amp,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.780
change a motor so that
its natural output, which

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.790
is a voltage
controlled velocity,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.580
could be perturbed into a
voltage controlled position.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.740
Today I want to just
do a few more examples.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.590
Because what I want you to do
is leave this place thinking

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.480
feedback's really useful.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.680
It's not just torture.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.736
I mean it is torture.

00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:32.860
We do torture you and you're
supposed to figure out

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.568
how it works quantitatively
and all that.

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:36.010
But it's not just torture.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.870
It's actually very useful.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.800
And that's what I
want you to take away.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.650
The first application today
that I want to think about

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.390
is reducing unwanted
parameter variation.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.140
So the idea that I
want you to think about

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.590
is what do you have in a power
amplifier of the type that you

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.900
would drive speakers--

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.270
of the type that you would
use to drive speakers.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.090
That's a kind of a
complicated electronic device.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.250
It's kind of hard
to make high power.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.500
You end up having to
generate high power in order

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.517
to make a loud speaker that
fills this hall for example.

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:12.100
And if you were to
try to do something

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.935
bigger like a concert,
it's even harder.

00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:17.050
And the problem with
those kinds of devices

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.779
is that they are active.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.370
They generate signals
that are bigger

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.560
that generate more
power at their output

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.870
than there was
available at the input.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.280
And we're very good
at such things.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.260
Unfortunately, such things
are intrinsically non-linear.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.430
So we actually take advantage
of non-linearities in materials

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.030
in order to do that.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.000
The result though is
that at a high level

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.350
the thing's still non-linear.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.720
And we can see some of that.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.120
And not only non-linear,
but other things.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.480
They can be
temperature dependent.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.560
So if you were to make
a high power amplifier

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.540
it's very likely
that the performance

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.270
would depend on temperature.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.090
Who cares, it's always
room temperature.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.310
No, not inside the amplifier.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.050
It may start out
at room temperature

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.300
every time you turn it on,
but within a few minutes

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.200
it's going to be much higher
than room temperature.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.866
And if you didn't do
something about it,

00:05:07.866 --> 00:05:10.730
the gain would change.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.280
If you didn't do something
about it in your car,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.500
it would track the
weather, which may be good.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.530
Maybe it would
provide a distraction

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.980
and provide utility to winter.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.740
But short of that
normally we don't

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.940
want the sound level that
comes out of a stereo system

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.380
to depend on temperature.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.770
So how do you take a
device that intrinsically

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.980
depends on temperature?

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.580
Here I am imagining that I
have a power amplifier whose

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.600
gain can go between 8
and 12, say, depending

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.340
on what the temperature is.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.040
How could you fix that
so that its behavior

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.570
was more consistent from day
to day, from hour to hour.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.480
And of course, not too
surprisingly, the answer

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.272
is use feedback.

00:05:53.272 --> 00:05:54.920
So how do you do that?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.800
So you want to connect the
amplifier to the speaker.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.847
After all, it's
inside the amplifier

00:05:59.847 --> 00:06:01.430
that you have all
the transistors that

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.020
are able to drive the speaker.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.790
So you don't want to
perturb that connection.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.280
But what you can
do with feedback

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.180
is monitor what was the voltage
that actually got produced

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.020
and try to rig the feedback
system to coerce it

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.410
to the voltage you wish it were.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.180
So the way you can do that is
to generate a feedback loop.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.130
Precede the power amplifier
with a voltage amplifier

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.890
that does not necessarily
significantly increase

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:29.400
the power.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.566
That makes that kind of an
amplifier somewhat easier

00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:34.400
to make.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.860
So imagine that
this power amplifier

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.720
has big chunky
transistors because it

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.160
has to generate amps in order
to make your speakers work.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.460
This, by comparison, could be
a much less power hungry kind

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.060
of amplifier.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.850
And it's easier to
make, and in particular

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.260
would be easy to make it
with a gain of 10 or 100

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.730
or 1,000 or 10,000.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.270
We're very good at doing
that kind of stuff.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.440
Then the idea of feedback
is to compare the signal

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.490
that you generated to the signal
that you might have desired.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.080
So here's the signal
you generated.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.430
Here is the signal you desired.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.650
I'm comparing it
through a monitor

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.710
that's feeding back beta
times the output voltage.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.750
The reason I do that
can be seen if you just

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.666
work through the math.

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:21.700
So if I just write the
closed loop transfer function

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.890
for x goes to y, the easy
way to think about that's

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.630
Black's formula,
of course, right?

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.500
So think about the forward
path, k times f naught divided

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.580
by 1 plus the loop gain.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:42.342
So 1 plus the gain around
the loop is beta k f naught.

00:07:42.342 --> 00:07:43.800
And now just think
about what would

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.280
happen if I coerced it so
that I made k the thing that's

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.230
under my control big.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.750
If I make k big
enough, then I can

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.660
arrange so that beta k f naught,
independent of beta and k,

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.110
I can always choose k so
that the product is big

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.600
compared to the one.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.460
If I do that, I
can ignore the one.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.650
If I ignore the
one, the k's cancel,

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.100
the f naughts cancel, and
I'm left with whatever beta.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.170
Beta didn't depend on f naught.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.230
That's what I wanted.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.390
It didn't even depend
on k, other than k

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.960
had to be big enough so
that the division worked.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:32.110
So the result is that you
can make a stable gain

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.799
by incorporating an amplifier
with an unstable gain.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.080
Unstable meaning that it
varies in time, not that it's

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.496
unstable in the sense that we
often use the word unstable.

00:08:40.496 --> 00:08:41.350
I should avoid that.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.630
The parameter of
the gain changes.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.300
It changes between 8 and 12.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.740
And I can illustrate that
with this kind of a picture.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.840
If I plot the
variation at f naught.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.850
I've showed a range
here from 0 to 20.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.220
I'm imagining that in
a practical situation

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.850
it could vary between 8 and 12.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.880
And then in red,
I'm showing the gain

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.850
that would result if
there were no feedback.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.770
And as you can see that
over the range of 8 to 12,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.700
the output gain, the
total gain of the system,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.710
varies between 8 and
12, not surprisingly.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.720
That's what it would
mean to have no feedback.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:25.270
But if I crank in feedback, if
I set the k to 100 and feedback

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:30.820
ratio to 1/10, the 100 is
sufficient to make the one

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.660
negligible which means that
my overall gain is 1 over 10

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.780
determined only by the
feedback ratio, beta.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.050
And so the result
is this line shows

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.830
the solution to that equation.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.850
And you can see that
it's ruler straight

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.370
through the interesting region.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.540
Does that makes sense?

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.090
So what I've been able
to do is use feedback

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.240
in order to control the
value of a parameter that

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.480
was otherwise variable,
or sensitive to something,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.590
often temperature.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.020
Is that all clear?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.110
That kind of a thing--

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.150
Question?

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.891
I got rid of all the
variations, except beta.

00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:14.140
What about variations in beta?

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.247
Right, the premise was
I couldn't control this,

00:10:19.247 --> 00:10:20.830
it was going to vary
between 8 and 12.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.120
But what if beta changes.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.550
What if beta went
from 1/8th to 1/12th,

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.960
would that affect things?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.675
AUDIENCE: So yeah,
so we could put

00:10:30.675 --> 00:10:31.900
a feedback loop [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.191
DENNIS FREEMAN: You could
put in another feedback loop.

00:10:34.191 --> 00:10:37.510
That doesn't sound like it's
going to converge quickly.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.824
Yes?

00:10:38.824 --> 00:10:42.185
AUDIENCE: Typically we want to
be able to control beta anyway.

00:10:42.185 --> 00:10:43.060
DENNIS FREEMAN: Right

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.240
AUDIENCE: There's
nothing users control.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.790
DENNIS FREEMAN: That's right,
we'd want to control it.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.950
Is there any reason we--

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.520
but that's what we wanted
to do with f naught too.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.603
We wanted to control that.

00:10:49.603 --> 00:10:51.730
We'd like that to be 10.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:52.700
Yes.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.095
AUDIENCE: It will depend on
how that beta would change.

00:10:56.095 --> 00:10:58.520
Changes, say, from
1/8th to 1/12th,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.975
probably nothing to worry about.

00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:04.957
If it changes from
1/8th to 1 over 8,000,

00:11:04.957 --> 00:11:07.739
then you may want to think
about what k and f are.

00:11:07.739 --> 00:11:09.780
DENNIS FREEMAN: So what
do you think will happen?

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.571
Do you think it will
vary a lot or a little

00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:13.590
compared to 8 to 12?

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.970
AUDIENCE: Probably
not that much.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:15.930
DENNIS FREEMAN: Why?

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.602
AUDIENCE: Because
the k is already--

00:11:18.602 --> 00:11:21.506
1/8th and 1/12th is not
really much of a difference

00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:22.357
in terms of--

00:11:22.357 --> 00:11:24.690
DENNIS FREEMAN: So why do I
think about beta differently

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.650
from the way I think
about f naught?

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.950
Is there a good reason
for that or is that just

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.810
wishful thinking, right?

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.230
Engineering by wishful thinking.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.320
I wish I could get a beta
that was exactly right.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.135
Yes?

00:11:38.135 --> 00:11:41.105
AUDIENCE: For amplification,
beta needs to be less than 1

00:11:41.105 --> 00:11:44.060
[INAUDIBLE] so [INAUDIBLE]
the resistor, it's not

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.060
going to have a very big
temperature [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.390
DENNIS FREEMAN: Precisely.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:52.150
So the problem is getting
gain in a stable and reliable

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:56.360
fashion, not in
getting attenuation.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.370
We can control the value of a
resistor with great precision.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.490
And so it's easy,
by comparison, it's

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:12.310
relatively easy to control the
gain of a resistor network,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:17.140
and much harder to control the
gain of a transistor network.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.150
Transistors have gain.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.870
Gain is hard to make in a non
temperature dependent fashion.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.990
Division by a resistor, it's
not hard to make a resistor.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.810
I mean it's not trivial,
but it's not hard.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.020
Even in the dark ages--

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.980
even in the dark ages, resistors
were made by winding wires,

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.750
and they were very
stable with temperature

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.080
or could be made to be very
stable with temperatures.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.460
So one of the tricks in
feedback is that we usually--

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.500
so we move the--

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:52.120
we move the parameter dependence
out of the forward path

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.330
and into the feedback
path with the idea

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.310
that we're moving it
out of the part that

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.550
has active parts like
transistors and into the part

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.920
that we can build
with passive parts.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.040
And we almost always
do feedback that way.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.290
Not always, but almost always.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.930
Another important point
is that this could

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.320
work at a very high speed.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.270
As an illustration
of that I want

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:22.160
to think about what would be
inside of that f naught box.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.900
Here's a very
simple idea of what

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.770
you could put in there that's
based on two power transistors.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.040
This is not a course
in power transistors.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.060
I am not going to give
you a very good model

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:32.810
for a transistor.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.851
There's other courses that
do much better justice

00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:36.300
to that topic.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.270
But what I do want to
say is that the idea

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.030
would be that turning those
transistors on and off

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.370
represents a significant
source of distortion,

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.420
or potentially a
source of distortion.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.140
So for example, the
simplest possible model

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.860
I could think about
would say that in order

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.740
to generate, in order to
push this voltage to a higher

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:59.600
number, what I want to do
is turn this transistor on

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.760
because this will
pull this voltage up

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.470
toward the positive rail.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.110
So if the input is such
that I'd like this to go up

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.570
what I would like to have
happen is that this transistor

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.900
would come on and conduct
current this way, which would

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.930
suck this voltage up to there.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.130
To do that, the voltage here
has to exceed the voltage there.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.590
For a BJT, that's not the
only kind of transistor

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.950
I'm just illustrating one
particular kind of example.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:31.780
For a bipolar
transistor of this type,

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.660
the way you would turn
that transistor on

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.880
would be to have
this voltage exceed

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.150
this voltage by at least some
threshold voltage, nominally

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.530
0.6 volts, which means that
the kind of relationship

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:48.360
between v out and v in that you
would get is illustrated here.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.450
If the input voltage differed
from the output voltage

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.480
by less than plus or minus
the threshold voltage, then

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.070
nothing would happen because
neither transistor would be on.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.270
If the input exceeded what
was desired for the output

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.150
by more than 0.6, the
transistor on the top

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.960
would start to come on, and you
would get roughly linear growth

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.830
in the output voltage in
relation to the input voltage.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.090
Similarly with negative.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:20.500
If you make the voltage at the
input sufficiently negative,

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.010
you can cause the
bottom transistor

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:26.636
to come on and suck the
voltage down toward minus 50.

00:15:26.636 --> 00:15:28.510
But again, you have to
exceed the difference.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.885
The difference has to exceed
something like the threshold

00:15:30.885 --> 00:15:34.960
voltage, normally about
0.6 volts, which means then

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.280
that you get this piecewise
linear approximation

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.400
to the relation between the
input and the output voltage.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.070
The problem with that is that
it distorts the waveform.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.040
So if I imagine a
purely sinusoidal input,

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.720
what I get at the output then is
not a purely sinusoidal output.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.170
And, in fact, that's
quite objectionable

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.760
for many purposes.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.560
In particular, in
the example where

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.560
we're listening to a sound, if
we were to listen to this sound

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.500
it would sound very
different from the way

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.340
a sine wave would sound.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.350
So the way I can do that
is, not surprisingly,

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.000
fix it with feedback.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.670
Again imagine that this
is the complicated part.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.230
v f naught, followed
by the speaker,

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.030
put some gain in front
of it, gain's cheap.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.250
We can do that run
relatively well.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.320
And put in feedback
so that I can directly

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.650
compare how is the speaker
voltage compare to the voltage

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.440
that I'd like to listen to.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.380
The result then
is that, depending

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.710
on how big is the
gain, I can change

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.630
how big is this dead zone.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:47.060
The zone of input voltages that
produce no change in output.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.380
So if I turn up the gain, here
I am illustrating k equals one.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.680
If I turn it up to k equals two
the dead zone gets smaller--

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.520
k equals four,
eight, 10, whatever.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.950
So the idea is that
by adjusting the gain,

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.710
I control how much
feedback there is.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:07.410
And I can control how
distorted the wave form looks.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.910
And I can illustrate how
bad it is to not do that

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.540
by comparing an
original clip of music

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.550
to different values
of the feedback.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.670
So what I'm going to do
is play this many clips,

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.920
some original--

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.310
the original that
came off the mp3.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.310
Put it through the system
with no feedback, that

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.660
is to say there isn't a k here.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.701
There's no feedback loop.

00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:35.220
You just put v in a v out.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.415
Then k of two, four, eight, 16,
and then back to the original.

00:17:38.415 --> 00:17:40.290
And if you listen, you
should be able to hear

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.220
the effects of the distortion.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:42.720
OK.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.494
Ready?

00:17:44.494 --> 00:17:46.486

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.590
You hear?

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.586
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:05.471 --> 00:19:05.970
OK.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.840
Everybody get to hear it?

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.510
So the point-- although the
acoustics in this room are

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.130
terrible--

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:16.480
but even somebody with
as old ears as mine, I

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.610
can hear a very big
difference even between k

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.230
equals 16 and the original if
I listen to it over headphones,

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.630
or if I listen to it in
a better environment.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.680
So the point is that we're
very sensitive to it.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.630
In fact, 16 isn't even close.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.420
I mean, in a real
kind of an amplifier

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.670
you would use gains
of at least 1,000

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.620
in order to make it acceptable.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.900
So the point is that
we can use feedback.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.870
So the overall point
is to try to illustrate

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.090
the kinds of things we
can do with feedback.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.700
Here what we're doing is making
a system that's intrinsically

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.190
non-linear more linear.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:52.710
Questions?

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.510
Comments?

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.630
Left turn approaching.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.770
So what I want to
close with then

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.610
is two more examples
that are much more fun.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.220
They're examples of
the use of feedback

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.690
to stabilize unstable systems.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.390
This is kind of connecting
back to the very first lecture

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.370
in this series that
Russ gave where

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.010
he did some very
complicated control

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.460
problems by doing feedback.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.330
I'm going to do some
slightly simpler ones.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:23.940
But they're hard
enough to be clear

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.342
that they were a hard
problem, and easy enough

00:20:26.342 --> 00:20:28.800
that every one of you should
be able to write the equations

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.789
and figure out what
I'm about to do.

00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:34.080
If you are interested to do
the more complicated things

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.570
like having owls
come in and swoop,

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.400
that's a research project.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.110
So this is supposed to be in the
middle ground between research

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.670
and trivial, right?

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.420
So I'm going to do some examples
now of some unstable systems

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:54.200
to illustrate how you would
use feedback for stability.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.660
First example, is
magnetic levitation.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.700
You've probably heard
of magnetic levitation.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.170
Magnetic levitation is hard.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.390
We've talked about magnetic
levitation since the 70s

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.760
at least, perhaps the 60s.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.580
It's hard because
magnetic systems tend

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.090
to be intrinsically unstable.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.080
Not always, but
the easy ways you

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.260
can imagine using a
magnet to levitate things.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.870
We'd all like to
make anti-grav right?

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.810
Anti-grav would be
a really good thing.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.760
And it seems like you
ought to be able to do

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.050
that with a magnet, right?

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.010
So the idea is what I would
like to do is levitate

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:35.470
a mass with a magnet.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.707
Anti-grav, right?

00:21:36.707 --> 00:21:38.290
We've had that since
Star Trek, right?

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.460
It's time somebody built it.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:44.872
But it's hard even though
we can make magnets.

00:21:44.872 --> 00:21:46.330
Even though we can
make things that

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.450
seemed like they would do it.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.110
It's hard because it's
intrinsically unstable.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.850
This particular system
is intrinsically

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.360
unstable in the sense
that if the mass, let's

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.170
say that it was at
equilibrium by which I mean,

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.270
in the absence of
somebody touching it,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.100
it would stay exactly
the way it is.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.050
That's what I mean
by equilibrium.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.390
Let's say it was
at equilibrium so

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.450
that the magnetic force I found
was just sufficient to hold up

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.640
the weight, Mg.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.360
If I came over and
just very gently bumped

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.045
the mass up a little, what
would happen to the force?

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.577
Force will go up.

00:22:30.577 --> 00:22:32.785
So you're supposed to remember
this from some subject

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:34.960
that you took before, right?

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.290
Yes, no, yes?

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:39.190
It started with an 8, yes?

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.250
So the idea is something
to do with if you

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:47.440
have a magnet of that type,
you generate magnetic fields.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.660
You remember they're not
supposed to cross, right?

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.201
One of the rules is
they don't cross.

00:22:51.201 --> 00:22:53.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:57.610
But the idea is that the
density of flux lines

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.850
decreases as you
leave the magnet,

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:02.830
and the force
that's generated has

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.460
something to do with the change
in the density of flux lines.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.140
If you move an object
through a region

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.056
where the number of flux
lines doesn't change,

00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:11.320
it takes no force.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.300
If you move an object
into a region that

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.151
has fewer or more flux
lines, it requires force

00:23:16.151 --> 00:23:16.900
to make that move.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.400
That's the idea.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:24.250
So, since the flux lines are
thinning as you move away,

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.837
if I push up it will generate--

00:23:26.837 --> 00:23:28.420
I'm moving the mass
into a place where

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.110
there is a greater density of
flux lines, that will generate

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:37.150
force up on the mass.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.240
That's bad, right?

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.060
I had the force exactly where
I needed it to be in order

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.782
to levitate the mass.

00:23:44.782 --> 00:23:46.240
If the force goes
up, what happens?

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.870
It accelerates up.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.730
Well, OK, so it
accelerates up, then what?

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.660
Well, it gets closer.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.510
Then what?

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.640
It accelerates faster.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.950
So, the problem is that
the position is unstable,

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:09.370
or we might say quasi stable.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.410
So what we can do is
make a model of this

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.670
to try to understand how we
could fix it with feedback.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.560
Imagine that I
represent the magnet

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.770
by a function that
maps for every value

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:26.890
of the position of the mass
why it generates a force, f m.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.270
Then, because of the
shape of the field lines,

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.805
I'm expecting that
the force increases

00:24:31.805 --> 00:24:33.430
on the right of the
curve and decreases

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.010
on the left of the curve.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:40.630
If I'm sitting for y zero
at equilibrium what matters

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:46.320
is the difference between y
and the equilibrium place.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.390
And the important
force is the difference

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:53.220
between the magnetic
force and Mg, the weight.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.870
So I get a simple
relationship that

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:59.010
says that this force,
this vertical line, f,

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.040
should be m a.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:07.320
F equals m a which
is m y double dot.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.960
So having generated
that kind of a model

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.780
I can now imagine putting
that into a feedback system.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.400
So now I put the model into the
feedback system and this junk

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.400
over here, this is f equals m a.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.195
f gets multiplied by
one over m, that a.

00:25:27.195 --> 00:25:29.050
a is y double dot.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.500
Integrate it to get y dot.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.150
Integrate it again to get y.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.400
But y was the thing that
controlled the magnet

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.170
in the first place.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:40.560
So I'm trying to cast magnetic
levitation into a frame

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.030
for understanding feedback.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.690
So now if I want to
further simplify things

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:54.330
I can replace the magnet model,
at least for small deviations

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.059
in position, by a linear gain.

00:25:58.059 --> 00:25:59.850
So I'm making a straight
line approximation

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.234
to this curvy line.

00:26:02.234 --> 00:26:03.650
And then we have
something that we

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.140
analyze all the
time, simple feedback

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:11.160
system that has integrators,
gains, that kind of stuff.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.590
It's surprisingly similar
to the mass spring dashpot.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:23.100
Springs, by contrast to magnets,
springs levitate stably.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.964
What happens if I
push-- so I'm suspending

00:26:24.964 --> 00:26:26.880
a mass from a spring,
if I push up on the mass

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.700
how does the force
in the spring change?

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.780
Gets less.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.000
That's what you want.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.970
It's no longer sufficient
to hold the mass up,

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.040
so the mass falls.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.990
Push up, the mass tries to fall.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.880
Pull down on the mass,
it tries to pull up.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.620
Spring levitates stably.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.300
Magnet levitates unstably.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:50.840
OK?

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.700
Almost the same system though.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.580
Here's a way of thinking
about the magnetic levitation

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.720
like we just saw.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.210
Here's an equivalent diagram
for the spring levitation.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.340
Almost the same thing.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:05.600
The critical thing is that
minus sign and that plus sign.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.300
So what's the relationship
between the poles of the spring

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:15.600
and mass system and the poles
of the levitation system?

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.730
Look at your neighbor.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.950
Say the word poles.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.780
We say that a lot in this class.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.750
How do the poles relate
in those two systems?

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.718
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.340
OK, so draw the poles in
the air for the two systems.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.530
How do they relate?

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.030
Excellent.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:00.529
Excellent.

00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:01.630
I saw one right answer.

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.350
Somebody else draw some--

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.896
I'm not sure if I
caught that one.

00:28:08.896 --> 00:28:10.020
So how do the poles relate?

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.040
Come on, somebody
drawn it in the air.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.123
I've got one right answer.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.360
OK, your air drawings
are a little cryptic.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.490
Here's a not so air drawing.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:23.430
So here's a picture of what they
look like for a spring and mass

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.810
system.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:28.670
And all you do is think about
the differential equation,

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:33.030
turn it into system
function, there's two poles,

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.610
factor the denominator,
you find that the two poles

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.160
are on the j omega axis.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.810
j omega axis, that sounds bad.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.550
Yeah, it is bad,
right? what happens

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.450
if they're on the j omega axis?

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:45.250
Oscillate.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.750
If they're right on the j omega
axis, it oscillates forever.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.458
That's exactly what
a mass spring dashpot

00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:52.220
does if you have no damping.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.610
OK, it's bad.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.480
But it's not nearly as bad
as magnetic levitation.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.970
Magnetic levitation, you get the
same distance from the origin,

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:06.380
but it's turned to plus
and minus something.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.170
That one.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.090
I like.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.700
That one I don't like.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.384
That one is unstable.

00:29:13.384 --> 00:29:15.800
So the question is, how can
you make a magnetic levitation

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.299
system?

00:29:16.299 --> 00:29:18.200
How do you make a
system that we use

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.250
a magnet to levitate a mass when
the physics are intrinsically

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:23.910
stable?

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.980
And the answer is--

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.170
feedback, of course, yes.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.900
So the idea is that
here is our system that

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.090
was intrinsically unstable.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:37.992
What we'd like to do is
somehow change the physics.

00:29:37.992 --> 00:29:39.700
One of the ways we
can change the physics

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.656
is by modifying the current
that runs through the magnet.

00:29:43.656 --> 00:29:45.280
If we changed the
current from i naught

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.225
to 1.1 times i naught,
then the forces

00:29:47.225 --> 00:29:48.350
everywhere would be bigger.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:54.690
We could use that idea to
introduce a second feedback

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:55.540
path.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.480
There is the intrinsic
one that comes just

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.950
from the physical layout.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.720
But I'm going to add a path that
senses the position of the mass

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.100
and feeds back a
change in current.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:10.350
And if I do this carefully,
I can arrange this path,

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:14.310
the intrinsic one has positive
feedback that was bad,

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:19.600
but the one I add has negative
feedback, which is good.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.920
Then the overall system looks
more like this where I've got

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.930
k, which I cannot
affect, that's physics.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.990
But I've got k two
that I can affect.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.160
And what's showed
here is a root locus.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.550
As I change k two, what
happens to the poles?

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.890
And what you can see is since
they were equally disposed

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.220
on the two sides of the j omega
axis, as I turned up the gain--

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.140
you can do this just by doing--

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.560
factor the polynomial.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.060
Right?

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:55.330
So I factored this to
generate this plot.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.610
As you increase k two the
poles go toward each other

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.010
and then they split,
and they become complex.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.545
Complex is good.

00:31:02.545 --> 00:31:05.450
But this still has the
problem that the mass spring

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.640
dashpot had if it
didn't have any damping.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.166
So it's better because
at least it's stable--

00:31:11.166 --> 00:31:12.290
Oh well no it's not stable.

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:13.640
It's marginally stable.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.160
It's now oscillatory.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.320
It no longer has eigenfunctions
that grow with time.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.000
The problem is they
don't shrink either.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.500
They state constant
in amplitude.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.580
But you can fix that,
and what I'll do now

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.810
is show a demo that was done by
Professor James Roberge where

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:38.320
the idea was you don't have
to just put the extra gain in.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.090
What Jim did was put a zero too.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:46.930
So these are the intrinsic poles
from the magnetic levitation.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:50.400
This is a zero introduced
by electronics.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.740
The zero has the effect
of bending the poles,

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.540
the closed loop poles
around, so that you can then

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.890
make it stable.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.840
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.070
So here's Jim's device.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.920
And the goal now
is to smash fingers

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.830
because it will try to levitate.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.980
So this is a hunky magnet.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.560
This is a hunky power supply.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.980
And that is-- well this
is the power supply.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.970
This generates DC voltage that
drives the amplifier that's

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:23.680
inside this box.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.160
So the idea then is we
have this metal ball.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.840
So we have this metal ball,
and it's kind of heavy, right?

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.250
You know, it's not
like some nuclear--

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.350
it's not uranium or
anything, but it's heavy.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:40.374
And the idea is going to
be to use the hunky magnet.

00:32:40.374 --> 00:32:41.290
Let's see, can we see?

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.660
Oh yeah, OK, so you
can see it up there.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.440
So you can see
maybe that here is

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.840
the pole of the magnet,
which is right there.

00:32:52.362 --> 00:32:54.320
So there is the pole, a
different kind of pole.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.955
Not to be confused.

00:32:55.955 --> 00:32:57.614
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:03.110
So that's the iron
core of the magnet.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.570
And you can see
the turns up here.

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.030
And here you can see some light.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.090
So what's going on here
is a source of light

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:14.270
is being aimed
toward a photo sensor

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:19.070
so that when the mass, the
ball, is levitating at exactly

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:22.250
the right place, there's a
signal that gets fed back

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.370
into the control box to do the
thing that I have illustrated

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.700
here.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.510
OK, everybody knows
what's going on?

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.340
I'll smash my
fingers now and then

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.644
ask Lorenzo to do it correctly.

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:35.060
So what I'm going
to do now is try

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:39.290
to move the mass into
the air so it levitates.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.420
so successful would be
you're watching up there

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.030
and there's going to be a ball
up here, and it will levitate.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:47.080
Unsuccessful is I'll
have a black and white--

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.680
a black and blue fingernail.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.540
So, let's see--

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:56.350
Lorenzo is laughing at me.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:58.306
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:59.284 --> 00:34:00.751
LORENZO: See your hand can move.

00:34:00.751 --> 00:34:02.220
OK.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.224
DENNIS FREEMAN: Nope,
that's not going to work.

00:34:04.224 --> 00:34:06.177
LORENZO: You don't
have a way to move?

00:34:06.177 --> 00:34:07.010
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yes.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.280
LORENZO: Yes.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.110
DENNIS FREEMAN: OK,
this will work better.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:14.310
If I get coached
enough, I can do things.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.640
LORENZO: Yeah!

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.139
Oh!

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:16.562
DENNIS FREEMAN: Almost!

00:34:16.562 --> 00:34:17.409
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:18.310
OK, it was close.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.100
No, no, no.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.300
Failing once is fine.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.350
Failing twice, no
that's not acceptable.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:30.060
Wonderful.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.449
OK, so that's magnetic
levitation made possible

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:34.120
by feedback.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.190
That's the point, OK?

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.856
Everybody sort of
knows what's going on?

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.832
OK, so to redeem myself
we'll leave the demo set up

00:34:43.832 --> 00:34:45.290
and after lecture
you can come down

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.998
and you can do it and
smash your fingers.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:53.949
Questions, comments,
everybody knows the point?

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:56.184
So we'll leave it there just
for entertainment value.

00:34:56.184 --> 00:34:57.225
LORENZO: It will get hot.

00:34:57.225 --> 00:34:58.360
DENNIS FREEMAN: Oh, OK.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.020
OK.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.436
You don't want to
burn it up, huh?

00:35:03.951 --> 00:35:04.450
Good.

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:04.960
Thank you.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.198
Thank you.

00:35:06.198 --> 00:35:08.114
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:15.040
So the next demo is the
famous inverted pendulum.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.360
The idea is that if
you have a pendulum--

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:18.860
Yes?

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.141
AUDIENCE: Was k
oscillating also?

00:35:21.141 --> 00:35:21.640
With the--

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.640
DENNIS FREEMAN: Correct.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.770
Correct.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:25.390
So, that's a good question.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.010
OK, so did I screw up?

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.460
Not a chance, right?

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.340
Or for those of
you who know me--

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.957
what would you conclude
if it was oscillating

00:35:35.957 --> 00:35:37.540
and I told you I
thought I built this?

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.030
I screw up the circuit.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:48.000
I screwed up the
root locus diagram.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.310
Everything's hunky dory,
and I did everything right.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:52.540
None of the above.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:53.332
Yes?

00:35:53.332 --> 00:35:55.657
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:55.657 --> 00:35:56.740
DENNIS FREEMAN: Positions.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.570
OK, so flaky hardware.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.540
Universal solution right?

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.140
Could be.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.639
Could be.

00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:03.320
Could be.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.360
There's a different
explanation, which is possible,

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.130
but your explanation
may be right.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:12.639
What's another explanation
besides flaky hardware?

00:36:12.639 --> 00:36:13.138
Yes?

00:36:13.138 --> 00:36:14.952
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
complex poles.

00:36:14.952 --> 00:36:17.410
DENNIS FREEMAN: Complex poles,
but didn't I stabilize them?

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.160
Leading question.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.720
Didn't I stabilize them?

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.220
Leading question.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.500
The answer is, didn't
I stabilize them?

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.770
Yes?

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:35.320
No?

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.455
Completely cryptic he is.

00:36:37.455 --> 00:36:40.904
AUDIENCE: I mean they can
still have complex values.

00:36:40.904 --> 00:36:42.820
DENNIS FREEMAN: They
could have complex-- how?

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
don't know where they are.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.901
DENNIS FREEMAN: And
so what depends--

00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:47.520
what determines where they are?

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.330
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:52.085
DENNIS FREEMAN: What
determines what they are?

00:36:52.085 --> 00:36:55.965
AUDIENCE: Whatever your--
whatever you set [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:55.965 --> 00:36:56.940
k or gain.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:57.886
DENNIS FREEMAN: k

00:36:57.886 --> 00:36:58.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.799
DENNIS FREEMAN: Exactly.

00:36:59.799 --> 00:37:03.150
So I get to control
this k two thing.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:07.660
And as I change k two,
the poles start out here,

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.980
they go toward each other.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.070
So if k equals
zero they're here.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.615
As k gets bigger they do this.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:20.550
So it's possible that
they're just simply here.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.370
Right?

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.180
The poles could
still be complex.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.300
If that were true, you would
expect the oscillations

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.250
to die with time.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:30.760
Right?

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.160
If the oscillations
didn't die with time,

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.050
it's still possible-- well,
if they don't die with time,

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.591
then I guess I
screwed something up.

00:37:38.591 --> 00:37:39.090
Right?

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.590
Because even if
they just come here,

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:44.400
they're oscillating but they're
on the left part of the axis so

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.800
they should decay eventually.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.570
So I guess to the
extent that they

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:53.460
didn't die eventually, something
screwed up with the analysis,

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.500
the hardware is
screwed up, something.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.238
Yes?

00:37:56.238 --> 00:37:58.680
AUDIENCE: So is root
locus due to k or k two.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.130
DENNIS FREEMAN: k two.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.340
You can draw a root
locus for anything.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.680
You can change any
parameter and sketch

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.750
the locus of points
where the roots move to,

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.870
hence the name, root locus.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.970
This is for k two.

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:19.550
So z zero was fixed here,
held constant, and k two

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.160
was modified to
trace out that loop.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.950
The next example is pendulum.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:32.720
So just like spring
mass system, spring

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.990
levitated mass in
a stable fashion,

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.020
although perhaps oscillatory.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:44.420
So this pendulum is also
stable in that same sense.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.780
Might be oscillatory, but
it will eventually stop.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.910
Of course pendula are
not very interesting.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.670
What's interesting
is inverted pendula

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.260
where the rule is
what I have to do

00:38:54.260 --> 00:39:01.580
is stabilize this by moving
my hand to compensate.

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:05.270
So let's say that it
starts to move this way.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:09.470
I've got positive feedback
that tends to make it continue.

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:15.710
So if I started at equilibrium,
by which I mean a state

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:19.530
that would persist
if nothing changed.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.610
So if I started at
equilibrium, but then

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.780
perturbed it by
breathing, or whatever,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.060
or by just not being quite
at equilibrium, it'll move

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.280
and then I have to do
something to compensate,

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.590
otherwise it'll fall down.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:37.130
And there are people who
can do this better than me.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:39.049
But we don't need to have--

00:39:39.049 --> 00:39:40.340
I don't need to be coordinated.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.890
I can build a system
that's coordinated instead.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:44.570
That's the value of feedback.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.790
So I can be uncoordinated.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:50.110
Before I do that--

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.050
no, let's do this first.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:56.120
So, here is a
mechanical system that

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.090
uses feedback to stabilize--

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.750
I'm not going to
read anything right?

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:04.490
So here is a pendulum,
an inverted pendulum.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:05.810
There's some stuff down here.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.480
There's no active parts.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.190
This stuff is a
potentiometer, just

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:12.148
like the potentiometer
on the back of the motor

00:40:12.148 --> 00:40:13.130
that I demonstrated.

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.650
And what it's doing
is providing a signal

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:20.690
to electronics that will let
the electronics say, oh, it's

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.190
moving this way.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:26.390
Now, the cart is on
wheels, and the wheels

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.480
are connected to a hunky motor.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.400
If the weight starts
to move this way

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.040
what should the hunky motor do?

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.440
Push the cart that way.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.700
So that's the idea.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:44.030
So I've got a one
dimensional inverted pendulum

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:48.290
and I'm explicitly modeling the
idea that I'm-- that the base

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:49.670
is moving.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.770
So over here is an
outline of the way you

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:53.960
think about that-- the way
you can think about that.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:59.100
I got the car and
it's in a not invert--

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.700
the car as supporting
a pendulum.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:04.770
The pendulum is in
a non inertial frame

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:06.780
because the mass--

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.150
let's say that I'm approximating
the pendulum as having

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.740
all of its mass at the end.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.900
That's an approximation,
but it's not

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.190
a critical approximation.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.970
So I can imagine now that I've
got an input variable, which

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:21.060
is x, the position of the car.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.760
And I've got a
feedback signal that's

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.350
trying to feedback
to me how much is

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:30.070
theta, the angle that
the pendulum is making.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:31.860
And so what I want
you to do now--

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:36.360
so if you just write
801 kinds of stuff

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.950
you can imagine that the if--

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:41.550
So, first off, you've got--

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:44.840
instead of f equals m a, you
have torque equals i omega.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.520
Everybody's happy about
torque equals i omega, right?

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.570
And, if I want to be in
a non inertial frame,

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:54.450
one way to account for the
fact that the car is moving

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.930
is to compute torques about
the point of insertion.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.110
Then I can represent the
effect of the moving car

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:05.620
as a pseudo force on the mass.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.120
That pseudo force
is in proportion

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.000
to the acceleration of the car.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.750
And I've got the weight of
the inverted pendulum trying

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.290
to pull it in the
other direction.

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:17.270
And if you think
about all this stuff

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.840
you get this kind
of an equation.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:25.340
So this is i omega dot, i
omega dot equals, and then

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.110
I have to worry about torques.

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:31.730
There's the torque
that's due to the weight,

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.620
and there's the torque that's
due to the cart movement.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.944
so the question then is, what
are the poles of this system?

00:42:42.944 --> 00:42:45.360
We want to think about all of
these kinds of systems using

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.030
003, because it's
such a powerful thing.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:52.480
So what are the poles of
the inverted pendulum?

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.620
Look at your neighbor.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.410
Say the word pole.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.270
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

00:43:02.007 --> 00:43:02.840
Where do the poles--

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.832
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

00:43:33.716 --> 00:43:35.210
Bump the car.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:41.260
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:44.770
OK, so where's the poles?

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:45.950
Sketch them in the air.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.480
No that didn't work at all.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.020
So to think about
where are the poles you

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.700
can think of-- the
hard part is just

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.630
the sinusoidal
trigonometric non-linearity,

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:59.060
so what do I do with that?

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.010
DENNIS FREEMAN: Throw
it away, absolutely.

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:06.700
So I'll assume that
the sine of theta is--

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.390
AUDIENCE: Theta.

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.720
DENNIS FREEMAN: Theta.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.757
And the cos of theta is?

00:44:08.757 --> 00:44:09.340
AUDIENCE: One.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.330
DENNIS FREEMAN: One.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:13.240
For small angular deflections,
just make a small angle

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.500
approximation.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.830
When you do that it
comes out surprisingly

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:23.270
to look just like the
levitated mass problem.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:27.980
You get real poles on each
side of the j omega axis.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.690
So in fact, you have to do a
similar kind of stability thing

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:34.012
to make this work.

00:44:34.012 --> 00:44:35.720
And so that's what
we'll demonstrate now.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:40.190
So the idea is going to
be to turn on electronics

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:42.710
to stabilize the inverted
pendulum so that I don't

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.566
need to do it with my hand.

00:44:45.566 --> 00:44:48.518
LORENZO: I'm not sure it's going
to work, because I [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:48.518 --> 00:44:50.000
the cord.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.127
So if [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:54.127 --> 00:44:55.460
DENNIS FREEMAN: It always works.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.454
He does it really well.

00:44:59.358 --> 00:45:00.326
LORENZO: That works.

00:45:10.962 --> 00:45:13.170
DENNIS FREEMAN: So it's a
little more stable than me,

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:14.350
but not much.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.470
I mean, I'm pretty good, right?

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:20.631
DENNIS FREEMAN: I can
keep it going too, right?

00:45:20.631 --> 00:45:23.670
Well, sort of.

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:25.020
So is it any better than I am?

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.210
So can you share that it's
better or worse than me.

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:38.460
LORENZO: It's better than you.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.740
DENNIS FREEMAN:
It's better than me?

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.240
Prove it.

00:45:44.216 --> 00:45:46.696
Go ahead.

00:45:46.696 --> 00:45:48.894
LORENZO: The way [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:48.894 --> 00:45:50.560
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
you ought to do this.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.934
So this guy.

00:45:51.934 --> 00:45:53.350
So can somebody
think of something

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:57.990
that's different about this
from the magnetic levitation

00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.490
problem?

00:46:04.359 --> 00:46:05.734
AUDIENCE: Like
right now it looks

00:46:05.734 --> 00:46:07.880
like it's going to converge.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.890
DENNIS FREEMAN: But it's
doing a really good thing.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:16.230
It's converging around here.

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:20.790
What would happen if
I was doing my thing

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.550
and it started to fall this
way, so I started to follow it.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.080
That's actually
very complicated.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.750
So there's actually another
feedback loop inside here

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:36.090
that's trying to make
it stay in the center.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:38.735
So if I tried to
pull that one out.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.770
Wap!

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:49.220
OK, so there's many feedback
loops going on here.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.960
There's the one
that you can see.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.600
But then there's also
a slow feedback loop

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.080
trying to keep the whole thing
oscillating in the center.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.169
Everybody follow that?

00:46:59.169 --> 00:47:00.960
So there's the primary
feedback loop, which

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.282
is very analogous to that guy.

00:47:02.282 --> 00:47:04.740
But then there's a slow feedback
loop saying wait a minute,

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.320
you're spending too
much time to the left.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.660
I'm going to move it a
little bit in the wrong way

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.960
so that you migrate
toward the right.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.320
But the result of
that is very stable.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.358
How stable?

00:47:16.358 --> 00:47:17.358
LORENZO: We'll find out.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.246
DENNIS FREEMAN: I didn't put
a battery on the top of mine.

00:47:26.246 --> 00:47:28.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:29.540
I could have!

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.040
Well, I could've put it there.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:35.425
So now we put the--

00:47:35.425 --> 00:47:37.405
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.015
AUDIENCE: I think
someone should sell this.

00:48:16.015 --> 00:48:17.260
DENNIS FREEMAN: A volunteer!

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:20.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:23.640
Everybody in favor?

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.011
It's overwhelming.

00:48:26.011 --> 00:48:26.510
OK.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:27.510
So that's all for today.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:29.420
The idea is that
we can use feedback

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.670
to do a whole bunch of things.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:31.878
And maybe even more tomorrow.

00:48:31.878 --> 00:48:34.060
Oh well now that's just a joke.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.430
See you tomorrow at the exam.

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:37.547
No recitation.

00:48:37.547 --> 00:48:39.380
We'll stick around for
two or three minutes.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.150
You can look at these
more if you want to.
