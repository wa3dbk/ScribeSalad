DENNIS FREEMAN: Hello.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.160
Welcome to the first lecture in
the last topic of this class.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.970
So we'll spend this lecture
and the next lecture

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.100
talking about modulation.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.880
Modulation, like sampling,
is an excellent illustration

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.490
of the power of thinking
about signals in terms

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.500
of their Fourier transforms.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.390
We'll see, just like
we saw in sampling,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.940
that a problem that
was potentially very

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.120
complicated to
understand, sampling,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.510
was very easy when you thought
about it in the Fourier domain.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.010
And precisely the
same thing happens

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.200
with modulation, which is
precisely the reason we're

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.540
talking about it now.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.330
So I'll talk about modulation in
the context of a communication

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.040
system.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.360
That's just for convenience.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.030
In fact, modulation is used
in lots of other places.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.890
In fact, next time,
in the next lecture,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.250
I'll show you an
application of modulation

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.750
from my research group,
where we used modulation

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.950
to improve the resolution
of an optical microscope--

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.210
nothing whatever to do
with communications.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.010
But it's still-- the
optical microscope--

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.190
the enhancement to
resolution that we achieve

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.470
is directly based
on the principles

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.970
that I'll start
to describe today.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.840
So I'll talk about
modulation today

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.760
in the context of
communications.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.400
Probably the most
convenient, easiest

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.310
to think about communication
system to all of us,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.240
being humans, is speech.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.790
We use speech for
communication all the time.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.570
It's very easy to think
about how speech works

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.710
as a communication medium.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.710
Somebody talks,
somebody listens.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.540
One of the first ways
of thinking about it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.430
as a technological feat
was the telephone--

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.420
the idea being that you convert
the sound that I'm emitting

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.359
when I'm speaking
by a microphone

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.150
into an electrical
representation that gets

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.360
shot down a wire.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.800
Then at the other end, you
take the electrical signal

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.710
that's coming down the wire
and turn it back into sound.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.980
That's the principle
of a telephone--

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.440
works very well.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.880
Modulation comes
up when we start

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.560
to think about how would
we generalize this notion

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.930
for wireless communication.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.920
In particular, if we do
cell phone communication,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.130
cell phones transmit the
signal that is picked up

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.690
from the microphone.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.410
That signal gets converted
into electromagnetic signals.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.660
That's the basis by which
cell phones communicate

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.640
with the cell tower.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.560
The towers may communicate
with other towers

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.510
via lot of different
kinds of technologies.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.310
I'm ignoring those for now.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.920
But the communication between
the phone and the tower

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.530
is via electromagnetic waves.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.570
And there's an
interesting thing that

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.500
happens when you try to recode
the signal that would have been

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.740
perfectly happy running
down the copper wire, when

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.630
you try to recode that signal
into an electromagnetic wave.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.380
And that has to do
with basic physics

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.140
of electromagnetic waves,
which I'm sure you all know.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.450
And so I'll just remind
you of one simple idea.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.880
So for efficient
transmission from

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.600
an electrical representation
to an electromagnetic wave,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.020
first off, that transduction
is mediated by something

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.490
we call an antenna.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.317
Antennas will take
an electrical signal

00:03:47.317 --> 00:03:49.150
and convert it into an
electromagnetic wave,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.250
and vice versa.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.670
But the efficiency with
which an antenna works

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.740
has to do, among other
things, with its size.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.220
It's very difficult-- by which
I mean it takes lots of power--

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.350
to transform a signal from
an electrical representation

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.910
to an E&amp;M representation
if the antenna is smaller--

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.579
is significantly smaller-- than
the wavelength of interest.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.840
So it's not that
you can't do it.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.290
It's that it takes
lots of power.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.680
So if you don't want
to burn a lot of power

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.780
doing that
transformation, then you

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.580
need to make an
antenna that's roughly

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.710
the size of the wavelength
that you're trying to transmit

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.260
as an electromagnetic wave.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.140
So if we were thinking
about this kind

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.170
of a scheme for the
communication of voice--

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.480
we've talked about
voice many times--

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.190
Telephone-quality
voice is usually

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.280
defined to be frequencies
between about 200 hertz

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.990
and about 3 kilohertz.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.030
If I had a signal
that was composed

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.060
of those kinds of
frequencies, how big

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.260
should I make the antenna
to get efficient coupling

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.050
between the electrical
representation

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.750
in the cell phone and
the electromagnetic wave

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.550
that the cell phone
wants to launch

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.650
to get to the cell tower?

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.040
So look at your neighbor.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.720
That involves turning your head.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.490
Say hello and figure out how
long should the antenna be.

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.472
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.180
DENNIS FREEMAN: Does
everybody have an answer?

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.360
Raise your hand if you
don't have an answer.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.140
How do you like that
for a switch of--

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.715
Raise your hand if you
don't have an answer.

00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:07.590
You all have answers?

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.260
OK, so how big should
the antenna be--

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.590
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5?

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:17.770
OK, very good.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.700
So the answer is really big.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.640
So you think about the
relationship between wavelength

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.540
and distance, so you can think
about the relationship is

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.860
given by speed.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.040
The speed of a wave
is the wave length--

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.680
how long it goes per cycle--

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.580
times the number of
cycles per second, f.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.470
So you can solve that
expression to find out

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.570
the wavelength in terms
of the speed, which

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.076
for an electromagnetic wave is
the speed of light, 3 times 10

00:07:51.076 --> 00:07:53.110
to the eighth meters per second.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.580
The hardest one to launch
is the lowest frequency.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.680
That'll take the
biggest antenna.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.360
So the lowest frequency
in telephony--

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.170
in telephone-quality
speech-- is 200 hertz.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.940
So we get about
1,500 kilometers--

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.365
kind of big, kind of useless.

00:08:13.365 --> 00:08:14.740
If you were thinking
about trying

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.073
to make cellular communication
and your antenna actually

00:08:17.073 --> 00:08:24.310
had to be 1,500 kilometers,
that just isn't going to work.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.350
So what do we do?

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.670
We obviously don't do this.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.580
So the answer is that
you would need an antenna

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.549
hundreds of miles in length.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:41.409
So what frequency
should you be using

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:44.440
if you wanted to build a phone
that kind of fit in your hand--

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.810
10 centimeters or so?

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.107
What would be the frequency--

00:08:49.107 --> 00:08:51.190
what would be the interesting
range of frequencies

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.305
that you would want to
use for such a device?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.870
And the answer is--

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.580
Of course.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.150
So the answer is, you
go to the bottom one,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.690
and it's bigger
than a gigahertz.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.090
And it's just running
the same expression

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.920
in the other direction.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.250
So you think about, the
frequency that you would like

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.430
would be the speed of light
divided by the wavelength.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.220
If you wanted the wavelength
to be 10 centimeters,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.860
then you would end
up with a frequency

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.480
on the order of gigahertz.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.400
And it shouldn't come
as a surprise to you

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.460
then that that's what we use
in cellular communication.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.620
So a modern cell phone
uses 2.1 gigahertz.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.570
So the point is that
when we're thinking

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:47.920
about how we would like to use
the electromagnetic spectrum

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.130
for a communications
task, that spectrum is not

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.190
necessarily well-matched
to the communications

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.960
problem of interest.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.970
You might think that
that cellular example

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.910
is an exception.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.670
In fact, that's the rule.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.520
If you try to have a signal
of interest transmitted

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.150
over a medium or stored
on some sort of a medium,

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.547
it is generally the case that
there is a matching problem,

00:10:10.547 --> 00:10:12.130
that the characteristics
of the medium

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.260
don't match the
characteristics of the message.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.960
And so part of
communications engineering

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.010
is trying to come up
with a coding scheme that

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.670
matches the characteristics
of the message

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.915
to the characteristics
of the medium.

00:10:28.915 --> 00:10:30.290
And so what I'm
going to do today

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.700
is talk about some matching
schemes based on modulation.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.860
So we just saw that if we wanted
to do cellular communication

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:44.210
of voice, voice might have
a spectrum represented

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.410
by this magnitude
function, X, where

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.910
the bandwidth is on the
order of a few kilohertz.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.340
But we might want to
transmit a signal that

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.700
has the same information.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.340
However, we would
like the frequencies

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.460
to be up around 2 gigahertz.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:11.710
Which of these coding
schemes, Y as a function of X,

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.140
achieves this transformation?

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.610
Take the stuff that you have
in a low frequency range

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.680
and shift it to a
high frequency range.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.460
What would you do?

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.570
The obvious answer is to
stare with a blank face in it.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.704
It'll definitely
come to you, right?

00:11:36.704 --> 00:11:38.370
You don't want to
talk to somebody else.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.369
That would give it away.

00:11:42.154 --> 00:11:47.643
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:08.601 --> 00:12:11.810
DENNIS FREEMAN: So what's the
relationship between X of t

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.410
and Y of t?

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.300
Is it relation 1, 2, 3,
4, or none of the above?

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.950
OK, it's about 80% correct.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.960
So how do I think about it?

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.050
So let's see, I
want to figure out

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:35.700
a relationship between the
Fourier transform of Y and X.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.190
If I wanted to figure out
the Fourier transform of Y,

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:45.940
I would integrate Y of t e
to the minus j omega t dt.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.850
That looks kind of right.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.059
And Y would be X of the t--

00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:51.100
let's try the first one--

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.775
X of t e to the j omega c t
e to the minus j omega t dt.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:06.580
Well, that's almost the Fourier
transform of X. All I've done

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.710
is shifted omega.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:18.970
So in fact, that's the same
as X of j omega minus omega c.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.380
And that's what I want to do.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.230
So the idea is that,
if you multiply

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.010
by this complex
exponential, the effect

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:35.080
of that multiplication in
time is to shift frequencies.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.120
Can somebody say that to me--

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.760
say the same transformation but
in slightly different words?

00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.877
Guess that was kind of big.

00:13:47.877 --> 00:13:48.377
Yes.

00:13:48.377 --> 00:13:51.814
AUDIENCE: Couldn't you
[INAUDIBLE] multiplication

00:13:51.814 --> 00:13:53.247
by the exponential in time.

00:13:53.247 --> 00:13:55.580
DENNIS FREEMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
by the exponential in time--

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah equal to--

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.040
DENNIS FREEMAN:
--should correspond to--

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.656
AUDIENCE: Which gives you
a frequency [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:59.656 --> 00:14:01.572
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
generally, a multiplication

00:14:01.572 --> 00:14:02.865
in time corresponds to--

00:14:02.865 --> 00:14:03.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.660
DENNIS FREEMAN: --convolution.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.410
So equivalently, instead of
saying it shifted in frequency,

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.610
you could say--

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.020
DENNIS FREEMAN:
--it got convolved--

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.496
AUDIENCE: With delta.

00:14:16.496 --> 00:14:19.320
DENNIS FREEMAN: --with
the delta function.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.410
So a different way of
saying the same thing

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.570
would be that you
think about convolving

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:29.400
with the delta
function in frequency--

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.670
same thing.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.440
Now, we don't actually do this.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.023
When we're doing the
cell phone thing,

00:14:36.023 --> 00:14:39.240
we don't actually multiply
it by e to the j omega c t.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:39.920
Anyone know why?

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.960
This is kind of the simplest
way that you could imagine.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.830
I've taken frequency
content centered near 0

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.330
and turning it into frequency
content centered near omega c.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.984
But that's not
what we really do.

00:14:51.984 --> 00:14:53.150
Why don't we really do that?

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.102
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:57.120
DENNIS FREEMAN: Exactly.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.130
We don't really do it, because
the signals aren't real.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.640
So how do you know the
signal is not real?

00:15:11.005 --> 00:15:15.855
AUDIENCE: Because
magnitudes [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:15.855 --> 00:15:18.600
DENNIS FREEMAN: If the
signal had been real,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.225
the Fourier transform
would have been--

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.750
If the signal had
been real the Fourier

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.370
transform would have been--

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.460
X of j omega.

00:15:34.407 --> 00:15:36.490
If the signal had been
real, the Fourier transform

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.300
would have been--

00:15:40.228 --> 00:15:41.692
AUDIENCE: Symmetry.

00:15:41.692 --> 00:15:43.710
DENNIS FREEMAN: --some
kind of symmetry.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.561
How do I see symmetry
in that expression?

00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:46.394
AUDIENCE: Conjugate.

00:15:46.394 --> 00:15:46.791
AUDIENCE: Conjugate.

00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:48.320
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Conjugate symmetry.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.675
How do I see conjugate
symmetry in that expression?

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:01.100
Well, this is cos omega
t plus j sine omega t.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.810
So if this is a real signal,
then it gives rise to something

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.640
here that is symmetric.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.570
The cosine terms are all
symmetric about the origin.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.120
And it has an
imaginary part that

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.397
is antisymmetric
about the origin,

00:16:23.397 --> 00:16:25.230
because you add together
a bunch of cosines.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.510
You can't get anything that's
anything other than symmetric

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.260
about the origin.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.490
You add together
a bunch of sines.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.448
You can't get anything
except something that is

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:34.530
antisymmetric about the origin.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.510
So you know this
thing has to be--

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:42.624
so a real signal would have
had conjugate symmetry.

00:16:42.624 --> 00:16:44.290
The real part would
have been symmetric.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.810
The imaginary part
would be antisymmetric.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:50.946
And you can see that this
is not conjugate symmetric.

00:16:50.946 --> 00:16:52.571
Everybody knows what
I'm talking about?

00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:55.264
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:56.680
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Conjugate symmetry

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.680
would mean that the
real part of the signal

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.700
is symmetric about the origin,
which means that if this

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.069
is supposed to
represent a real signal,

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.490
then there should have been a
reflection over here to make

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.754
it symmetric about the origin.

00:17:12.754 --> 00:17:16.682
AUDIENCE: Just was
it symmetric before?

00:17:16.682 --> 00:17:19.010
DENNIS FREEMAN:
It was symmetric,

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.930
but I shifted it by
a complex number.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:27.290
I shifted it by cos omega
c t plus j sine omega c t.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:33.018
So by that multiplication, I
generated a complex number.

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:35.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:41.340
DENNIS FREEMAN: So this signal
was complex valued and not

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.836
conjugate symmetric.

00:17:43.836 --> 00:17:45.210
So the point is
trying to get you

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.130
to remember the kinds of things
that we're supposed to know

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.450
about Fourier transforms.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:54.240
So by shifting with a
complex exponential,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.800
we wreck the realness
of the original signal.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.900
The real original signal would
have been conjugate symmetric

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.880
in frequency.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.760
But the wrecking of it
gave rise to a signal

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.692
that was no longer conjugate
symmetric in frequency.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:16.490
So we don't really
modulate this way.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.470
But we do the obvious extension.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.720
What we would do is
modulate with a cosine wave.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.570
So now, if instead
of multiplying

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.117
by a complex exponential, I
multiply by the cosine omega c

00:18:30.117 --> 00:18:32.990
t, by Euler's expression,
I can think about that

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.100
as being the sum
of two components--

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.520
one at plus omega c and
one at minus omega c.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.950
And now, when I do
the convolution,

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:47.180
I get a signal that is
conjugate symmetric.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.270
So when I convolve
this with this one,

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.530
this one gives me a
copy of this here.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.230
And when I convolve
this with this one,

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.060
this one gives me a copy
of this one down here.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.710
So now, the resulting signal,
which I know by construction--

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:05.310
if this was real and this
was real, then that's real--

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.426
I know by construction that
this signal must have been real.

00:19:08.426 --> 00:19:10.050
But I can also see
it in the transform,

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.466
because I can see
now that there's

00:19:11.466 --> 00:19:13.200
a symmetry that is
consistent with it

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.100
being conjugate symmetric.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:15.600
Yes.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.599
Somebody had a question?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.579
So that's what we
mean by modulation.

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:24.370
This is modulation.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.610
Modulation just is a fancy
word that means multiply.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.300
So what we're going to
do is multiply the signal

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.860
by a carrier.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.490
The carrier is going to
be a signal that carries

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.530
the message through the medium.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.800
The carrier is chosen
so that it goes

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.500
efficiently through the medium.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.310
And then the carrier carries
the message through the medium.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.190
So we think about
this as modulation.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.010
And we want to be familiar
with going back and forth

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.760
between time and frequency.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.020
You can also think about the
result of modulation in time.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.060
So if this were
my message, which

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.570
is intended to be represented
as a low frequency,

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.430
and this is my carrier,
which is intended

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.280
to be represented as a
higher frequency, then

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.550
when I modulate it, I
get a modulated signal,

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.000
by which I mean--

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.390
this is called
amplitude modulation--

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:20.170
the amplitude of the carrier
is modulated by the message.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.370
That's all we mean.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:26.350
So you can see that this
transformation, which

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.987
has the property of
moving the information

00:20:28.987 --> 00:20:30.820
from a low frequency
that's hard to transmit

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.850
to a high frequency that
is easy to transmit,

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:40.240
that has the effect of doing
a very particular pattern

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.760
to the time-domain waveform.

00:20:45.091 --> 00:20:47.340
Now, it would be completely
useless as a communication

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.660
scheme if it weren't
easy to invert.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.540
So imagine that I
have this signal.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.950
And what I'd like
to do is recover x.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:03.840
What should I do to recover
x, the original message?

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.180
So the idea is, I have
an original message

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.770
available in my cell phone.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.690
It gets modulated so
that it can be launched

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.070
into electromagnetic waves.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.670
The electromagnetic waves go to
a receiver thousands of miles

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.600
away.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.420
And now, the idea is to
reconstruct my original signal

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.320
x.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.880
What would I do--

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.705
what kind of a system would
I use to recover x from y?

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:32.677
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:32.677 --> 00:21:33.760
DENNIS FREEMAN: I'm sorry.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.191
AUDIENCE: Couldn't you
divide out the cosine?

00:21:35.191 --> 00:21:37.470
DENNIS FREEMAN: You could
divide out the cosine.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:45.330
So you could take x of t cosine
omega c t times something--

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.600
what do I want to
say-- a of t designed

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.310
so that this times this is 1.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.270
That's kind of ugly.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.320
Anybody see anything
ugly about that?

00:21:59.320 --> 00:21:59.820
Yeah.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.952
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] shift
it back the other way?

00:22:01.952 --> 00:22:04.410
DENNIS FREEMAN: You could also
shift it back the other way.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:04.951
That's right.

00:22:04.951 --> 00:22:07.027
So before we do that,
why is this ugly?

00:22:07.027 --> 00:22:08.490
AUDIENCE: The zeros.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.770
DENNIS FREEMAN: The zeros.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:15.780
So if we wanted to take a signal
that looks like a cosine wave

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:20.970
and multiply it by some
signal that generates 1,

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.709
that's not too hard to do here.

00:22:22.709 --> 00:22:24.500
You would do that with
something like this.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.250
But it becomes very
hard to do here.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:31.320
So you would end up making some
signal that does some awful--

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.390
So it would
periodically be a mass.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.180
But you can do what you said.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.390
An alternative would
be to multiply it

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:45.530
by another cosine, which
in the frequency domain

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.760
is easy to think about.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.670
It would just shift it back--

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.460
so convolve with
a pair of impulses

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:56.690
to move something that was at
DC out to some high frequency,

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.180
convolve again to take the
thing that was at high frequency

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.340
and bring it back to DC.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.540
And you can think about that
in either frequency or time.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.040
It's easy to think
about it in time.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.748
If you think about it
in time, here we've

00:23:08.748 --> 00:23:10.850
got the product of two cosines.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.890
But the product of two
cosines is just 1/2

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.640
plus half the cosine of double.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.500
Well, that's good.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.230
Why is that good?

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:23.180
Well, if you multiply
x of t by this,

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.010
this is a super high frequency.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:30.390
If omega c was a high frequency,
2 omega c is even higher.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:36.410
So what you could do is remove
x times 1/2 cos 2 omega c t

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:39.890
with a low pass
filter, since omega c

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.630
is such a high frequency.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.480
And that would just leave you
with half the message, which

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.720
would be easy then
to reconstruct,

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.420
because what you would do is
just put it through a low pass

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.310
filter and then multiply by 2.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.920
You can similarly think about
the same thing in frequency.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.460
If I took y and convolved
it-- if I multiply

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.020
in time by another cosine
wave, that second cosine wave

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.960
is a pair of impulses--
one at minus omega

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.100
c and one at omega c.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.200
And now, when I
convolve the y signal,

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.870
this one shifts these
two up, and this one

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.760
shifts these two down.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.620
And two of them land
on top of each other.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:26.770
But each of these was
only of height 1/2.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:32.810
So by Euler's expression,
cosine of something was 1/2 e

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.720
to the whatever plus
1/2 e to the whatever.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.320
So I got 1/2's on each
of those amplitudes.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.820
So the result is then that
I have to multiply the low

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.430
frequency part by a factor
of two to undo the 1/2's.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.640
So this kind of a scheme
is especially nice,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.510
because you can scramble
together multiple messages

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:02.820
and still get them separated
at the destination.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:09.500
If you imagine having three
similar transmitters that

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.250
use their own omega c--

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.080
so the first one uses
omega 1, omega 2, omega 3--

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.530
so if each one of
the transmitters

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:23.730
had their own frequency, and if
the frequencies were far enough

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.000
apart, and if the frequencies
were all big compared

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.470
to the message frequency, then
you could combine them all

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:35.440
and select out the
one of interest

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:42.290
by tuning the receiver, by
choosing the demodulation

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.020
frequency.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.190
So now, if the receiver
chose omega c equals omega 1,

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.000
you would decode message 1.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.110
If omega c were omega 2,
you'd decode message 2.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:59.430
And that's because the medium
works approximately linearly.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.940
So if you launch multiple
waves into the air--

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.890
I don't want to get too much
into electromagnetic theory--

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.620
so the presence of the antennas
distort it from linearity.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.434
But once the antennas
are all there,

00:26:12.434 --> 00:26:13.850
then it's perfectly
linear system.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:21.180
And the thing that gets into
the air as a result of a sum

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.850
is the sum of the
individual parts.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.540
So the idea then is
illustrated here.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:31.080
If I had three different
messages represented

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:36.810
by different style houses, and
each one of the messages was

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.170
at a different frequency--
omega 1, omega 2, omega 3--

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.770
by tuning the omega
c of the receiver,

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.930
if I put omega c at omega 1,
the convolution of this one

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.810
would suck this one up to here.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.910
And by this one would
lower that one down there.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:59.130
You get overlap of the
lowest frequency pair.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.810
And so if you built
a low pass filter

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:06.450
of exactly the right width,
you would decode message 1.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:11.800
Where, if you just changed the
frequency of the demodulator--

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.760
if you make the demodulation
frequency now be omega 2--

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.360
now, the effect of shifting
that different amount

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.260
means that the low pass filter
recovers message 2, rather

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.530
the message 1.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.760
So that's the idea.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.250
So that's the idea that we
use in commercial AM radio.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:37.060
And that was, in fact,
a revolutionary idea

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.910
that enabled people to think
about for the first time

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.460
a communication system
that did a lot of things

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.220
that were very different from
previous communication systems.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.000
In particular, it went
at the speed of light.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.970
Even more importantly,
or at least as important,

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:56.040
is the fact that it
was a broadcast system.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.040
So broadcast was
an idea that was

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.920
championed by David Sarnoff.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.170
Sarnoff was a visionary.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:10.670
He was the person who was
very excited about the idea

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:14.420
of broadcast, which is a
little ironic, because he

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.900
got his start with Marconi.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.370
Anybody ever hear of Marconi?

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.760
Good, good, you're supposed
to have heard of Marconi.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.860
So Sarnoff got his start--

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.930
this is Sarnoff;
this is Marconi--

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.550
Sarnoff got his
start with Marconi.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:33.170
Marconi made his mint
with wireless telegraphy.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.870
Anybody ever hear of telegraphy?

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.820
Of course not.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.480
So telegraphy, that's telegraph.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.440
Shake your heads yes.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.930
It's ancient, I realize.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:49.220
So Marconi made his fortune
with wireless telegraphy.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:54.770
Telegraphy was what we
call point to point.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.590
The idea in telegraphy
was precisely the same

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.450
as the idea of the
US post office,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.070
except it was at
the speed of light,

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.140
or not quite the speed of light.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:10.330
So the idea in the post office
is you take a sheet of paper

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:13.540
and do something to it that
makes it magically appear

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.580
at somebody else's place.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:20.401
So point A communicated
to point B.

00:29:20.401 --> 00:29:21.970
Telegraphy was
precisely the same.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.150
You take your sheet of paper
to the telegraph office.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.940
And somebody who's very
skilled with their hands,

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.510
or specifically
with their finger,

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.810
would do something that
caused that piece of paper

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:39.510
to be regenerated
hundreds of miles away.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.110
Then that piece of
paper got delivered.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:46.010
So message went from
point A to point B.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.800
So telegraphy came
long before Marconi.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.830
And it was a revolution in
how you do communications.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.260
But it was point to
point-- one person

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.760
sent one message to one person.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.090
Sarnoff got his start
in newspaper business.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:09.040
He was a Russian immigrant,
impoverished, and had

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.450
a newspaper route as a kid.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.430
And he was ambitious.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.440
Newspapers are broadcast.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.370
The idea in point to point and
broadcast are very different.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:20.990
In broadcast, you're
allowed to spend

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.360
a fortune on the transmitter--

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.710
the printing press--
but not on the thing

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:28.780
that the individuals get.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.450
The individuals get newsprint.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.730
So the paper and ink
have to be cheap.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.580
The printing press doesn't.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.840
So that was
Sarnoff's background.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.040
So he was interested as a kid
in broadcast, in newspaper.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:50.000
But then he got his reputation
working for Marconi in wireless

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.110
telegraphy.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:54.830
Marconi, the inventor of radio,
thought of a way of doing

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:58.780
point-to-point telegraphy
wirelessly via radio--

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.180
radio telegraphy.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:08.170
And he sold it to ships.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.980
And Sarnoff made his
reputation, because he

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.640
was the guy operating
the radio telegraphy

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:21.990
system at that Marconi
company when the Titanic sank.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.540
Everybody know about
the Titanic, right?

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.440
Big ship sank.

00:31:33.255 --> 00:31:38.040
So Sarnoff was known as an
amazing telegraphy operator.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.570
And he stayed at the station
for 72 consecutive hours getting

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.760
emergency messages
from the Titanic,

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.340
telling everybody
everything that he could,

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.040
trying to tell them the
situation, whose family was

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.380
in good shape, whose family
was not in good shape.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.170
It had an enormous impact--

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:58.050
big enough that
Congress made a law

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:01.230
saying that every ship had
to have wireless telegraphy.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:04.500
Now, that made Marconi
extremely rich.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.410
And it indirectly made
Sarnoff extremely rich too.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:13.020
Sarnoff then got very
interested in extending

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.330
the idea of radio,
which then was

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:19.000
point to point to broadcast.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.420
So the idea was to somehow--

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.690
he called it a radio music box.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:28.020
Somehow, it was supposed
to be like a newspaper

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.730
but at the speed of light.

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:37.680
So the idea was to somehow
make mass consumption of radio.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:43.560
At the time, radio was
per ship, point to point.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.460
So you have the land-based
station talking to ship A,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.990
or the land-based
station talking

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.480
to ship B, or ship
A talking to ship B,

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.100
but it was all point to point.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:57.000
Sarnoff's idea was, let's
make a newspaper out of this.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.790
The key to doing that was
making a cheap receiver.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:04.170
It's like newsprint.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.720
The printer can cost a mint.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:12.600
The transmitter for
radio broadcast music

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.299
is allowed to cost a
mint, but the receivers

00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:16.590
are not allowed to cost a mint.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.600
That's like the newsprint.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.990
So the trick was to make
an inexpensive receiver.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:25.500
The problem with making an
expensive receiver is that

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.670
the scheme that we
just talked about,

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:38.720
where you decode the signal by
multiplying by cos omega c t--

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.910
omega c chosen to be the
frequency that you want

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:42.919
to listen to--

00:33:42.919 --> 00:33:44.460
the problem with
that-- that's called

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.640
synchronous demodulation--
the problem with that

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.880
is that you've got to
be exactly synchronized.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.560
If you want to listen to
the message at omega 2,

00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:01.050
omega c must equal omega
2, not omega 2 plus 3.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:04.560
So if you want to listen
to a particular frequency,

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.340
to a particular message, you
had to have the frequency chosen

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.830
to match the carrier
of the message you

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.110
wanted to listen to.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.239
Today, that's not so hard.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.130
The way we would make
frequencies today

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.810
is with crystal.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:23.190
Crystals are great because
the frequencies are determined

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:25.920
by the distances in
crystal lattices, which

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.179
are determined by nanomechanical
processes very precisely.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.520
And in fact, we can make
crystals with no problem

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.760
with frequency resolutions
of 10 to the minus seventh,

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.230
even 10 to the minus eighth.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:42.060
So the errors are very small
compared to the frequencies

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.920
that we're trying to generate.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.010
Even that wouldn't
be good enough.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:51.960
So back then-- so Sarnoff was
working back in the 1800s--

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.850
back then, they
couldn't possibly do 10

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.147
to the minus eighth precision.

00:34:55.147 --> 00:34:56.730
They were doing
something more like 10

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.980
to the minus second precision.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.260
They didn't have a
technology based on crystals.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.890
So it would have been
impossible to match

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:10.132
even to within a factor
of 10 to the minus third.

00:35:10.132 --> 00:35:11.590
But even if they
could have matched

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.590
to within 10 to the minus
eighth, which we could

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:17.310
today, even that wouldn't
work, because not only does

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:21.620
the frequency have to match,
the phase has to match.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.680
So if you're multiplying
by cos omega c t

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.660
and you want omega
c to be omega 2,

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.420
it better actually be
the cosine of omega 2

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.610
and not the sine of omega 2.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.310
Sine and cos differ by a phase.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:40.040
So the question is, what's the
effect of phase when you're

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.540
trying to demodulate a signal?

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.610
So look at your neighbor.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.740
What would happen if
you tried to demodulate

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.870
by precisely the right frequency
but you were slipped by phase?

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.763
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.410
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
what would happen

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:20.340
if there is a shift
between this carrier that

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.600
was modulating the signal
and the carrier that

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.960
is demodulating the signal?

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.460
What would happen
if there's a phase

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.730
shift of phi between those two?

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:32.340
What's the effect
of phi not being 0?

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.440
Ideally, phi would be 0.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.445
Ideally, phi would be 0.

00:37:35.445 --> 00:37:36.945
What would happen
if phi were not 0?

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.654
You did all that talking,
and you don't have--

00:37:46.654 --> 00:37:47.154
Yes.

00:37:47.154 --> 00:37:52.130
AUDIENCE: So the low pass
filter of the two will not work.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.630
It would be--

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.294
It will be lots more
than what you want it

00:37:56.294 --> 00:37:58.084
to be, like 1/2 the original.

00:37:58.084 --> 00:37:59.750
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
that's exactly right.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.500
So the effect of phi--

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.120
if you think about--

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.040
so now, you have cosine of some
omega c t and cos omega c t

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.000
plus phi.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.080
So you have cos A cos
B. so that gives you

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.577
the cos of the difference
and the cos of the sum.

00:38:16.577 --> 00:38:18.160
The cos of the
difference was supposed

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.750
to be-- the difference
was supposed to be 0.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:21.070
The cos of the
difference would be

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.486
the cos of zero,
which would be 1,

00:38:22.486 --> 00:38:25.010
and that's where
the 1/2 came from.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:29.170
But now, the difference
isn't 0 anymore.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:32.440
So instead of
getting 1/2 cos of 0,

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.930
we get 1/2 cos of
phi, which means

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:40.270
that if phi is a constant, you
just get the wrong amplitude.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:47.110
But if phi is a slowly varying
signal, which it would be,

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.882
even if you had a frequency
reliability of one part in 10

00:38:50.882 --> 00:38:53.074
to the minus seventh--

00:38:53.074 --> 00:38:55.240
one way of thinking about
that would be that there's

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.010
a slowly varying phase--

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.720
the effect of the
slowly varying phase

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.340
would be to make the
amplitude vary with time.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.630
So we call that fading.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.600
And it would be a
very distracting thing

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.720
to have happen.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.710
So this kind of a
technology would even

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:15.190
be difficult today, when we can
match frequencies very well.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.310
It was completely out of the
question back in the 1800s,

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.800
when they couldn't match
frequencies that well.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.640
So the trick was to not
only send the message

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.140
but also send the carrier.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:34.020
So ideally, when we first
talked about modulation,

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.454
there is no C path.

00:39:35.454 --> 00:39:36.870
All you do is you
take the signal,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.244
and you modulate
it by a carrier,

00:39:38.244 --> 00:39:39.840
and you send that
out on the antenna.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:46.320
Now, instead, add on a
little bit of the carrier.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.010
That way what's in the air is
the carrier and the message.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.160
So now when you
receive it, somehow

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.440
if you can receive
the carrier, you

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.720
can use the carrier to tell
you information about not

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.260
only the frequency but also
the phase of the carrier.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.760
And you can use that then
to demodulate the message.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.980
That's the idea.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:10.200
Notice that adding in a
little bit C of the carrier

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:16.560
is precisely the same as adding
a constant to the message

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.119
before you modulate--
mathematically identical.

00:40:20.119 --> 00:40:22.410
And that gives an easy way
of thinking about the effect

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.810
of this carrier.

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:27.030
If you think about
the message added to C

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:35.650
and if C is big enough, you can
make the message positive only.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:39.030
You remember in the
previous illustration,

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.730
every time the message went
through 0, which might happen

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:47.910
here, the modulating
message went through 0 also,

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:51.240
which means that sign
changes were affected

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.190
by a 180-degree phase
shifts of the carrier, which

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.950
was kind of a subtle thing.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:58.170
So now, the message
appears entirely

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:03.000
as the positive
envelope of the carrier.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.280
Well, that's nice, because
that makes it very easy

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:11.080
to decode in a way that
has no dependence whatever

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.310
on the carrier frequency.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.390
If the carrier frequency
is big enough--

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.300
if the frequency of the
carrier is sufficiently larger

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.490
than the maximum
frequency of the message,

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:26.380
there's a trivial way to decode
such a system with a nonlinear

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.830
circuit of this type.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:30.630
What's intended here is that
you take the message that's

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:36.190
received from the antenna,
reconstruct y, which

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:40.210
is intended to be the
output message, such

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:43.360
that if z, the signal
on the antenna,

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:49.730
exceeds the current value of
the message, the diode comes on.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:53.200
And that makes the blue
line, the decoded signal,

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.420
rapidly go back up
to the red line--

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.030
the thing that's
coming off the antenna.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:01.930
But if the antenna signal
shrinks below the blue line,

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:05.250
let the blue line
discharge, because there

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:09.930
is an RC decay constant.

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:13.190
So there's a fast attack
through the diode,

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:16.730
so that the blue quickly goes
to the peak value of the red

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:20.180
and slowly decays back toward 0.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.840
The result is that if the
difference in frequency

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.980
between the carrier frequency
and the message frequencies

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.470
is sufficiently large,
you can effectively

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:34.044
separate the blue from the red
with a very simple circuit.

00:42:34.044 --> 00:42:35.335
And that's the way they do it--

00:42:35.335 --> 00:42:39.320
or that's the way they
did it in the early 1900s.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.310
But there's still a
problem with that.

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:43.760
The problem is
that the messages--

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.420
audio of the type that
I'm speaking, speech--

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:52.810
is characterized by an
enormous peak-to-average ratio.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:56.290
The strongest pressures
that are generated by speech

00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:00.030
are enormously more powerful
than the average pressure

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:01.360
that's generated in speech.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.150
You can see that in this
diagram by these peaks.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.430
There are several things
that generate peaks.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:12.550
Peaks are generated at about 60
or 70 hertz by my vocal chords.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:16.480
But they're also generated
by my lips in plosives.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.810
When I do plosive,
there's a sudden jump

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.770
in the instantaneous frequency
that's not there on average.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.590
And for normal
speech, that ratio

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:29.291
can be as high as 35 to 1.

00:43:29.291 --> 00:43:31.470
35 to 1, not a big deal.

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:34.740
The problem is that power goes
like the square of voltage.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.760
So 35 to 1 becomes 1,000 to 1.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:43.390
It takes 1,000 times more
energy to code the peaks

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.580
than it does to
code the average.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.280
And the problem with that is
that in this coding scheme

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.550
that we talked about,
you have to add

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:55.720
a constant that is big enough
so that the signal never

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.680
goes negative.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.090
So the constant that you
add has to go in proportion

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:04.460
to the peak value.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:10.300
So you end up transmitting
almost all of your power

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.010
By the ratio of
1,000 to 1, that's

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.780
the amount of power
that gets used

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.720
to transmit the carrier
compared to the message.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:21.280
Well, that's a terrible scheme,
if what we were trying to do

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.230
is point to point.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:26.320
Imagine your cell
phone, if you had

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:32.080
to transmit enough power to, in
the worst case, do the peaks,

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.180
you would on average
be transmitting power

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.840
at 1,000 times the rate that
you would necessarily have to.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.210
So that's OK for broadcast.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:43.900
So for example, WBZ
broadcast radio,

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.520
WBZ uses a 50-kilowatt
transmitter.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.690
50 kilowatts is
the amount of power

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:53.830
that would otherwise be
sufficient to generate

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:57.950
500 100-watt light bulbs.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:59.200
That's a fair amount of power.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.980
Imagine the heat that comes
off 500 100-watt light bulbs.

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.470
That's how much power
is being radiated

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:09.460
by the antenna for WBZ.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.780
That power is not necessary to
transmit the average message.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:18.370
It's necessary to
transmit the peak message.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.350
You can imagine how
long your cell phone

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:26.210
battery would last if you were
transmitting 50 kilowatts.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:27.820
That doesn't work.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.660
So that's how the
broadcast radio

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.850
takes advantage of broadcast.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:37.030
It makes no sense to
use this coding scheme

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.310
for a point-to-point system.

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:41.740
It's fine if what
you're trying to do

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.470
is have one
transmitter, WBZ, that

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:46.540
services a million listeners.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.560
That's fine.

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.490
The problem with this
scheme for decoding

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:55.000
is it still doesn't
separate different channels.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.290
And the way to fix that was
developed by Edwin Armstrong.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.420
So Sarnoff who was
kind of the visionary.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.150
He had the idea for
broadcast radio.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:08.980
He's the entrepreneurial type,
who thought of how to do this.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.090
Armstrong was the
technical genius.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.600
He knew how to do it.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.290
So Armstrong's idea here,
which we call superheterodyne,

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:21.230
was let's make the signal
look like it always

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:25.830
comes from omega i regardless
of what channel it comes from.

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:28.210
So omega i, the
intermediate frequency,

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:32.260
will always take whatever
frequency you're interested in

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:36.250
and turn it into omega
i and will do that

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.805
by just modulating.

00:46:38.805 --> 00:46:41.250
And the cleverness
had to do with a lot

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.720
of technical details.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.440
He worked out a scheme where
this modulation was very easy.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.460
The cutoff-- the sidebands
on the bandpass filters

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.680
didn't have to be
very steep, which

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.680
made them easy to implement.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.370
The sharp band pass filters
were all at that one

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.170
intermediate frequency.

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:05.510
So he had to generate one
very sharp band pass filter,

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:10.680
but that same sharp bandpass
filter could then be used

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.540
for all the different channels.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:18.300
So the idea then was use
a coarse tunable filter

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:22.320
to map the frequency
of interest to omega i,

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.500
put that through a very
sharp filter, of which there

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:29.280
is exactly one in each
receiver, and then use

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:43.530
this decoding scheme to
demodulate the carrier, wi.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:45.210
That's how they did it.

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.600
We would never do it that way.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.520
That's part of the
theme of the course.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.380
We are interested
in schemes that

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.900
let us map continuous
time to discrete time,

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.000
that sort of thing.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.400
So one way we might do it is
implement a radio digitally.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.030
So the idea would be, what
if you took the antenna,

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:11.190
put it through a sampler,
turned the radio signal,

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:13.590
which contains a gazillion
number of bands--

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.610
for commercial radio, there's
100 channels in the frequency

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:23.250
band 500 to 600 kilohertz--

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:26.340
but just take the whole
signal off of the antenna,

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.680
turn it into a bunch
of bits, run that

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.890
through some digital
logic that does,

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:36.300
by magic, picks out the one
that you're interested in,

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.430
generates a new
stream of bits, yd,

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:41.530
from which you can do
bandlimited reconstruction.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.187
So this is the
last two lectures--

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:45.520
do you do this, how you do this.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.680
Now, all we do is we put a
particular algorithm in there.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.140
And we've got a radio.

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:50.860
That's the idea.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.250
So the key to being
able to do that

00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:01.300
is whether or not you
can build that sampler.

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:06.940
So what would be the required
sampling time in order

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:10.000
to make a digital radio?

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.300
And since I'm
running out of time,

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.130
I'll just tell you that the
important thing it's sampling--

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:22.900
it's what we did last time--
the answer is you need T,

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.100
so that the sampling
frequency is at least twice

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.860
the maximum frequency
of the thing

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.160
that you're trying to code.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:39.800
So the biggest frequency
here is 1,600 kilohertz.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.830
You need to sample that with
omega sampling more than twice

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:46.720
that frequency--

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.920
so bigger than 2
pi 1,600 kilohertz.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.490
And if you work that out,
that leaves sampling time

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:56.350
of about 1/3 of a microsecond.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:50:00.040
And the point is that that's
easy to do these days.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:04.860
That's the kind of part that
you get from DigiKey for $2.

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.390
So that's easy.

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:09.190
So the only thing
that you need to do

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:12.940
is worry about, well, then
how much computation is there?

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.769
And that also turns
out to be easy.

00:50:15.769 --> 00:50:18.310
The principal thing you need to
do is make a bandpass filter.

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:25.210
The question is, how would
you make a bandpass filter?

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.330
And here are three
possible systems

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:30.850
for making a bandpass filter.

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:37.450
Should I take my digitized
antenna signal modulate

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:43.320
low pass modulate, or modulate
low pass modulate, modulate

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:47.270
low pass modulate, cosine,
sine, cosine, sine,

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:52.700
or put it through a filter
that looks just like that unit

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.650
sample response,
except that it's

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.630
multiplied by cos omega c t n?

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:03.050
Some number of those work.

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:08.324
And I'll leave it for you to
figure out which of those work.

00:51:08.324 --> 00:51:08.990
Good to see you.

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:11.140
Have a good day.
