DENNIS FREEMAN: With that, what
I want to do is think about--

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.370
finish up thinking
about modulation.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.620
Last time we thought
about modulation

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.410
in a communications context.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.840
That's a very important context.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.310
It's a way of thinking about how
we can use modulation to better

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.000
match a signal to the medium.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.370
So we saw in
particular that if we

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.880
were trying to
transmit human voice

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.540
via electromagnetic
waves, trying to simply

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.770
launch an electrical
representation of the voice

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.957
into electromagnetic waves,
just doesn't work very well.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:00.290
And that's because of the
enormous frequency difference.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.164
We would rather have
frequencies on the order

00:01:02.164 --> 00:01:07.130
of 2 gigahertz for
efficient transmission

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.500
through the atmosphere and
human voices just are not

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.840
centered on 2 gigahertz.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.930
We can use modulation
to bridge that gap.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.770
Having done that, we get a
number of other advantages too.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.770
So for example, we
talked last time

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.790
about the idea of
broadcast radio, which

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.970
was an enormous revolution.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.730
The idea of being able
to instantly communicate

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.020
lots of stuff like a
newspaper, but instantaneously,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.040
not with a day or a week
delay, was an enormous deal.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.620
Today what I want
to think about--

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.730
I mean the way we motivated
last time-- the way

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.729
to do the modulation that
we motivated last time

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.530
was the idea of
amplitude modulation.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.980
Amplitude modulation is a
terribly non-linear process.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.750
We multiply two signals.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.620
That's pretty non-linear.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.350
And you could
imagine that if we're

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.460
willing to open up
that can of worms

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.650
so that we're willing to
do a transformation that

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.340
is non-linear, there's
enormous numbers of them.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.010
So you don't have to just
do amplitude modulation.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.420
You could also do--

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.890
here are three
classics-- you can

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.080
do phase modulation and
frequency modulation as well.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080
All of those systems work.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.970
Phase modulation, the idea is--

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.640
Well, first off,
amplitude modulation.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.590
The idea was you modulate
so-- this is the carrier.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.140
cos omega ct is the carrier.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.470
That's the thing that goes
through the medium well.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.860
Now we want to somehow embed
the message on the carrier.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.030
In AM, we did that
by multiplying.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.600
We take the signal x of
t and we multiply it.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.410
We take the signal
of interest, x of t,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.100
and we multiply it by the
carrier and transmit that.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.610
And we saw that, for reasons
of decoding simplicity,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.060
it was convenient to add
a constant term, which

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.510
was essentially sending, not
only the modulated carrier,

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.380
but also the carrier alone,
so that you could locally

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.970
retrieve both the modulated
message and the carrier.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.480
It simplified the modulation.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.500
But a different
kind of alternative

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.190
is, convey the
message in the phase.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.690
Right?

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.870
We all love phase, right?

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.860
Nod your head yes.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.960
We all love phase.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.710
So what we could do
instead is take the carrier

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.400
and add a phase term in
proportion to the message.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.370
That's a different way of
coding the message on a carrier.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.130
Another way to do it is
to code the frequency.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.290
So take the message,
integrate it--

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.170
it is kind of a funny
way to talk about FM.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.080
So you could use the
message to modulate

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.940
the frequency of
the carrier, which

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.770
would be very similar
to using the message

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.210
to modulate the phase.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.570
They, in fact, differ
by an integral.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.970
And I'll talk about
that more in a minute.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.730
So the idea then is even though
the first thing they tried--

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.490
the first successful way
of making broadcast radio

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.010
--was via AM, we should
think about the alternatives

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.990
and try to figure out
what are the advantages

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.730
and disadvantages of different
kinds of coding schemes.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.229
And also consistent with
the goals of this course,

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.770
in thinking about
these alternatives,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.269
we're going to get
a lot of practice

00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:29.220
in thinking about
Fourier transforms.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.580
Which is good.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.770
So let's think about what would
be the difference between AM

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.280
modulation, where we convey
the message by modulating

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.190
the amplitude of the
carrier versus FM,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.510
where we convey the
message by modulating

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.365
the instantaneous
frequency of the carrier.

00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:51.490
And if we're just looking
at time domain, which is,

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.864
after all, probably the first
place anybody should look--

00:04:53.864 --> 00:04:57.230
if we just compare those two
schemes in the time domain,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.100
there's some very
big differences.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.060
You can see that when
we amplitude modulate,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.850
the power that is used
to transmit the message

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.730
depends on the message.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.060
So there are places where
there is not much power.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.820
There's not much
energy in this signal.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.100
And there are places
where there's lots.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.350
By contrast, down
here you see something

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.090
that has constant power.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.920
At least if you integrate over--

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.010
say you've got a 2
gigahertz carrier,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.670
then as long as you integrate
over 10 or 20 cycles, which

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.280
is a small fraction
of a second, you're

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.990
going to get the same
answer, regardless

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.860
of where in the message
you do the integral.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.110
So there is obviously
a power difference.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.460
There's no need to transmit
the carrier in order

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.040
to decode the FM signal,
unless of course you're

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.010
interested in understanding
exactly where DC is.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.570
The interesting
thing about audio

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.900
is that we're very
insensitive to DC.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.140
So that's not really very
important for conveying

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.720
speech sounds.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.510
But the original
motivation for thinking

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.830
about alternative ways of
coding was in fact bandwidth.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.190
So the idea was there's
a limited resource.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.440
Bandwidth is a limited resource.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.850
If person A is using 1 megahertz
plus or minus 5 kilohertz,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.680
which is one of the
broadcast AM frequency bands,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.435
then person B can't
use that band.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.040
You can have only
one transmitter

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.620
for each of the radio bands.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.190
That makes bandwidth-- radio
bandwidth --a resource.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.160
Now there's lots of it.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.880
There's lots of frequencies
between a megahertz and 2

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.650
gigahertz.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.640
On the other hand, there's
lots of people who want it.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.287
So your local fire
department thinks

00:06:57.287 --> 00:06:59.120
they ought to be able
to talk to each other.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.579
Your local police
department thinks

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:02.411
they ought to be able
to talk to each other.

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:03.887
Your local ambulance
service thinks

00:07:03.887 --> 00:07:05.720
they ought to be able
to talk to each other.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.060
So there's lots of people
with demands for it.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.100
So the idea of--

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.640
the original pursuit
of FM was to try

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.390
to think about a scheme that
would use less bandwidth.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.990
If you're thinking about speech,
you need about 3 kilohertz.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.220
3 kilohertz is considered
telephone quality speech.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.530
It's not perfect,
but it's good enough

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.850
to get very good speech
intelligibility across it.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.120
So I AM used plus or minus
5 kilohertz bandwidth.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.190
They allocated a band of 10
kilohertz for every station.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:46.530
The initial idea in FM to--
so take this expression for FM

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.240
and think about an
instantaneous frequency omega

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.770
i, which is a frequency with
a slightly different value

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.210
from the carrier frequency.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.180
It's different because
we're doing FM.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.570
And you can calculate the
instantaneous frequency

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.550
as the derivative of phase.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.180
So the derivative of phase gives
you an omega c term out front.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.577
Omega ct is the carrier phase.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.160
And then there's the
part of the phase

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.960
that comes from the message.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.540
So the total
instantaneous frequency

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.120
is omega c plus the time
derivative of phase.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.570
And since we're
modulating frequency--

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.520
since we're modulating with
the frequency, that turns out

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.920
to be proportional to x.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.990
So the instantaneous
frequency, like you

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.659
would like for frequency
modulation-- the instantaneous

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:40.580
frequency --is a linear
function of the message x.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.490
But it's proportional.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:49.130
So the reasoning
was make k small.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.610
If the instantaneous deviations
of frequency are small,

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.830
say 10 to the minus 6th hertz--

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.150
really small.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.660
Well, if you could have
10 to the minus 6th hertz,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:08.670
you could pack 10 to the
6th stations in a hertz.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.050
Well that's pretty good.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.810
So instead of using 10
kilohertz to send one message,

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.910
you could get 10
to the 6th messages

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.690
in one hertz of bandwidth.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.180
That was the
original motivation.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:24.300
That was an idea that was
propagated at Bell Labs, who

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.120
were one of the commercial
entities who were seriously

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.570
interested in trying to make
money on broadcast radio.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:36.450
So the idea was maybe we could
use FM to squeeze more signals

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.430
in the available bandwidth.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:45.210
Well that turns out to
be completely wrong.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.340
And that's why studying
Fourier transforms

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.370
is such a good example of how
you can use Fourier transforms

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.350
to figure things out.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.050
That argument is just
completely wrong,

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.260
as two lines of double-0
3 will show you.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.250
So here is our expression
for the FM signal.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.120
You can see that it's
complicated because it's

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.240
the cosine of a sum.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.220
But we all know
from trigonometry,

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:17.630
the cos of a plus b is cos
a cos b minus sine a sine b.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:23.300
So we can get an exact
expression for this part--

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.660
we can expand this
exactly as the cosine

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:33.830
a times the cosine of b minus
the sine of a times the sign

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.912
of b.

00:10:35.912 --> 00:10:36.620
Well that's easy.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.750
Now what would happen
to that expression

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.490
if we made k very small?

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.090
Well if we make k very small--

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.150
if k goes close
to 0 --the cosine

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.430
gets arbitrarily close to 1.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.060
Fine, that sounds OK.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:59.210
This sine of l times something
does not go-- well the fallacy

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.370
in the reasoning
was that goes to 0.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.120
It does go to 0, but it
actually goes to 0 slowly.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.400
It actually-- the limit
approaches k times--

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.340
so the limit of the sine of
theta, as theta gets small,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:14.940
is theta.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.300
So the idea wasn't quite right.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.610
It doesn't go
arbitrarily close to 0.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.780
It gets arbitrarily
close to the message.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.480
So that means that
this expression, which

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:38.380
looks horrible up here, is
equivalent to this expression,

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.280
which says that the signal
that I'm transmitting

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.320
is the carrier.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:54.310
Just like AM minus sine
omega ct times the message.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.076
But that's just AM.

00:11:56.076 --> 00:11:57.610
I took the message times sine.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.290
Uh, it's sine.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.329
It's not cosine, who cares?

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:02.120
That's a difference of
90 degrees of phase.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.500
Who cares?

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.610
It's AM.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.730
The fallacy in the
reasoning is that this k

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.750
does not-- the sine of
theta, when theta gets small,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.860
does not go to 0.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.970
It goes to theta.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.530
And so the limiting
case for narrowband FM

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:24.460
has precisely the
same bandwidth as AM.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.060
Narrowband FM has the
same bandwidth as AM,

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.920
so therefore, this
whole idea that you

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.810
could use FM to squeeze more
channels into a given bandwidth

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.696
is just completely wrong.

00:12:36.696 --> 00:12:38.070
So it was the
initial motivation.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.380
It's just wrong.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:46.432
In fact, what's good about
FM is the other limit.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.640
Don't worry about narrowband.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.070
Worry about broadband.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.360
The value of FM--

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.040
and this was Armstrong again.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.580
The same guy who did the
superheterodyne receiver, which

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.520
made AM broadcast
radio possible.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.850
Same guy went on
to think about FM

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.670
and he saw that the
value of FM was, in fact,

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.800
to use lots of bandwidth.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.084
Why would you do that?

00:13:09.084 --> 00:13:10.250
Well, we'll see in a minute.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.390
That the reason you want
to use a lot of bandwidth

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:17.070
is that you generate a robust
signal that can be recovered,

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.500
even when noise
gets added to it.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.210
One of the big
problems, especially

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.411
with the early versions
of AM broadcast radio,

00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:26.410
was that it had a lot of
noise in the background

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.620
we called static.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.650
Kind of like tsss, but
a little bit more poppy

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.230
and more irritating.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.620
And Armstrong figured
out that there was a way

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.390
to reduce that static by
using more bandwidth to make

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.750
a more robust signal.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.910
So that's the idea.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.930
And coincidentally, it gives
us an excellent opportunity

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.520
to practice our
skills of figuring out

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.110
Fourier transforms.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.170
So let's figure out the Fourier
transform of an FM signal.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.670
Right?

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.040
That'll be fun.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.260
Remember what the FM
signal looked like?

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.260
We saw back here, it's
kind of horrendous looking.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.020
So the goal for the
next five minutes

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.728
is to take the Fourier
transform of that.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:18.610
So let's think
about phase coding.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.900
Phase and frequency coding
are almost the same thing.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.640
All you do is, in one case you
transmit a phase in proportion

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.850
to x.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.670
That's phase modulation.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.170
In the case of
frequency modulation,

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.000
you transmit a
phase proportionate

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.730
to the integral of x, which
is the same as modulating

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.570
the instantaneous
frequency by x.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.620
So let's think about phase
modulating by sine omega mt.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.765
This is omega carrier
and omega message.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.460
And I'm putting an m out front.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.260
The modulation depth.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.120
Just so that I can
track what happens,

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.470
as I turn up the
amplitude of the signal.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.250
So let's think about, what
does this signal look like?

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.360
So we have cos a plus b.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.470
We expand that as cos a
cos b minus sine a sine b.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:16.210
And let's start by looking
at this first term, which

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.980
is modulated something.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.550
The something is the hard part.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.900
So the something is the
cosine of m sine omega mt.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.680
For the particular case, that
the message is the sine omega

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.580
mt.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.490
So let's think about that.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.460
So we'll start with the message.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.980
Sine omega mt.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.070
And we'll say that the
modulation depth is 1.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.780
Now we have to take
the cosine of that.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.100
So now we take the
cosine of this signal.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:53.270
So this signal is going
0- 1- 0 minus 1- 0.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:58.930
So the cosine of that-- when
the sine is 0, the cosine is 1.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:03.010
Then the sine is going toward 1.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.130
As the sine goes toward 1,
the cosine starts going down.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:06.630
Right?

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.870
The first part of the cosine
waves, cosine t, as you

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.040
increase from 0.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.180
It starts to decay.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.570
Same thing's happening here.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:22.290
But then by the time
the sine gets up to 1,

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.000
the sign starts going down.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.770
So the cosine starts
going back up.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.478
Everybody see what
I'm what I'm implying?

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.960
So this waveform
is a sine waveform.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.750
And this is the cosine
of that waveform.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.130
That's what an FM signal is.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.560
As I increase the
modulation depth,

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:47.340
so make the modulation depth
now 2, now the deviation from 1

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.000
is bigger.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.510
Right?

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:52.020
Before, the deviation
for 1 was caused when

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.920
the sine wave went up to 1.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.530
Now, the biggest
deviation occurs when

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.921
the sine wave gets up to 2.

00:16:56.921 --> 00:16:57.420
It's bigger.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:05.260
And then I may make
it bigger and bigger.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:05.760
OK.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.290
By the time--

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.560
The big difference
between 3 and 4--

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.794
3 and 4.

00:17:12.794 --> 00:17:14.460
Why is a big difference
between 3 and 4?

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.400
It's because there's a
number between 3 and 4.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.680
Pi.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.609
By the time you get
to pi, it rolls over.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.810
Everybody see that?

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:37.010
I started out 1, 2, 3, just
less than pi, 4, just bigger

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:51.210
than pie, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 20, 50.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.250
Horrendous, right?

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.950
But I want you to find the
Fourier transform of that.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.290
Actually, I want you to find
the Fourier transform of that!

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:04.630
But as a subtopic, I'll accept
the Fourier transform of that.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.540
OK.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.680
Look at your neighbor.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.263
Tell me the Fourier
transform of that.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.070
So what's the Fourier
transform of the bottom thing?

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:05.740
OK.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.900
Was a hard question.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.470
Yes!

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.612
Yes.

00:20:09.612 --> 00:20:10.520
Oh nice!

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.840
It was number 4, got it.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:18.870
[LAUGH] So what should I
notice about this signal?

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.080
Except what?

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.570
As a sophisticated signal
processor at this point,

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.730
after all it's the
penultimate lecture,

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.550
you're already sophisticated.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.690
So as a sophisticated
signal processor,

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.180
what do you notice immediately
about that waveform?

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.440
It just cries out, I feel.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.580
It says?

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.290
Periodic.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.400
Exactly.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.990
Even though it's
horrendous, it's periodic.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.810
Why is that interesting?

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.180
It has a series.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.260
Precisely.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.960
So all I need to do to
figure out the transform,

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.331
is figure out the series.

00:20:54.331 --> 00:20:54.830
OK.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.750
So let's do that.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.150
Now let's start.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.580
The same waveform on the top.
m equals 1, just like before.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.210
Now I'm going to take the series
of this periodic waveform.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.540
And I'm going to
represent that down here.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.380
As you see, as I start to
modulate this waveform,

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:19.370
I'm getting two bumps, where
I had one bump of this--

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:22.330
where I had one period of this.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.960
I'm getting two periods here.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:31.030
So that's the reason my
first non-0 contribution

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.280
is k equals 2.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.210
Also notice that if I turn
to m the whole way down to 0,

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.480
I would just get dc k equals 1.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:52.280
So for the small m's, I'm mostly
getting dc and k equals 2.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.130
OK.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.580
Now as I turn up the
amplitude, now I'm

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.620
getting something that
doesn't look quite as

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.210
much like a sine wave.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:07.240
And that distortion is
manifest as some k whose 4.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.500
Then I turn it up higher.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.460
Whoops, I hit the button a few
times more than I intended to.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.640
If I go up to m equals 5, now
it's wrapped around like this.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:21.580
And I can see I've got k equals
0, 2, 4, 6, and a little 8.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:28.430
Keep going up, up, up, up.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:33.980
And what you can see is that
as I turn up the amplitude,

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.780
I'm getting bigger
and bigger k's.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.090
In fact, there's kind of
a simple relationship.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.440
By the time I got up to m
equals 50, I got about 50 k's.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.840
Roughly speaking.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.570
And that has something to
do with the periodicity

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.130
of the cosine being 6.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.630
2 pi.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.950
So the number of
terms I'm getting

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:02.840
is related to how
big that signal is.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.270
I was able to represent
this horrendous signal now

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.520
by a series, but I
asked you for-- what

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.370
I'm really trying to do is
find the transform of this.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:14.140
We just found the
series of this,

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.270
but I really want to find
the transform of that.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.200
So I'd like to turn
this into a transform.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.114
How do I turn a
series in a transform?

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.750
Turn each k into an impulse.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.030
So now I get a
train of impulses.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.580
Each one of them has
weights proportional

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.010
to the length of the lines.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.010
Then each impulse gets located
in frequency, instead of

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:44.240
in k space, each impulse
gets located in frequency

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.760
at a multiple of
2 pi over omega m.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.420
So when I do that,
I get the transform

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:59.550
of this mass, which looks
like this centered here,

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:03.090
but then I modulate
by the cosine.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.340
So modulation gives
me two copies.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.010
I get the whole spectrum
for the inside here

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.240
and a duplicate over there.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.550
This time centered on omega c.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.620
That's all perfectly clear.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.600
Right?

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.260
So then I just did this term.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.900
Now I have to worry about that
term, but it's the same thing.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.450
Except now my periodicity
is a little different.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.790
Now I'm taking the
sine of the sine

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.950
rather than the cos of the sine.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:38.210
So now as I crank
up the waveforms,

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.160
the picture looks
slightly different.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.270
The principle
harmonics are now odd

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.020
because of the odd
symmetry of the sine wave.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.700
I had evens when I used cosine.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.280
I have odds when I use sine.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:56.340
So now I'm filling in a
bunch of odd harmonics,

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.850
but the general pattern
looks very similar.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.480
So that now the result looks
very similar to the result

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.070
from before.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.380
And the sum is the sum.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:15.150
Here's the Fourier transform
of this waveform y of t.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.460
The point is it's
huge bandwidth.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.940
The advantage of FM is not
in conserving bandwidth,

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.850
it's actually using bandwidth.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.480
So we're using-- this
is the K, big case.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.490
So we're doing wideband FM.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.070
We're shoving
frequency components

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:39.630
all over the spectrum,
but the advantage of that

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:42.450
is that I get a signal
that's very robust.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:46.490
Imagine if I were to add a small
level of noise to this signal.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.032
You could still
recover the signal.

00:25:52.032 --> 00:25:53.490
The only thing
that's coded here is

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.220
one sine wave that
has one period

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.480
across that whole length.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.630
You could recover that in
the absence of, not only

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.450
a little noise, but an
enormous amount of noise.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.117
And that was what
FM was good for.

00:26:05.117 --> 00:26:06.700
And that's what
Armstrong figured out.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.783
And that's why we have FM.

00:26:07.783 --> 00:26:11.880
And that's why
television, even HDTV,

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.400
uses FM coding of the audio.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.840
Because it's resilient to noise.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.940
So that was kind of a motivation
for thinking about modulation,

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.980
in terms of communications.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.370
I don't want you to go away
thinking about modulation

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:31.540
as only useful for
communications,

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.420
so I want to close with
a kind of unconventional

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.300
use of modulation.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.190
I may have mentioned
that I like microscopy.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.580
I'm going to show you how
you can use modulation

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.500
to improve microscopy.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.530
So this was an idea of
Michael Mermelstein.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:54.250
Michael was a PhD
student in my lab.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.930
He thought of it.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.450
Stan and Jay developed it.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.480
They all three got
PhD's on this topic.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.980
Berthold is a professor
in CS and five of us

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.440
worked on this project.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.090
So the idea is improving
microscopy with 6.003.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.840
With modulation in particular.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.830
You've all seen this.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:22.950
This is the double-0 3
model of a microscope.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.750
Double-0 3 microscope convolved
with blurring function.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.070
Done.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.870
That's what a microscope is.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.570
That's the double-0 3
model of a microscope.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.400
Microscope is a low pass filter.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.677
Because all of the different
spatial frequencies

00:27:37.677 --> 00:27:39.260
that are available
in the target can't

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.551
get through all the lenses
for very fundamental reasons

00:27:41.551 --> 00:27:44.660
in physics, the high
frequencies don't make it.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.100
The low frequencies do.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.830
The result is a blurred image.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.750
So I'm representing
this as the target.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.700
It passes through
the microscope, which

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.770
is represented by
a low pass filter

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.510
and it comes out
a blurry picture.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:05.770
Michael's idea was instead
of illuminating the target

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.360
with uniform light--

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.240
if you tear apart a
microscope, a lot of the guts

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.970
are intended to make a
nice uniform light that

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.010
goes across the target.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.000
Nice uniform illumination.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.090
Michael's idea was,
let's not do that.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.970
Let's project stripes on it.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.800
That's a little bizarre.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.990
So instead of having a nice,
blurry picture of a target,

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.830
Michael wanted me to
generate blurry pictures

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:40.007
of stripey targets.

00:28:40.007 --> 00:28:42.340
But you're a sophisticated
double-0 3 people, as well as

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.644
Michael.

00:28:44.644 --> 00:28:45.810
Why does he want to do that?

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.400
Different frequency.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.030
Phase modulated microscopy.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.830
That's why he wants to do this.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.200
We're going to
modulate microscopy.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.930
OK, well what's that?

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:08.520
OK, so Stan Hong was one
of our TA's in double-0 3.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.700
And he wanted to explain
the way this works

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.374
using purely double-0 3 terms.

00:29:14.374 --> 00:29:16.290
He also knew that I would
be receptive to that

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.720
and that Bertold Horn, who
teaches this course all

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.490
the time, would be receptive
to that kind of an argument.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:25.840
So Stan made a picture
to illustrate that.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.930
So here Stan's picture.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.606
What do you see?

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.460
Nice picture, right?

00:29:43.094 --> 00:29:43.760
What do you see?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.210
Great.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.440
Excellent.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.240
That's exactly right.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.240
Some of you close to the
front, what do you see?

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.620
Stripes.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.690
So what you see is stripes.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.836
And if I were sitting
where you're sitting,

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:05.960
I wouldn't see the stripes.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.470
Why is that?

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:15.500
Because my eyes, like any
optical system, blurs.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.430
Me being old, they blur
more than you being young.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.960
You can see stripes
better than I can.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.830
So if I were to sit
there or if I read it--

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.350
or if you were to
sit-in the back row it

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.810
would be hard to see the stripes
would you still see blur.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.540
You'd still see gray.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.485
So what do I do?

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.996
This is double-0 3.

00:30:38.996 --> 00:30:40.620
We just did phase
modulated microscopy,

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.504
but what should I do next?

00:30:43.504 --> 00:30:44.545
I have a stripey picture.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.360
How did that
picture get stripey?

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.830
It got modulated.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.790
What should I do next?

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.505
Demodulate it.

00:31:01.505 --> 00:31:02.380
So how do we do that?

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.000
Do the same process when--

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.220
and that process was?

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.480
So I put stripes--

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.270
I illuminated the
picture with stripes

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:19.400
in order to make the original.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:26.350
Now what I should do is
illuminate the result

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.000
with stripes.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.820
If I multiply the
picture by stripes

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.780
I'm phase modulating it.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:41.050
Multiply by cos omega
whatever, right?

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.090
So now I'll put
the clicker down.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.170
No cheating, right?

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:46.600
Nothing up my sleeves.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.030
And now I'm going to project
that stripey pattern.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.402
Cute, huh?

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.430
It's pretty amazing.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.310
So who is that?

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.990
Fourier.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.489
Good.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.870
That's the principle behind
Michael's microscope.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:19.320
And by the way,
I'm not cheating.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.355
So if I roll the phase--

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.750
It works just like radio.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.370
Now how's it work?

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.035
And how well-- so
that was a demo.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.120
Stan's committee loved it.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.880
Here's the idea.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.260
So the poster was phase
modulated Fourier.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:56.490
Fourier is a
function of x and y.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.735
And you modulate the
phase of carrier.

00:32:58.735 --> 00:33:01.530
The carrier now is
the y displacement

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:05.220
because we were putting
this kind of line on it.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.720
So we modulated carrier.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:12.330
Cos omega cy was the carrier
by the phase of Fourier.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.560
So we bumped the
lines up and down.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.280
We being, Stan.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.280
Stan bumped the lines up
and down in proportion

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.450
to the brightness of Fourier.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:30.110
And that put Fourier's
content centered on omega c.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:34.890
It was hard to see from the
audience because your eyes--

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.590
the projector projected omega c.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.840
It's hard for you to
see from the audience

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:46.910
because your visible frequencies
in space don't go that high,

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.510
but you beat it with
the stripey pattern,

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:54.140
that modulates in space just
the way it modulates in time.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.940
And it takes a copy
of Fourier, which

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.040
had been modulated up
to omega c and bumps it

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.807
back down to the visible.

00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:00.890
That's why you can see it.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.090
Well, we're going to
see that in a moment.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:07.840
Good question.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:16.980
The idea is precisely the same
as the superheterodyne radio.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.510
If this is the
complicated picture

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.010
that we would like
to look at-- this

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.780
is the Fourier transform
or the complicated picture

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.100
that we would like to look at.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.969
If we demodulate with
this stripe at omega c,

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:32.460
we're able to bounce
down this pe house

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.880
and we're able to see
that part of the picture,

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.460
even though those frequencies
are too high for them

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.156
to go through the microscope.

00:34:40.156 --> 00:34:41.989
There's a limited number
of frequencies that

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:43.500
will go through the microscope.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.960
Just like there's a limited
number of frequencies

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.440
that'll go through your eye.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.080
And we can take a band of
frequencies, that don't make it

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.830
through the microscope, beat
it with this stripey pattern

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:57.150
into a frequency range that
does go through the microscope.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:01.170
Then we can change
the stripey pattern.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.900
If we make stripey pattern
with slightly higher frequency,

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.770
we get a different part
of the invisible spectrum.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:10.720
And we just keep repeating.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.420
There's a bit of an issue
that it's a 2D transform.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.860
We have to worry
about frequencies

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.700
in x and frequencies in
y, but we are all experts

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.720
at this sort of thing.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.930
The difference between stripes
this way and stripes this way

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:26.080
is Fourier's this way
and Fourier's that way.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.670
You rotate the stripe.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:29.685
It just rotates the
Fourier transform.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:38.050
We can think about, in space
we can modulate like that

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:41.630
or we can modulate like that.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.420
And in fact, what
we would like to do

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:48.980
is modulate by a whole
bunch, so that we could

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.480
take all these little regions--

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.829
so say the circle
corresponds to the radius

00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:56.120
of frequencies that get
through the optical microscope.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.036
What we'd like to do is
put that little radius

00:35:58.036 --> 00:36:02.460
at every possible
place, one of the time,

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:07.485
to bring down those frequencies
in the target, one at a time.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.580
So the idea--

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.380
Then the problem
becomes, how do you

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.340
make so many stripey patterns?

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.600
And you have to generate
those stripey patterns at very

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.280
high spatial frequencies.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.010
Very small distances.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.520
If you're going to
beat a microscope--

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.320
Optical microscope
resolutions are

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.900
on the order of 500 nanometers.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.710
Wavelength of light.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.640
So you're going to have to make
these patterns small compared

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.170
to the wavelength of light.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.010
So Michael's idea
was interference.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:47.350
You take two coherent
laser beams, point them

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:50.790
toward each other but
at a slight angle,

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:55.050
and they will interfere
and make a stripey pattern.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:58.230
Then you turn on a
different pair of beams

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.770
and you get a different
stripey pattern.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:02.598
Different.

00:37:02.598 --> 00:37:03.426
Different.

00:37:03.426 --> 00:37:04.050
Different.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.720
I'm showing on the left, the
spatial, and on the right,

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.900
the Fourier transform.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.770
Fourier transform for
the stripey pattern.

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:16.850
All light-- all pictures
have some dc because there's

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:19.630
no negative photons.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.100
So that's this.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.980
And these are coding--

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:28.210
the angle is coding
the orientation

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.090
and the distance is
coding the pitch.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.230
Different stripey pattern.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.665
Different.

00:37:34.665 --> 00:37:35.165
Different.

00:37:35.165 --> 00:37:36.800
Different.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.524
There's a bunch of them.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:52.090
With 15 beams, you get 15k 2.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.540
Order 15 squared.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.950
That's the idea.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.270
And that was Michael.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.410
This is Stan.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:04.060
Stan figured out a way
to build an apparatus

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.070
to take the beam from a
laser, break it into 15 parts,

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.729
steer it with a
bunch of mirrors,

00:38:11.729 --> 00:38:13.270
and point them all
toward the center.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:17.190
So the target-- so the
lasers coming in over here.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:20.330
There's these pick-off mirrors
steering things around.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:23.790
This was some complicated
optimization that Stan did.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:27.060
Here is the region
of interest, which

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.970
is this big on his microscope.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.870
And about 2 centimeters
down, the beams

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.090
converge on a specimen.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.307
Which is right there.

00:38:38.307 --> 00:38:40.640
So if we zoom in and you can
see it a little bit better,

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.830
there is a conventional
microscope objective

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.140
with 15 beams fired toward it.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.770
Now the idea is you put the
specimen between the beams

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:51.200
and the objective.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.650
And then you view the
stripey illuminated target

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:58.770
with the microscope objective.

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:02.010
Here is a picture
taken by Jay, where

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.070
he took a bunch of small beads.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:09.690
It's easy to get plastic beads
of very uniform dimension.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:13.340
So these are about
1 micron beads

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.240
and about a gazillion of them.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.090
So he just made a
solution of beads,

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.730
put them on a glass
slide, evaporated it

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:25.620
so that he would have a random
constellation of plastic beads

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.930
all one micron in diameter.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:29.730
And here's one picture of it.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.740
And you can see the pixels.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.740
Each one of these squares
is one pixel in the camera.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.309
I'm zooming in a lot.

00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:38.850
Keep in mind that
these guys are only

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.070
about a micron in dimension.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:45.490
But then if you change
the stripey pattern,

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.570
you get a slightly
different picture.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:51.170
And if you change this
stripey pattern again.

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:52.620
And again.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.120
And again.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:53.550
And again.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:54.050
And again.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.700
And again.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:59.510
So he recorded then, 300
and some odd pictures

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:01.920
of the same thing with
different stripey patterns.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:07.690
Then he did some
signal processing

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:11.030
and turned that sequence of
pictures into that picture.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.510
So you can see the
resolution is up a bit.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.560
The resolution is
very sub-pixel.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.020
You can see many
resolution elements

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.050
inside one pixel from
the original picture.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.800
In fact, if you
compare the original

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.260
to the reconstruction--

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:37.840
so this is one picture taken
with uniform illumination.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.580
This is the result of
calculating some 300 pictures

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.010
with structured illumination,
with different structure

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.630
in each picture.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:49.190
And you can see a lot
better resolution here.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.800
In fact, you can
see here there's

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.320
something that looks
like it might be a bead,

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:57.800
but over here you can see more
clearly it's really two beads.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.430
And if you take a solitary
bead and plot the brightness

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.260
through a line, you get this.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.630
But if you plot the brightness
through a reconstruction,

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.475
you get something much narrower.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:16.590
Stan then developed a method
for scanning this around.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.590
He also developed a method
for measuring the point spread

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.037
function directly.

00:41:21.037 --> 00:41:22.620
Here I want to show
you a measurement,

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.590
same sort of apparatus,
with a 200 nanometer bead.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.752
A much smaller bead.

00:41:27.752 --> 00:41:29.460
Keep in mind that the
apparent brightness

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.920
goes as the cube of diameter.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.230
So changing the diameter
by a factor of five,

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:39.520
changed the apparent
brightness by 5 cubed.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:45.320
So here is a picture taken
with Stan's microscope.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.450
And if we take a row of pixels
and plot the brightness,

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.300
this is the reconstructed
image by using

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.330
standing wave illumination,
which is what we called it.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:58.900
And it's got an apparent
diameter of 290.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:02.320
The 290 is bigger than the
200 because of the blurring

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.600
of the microscope.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:09.250
The prediction, based on the
angle of the laser beams--

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.720
the resolution of
this microscope

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.130
depends on the
angle of the laser

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.620
beams because the angle
of the laser beams

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.780
determines the
pitch of the fringe.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:21.010
That the pitch of
the stripey pattern.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:25.690
So the prediction, based
on the angle of the beams

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:30.870
from the apparatus, was that
it should have been 250.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.700
And the fairest thing
to compare that to

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.430
is, what would it have been
if we hadn't used any wave

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.990
illumination?

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.490
If we hadn't used
any illumination,

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:42.490
it would have been
1500 nanometers.

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:44.400
So you can see, there's
an enormous increase

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.310
in the resolution by using this
phase modulated microscopy.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:51.240
So the point is that you
can use modulation for a lot

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.121
other things than
communications.

00:42:53.121 --> 00:42:54.870
Because the application
and communications

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:56.880
is terribly important,
but here was

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.280
