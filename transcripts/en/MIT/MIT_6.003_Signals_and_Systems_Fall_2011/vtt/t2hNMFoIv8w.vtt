00:00:25.988 --> 00:00:28.470
DENNIS FREEMAN: Hello.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.590
So welcome to the
last lecture in 003.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.350
So there are more
lectures scheduled.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.940
But I don't believe
in trying to cram

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.780
new material in the last couple
of hours before the exam.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.770
So no new material after today,
although it will be helpful

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.200
if you continue to try
to work on problems,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.510
and try to internalize
what we did more recently.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.830
That's the idea.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.890
So I'm not trying to
pump new information in.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.260
That doesn't mean that
there aren't things

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.450
that you should be doing.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.900
But after today,
no new information.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.900
In fact, today there
is no new information.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.760
There will be a
session on Tuesday.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.410
But the idea is primarily to
get feedback from you people.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.960
As I mentioned last time,
we've changed a lot of things.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.000
We change a lot of
things every term.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.280
And our primary
source of information

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.110
is the end of term surveys.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.950
Tell us what works.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.910
Tell us what didn't work.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.750
Tell us what you liked.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.958
Tell us what you didn't like.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.900
If you didn't like the
electronic submission

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.917
of homework, tell us.

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:28.500
If you didn't like
the tutor, tell us.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.320
If you would rather have
individual office hours instead

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.900
of block office hours,
it's a good chance for you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.560
to tell us what you think.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.960
And it's especially
important that you fill out

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.180
the online subject evaluation.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.390
So please, if you have a laptop
with a certificate on it,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.880
feel free to bring it
to lecture next time.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.960
That's one of the main ideas.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.360
But we'll also spend
some time just discussing

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.414
what you would suggest for
improvements for next time.

00:02:00.414 --> 00:02:01.330
Questions or comments?

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.710
OK, so today is
mostly just for fun.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.419
Today is mostly just to
tell you about the way

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.410
6.003 plays out in
technologies that you

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.050
might have some interest in.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.470
And I chose a technology that I
am particularly interested in.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.350
Because as I probably have
mentioned in the past,

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.440
like many of you, I was
afflicted with an addiction

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.300
with music at about your age.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.350
I recovered.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.160
You will too.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.720
But I was very interested in it.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.340
It was a very hot topic.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.270
And I want to talk about some
of the things that 003 has done

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.140
to make that industry very
different today from what it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.430
was when I was an undergraduate.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.850
It may not surprise
you, but it surprises me

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.300
that the technology that
we used was really not

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.250
very different
from the technology

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.290
that the inventor invented.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.397
So who invented the phonograph?

00:03:06.397 --> 00:03:07.480
You can look at the notes.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.688
You're supposed to know that.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.270
Just shout.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.005
Makes me feel better.

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:15.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.005
DENNIS FREEMAN: Thank you--

00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:17.950
Edison.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.915
So Edison was, of course, a
genius and a prolific inventor.

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:25.540
At the time he invented
the phonograph,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.600
he was interested in
two things that he

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.840
was trying to draw
relations between,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.330
telegraphy and telephony.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.770
We talked about
telegraphy before.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.910
Telegraphy, telegraph, was
a way of getting messages

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.890
point to point.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.100
So person A wanted to get
a message to person B.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.460
And it would be transmitted
via the telegraph system.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.080
Now I kind of
oversimplified the way

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.496
the telegraph
system worked when I

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:52.864
talked about it the last time.

00:03:52.864 --> 00:03:54.530
It really worked a
lot more like message

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.714
passing than you
might have thought.

00:03:57.714 --> 00:03:59.380
What would happen is
that there wouldn't

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.440
be a direct connection
between person A and person B.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.930
It might have to go
through six relays.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.270
So in order to
get to California,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.850
it might be important
that a message that

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.880
originated in Boston
would go to New York,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.730
and from New York
to Pennsylvania,

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.000
from Pennsylvania to
Chicago, et cetera.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.080
So there may not be a direct
route over long distances.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.930
So the way that was done,
you would take your message

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.990
to the telegraph office A.
The operator would key it in.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.790
It would get written
down by the receiver,

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.750
say, in New York, who would
listen to the message,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.140
write it out, basically
reproducing your message there,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.990
then key it in to
the next relay.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.900
So it might actually be
keyed in a dozen times

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.730
before it hits the
final destination.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.370
And that was tedious,
laborious, hard.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.630
And Edison was interested
in fixing that.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.990
And to do so, he invented
a paper tape system,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.400
so that the receiver
wouldn't need to listen it.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.539
They would just punch out paper
tape as the clicks came in.

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.080
So as the dots and
dashes came in it,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.700
it would make holes in paper.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.350
The holes in paper,
then, could be

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.050
used to transmit to
the next station.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.510
So Edison did that.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.040
He was interested
in thinking about

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.600
whether you could do
the same sort of thing

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.880
with other kinds of signals
besides telegraph signals.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.070
And that's the origin
of the phonograph.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.580
He was interested in, could
you send a voice message

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.570
to a relay, have it
automatically recorded,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.704
so that it could then be
rebroadcast over the next link?

00:05:39.704 --> 00:05:41.870
So he was kind of imagining
a telephone network that

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.610
was based on the same principle
that the telegraph network had

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.720
been.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.960
So the idea was to try
to record an audio signal

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.820
of the type that would come
across a telephone wire.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.690
So he got together with
his aide, Batchelor,

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.100
and made this drawing.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.460
This was 1877.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.440
And 30 hours later--

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.080
kind of rapid prototyping
for the time--

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.750
his machinist made this.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.610
So that's the first phonograph.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:21.230
The idea was you wrap that
disk with a piece of wax paper.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.480
You turn the crank.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:29.320
As you turn the crank, this
thing is connected to a screw,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.450
so that it's moving this way at
the same time this big thing is

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.820
going around that way.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.300
This is a diaphragm, so
that you shout in here.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.710
And there's a needle
connected on the other end,

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.190
so that as you shout,
the needle gets

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.500
moved with audio frequencies
contained in your voice.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.300
So how do you do this, then?

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.970
So you grab the handle.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.700
You put a new sheet
of wax paper on it.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.810
You grab the handle.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.200
You turn at a constant
speed, and shout.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.300
OK, it took some coordination.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.140
The remarkable
thing is it worked.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.986
So Edison said, Mary
had a little lamb.

00:07:12.986 --> 00:07:17.390
And on replaying it, the device
said, Mary had a little lamb.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.020
The very first try, it worked.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.220
Now it didn't work
all that great.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.535
What do you suppose happened?

00:07:25.535 --> 00:07:26.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.886
DENNIS FREEMAN: Noise?

00:07:27.886 --> 00:07:29.538
Of course, there was noise, yes.

00:07:29.538 --> 00:07:30.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.525
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Frequency was terrible.

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:35.710
Anything more disastrous?

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.340
Yeah?

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.509
DENNIS FREEMAN: Cranking
is not at all constant.

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:42.520
So you can make it sound like
Alvin the chipmunk if you like.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.670
Something worse.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.734
How long do you think
the recording lasted?

00:07:53.734 --> 00:07:55.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.586
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Yeah, about once.

00:07:57.586 --> 00:08:01.262
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:01.262 --> 00:08:02.720
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
the problem was,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.190
to get the energy back
out, you have to--

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:12.500
so after recording-- so
clean sheet of wax paper,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.760
crank, crank,
crank, yell, scream,

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.340
and now reset the
needle to the beginning.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.010
And now crank without screaming.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.990
In order to get the
message back out,

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.960
you had to push on the needle,
so that it would follow

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.100
the indentations on the wax.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.860
But if you pushed hard
enough for it to follow it,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.559
what would happen?

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.130
It would erase the message.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.429
So it was kind of a
destructive read out.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.799
It didn't last very long.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:47.850
Because the act of reading it
back out tended to erase it.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.960
So he redid the
thing with tinfoil.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.250
That worked much better.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.780
And in fact, it caught
on like overnight.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.060
So within two years,
he was invited

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.770
to the National
Academies of Sciences

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.180
to give a talk on this.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.000
That's him posing at the
National Academy of Sciences

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.210
with his then phonograph.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.460
They loved it.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.260
Now despite the
fact they loved it,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.750
nobody knew what to do with it.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.570
Everybody thought it was just
the neatest thing in the world.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.550
But they didn't have a
clue what to do with it.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.590
And of course, Edison, one,
was a bit self-promoting.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.940
So he wrote articles about
it, and tried to explain.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.160
In the patent, he listed
about seven or eight things

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.990
you could do with this thing.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.070
Today they sound a
little far-fetched.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:42.080
Recording important
historical addresses,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.870
medical transcription--

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.780
the one that seems most--

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.610
I don't know-- sort
of gruesome to me,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.610
recording the last will
and testament of a person

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.070
as they're dying.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.230
Now that sounds gruesome to me.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.280
Then imagine what it
was like back then.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.260
Back then, nobody had ever
heard somebody's voice

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.040
who was not alive.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.140
The technology didn't exist.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.090
So all of the sudden,
he's proposing

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.630
to record the dying
breath of, say--

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.970
it kind of mortified everybody.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.960
What Edison didn't
like was the idea

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.420
that it would be used for music.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.830
That was trivial.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.410
He was doing important science.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.350
So he didn't like the idea that
this would be used for music.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.900
And so he downplayed
that his entire life.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:39.300
Nevertheless, the commercial
success was music.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.510
He was trying to promote this as
a system for recording speech,

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.350
medical transcription, buying
breaths, historical talks.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.520
That didn't really catch on.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.520
This was a playback device.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.160
This really did catch on.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.050
This was about 60 years later.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.886
It's virtually identical.

00:11:00.886 --> 00:11:02.760
It became a piece of
furniture that everybody

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.460
had in their house.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.100
The cylinders had
gone back to wax.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.410
Alexander Graham Bell had
worked on the problem.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.010
He figured out how to
make long-lasting wax.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.920
This crank cranked a spring.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.205
So you could crank it up,
but over time it would play.

00:11:20.205 --> 00:11:22.330
So you didn't need to go
at exactly the right speed

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.090
anymore--

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.920
a number of big improvements.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.660
The cylinders held two
minutes of recording.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.780
So they weren't
exactly long-playing.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:42.620
OK, this was the same model of
phonograph I had in college.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.680
And it's actually
remarkably similar.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.340
So there's some differences.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.560
There was no crank.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.140
We had electricity.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.265
It had a motor.

00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:57.660
So the motor propelled it.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.100
It was no longer a cylinder.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.020
Now it's a desk.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.815
There was no screw.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.690
So how does the needle track
the grooves if there's no screw?

00:12:11.325 --> 00:12:12.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.085
DENNIS FREEMAN:
There's a spiral.

00:12:14.085 --> 00:12:15.409
So the records had a spiral.

00:12:15.409 --> 00:12:15.950
That's right.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.400
This was the thing
that read the grooves.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.020
What held that in the groove?

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.850
It was gravity.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.080
So it was the same kind of idea.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:41.150
You had to push on the needle to
hold the needle in the groove,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.020
so that the needle could
report the vibrations that

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.110
were recorded there.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:54.515
But this was much classier than
the version in Edison's time.

00:12:54.515 --> 00:13:01.670
And in fact, you could tell
how serious the audio file was

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.604
by the different kinds of
performance enhancements

00:13:04.604 --> 00:13:05.520
of this sort of thing.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.660
So for example,
this little knob,

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.995
this controls the
weight, the force

00:13:12.995 --> 00:13:14.711
that's placed on the needle.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.460
If you had a good set
up, you could set it

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.890
for about 1.2 grams.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.050
If you had a bad set up,
it'd go up to 2 grams.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:29.879
So you could tell how serious
a person was by how much force

00:13:29.879 --> 00:13:30.795
was required to track.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.790
So for example,
the primary thing

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.540
that determined how
well the system worked

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.092
was the cartridge.

00:13:41.092 --> 00:13:42.550
So here's a blow
up of a cartridge.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.320
The cartridge--
anybody who is serious

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.970
had a diamond-tipped needle.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.980
If they didn't have a
diamond-tipped needle,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.990
you just didn't even
think about them.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.120
So everybody I knew had
a diamond-tipped needle.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.970
That was just the way it was.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.160
The least expensive
kind of cartridges

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.020
was a little piece
of piezoceramic.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.470
The piezoceramic
was stiff, so that,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.900
as you played the records,
they tended to wear out.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.450
Because you had to put
a lot of force on it.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:17.400
Mine, I had the V15 type 4.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.280
So this was a magnetic device.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.890
So there were a tiny
little electromagnets,

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.450
so that the up and
down motions would

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.130
be converted into
an electrical signal

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.700
by magnetism, not by
piezoelectric effect.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.550
And you could track that
with a much smaller force.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.460
And I should just mention
just so you know that we

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.810
were serious back then--

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.890
so this cost 160 then dollars.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.780
There's been a factor of six or
so inflation, this cost $1,000.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.160
And if you were
serious, you had these.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:54.650
So that's kind of the
technology as it existed

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.690
when I was an undergraduate.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.150
And it was good.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.480
It had existed for
over 100 years.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.100
But it was still basically the
same thing Edison had done.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.590
The media-- oh, I should
show it just in case

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.020
you've never seen a media.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.730
So this is a record.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.670
This was my record.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.892
And the problem is, of
course, they scratch.

00:15:23.892 --> 00:15:25.600
So over time, these
things would scratch.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.599
So the technologies
for things like,

00:15:27.599 --> 00:15:29.140
how do you keep them
from scratching,

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.020
how do you wear them out?

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.680
And you can also appreciate sort
of where the music industry is

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.490
coming from.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.680
This costs about $15--

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.770
15 then dollars.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.660
So with factor six,
it's about $100.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.110
So from the point of
view of buying music,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.792
it was much more
expensive back then.

00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:49.000
And from the point of view
of the recording industry,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.720
think of it.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.400
You had all these
addicted people

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.010
wanting to buy this stuff.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.120
And it wears out.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.190
So you play it for
two or three years,

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.090
you have to buy a new one.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.560
OK, so you can sort of
appreciate where the music

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.730
industry is coming from.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.360
Because things have changed.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:14.070
OK, so distortions, expensive,
fragile, blah, blah, blah.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.280
Then in the 1980s,
everything changed.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.400
In the 1980s, there was
the invention of the CD.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.250
The CD was invented
by Philips Corp

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.830
and Sony Corp working together.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.930
And just everything
was revolutionized.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:35.960
So we'll talk a little bit
about how the CD works.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.300
The important thing
for the discussion

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.410
is that, unlike records, CDs
are virtually indestructible.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.660
They have very low distortion.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.060
They are next to free.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.390
And all of that is
technology that's

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.800
in large part enabled by 6.003.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.920
Of And that's what I want
to actually talk about.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.585
So what is a CD?

00:16:57.585 --> 00:17:00.620
A CD is not very
different from a record.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.979
So a CD has tracks.

00:17:02.979 --> 00:17:04.520
The information is
written in tracks.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.369
The tracks are
written as a spiral.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:10.359
The spiral starts at the
inside and spirals out.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:14.319
And so the idea is that you
read a spiral of messages.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.780
And just like a record--

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.450
the way you make a record
is called embossing.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.319
You make a master.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:28.460
And then you take molten
plastic, and press it,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.780
and copy the patterns
to make that record.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.570
In fact, there is a big
technology on the formula

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.030
that you used for the vinyl.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.460
One of the secrets of
RCA at the time when

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.540
I was in graduate school,
they had a secret recipe

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.680
that included dropping four
slices of American cheese

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.300
in their vinyl producing.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.890
Because somebody had
accidentally once

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.450
dropped a sandwich.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.970
And those records came out good.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.030
So there were magical
things like that that

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.670
were trade secrets at the time.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.600
OK, so that technology
was basically embossing.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.410
And that's the same thing
you do when you make a CD.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:14.720
CD is poly carbonate,
which is injection molded.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.500
So you make a master.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.150
The master is usually
made out of aluminum.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.150
The master is made
very similar to the way

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.530
that Edison would make a master.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.870
There's a big device
with an electromagnet

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.710
with a small stylus
and it punches them.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.520
But then you copy the
CDs by injection molding.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.510
So you take that original.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.320
And there's actually
a complicated process.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.930
You use the original to
make a half a dozen fathers.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.030
The fathers are used
to make mothers.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.530
Each father makes 20 mothers.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.050
Then each of the
mothers make children.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.050
And so you end up being
able to get a lot of copies

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.175
out of the original master.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.520
There's a reflective
layer of aluminum

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.920
that's evaporated on top
of the polycarbonate.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:09.320
And then there's a thin layer
of plastic put over the top.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.450
That results in something
that's extremely robust.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.050
And we'll see in a minute
how they make it robust.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:22.640
But this dimension is
like over a millimeter.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:29.450
So this is the CD version
of the same album.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:34.460
So this surface is the
information reading side.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.930
There's a millimeter
of stuff here.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.830
There's a millimeter of
polycarbonate protecting

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.320
this surface that
has the information

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.030
from the environment.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.549
So in fact, if you want
to destroy somebody's CD,

00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:49.340
you might think the
way to do that would be

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.080
to write in felt tip on here.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.310
No, don't do it that way.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.150
Use a ballpoint
pen on this side.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.060
Because that layer of
plastic is very thin.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.760
So use a ballpoint pen here.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.500
It will completely screw it up.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:08.335
So it's very robust when it gets
imperfections on the read side.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.350
OK, so that's kind
of the structure.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.510
It's virtually
indestructible is the point.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.090
So then, how do you get
the information on it?

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.540
Well, the information is
coded in these patterns.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.350
The patterns are small.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.785
The pattern width
is half micron.

00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:34.940
A human hair is 50
to 100 microns thick.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.020
And I have white here.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.790
Well, I used to
have blonde hair.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.160
I have gray here now.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.470
Ignoring that for the moment,
I used have blond hair.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.860
Blonde hair is about
50 microns diameter.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.830
Black hair is about
100 microns diameter.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.630
So depending on the
color of your hair,

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:55.100
it would obscure 30
to 60 tracks if you

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.720
were to lay a hair across it.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.960
So these are very,
very small patterns.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:08.960
And so the trick for how you
code them is a big problem.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.657
Before we get there, though,
how do you code the audio?

00:21:12.657 --> 00:21:14.240
You won't be too
surprised to find out

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.190
that it's a sample data system.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.060
So we do sampling just the way
we've talked about it before.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.550
Audio, you can hear
sounds from about 20 hertz

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.170
to about 20 kilohertz.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.330
This is an ideogram.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.880
Audiogram's plot is a
function of frequency.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.950
What's the minimum
amplitude required

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.129
to be able to hear
that frequency?

00:21:33.129 --> 00:21:35.045
You're most sensitive
in the kilohertz region.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.072
The scale over here
is DB in something

00:21:40.072 --> 00:21:41.280
we call sound pressure level.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.880
Sound pressure level is
the centigrade equivalent

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.590
for hearing.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.090
So 0 is just audible.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.580
100 starts to hurt.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.910
120 is permanent
damage kind of thing.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:59.990
So you can hear about
100 decibels over a range

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.890
from 20 to 20 kilohertz.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:07.260
And so the way they
coded it for the CD

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.200
was sampled at 44.1 kilohertz.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.380
They chose that
funny number to be

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.560
a little bit bigger
than twice the highest

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.590
frequency that you can hear.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.450
But they made it
the funny number

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:26.950
because they wanted it to
be an integer multiple of 60

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.580
so it was easy to synchronize
with television signals.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.300
That's where the funny
number came from.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:37.470
So 44.1 kilohertz divided
by 60 is some integer.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.500
The problem is, of course,
that they wanted to be greedy.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.590
They wanted all the
bits to code audio.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.880
So they only sampled
barely over the frequency

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.860
that was required.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.715
So according to the sampling
theorum, you need 40.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.700
So if you had a sample
data system running at 44,

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:09.430
any amount of signal above 22
would alias and sound terrible.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.180
So you need to put an
anti-aliasing filter

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.060
to prevent that.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.820
We've kind of cheated the
whole way through 003.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.960
We always said, when you
need a low-pass filter,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.890
use an ideal one.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.640
Well, they don't exist.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.030
we use ideal filters because
they're conceptually simple.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.770
There is no such thing.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.820
If you actually try to make a
filter using designs like Russ

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.110
talked about in recitation.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.780
Butterworth filters,
things like that, they

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.000
have transitioned bandwidths.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.310
So there is a range
of frequencies

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.880
for which the filter is
neither fully on nor fully off.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.490
And it's in transition.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.440
You would like that range of
frequencies to be very small,

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.880
so you don't waste bandwidth.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.180
So they would like to
reconstruct up to 40.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:02.210
And they allowed 4
kilohertz in the guard band.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.580
That was intentional,
because they

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.770
didn't want to have a
lot of bits that were not

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.037
useful for recording audio.

00:24:09.037 --> 00:24:11.120
That's the reason they
only went up to 44, instead

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.690
of, say, 80, which would have
made the anti-aliasing problem

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.700
simple.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.900
But it complicated the making
of the anti-alias filter.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.980
Because there is sounds
that come into microphones

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.150
about 20 kilohertz.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.390
It's just that you
can't hear them.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:33.060
But if you were to record those
sounds, and then sample them

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.879
at 40 kilohertz, you
would hear the alias.

00:24:36.879 --> 00:24:38.420
And it would be
highly objectionable.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.790
So you have to anti-alias.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.650
And that's actually hard.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:47.270
Because if you'd like
to hear up to 20,

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:52.650
and if you're
sampling at 44.1, 20

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:56.340
reflected down to
24.1, which means

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:00.930
that you want the transition
band to be 34 kilohertz.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.540
And if you think
about the design

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.960
of a filter like a
Butterworth filter,

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:15.512
in order to get a transition
that attenuates by ADDB--

00:25:15.512 --> 00:25:17.220
think about the dynamic
range of hearing.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.170
You have to make the
loudest sounds small enough,

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:23.730
so that you can no
longer hear them.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:28.050
So in general, you have to
attenuate by about ADDB.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.820
You need about 50 poles.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:37.030
To get an ADD attenuation
using a Butterworth design

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.610
in 4 kilohertz at 20 kilohertz.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.470
Everybody sort of know
what I'm talking about?

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.920
That's impossible.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.060
Lining up filters-- so the way
the Butterworth filters work,

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.690
you remember?

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:59.240
So you have a bunch
of poles like so.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.550
The way you think
about that is that you

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:07.160
start with a design that looks
like a not-so-good low-pass

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.530
filter.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:14.010
Then you add these
poles, which give you

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:19.180
a peaky response like that, so
that when this is going down,

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.800
the peakiness here
helps to cancel that.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.740
Then you do that again.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.820
So you can think about
these successive pole pairs

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:35.060
as sharpening the
transition by pushing up

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.400
on the center frequency
and rolling off

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.790
on the edge frequency.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.850
But in order for that to work,
they have to all be lined up.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.320
So if you've got
50 of them, you've

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.380
got to be able to line these
up to about a percent or so.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.830
Otherwise, they don't perform
the way they're supposed to,

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.840
and they can actually
make things worse.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:00.130
So making an analog
filter of that type

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.980
was impossible then
and is difficult now.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.190
Here is sort of the
state of the art.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.400
So this actually does
have ADDB of roll

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.060
off, because it's
a fancier design.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.070
As an elliptic design.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.620
The trick here, though,
is that all the parts

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.510
are laser trimmed.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.250
So they're all done
on one substrate.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.110
All the inductors,
all the capacitors

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.652
are done on a single substrate.

00:27:22.652 --> 00:27:24.610
Then they're laser trimmed,
so that they follow

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.550
the exactly the right places.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.850
Then it's encased
in aluminum to help

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:34.030
to hold the temperature
constant and to keep

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:37.420
the electromagnetic
interference out.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:42.290
And even so, this has
just 11 pole pairs.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:47.600
So this is not nearly adequate
for that kind of a design.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:56.000
So what we do instead is we use
something called oversampling.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.820
So instead of sampling
at 44.1, which

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.190
is what you would think
would happen in a CD,

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.680
you sample it four times that.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.590
By sampling at a
very high frequency,

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:11.970
you make it easy to make
an anti-aliasing filter.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.130
Because now, you
only need to worry

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:18.690
about saving the frequencies
up to 20 kilohertz.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:26.100
But you've got 170 kilohertz
to do the transition.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.990
So the filter design
becomes very easy.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:32.820
In fact, a typical design only
has five poles, and so just

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.880
a handful of capacitors.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.020
Just two capacitors and
two op amps will do that.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:47.212
So then you've got a system that
is sampled at 176 kilohertz.

00:28:47.212 --> 00:28:48.420
What's the problem with that?

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.623
What's the problem with
sampling at 176 kilohertz?

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.630
Too much information.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.277
So what you've done by sampling
at the higher frequency

00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:07.610
is you've increased the amount
of information that needs

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.210
to be stored by a factor of 4.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:14.980
So instead of being able to
record 74 minutes of music,

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.310
you can record 74 divided
by 4, 18 minutes of music.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:20.800
Nobody would like that, right?

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.960
So how do you fix that?

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.820
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Downsample, exactly.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:36.690
So what you do is you run
that discrete time signal that

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:42.330
was sampled at 176 through a
discrete low-pass filter, which

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:46.050
you implemented digitally with
arbitrary precision as much

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.520
as you want.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:57.930
So here's a design based on
a filter whose length is 200.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.350
By making a length 200
discrete time filter,

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.222
you can capture the
basic sine T over T shape

00:30:04.222 --> 00:30:06.180
that you're trying to
get with an ideal filter.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:14.680
So here with 200 samples,
it's easy to reproduce

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.500
a large number of ripples
similar to the large number

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.850
of ripples that I
wanted over here,

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.540
but now with digital
multiplies, not

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.490
with resistors and capacitors.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.420
And this shows where the poles--

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.940
this is an all 0 filter.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.350
It's a finite length filter.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.090
We didn't talk about that.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.270
It's an easy way to
implement filter design.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.620
It's an easy way
to design filters.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.530
It's a very popular
way of doing it.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:44.810
So it's an all 0 filter.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.560
And you can sort of
figure out by thinking

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.100
about the spacing of the
zeros relative to the unit

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.940
circle, how that implements
a low-pass filter.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.850
That was done with an
automated optimizing

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.540
algorithm for finding
the best low-pass filter.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:03.780
The method is called the
Parks-McClellan algorithm.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.580
And it makes a very nice filter.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:10.680
So this shows the
transition of ADDB

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:17.280
passing 20 kilohertz signals
and attenuating 24 and above.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:22.130
So you get a very nice filter
by doing that in discrete time.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:26.174
So then having done
the digital filter,

00:31:26.174 --> 00:31:27.590
you can throw away
the frequencies

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.700
that would alias
and then downsample.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.314
Yeah?

00:31:31.314 --> 00:31:34.237
AUDIENCE: Is the filter
in those zero locations

00:31:34.237 --> 00:31:35.470
standardized by anybody?

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.060
Or does any manufacturer--

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.470
DENNIS FREEMAN: Any
manufacturer-- yes.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.132
Every manufacturer is different.

00:31:41.132 --> 00:31:42.590
What's happening
over time, though,

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.290
is that the chips are
becoming standardized.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.487
So if you buy a particular chip,
it has a particular filter set.

00:31:48.487 --> 00:31:50.070
But it's not
standardized in the code.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:32:01.340
OK, so that's how you generate
a signal that is robust.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.530
And it's basically just 003.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:06.980
Now we have to think about,
how would you make the player?

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.200
Because what we'd
like to do is enable

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:16.140
you to use a CD in a
more portable fashion

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.140
than you could use
this technology.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.060
So the question is
now, how would you

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:27.120
make a player that can pick up
this information off the CD,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.540
so that you can
reproduce it in a Walkman

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:35.440
or in a more
portable environment?

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.620
So I had this brilliant
idea about two years ago

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:45.070
that I would take this CD and
I would use my microscope.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.770
I may have mentioned
I light microscopy.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:48.880
I went into my microscope.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.630
I used my research-quality
microscope,

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.810
which costs $70,000.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:57.730
And I'll take a beautiful
picture of the bits on here.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:03.100
And I'll write a problem set
for 003 where you have to decode

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.780
the bitstream.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.940
I thought it was brilliant.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.520
And it was like a week
before the homework

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.520
had to be written, you
know, the standard thing.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.020
And of course, I couldn't
get it to work in time.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:18.940
The problem was that even my
$70,000 research microscope

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.620
has trouble seeing the bits.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.520
The bits are really small.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:31.020
So when I first tried it,
I couldn't see anything.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.760
So I fiddled around
with the microscope.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.280
I tried all different
kinds of magnifications.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.260
I tried all kinds of
different optical tricks.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.190
But I know I couldn't
figure out anything.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.780
I couldn't get it to work.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.029
So I got my graduate students.

00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:43.200
They're always much better
at this sort of thing.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.880
And we finally got it to work.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.520
We cheated like crazy.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.610
So we had to use something
called water immersion.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:53.490
So you put a drop of
water on the surface,

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.170
so that you can use the--

00:33:55.170 --> 00:34:00.620
you lose resolution when
you go through a glass

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.380
to air interface.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.960
That's a bunch of microscopy
that you don't need to know.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.010
But you do.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.810
So there are tricks
in microscopy

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:13.250
where you can avoid having the
air interface by using water.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.880
The water is more closely
optically matched to glass.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.120
So what we did was we
did immersion microscopy,

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.969
put a drop of water on here,
put the lens in the water.

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:25.780
And that's the picture I got.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:32.580
So the point is that I had
to work to get a $70,000

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:37.290
microscope to read
the bits off here.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.120
And I sort of gave
up with the idea

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.340
that I would record a track.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.210
Because it was just too painful
to just get this one image.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:51.510
Now the trick is they make
players that cost $10.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:55.650
What do they know
that I don't know?

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.230
So here I am with a
$70,000 research microscope

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.860
having a difficult time
getting the bits off.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:07.070
How do they make a
CD player for $10?

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.499
Just for fun, I did the
same thing with a DVD.

00:35:09.499 --> 00:35:11.790
After I figured out how to
do the immersion microscopy,

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.840
I figured I'd at least--
so this is a DVD done

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.800
with the same sort of thing.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.810
So how do they do it?

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.250
They do very clever things.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.265
The first trick they
use is interference.

00:35:23.265 --> 00:35:25.560
So I talked about
interference last time

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.510
with our standing wave
illumination microscope.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.400
They do interference.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.221
So I told you that this is
polycarbonate with an aluminum

00:35:36.221 --> 00:35:36.720
coding.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.930
The aluminum is actually
working like a mirror.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.380
And that's the intent.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:46.780
So they don't actually try
to code block and white.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.090
What they try to
code is distance.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.250
So the idea is that
you take a laser beam,

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:55.240
and you out reflect
it off of the CD much

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.580
like it reflects off a mirror.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:03.260
And then the features
that were embossed

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.420
are at different depths.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.000
And the depth's chosen
very specifically

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.250
to be lambda over 4, the
wavelength of the light.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:15.290
They use a 700 nanometer laser.

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:24.290
And the features are
offset by lambda over 4.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.410
The idea is that--

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:32.730
so if you have a
feature, and you have--

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:40.120
so you compare, what would be
the timing for this laser beam

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.106
if it struck the mirror?

00:36:42.106 --> 00:36:43.480
You compare that
to what it would

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.250
be if it struck a feature.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:48.790
And you rig it so
that those two times

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.610
are different by lambda
over 2, lambda over 4 in,

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:56.140
and lambda over four out.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:02.830
So then if you rig the beam
to be half of the light

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:08.190
falls on both, what's the
sum of these waveforms

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:13.240
going to be if you
have a component that's

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.630
at the mirror and a
component at the indented?

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:19.810
If these are different in
timing by lambda over 2

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:22.240
when you add them,
the answer is?

00:37:25.138 --> 00:37:26.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.550
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yeah, you
get complete destructive

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.091
interference.

00:37:28.091 --> 00:37:29.950
You get an out answer of 0.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:31.780
So the idea in the
reading of them

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.530
is to use interference
and rig it

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:40.380
so that 0s are
represented by no light

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.780
and 1s are represented
by lots of light.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:48.910
So that's the first
clever trick they do.

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:52.540
Then the question is,
how do you focus it?

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:56.470
When I was doing my research
microscope, the research

00:37:56.470 --> 00:38:00.730
microscope-- and first off, it
sits on a half ton of granite

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.050
to make it all very stable.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.530
Because when you're
doing the focusing,

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.360
you don't want--
so the vibrations

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:13.230
of the floor in my lab
are about 100 micrometers.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.920
So it's about 100 micrometers.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.160
And I have to have the stability
of the system sub-micron.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.060
So I use a table made out
of a half ton of granite.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.890
And the microscope
sits on top of that.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.370
And that makes everything
nice and stable.

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:29.150
They can't do that.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.470
So how do they control the
focus without using a half--

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.470
I mean, it wouldn't work
to make a Walkman that

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.620
is a half ton granite, right?

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.560
So what do they
do to enable them

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.430
to do the same kind of
focusing that I was doing?

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.050
They use feedback.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:52.480
So the idea is to substitute
feedback for precision.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.210
So rather than trying to
make the parts precise,

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:59.900
they put the imprecise
parts in a feedback loop--

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:03.210
very powerful method.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:04.610
So here's what they do.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:05.990
They take the laser.

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:09.030
It's trying to focus on to the
CD that has patterns in it.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.850
And so there's a beam splitter,
so that part of the light

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:18.150
goes over to the detector.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.650
Excuse me.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:19.660
I didn't do that right.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.520
The laser, it
squirts up to here,

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.380
goes straight through
the beam splitter,

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.660
comes back through
a focusing lens,

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.910
bounces off the beam splitter
through another lens,

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.930
and hits a detector.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:32.170
So the detector is this way.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:33.462
And I'm showing this view then.

00:39:33.462 --> 00:39:34.795
So the detector should be there.

00:39:34.795 --> 00:39:36.280
I'm sharing a view
of it over here.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.760
And it's rigged, so
that these two lenses--

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.720
one of the lenses is spherical
and one is cylindrical.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.330
What that means is--

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:48.260
you remember I've talked
about microscopy in the past.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.530
Out of focus means blurred.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:55.080
Blurred for a spot means bigger.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:01.100
As a microscope goes out of
focus, the spot gets bigger.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.230
What you do with
these two lenses--

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.870
because one is
circularly symmetric,

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.210
and the other is
slenderly symmetrical,

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:13.010
what you do is you make
the beam in this direction

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:17.538
go out of focus as it's going
into focus in this direction.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:28.410
So because you get two lenses,
one is symmetric in xy.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:33.690
And one has no magnification in
y, but big magnification in x.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:37.620
You can rig it so that
this dot will go out

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:45.230
of focus horizontally while it's
coming into focus vertically.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:53.070
The result is that, if you move
the CD closer, it becomes fat.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:57.640
And if you move the CD
further, it becomes skinny.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:03.070
So all they need to do,
then, is focus up and down

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.080
until the dot is
as close to being

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.120
circular as they can get it.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.370
That's why they use
a quadrant detector.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:14.100
So the quadrant detector
lets them calculate

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.140
a plus c minus b plus d.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.140
And you would like
that answer to be 0.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.280
So now you use
that as your error.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.620
They use the light that
hits this quadrant detector

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.530
to compute this number,
put that in a feedback loop

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:34.160
that drives the stage
up and down to focus.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.410
So here's an ancient CD.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.350
The CD would be here.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:42.140
Here is the reading lens.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.490
Here is a platform that has
an electromagnet under it that

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.335
will move it up and
down 100 microns.

00:41:54.410 --> 00:42:00.240
So this electromagnet
is under the stage.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.760
So this whole thing
goes up and down

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.570
in a feedback loop that
tries to make this error

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:12.090
signal be 0, tries to make the
pattern circularly symmetric.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:15.210
So it's extremely clever.

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:21.430
Then you have this pattern.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.470
So the light is twice as big.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:26.650
Half the photons are
supposed to fit in the pit.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.210
And half of the
photons are supposed

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:32.290
to hit in the land
that surrounds the pit,

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:44.190
so that as the CD is spinning,
if the spot illuminates

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.260
a place that's
entirely in the pit,

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.640
the dot is small
because of interference.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.190
And if it hits a place
that doesn't have a pit,

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:56.930
the dot is large, because
there's no interference.

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:58.340
But then you have
the problem of,

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:04.860
how do you keep the dot reading
the center of the groove?

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.080
So in this technology,
we kept the dot

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.040
in the center of the
groove by using gravity.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.560
We obviously don't want
to touch that surface.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.300
So that's not the
technology we use.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.210
We don't use a screw.

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.065
We use feedback.

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:27.420
So here what we do, instead
of projecting a single dot,

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.700
we use a beam
splitter that turns

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.880
the one dot into three dots.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.100
And the three dots
are positioned

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.970
so that they hit two
more photo sensors, one

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:42.520
on each side of the
main photo center.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.560
And the idea is that, if the
light is perfectly centered

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.810
on a track, these will
have equal brightness.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:56.490
But now if the beam is off
center, one of the dots

00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:00.600
will be bright, because
it hit all land, compared

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.070
to the other one, which some of
the light is hitting the pit.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:09.340
So this is just like the
head tracking thing in 601.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:13.720
So whichever of the two photo
sensors gets more light,

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.120
you move the track to
compensate for that.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.910
So it all works in
a feedback loop.

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:27.380
So the idea here is
the same sort of deal.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.910
You have two sensors here.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:33.940
And you use the error, which is
the difference between the two,

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.260
to move the head to the track.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.120
And the head motion is
this thing over here.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.210
So here's a rack and pinion
connected up to a motor.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.680
And so you have that
motor servo-ed back

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:50.630
to some photo sensors over here
that keep the beam centered.

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:59.210
So the idea, then, is
that what you get for $10

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:02.780
to read this thing is
completely remarkable.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:07.010
The idea is that it's got very
complicated servo mechanisms

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:11.480
that can read very small
things that even a $70,000

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.960
microscope has trouble reading.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.130
And it's stable.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.980
And you can run them, or
you can jostle them around,

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.660
and jog with them.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.650
And that's all because they use
feedback, rather than trying

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.170
to make precision machining.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:30.770
And then they make the
signals robust by using

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:34.065
the kind of DT signal
processing that we talked about.

00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:36.290
So anyway, the point
of today was just

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:40.010
to give it some motivation
of the way 6.003 factors

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.380
into technologies that you
might be interested in.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.680
And this is just one example.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.150
I could have chosen any
number of different devices

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:49.020
and they would
have been similar.

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.960
So I hope you
enjoyed the course.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.060
I hope that you have
fun with the final.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:58.100
Please come on
Tuesday, and tell us

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.630
what we should do
differently next time.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.180
Thanks.
