DENNIS FREEMAN:
Hello and welcome.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.627
Today, we're starting the
second half of the class.

00:00:30.627 --> 00:00:32.210
In the second half
of the class, we'll

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.330
focus on methods that
will generally be

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.480
described as Fourier methods.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.060
And those methods revolve
around thinking about signals

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.719
as being sums of sine waves.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.260
So we've previously
thought about how

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.030
you can think about a
system by thinking about how

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.690
it responds to sine waves.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.630
So this is closely related.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.130
Now, instead of
thinking about a system

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.570
by how it processes
these sine waves.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.230
Rather, we'll
think about signals

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.166
as being composed of sine waves.

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.290
So that's sort of the idea.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.660
And today, we'll do
the very simplest kind

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.380
of representation, which
is a Fourier series.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.320
The importance of that's going
to be our first encounter

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.850
with how you can think
about complicated signals

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.980
as sums of sines and cosines.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.840
But also, we'll get
a new representation

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.000
for a system that
will be generally

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.430
useful called a filter.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.140
So that's the two
agenda items for today.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.090
Roughly, the first half
is on the Fourier series

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.370
representations for a signal.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.460
The second half is on
thinking about systems

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.540
as filters, which is a direct
consequence of the first.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.480
So the first idea is
just, why should we

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.610
even think that you
can think about signals

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.020
in terms of sine waves?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.200
Well, there's very
simple examples of that.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.440
Some signals are just very
naturally described that way.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.699
One class of those are the ones
whose entire frequency content

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.120
are harmonics.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.180
Just a bit of jargon, we'll
think about harmonics of omega

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.020
0, harmonics of some frequency.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.110
Say, 1 kilohertz.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.740
Then we'll have
the first harmonic.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.860
That's another name
for the fundamental.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.440
That's 1 kilohertz, for example.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.810
Second harmonic would
be some component

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.020
at twice the frequency.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.790
Third harmonic, three
times the frequency.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.730
0-th harmonic for
the completely--

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.890
so for no good
reason at all, we'll

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.370
call them 0-th
harmonic the DC term,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.530
meaning Direct Current,
which is neither direct

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.360
nor has anything
to do with current.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.910
But we will use that jargon
because everybody else does.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.250
So that's just jargon.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.340
What I want to think about
though at a deeper level is,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.780
what kinds of signals
should we expect

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.820
have a good
representation in terms

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.770
of sums of sines and cosines?

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.060
And one very easy kind of
signal that you can think about

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.450
is signals that we associate
with musical instruments.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.330
So think about the sounds that
these instruments generate.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.189
And I'll play some audio.

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.730
And while I'm playing
it, what you're

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.354
supposed to be doing
is thinking about,

00:03:22.354 --> 00:03:26.700
what's the cues that this
sounds like a sum of harmonics?

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.670
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.160
So using the things that we'll
go over today in lecture,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.410
I can write a Python
program, which

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.500
I did, to analyze
each of those sounds

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.050
to expose its
harmonic structure.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.400
And here's the results.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.470
So for k equals 0, DC1,
the fundamental, 2,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.990
the second harmonic, third
harmonic, fourth harmonic.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.990
The lengths of the bars
represent the magnitudes,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.329
how much energy--

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.019
well, roughly energy.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.750
How much signal is
present at those harmonic

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.040
frequencies as a function of
harmonic number k for each

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.900
of the different instruments?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.580
And just like the time wave
forms have a signature,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.090
there was a
characteristic shape.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.590
In fact, if I go on, here
is the characteristic shape.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.000
That's an actual wave form
taken from the audio clip

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.590
that I played.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.750
That's a clip from the piano.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.580
This is a clip of the same
time duration from the violin.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.810
A clip of the same time
duration from the bassoon.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.520
And here are the
harmonic structures

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.380
for those different sounds.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.290
And you can see the harmonic
structures look very different.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.800
So not much DC.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.920
A fair amount of
fundamental, a lot of second.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.290
A lot of fundamental,
not too much second.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.970
Not much fundamental.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.350
That's kind of interesting.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.270
The bassoon is
special in this class

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.280
because there's not
much fundamental,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.650
but there's a lot of second.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.680
So now, think about
comparing these two

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.850
and listen to them again.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.778
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.666
So what I want you to
try to think about--

00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:49.020
and it's kind of hard.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.970
Think about how it is that the
harmonic structure is playing

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.470
a role in determining
the timbre of the sound

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.610
that you're hearing.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.300
OK.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.720
So that's kind of
the motivation.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.930
Another motivation is that
thinking about signals

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.580
in terms of their
harmonic structure

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.820
can provide important
insights into the signals.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.230
And so for example in music,
the harmonic structure

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.690
is what determines
consonance and dissonance.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.570
Dissonance.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:29.090
So I'm going to play
two different notes that

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.930
are related by an octave
shift, by a fifth shift,

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.140
and adjacent notes in
the semitone scale.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.610
And below it, I've illustrated
the harmonic structure

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.030
for the D and for D prime.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.530
OK.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.610
So an octave above means
that the first harmonic,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.410
the fundamental of
this guy, corresponds

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.110
to the second
harmonic of this guy.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.720
The second to the
fourth, et cetera.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.130
There's some relationship for
the fifths illustrated here.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.600
And there's a different
relationship here.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.900
So what I want you to do
is to hear the difference

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.810
between those six sounds.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.090
And again, think about not
only the time waveform,

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.323
but also how their
harmonics relate.

00:07:17.323 --> 00:07:20.774
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.190
So dissonance has something
to do-- well, consonance

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.164
has something to
do with the overlap

00:07:48.164 --> 00:07:49.830
of the harmonic
structure and dissonance

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.630
has something to do
with the lack of overlap

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.280
of the harmonic content.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.850
So the point just being that
we can get some mileage out

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.880
of thinking about
signals according

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.490
to their harmonic decomposition.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.769
So that's kind of
the introduction.

00:08:08.769 --> 00:08:10.060
How should we think about that?

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.650
What kinds of signals
ought to be representable

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.550
by their harmonic structure?

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.050
OK.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.300
Well if you just draw a
picture in a time domain

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.270
and think about a
fundamental, what would it

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.827
look like in the time domain?

00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:26.160
What would the signal look like?

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.710
What would the second
harmonic look like?

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:34.299
Well, that's a signal whose
frequency is twice as big.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:37.850
If the frequency is twice as
big, the period is half as big.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.880
So there's now two periods of
the blue guy in the same time

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.020
interval as one
period of the red guy.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.040
So the relationship of
frequencies in the harmonics

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.910
has a relationship in time.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.860
It's inversely proportional.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.640
OK.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.370
So if you think about
fundamental, second, third,

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.140
fourth, fifth.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.240
Fundamental, second,
third, fourth, fifth.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:10.270
There's a relationship
in time of the periods.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.190
And one thing that
should be clear

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:17.590
is that these harmonics are
all periodic in the period

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.480
of the fundamental.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.490
So one thing that
you can think about,

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.860
by thinking about the time
representation of what

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.860
harmonic signals ought to
look like, periodic signals

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.070
are sort of our only candidates.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.120
All of the harmonics
of a fundamental

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.300
will have the same--

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.990
are periodic in capital T,
the period of the fundamental.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.760
So it's going to
be hard to generate

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.610
a signal by a sum
of harmonics that

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.580
doesn't have that periodicity.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.120
So we should be expecting a
relationship between signals

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.660
that can be represented
by a sum of harmonics

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.230
and periodic signals.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.640
So we would not expect
an aperiodic signal

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.770
to be represented this way.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.170
The counter question
is, should we

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.770
be expecting that all periodic
signals can be represented

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.990
this way, or some
periodic signals,

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.835
or some very special class?

00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:20.600
Is it a big class
or a small class?

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.450
How do we think about that?

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.850
And historically, that's
been a hard question.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.640
And by the end of the hour, I
hope that you all understand

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.765
why it was a hard question.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.360
People, like Fourier,
you might imagine,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.780
advocated the
notion that you can

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.580
make a meaningful harmonic
representation for a very

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.230
wide class of signals.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.140
Fourier claimed,
basically, everything.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.080
Anything that was periodic
could be represented

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.210
in terms of a sum of harmonics.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.390
Other people thought
that was preposterous.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.950
In a widely reported
public rebuke of Fourier,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.010
Lagrange said,
this is ridiculous,

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:09.330
because every harmonic is a
continuous function of time.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.250
And you can easily
manufacture a periodic signal

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.510
that's a discontinuous
function of time.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.540
So for example, a square wave.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.610
How on earth are you--

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.090
Lagrange, how on earth
would you represent

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.640
a discontinuous function by a
sum of continuous functions?

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.130
That makes no sense.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:34.900
So what we will want to do
in the course of the hour

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.730
is think about, does that
or doesn't that make sense?

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.320
And it will turn out the
answer is kind of complicated.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.000
And so we can sort
of forgive both sides

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.580
for having sort of
argued with each other

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.790
because the answer is
not completely obvious.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.890
For the time being, I'm
going to just assume

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:55.830
that the answer is yes,
that it makes sense

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.790
to try to make a harmonic
representation of a signal that

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.200
might even be discontinuous.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.190
I'm going to assume
periodic, let's try.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.350
And the question will be,
does that make any sense?

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.520
So there's a little bit of math.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.960
There's a mathematical
foundation

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.220
that makes understanding these
Fourier series very easy.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.380
The idea has two parts.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:26.650
First off, if you have a
sinusoidally-varying signal

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:32.110
here at frequency k omega
0, the k-th harmonic.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.910
If you were to multiply
the k-th harmonic

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:40.880
times the l-th harmonic, a
signal of frequency k omega 0

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.790
times a signal of
frequency l omega 0,

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.200
you get a new harmonic,
the k plus l-th one.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.500
That's a simple property
of the way the product

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.540
of two exponents--

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.850
you add the exponents
when you take the product

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.190
of two exponentials.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.230
OK.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.990
So that makes it very easy to
think about harmonic structure

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.860
because there's a simple
relationship for generating

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.370
one harmonic signal in
time from another harmonic

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.190
signal in time.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.010
The second thing
that makes harmonics

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.950
easy to think about
mathematically

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.940
is that if you integrate
over a period--

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.696
we'll do this so often that
we'll abbreviate it this way.

00:13:23.696 --> 00:13:25.570
Because if you have a
signal that's periodic,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.550
it really doesn't
matter which period you

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.920
choose to do the integral over.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.670
If you had a signal that was
periodic in, say, capital T,

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.035
and integrated it between 0
and T. And if it's periodic,

00:13:36.035 --> 00:13:37.660
you should be able
to shift that window

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.810
anywhere you like and you
should get the same thing.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:46.450
So we'll not worry about whether
it goes from 0 to capital T

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.397
or from 1 to capital T plus 1.

00:13:49.397 --> 00:13:50.480
We won't worry about that.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.680
We'll just say integrate
over the period T.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:00.430
If you integrate over the
period T any harmonic signal,

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.800
then there's only
two possible answers.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.750
So if you integrate
e to the jk omega

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:12.690
0 T over one period
of omega 0, there

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.310
will be k periods in there.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.490
So if k is a number
other than 0,

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.050
you'll have complete
periods of a sine wave.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.010
So the answer of the
integral, the average value

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.310
over that period, is 0.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.190
The only time you'll ever
get something that's non-zero

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.130
is if k were 0.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:40.640
If k were 0, if it were
DC, then e to the 0 is 1.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.400
The integral of 1 over a period,
regardless of what period

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.650
you pick up, the integral
of 1 over a period

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.180
is capital T. So two things.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.600
It's easy to figure
out the product

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.100
of two harmonic signals.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.690
It's just the
different harmonic.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.320
And integrals over
a period are easy.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.830
With that basis, then
it's easy to say how--

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.610
let's imagine that some
arbitrary periodic signal,

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.940
which we can always write this
way, x of t, if it's periodic,

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.230
could also be written x of
t plus capital T if x of t

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:18.340
is periodic in capital T. Let's
assume that that can be written

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.930
as a sum of harmonics.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.260
So a sum-- k equals
minus infinity

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:30.629
to infinity of some amount
of e to the j omega 0 kt.

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:32.170
Why do I have the
minus k's in there?

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.910
OK.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.295
I've asked this question
about six times.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.001
Why do I have the
minus k's in there?

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.871
Yeah.

00:15:48.871 --> 00:15:51.677
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:51.677 --> 00:15:52.760
DENNIS FREEMAN: Precisely.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.720
We like Euler's equation.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.320
We like complex numbers.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.930
We don't like cosine and sines.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.930
And we can convert
sines and cosines

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.410
into complex exponentials
using Euler's formula

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.110
and everything's very easy.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.120
So we use minus k
for the same reason

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.030
that we used minus omega in
previous representations.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.320
So imagine that we
can write x of t,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.710
some generic periodic signal,
as a sum of harmonics.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:27.170
Then, let's use those principles
that we talked about before.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.390
If that can be
represented as a sum,

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.920
I can sift out the
one of interest

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:38.252
by multiplying x of t times
e to the minus jl omega 0.

00:16:38.252 --> 00:16:40.210
We'll see in a minute
what I mean by "sift out"

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.600
and why I'm using
minus instead of plus.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.600
If you were to run this
integral over a period--

00:16:48.227 --> 00:16:50.810
and imagine for the moment that
all the sums are well-behaved,

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.820
so nothing explodes.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.560
And so all the convergence
issues are trivial.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.630
If the convergence
issues were trivial,

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:01.250
then I could swap the
sum and the integral.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.000
If I did that, then I would
end up with a sum of a bunch

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.829
of different k's.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:10.119
But for each one,
I'd be taking some--

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:14.930
the k-th harmonic times
the minus l-th harmonic.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.579
And that's going to give me 0
when I integrate over a period,

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:21.980
except when k equals l.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.990
If k equals l, then I'm
going to get capital T.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:32.760
So the net effect of doing
this is to generate T a l.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.830
It sifts out one of
those coefficients.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.410
Well, that's nice.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:43.550
That means that if I assume I
can write the signal this way,

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:48.820
then I can sift out
the k-th coefficient

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:54.300
by integrating against
minus the k-th and divide

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.040
by T because of
the normalization.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.820
Because if you integrate 1 over
a period, you get capital T.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.350
And that tells me then
that if this were true,

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.123
this is how you'd
find the coefficient.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:15.030
So that leads to what we call
a set of analysis and synthesis

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.570
equations.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:22.910
So that if x can be represented
this way, if we can synthesize

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.767
a periodic signal x
by adding together

00:18:25.767 --> 00:18:28.100
a bunch of harmonic components
with a suitable weighting

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.600
factor.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.130
The weighting factor
a sub k certainly

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.830
has a different magnitude,
just like those musical tones

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.110
that I played at the
beginning, those musical notes.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.450
All of the different k's
had different amplitudes.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.783
They also have different phases.

00:18:39.783 --> 00:18:41.540
The a sub k can be
a complex number.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.810
We like complex numbers.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.770
Complex numbers are easy.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:52.040
So if we can represent
x by a sum of harmonics,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.970
complex valued.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.410
So weighted by a
complex number, then we

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:02.420
can sift out what those
weight factors were by running

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.540
the analysis equation.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.530
We can analyze the
signal to figure out

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.240
how much of the k-th
component is there.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:19.010
So the strategy then is
assume that all works.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.590
That is to say, let's
talk an ugly signal

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.330
of the type that
caused controversy back

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.460
in the mid-1800s.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.250
Let's take a controversial
signal like a square wave,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.050
assume it all works,
and figure out what

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.180
the ak's would have had to be.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.000
And then we'll figure out
whether that made any sense.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.880
So if this thing were to
be represented by a Fourier

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.650
series, by a sum of harmonic
components, how many of these

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:52.180
statements would be true about
those harmonic amplitudes?

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.490
So as you start to write,
look toward your neighbor

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.590
and say hi.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.210
Then, write and
figure out the answer.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:06.695
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:14.390
OK.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.510
So how many of those
statements are true?

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:21.440
Raise your hand with a number
of fingers between 0 and 5

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.340
would seem good limits.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.800
How many statements are true?

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.190
OK, we've got about 40% correct.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.870
So that's a little under half.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.774
What do I do first?

00:22:34.774 --> 00:22:36.440
If I want to figure
this out, what would

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.510
I do to try to figure out--

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.240
so statement 1, a sub
k is 0 if k is even.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.650
Should that be true or false?

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.843
How do I think about that?

00:22:44.843 --> 00:22:46.807
Yeah.

That sounds good.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.600

then that would mess up
the oddness [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.040
DENNIS FREEMAN: So I might
want to have only odd terms.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:19.610
How many terms in the Fourier
decomposition are odd and even?

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.080
What is the Fourier
decomposition?

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.570
So let's start by just writing
some definition, right?

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:28.370
So I want to say
that x of t is--

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.870
let's see.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:29.950
I have a period of 1.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:34.210
That's the same as x
of t plus 1, right?

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.680
And I want to write this as
some sort of a Fourier thing.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.140
So what do I write next?

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.900
I want to say that this
signal can be represented

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.600
by some sum of something.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.730
And I'm going to have
to put some weights in.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.490
And I'm going to want something
like e to the minus j 2 pi

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:01.105
kt by T, something like that.

00:24:01.105 --> 00:24:02.980
And I'm going to need
a whole bunch of these.

00:24:05.487 --> 00:24:06.820
Where does even and odd show up?

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:19.480
So if I were to rewrite
this as sines and cosines.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.570
So I could rewrite this in terms
of some sines and some cosines.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.860
Then, the decomposition
into even and odd is easier.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.540
That's correct.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.890
So let's get back to this one.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.050
How do I think about
this one, though?

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.780
So I want k to be even.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.390
What does k even correspond to?

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:44.090
OK.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.410
Let's assume I don't
know what k even.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.940
How do I do this if I
don't know anything?

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.410
How do I just grunt through it?

00:24:54.358 --> 00:24:54.858
Yeah.

00:24:54.858 --> 00:24:55.860
AUDIENCE: Just do the integral.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.776
DENNIS FREEMAN: Just do
the integral, exactly.

00:24:57.776 --> 00:25:02.550
So what I'd like to do is
say that a sub k is 1--

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.860
so assuming everything works.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.630
Assuming everything
works, then a sub k

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:11.220
should be the integral over t
weighted by 1 over t, x of t

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:18.750
e to the minus j 2 pi kt over T.
I should have put a plus there.

00:25:21.627 --> 00:25:23.460
I want the minus sign
in one of the formulas

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.300
and not in the other one.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.160
OK.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.380
And if you just think about that
integral, it's not very hard.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.480
So I want this kind of thing.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.025
Capital T is 1.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.560
So I get two pieces,
the piece that

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.570
corresponds to the minus
a 1/2 and plus 1/2.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.551
And when I integrate them, I get
something that's a little bit--

00:25:45.551 --> 00:25:46.050
well, no.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.508
It's pretty
straightforward, right?

00:25:47.508 --> 00:25:50.320
So you integrate this
thing, the 1 over minus--

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.740
and so the minus j 2 pi
k flips into the bottom.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.460
The 1/2 turns it into j 4
pi k-- blah, blah, blah.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.000
You get four pieces.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.280
These two pieces
correspond to 1.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.600
They sum to 2.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.610
So you get that.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:15.020
The point is that it's a
pretty simple transformation

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.740
to think about the
square wave turning

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.570
into a sequence of amplitudes.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.480
So if you choose--

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.015
let's see.

00:26:27.015 --> 00:26:30.350
So if you choose k
to be even, then I've

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:34.435
got an integer multiple of 2 pi.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.030
If k were even,
then I would have

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.700
an integer multiple of 2 pi.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.890
e to the integer multiple
of 2 pi flips around to 1.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.682
As does the minus 1.

00:26:48.682 --> 00:26:51.660
That kills this stuff.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.060
OK.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.200
So that's where the k
even and k odd comes from.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.890
So the point is that
there's a simple way

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:04.680
to just crank through it and
we get a simple representation.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:14.847
So we get that ak is 1 over
j pi k, k odd, 0 otherwise.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.310
OK.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.840
And then we can just sort of
run down through the list.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.590
We'll see in a minute why this
particular list of properties

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:24.790
is interesting.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.230
So a sub k is 0 if k is even?

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.730
Yep.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.720
ak is real?

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.840
Nope, there's a j in it.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.920
ak magnitude decreases
with k square?

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.420
Nope.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.450
Decreases with k.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.360
There's an infinite
number of non-zero terms?

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.960
Yup.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.312
k goes to infinity.

00:27:49.312 --> 00:27:50.020
All of the above?

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.730
Obviously not.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:55.450
The point is it's simple
to do and you end up

00:27:55.450 --> 00:28:06.270
representing the time waveform
by just a sequence of numbers.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.950
How big is the fundamental?

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.270
How big is the second harmonic?

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:13.170
How big is the third
harmonic, et cetera.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:17.130
There's some more math that
makes things even easier.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:22.600
There are ways of thinking
about operations in time

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.860
as equivalent
operations in harmonics.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.310
That makes the idea
even more powerful

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.120
because what we
are developing is

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.300
an alternative
representation for signals.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.000
The same as we had multiple
representations for systems--

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.180
differential equations, block
diagrams, h of t, h of s,

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.350
h of r, Bode plots, all those
different representations

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:49.940
of systems, this represents
an alternative representation

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.320
of a signal.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.810
We think about it being
represented in time

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.170
or we think about it being
represented in harmonics.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.634
Or eventually, we'll
call that frequency.

00:28:59.634 --> 00:29:01.550
So we'll think about
signals being represented

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.894
in time or frequency.

00:29:02.894 --> 00:29:04.310
And you can think
about operations

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:08.980
in time having a corresponding
operation in frequency.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.520
So illustrated here, if a signal
is differentiated in time,

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:18.340
the Fourier coefficients are
multiplied by j 2 pi over T k.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.690
OK, well that's easy.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.370
If we assume for
the moment that we

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:25.160
can represent x as
this kind of a sum,

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.530
differentiation is linear.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.510
The derivative of a sum is
the sum of the derivatives.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.930
The derivative of
sine wave is easy.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:39.310
And we end up with the idea that
if you knew the a sub k's, then

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:45.460
you can easily formulate
the series representation

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.250
for the harmonic
structure by just

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.795
multiplying each of the ak's
by the power of the exponent.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.240
OK.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:01.770
So that gives us a way of
thinking about signals in time

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:05.050
as being represented
in frequency.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.520
So here's an
illustration of that.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.250
Imagine that we have a triangle
wave rather than a square wave.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.690
Answer the same questions.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.040
And be aware that it's a trick.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.840
By "trick," I mean you could
use the obvious approach, which

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.520
is the one we just did.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.894
Or you could use some
insight from the last slide

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:30.810
and do it in one step.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.792
So how many of these
statements are true?

00:32:15.792 --> 00:32:17.460
Everybody, raise your hand.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:21.900
Raise the number of
fingers equal to the number

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.370
of correct statements.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.490
We've got complete
switch of who's right.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.450
And still, 40% correct.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.910
That's phenomenal.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.100
So we could just go
through the list.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.995
What's the trick?

00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:38.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.070
DENNIS FREEMAN: So close.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.470
So integral, exactly.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.980
Right.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.644
This signal is the integral
of the previous signal.

00:32:47.644 --> 00:32:49.310
So that means that
we ought to be able--

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.260
there's some kind of
a simple relationship

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.720
between this series
and the series

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.070
that represents that one.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:59.112
What should I do to this one
to make it look like that one?

00:32:59.112 --> 00:33:01.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.790
DENNIS FREEMAN: Divide
by j 2 pi k, precisely.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:11.590
So I can think about the bk's
being the ak's, but then I

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:14.140
have to worry about
the representation

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.640
for differentiation.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.080
Or here, integration in
the frequency domain.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.350
In the frequency
domain, integration

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:25.950
corresponds to
dividing by j 2 pi k.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:33.780
So now, if I think about the
list of questions, is b0 for k

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.280
even?

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.150
Yeah, it was before.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.900
It is now.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.190
Because all we're doing
is changing the weights.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.000
And if the weight
started out 0 and we're

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.416
multiplying by
something, we can't

00:33:44.416 --> 00:33:47.650
get it to be different from 0.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.640
Is it real-valued?

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.710
Well, now it is because
I had a j times j.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.547
So now they are real-valued.

00:33:56.547 --> 00:33:57.880
Does it decrease with k squared?

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.920
Now it does because
I got one of the k's

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.410
from the differentiation
operator and the other k

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.504
from over here.

00:34:04.504 --> 00:34:05.170
Infinite number.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:06.310
Of course, the old one did, too.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.018
All of the above?

00:34:07.018 --> 00:34:08.031
Yes.

00:34:08.031 --> 00:34:08.530
OK.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:12.460
So that was just supposed to
be a simple exercise in how

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:17.530
to run the formulas, how to
do the stuff from a purely

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.940
mechanical point of view.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.620
Now I want to think about
the bigger question.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.260
Does any of this make any sense?

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.670
And the answers were concocted
to help me make sense of that.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.440
The questions, the
check yourselves,

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.500
were concocted so that if we
think about the answer that

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.020
came out, we will
have some insight

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.040
into why we think it works
and why it was controversial

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.100
150 years ago.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.370
So let's do the
simple case first.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.550
Even Lagrange wouldn't have
any trouble with this-- well,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.889
maybe he would have
had a little trouble.

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:55.320
I guess he would have
had a little trouble.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.620
So Lagrange had the
problem with Fourier

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.900
that Fourier was making
these outrageous claims

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.200
that any periodic function
should have a Fourier

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:03.790
decomposition.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.390
And if you have a
discontinuous function,

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:08.580
and if all the basis
functions are continuous,

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.310
how could that make any sense?

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:13.200
This doesn't have
any discontinuities,

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.612
but it does have
slope discontinuities.

00:35:17.612 --> 00:35:19.276
That's sort of the same thing.

00:35:19.276 --> 00:35:20.650
If you have a
slope discontinuity

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.590
and you're trying to make--

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.530
you're trying to represent the
signal by a sum of signals,

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:30.010
none of whom have slope
discontinuities, that's kind

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.960
of the same kind of problem.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.090
One way we can think
about it is to think

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:38.860
about how the approximation
gets better, or fails

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.302
to get better, as we add terms.

00:35:42.302 --> 00:35:43.510
So this is the base function.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:47.020
This is the signal that we would
like to represent harmonically.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:53.380
If we just think about
the first non-zero term,

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.930
the first non-zero term
is the fundamental.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.420
It actually is not bad.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.780
If we were willing to accept
errors about this big,

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.280
it would be OK.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.590
But somehow, it doesn't
capture much triangliness.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.940
It sort of doesn't
look much [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:14.380
So the one term sort of
catches a lot of the deviation,

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.230
but it doesn't capture
the triangle aspect.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.940
If you add another term--

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.940
the next non-zero
term is the third one.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.780
So if you write the sum of the
first term, the k equals 1 term

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:30.420
and the k equals 3 term,
you get this waveform.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.780
Notice that the effect
of that was to creep it

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.390
toward the underlying signal.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:37.830
If you add another term--

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:43.780
5, 7, 9-- it's getting
closer, closer, closer.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.420
19 because I got bored
making the figures,

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.410
so I skipped a bunch.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:52.920
29, because I skipped a bunch.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.500
39.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.880
You can see that
what's happening

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.840
is as we add more and
more of those terms,

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.089
by the time we got up to
number 39, it's pretty good.

00:37:03.089 --> 00:37:05.630
So that probably from your seat,
it's not altogether apparent

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:06.588
that they're different.

00:37:06.588 --> 00:37:08.330
They're still different.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:12.800
But you can see that
there is a sense

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.900
in which the approximation
is converging

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.340
toward the underlying signal.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.150
That's good.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:23.370
So that's a sense
in which there is

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:27.853
a convergence between the signal
and its Fourier representation.

00:37:33.276 --> 00:37:37.310
A different kind of
thing happens here.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.910
Now, let's do the square wave.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:44.500
If we put in the first term
of the Fourier representation,

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.380
which is the fundamental, we
get a sine wave approximation

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.740
which is a little worse
perhaps for a square wave

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.980
than it was for a triangle wave.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:38:02.150
Put in the 3rd, 5th,
7th, 9th, 19th--

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:05.610
so I threw in 5 again--

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.620
29, 39.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.039
It's not doing as well.

00:38:12.039 --> 00:38:13.080
What's not doing as well?

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:24.600
So we go one-term partial sum--

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:30.230
2, 3, 4, 5, 20.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:33.850
10, 15, 20.

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:34.830
Yeah.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:36.300
AUDIENCE: It's
not able to handle

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.115
the really quick transitions.

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:39.740
DENNIS FREEMAN: It's
not able to handle

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.090
the really quick transition.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:43.971
It's kind of like
Lagrange said, right?

00:38:43.971 --> 00:38:46.220
How are you going to make a
discontinuous function out

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.870
of a sum of continuous ones?

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:49.720
It's hard.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.790
In fact, this is
called Gibbs phenomena,

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:56.040
after the guy who
sort of formulated

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.820
the mathematics of this.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.310
Even in the limit, no
matter how many terms

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:08.250
you put into the sum, the worst
case deviation is about 9%.

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.260
You can't get rid of it.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:18.900
So in some sense,
Lagrange is right.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.690
You can't put enough
terms in there

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:25.320
so that it converges everywhere.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.020
So the problem then becomes
that we can't really

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.360
think about convergence in
the familiar ways we like

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.710
to think about convergence.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:35.060
Convergence at a point is not
a good way to think about it.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.370
Because there's always a
point that deviates a lot.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.870
And in fact, in
signal processing

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:46.040
we have lots of other ways
we think about convergence.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.120
So in addition to being
9% overshoot, the Gibbs

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.850
phenomenon, what else
do you see as the trend

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:56.850
as you increase the number
of terms in the partial sum?

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:06.580
In addition to
converging and staying

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.610
sort of the same
height, what else

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:12.720
happened as I added
terms to the partial sum?

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:18.840
It got skinnier.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:26.430
The deviations got crammed
toward the transition point.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:27.900
And if I keep
adding them, they'll

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.840
get crammed more
and more in there.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.610
And it's not like an impulse.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.380
The height didn't get bigger.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.032
The width got smaller.

00:40:37.032 --> 00:40:39.240
Had the height got bigger,
we'd have been in trouble.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.360
Because then we
would have said it

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.940
deviates from the
square wave by having

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.980
an impulse at the transition.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.880
It doesn't have an impulse.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.130
The height's staying the same.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:53.140
The width is smashing towards 0.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:57.450
The energy in that signal is
getting smaller and smaller.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.650
So a different way to
think about convergence

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:03.860
is, how big is the energy
difference between the two

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.060
signals?

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:10.350
In that sense, this converges
and Fourier's right.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:14.280
As you add terms, the energy
difference between the two

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.950
signals goes to 0.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:21.600
That's the modern way of
thinking about the controversy.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.060
There is an issue.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.520
If we choose to think
about convergence

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.950
in terms of energy
difference, then we

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:30.330
can resolve the problem.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:32.970
That's what we'll do.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:36.060
That's the reason in lots of
the things that we talk about,

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.750
we haven't been too worried
about single points being off

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.106
of curves.

00:41:42.106 --> 00:41:43.730
That's come up in
some of the homeworks

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.790
that we don't really
care too much that--

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:50.900
say you have a function that is
1 everywhere except one point.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.900
There's no energy difference
between the signal that differs

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.058
by 1 point and the original.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.990
It has a finite height,
but there's 0 width.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.060
So there's no energy difference.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:07.330
So that's the reason we haven't
been so worried about that

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:11.732
because we use this kind of
a definition of equality.

00:42:11.732 --> 00:42:14.190
They're equal if there's no
energy difference between them.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.900
And using that kind of a way
of thinking about things,

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.740
we get to write
Fourier decompositions,

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.980
harmonic decompositions,
for a wide range of signals.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.360
Not all of them, right?

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.980
Fourier exaggerated.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.560
But for a wide range of signals.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.970
In fact, the definition
we will typically use,

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:41.690
is signals with finite energy
we'll be able to do this.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.540
So now what I want to do is
the last part of this lecture,

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.885
I want to introduce how
thinking about a signal in terms

00:42:47.885 --> 00:42:49.510
of its harmonic
structure lets us think

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:53.940
about systems differently.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.300
So here, the idea
is we previously

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.420
thought about systems
as frequency responses.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.270
In a frequency response, we
use the eigenfunction property.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.270
You put in an eigenfunction, one
of these complex exponentials.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:07.040
You get out the same
complex exponential

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.040
if the system is
linear time invariant.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.555
And the eigenvalue is the
value of the system function

00:43:12.555 --> 00:43:14.180
evaluated at the
frequency of interest.

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.570
We've done that before.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:19.450
The neat thing that happens if
you think about Fourier series

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.430
is that you can
break down the input

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:26.270
into a sum of discrete parts.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.780
The first harmonic, the 0-th
harmonic, the second harmonic,

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:29.710
the third harmonic.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:34.510
And now, each one of those
parts was an eigenfunction.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:38.740
And each one of those parts
gets preferentially amplified

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:43.810
and/or time-delayed according
to the frequency response

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:46.820
idea for the system.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.180
That lets us think about
the effect of a system

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.460
is to filter the input.

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:59.810
The idea in a filter is
that systems do not--

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:01.910
LTI systems, Linear
Time Invariant systems--

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:03.951
the same kind of systems
that we've been thinking

00:44:03.951 --> 00:44:05.060
about all along so far.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.778
Linear time invariant systems
cannot create new frequencies.

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.660
If you put some
frequency in, that's

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.690
the frequency that comes out.

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:19.500
We've already seen that when we
talk about frequency response.

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.815
They can only scale the
magnitude and shift the phase.

00:44:22.815 --> 00:44:24.907
They can't make new
frequencies all they can do

00:44:24.907 --> 00:44:26.490
is change the amplitude
and the phase.

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:29.890
And that's a very interesting
way to think about a system.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.340
Think about a low-pass filter.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.980
Think about a system
whose input is little vi

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.900
and whose output is little vo.

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.192
You all know how to characterize
that a gazillion ways.

00:44:39.192 --> 00:44:41.733
You would know how to write a
differential equation for that.

00:44:41.733 --> 00:44:42.680
Nod your head yes.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.730
Yes, yes, yes?

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:46.230
You would know how to write
that as a differential equation.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.580
You'd be able to write
a system function.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.830
You'd be able to do a frequency
response, a Bode plot,

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:52.410
all those sorts of things.

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.790
That's fine.

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:58.770
What I want to do is think
about it instead as a filter.

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.590
So imagine the Bode plot.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.680
The Bode plot is good, right?

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.900
So imagine the Bode
plot representation

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.080
for the RC low-pass filter.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.950
So the RC low-pass
filter has a single pole.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.410
The pole is at the
frequency 1 over RC.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.740
Minus 1 over RC.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.070
Bode plot looks like so.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:23.610
Magnitude has an asymptote
at low frequencies

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:24.510
that is a constant.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.540
At high frequencies, it's
sloping with minus 1.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:31.670
Or, as we would say,
minus 20 dB per decade.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:33.597
And it has some sort
of phase response.

00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:34.930
Low frequencies, the phase is 0.

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:39.120
High frequencies, the
phase lags by pi over 2.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.750
But now, let's think about
exciting it with a square wave.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.750
Square wave is what we've
been thinking about.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:51.450
Square wave has a harmonic
structure that falls with k.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:58.800
So if we represent k equals
1, 3, 5, 7, 9 on a log scale,

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.110
falling with k is
a linear slope.

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:04.980
So this linear decrease
in amplitude height

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.190
is the reciprocal over here.

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:10.970
It's the idea of a log, right?

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:13.310
So we can represent the
signal, the square wave,

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:16.920
by this amplitude spectrum.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.480
How big are the
components at all

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.500
of the different frequencies?

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.375
Well, there's only a
discrete number of them.

00:46:21.375 --> 00:46:23.550
There's the k equals 1
one, the k equals 3 one,

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:25.320
the k equals 5 one, et cetera.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.270
Each one represented
by a straight line.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:30.830
And they all have phase of minus
pi over 2 because of the j.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:38.030
Now, if you were to
choose the base frequency

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:47.200
for the square wave so that
2 pi over capital T omega 0

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:52.880
is small compared to
the cutoff frequency

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.400
for the low-pass
filter, what would

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:04.380
be the effect on these
amplitudes of this filter?

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.880
Well, the magnitude is 1.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.360
So if you go to arbitrarily
low frequencies,

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.580
the magnitude is
arbitrarily close to 1.

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.730
If the phase is arbitrarily
close to pi over 2,

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:15.480
what would happen?

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:20.910
Excuse me, the phase would
be arbitrarily close to 0.

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:21.570
Sorry.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.920
I'm supposed to be going
to very low frequencies.

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.540
If I go to very low
frequencies, the phase is 0.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.850
If the amplitude is
arbitrary close to 1,

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.860
the phase is
arbitrarily close to 0.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.557
And if the input is represented
by the red lines, what's

00:47:34.557 --> 00:47:35.640
the output represented by?

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:42.420
Same red lines, right?

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:46.010
Each red line is
multiplied by 1 at angle 0.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:51.290
So the output has the
same shape as the input.

00:47:54.370 --> 00:48:00.730
If, however, I shift the
period to be shorter,

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:04.620
so that omega 0
is higher, then I

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.050
can have some of the
higher frequencies

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:12.070
fall into the region
of sloping magnitude.

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.340
I can have some of the
phases fall into the region

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.480
where the phase is
minus pi over 2.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.030
The way to think about
it is the fundamental

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:26.380
is still going through the place
with unity gain phase of 0.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.080
The basic shape is determined
by the fundamental.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.390
The basic shape comes through.

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:34.610
But now the high frequencies
are being altered

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:37.130
and their phase relationship
is being altered.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:41.360
And that's why the
shape is different.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.110
If you go to still
higher frequencies,

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:48.560
more of the components
are filtered.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.650
Each component gets sent
through the frequency response.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:54.290
And its amplitude and phase
are modified appropriately.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.680
And if you go to extremely
high frequencies,

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:03.670
then all of the
magnitudes are multiplied

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:05.800
by this sloping down line.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.340
We turn k convergence-- we
turn the reciprocal in k

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:11.770
into a reciprocal on k squared.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:15.650
Where have we seen that before?

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:20.000
That was the decomposition
for the triangle wave.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.450
So the answer comes out
looking like a triangle wave.

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:27.560
The point being that
in addition to thinking

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.130
about how the system works in
terms of feeding frequencies

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:31.550
through it, now
we think about how

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:36.460
signals work by breaking
them up into frequency parts.

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.370
And the whole system
then is reduced to,

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:43.010
how does the system
modify that component?

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:44.920
So that gives rise to
the idea of thinking

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.490
about the system as a filter.

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:50.830
LTI systems do not
generate new frequencies.

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.200
All they do is modify
the amplitude and phase

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.550
of existing frequencies.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:57.100
If you enumerate all of
the existing frequencies,

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.960
you can just go
through them one by one

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.700
and figure out
how they come out.

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.062
And that's an equivalent way of
thinking about an LTI system.

00:50:04.062 --> 00:50:05.770
And that's the kind
of a focus that we'll

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:09.100
use in the remaining
part of the course.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.350
OK,
