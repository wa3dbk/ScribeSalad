00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.270
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.570
We are on the finish line.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.610
Two more weeks to go.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.740
Our last chapter is coherence,
and I can promise you

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.390
this chapter of coherence
has some highlights,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.030
so we are not going to
and more boring subject.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.950
Actually, some of
the best subjects,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.000
some of the most exciting
topics are still to come.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.780
So today, we continue our
discussion of coherence.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.240
As I pointed out
last week, we first

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.480
talk about coherence
in single atoms

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.040
and then coherence
between atoms.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.150
In the first part
on coherence, I

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.460
want to come back to this
topic of spontaneous emission,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.120
because many of us have
deep rooted misconceptions

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.040
about what spontaneous
emission is.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.470
We discussed on Wednesday that
spontaneous emission is not

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.830
so spontaneous as many
of us assume because it's

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.040
a unitary time evolution
with an operator

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.825
with a term in the Hamiltonian.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:41.680
It is exactly this
operator which

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.460
takes the wave function of
the total system, the atoms

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.940
and the light, to
whatever it is later on.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.520
There is no random phase,
there is no random variable

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.680
in this time evolution,
exclamation mark.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.200
But there are certain
aspects associated

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.300
with spontaneous emission,
and I want to address them.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.539
On the other hand, if you think
about spontaneous emission

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.150
in the most fundamental way,
the first thing you should think

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.470
about it, vacuum
Rabi oscillation.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.860
Here you see in the
simplest possible system

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.870
what spontaneous
emission can do for you.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.710
The way we want to discuss
an important aspect

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.550
of spontaneous emission, we want
to go beyond the vacuum Rabi

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.930
oscillation, is the following.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.250
We start with an atom
in the ground state

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.740
and the cavity is
in the vacuum state,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.550
but now we take a
short pulse of a laser

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.700
and we prepare the atom.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.440
And because the laser
outputs a coherent state,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.050
the coherent state has
a well defined phase,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.190
and this phase appears
in the superposition

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.290
between ground and excited
state because this superposition

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.400
is created with the
matrix element which

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.670
has the electric
field of the laser.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.400
But then we allow spontaneous
emission to happen,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.140
and spontaneous
emission to happen

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.310
means we take our operator
which I just showed you,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.510
we propagate forward
in time in such a way

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.300
that we just go through half
a cycle of a vacuum Rabi

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.170
oscillation, which
means everything which

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.970
was in the excited state
is now in the ground state.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.700
And by just exactly propagating
this system forward in time,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.650
we obtain this state,
and that's something

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.080
I hope very, very
insightful which

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.180
we arrived at the end
of the last lecture,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.230
that the quantum
state of the atom

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.010
has been perfectly mapped
onto the photon field.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.900
So all the information
which was in the atom

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.120
before spontaneous
emission is now

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.360
available in the photon field.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.880
So the next thing to
address is the phase phi.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.810
What is the phase of the
spontaneously emitted photon,

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.643
and this is what we
want to understand now.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:31.130
So how well can we
measure the phase phi?

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.900
You should first assume
the phase phi is perfectly

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.960
determined with
extremely high accuracy

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.720
if you use a laser
beam which has

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.490
a macroscopic electric field.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.700
The phase phi is a
classical variable

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.600
and can be determined
with arbitrary precision.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.530
And therefore the phase phi,
which we have imprinted first

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.190
into the atomic wave function
and then in the photon field,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.220
is an exact number.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.250
It comes from the laser beam.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.910
What I'm showing here
is phase space plots

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.190
for the photon field.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.570
I know we talk about
photons and two

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.080
dimensional phase-space
distribution mainly in 8-422,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.905
but I think the pictures
speak for themselves.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.510
A lot of you have seen the
harmonic oscillator and

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.930
harmonic oscillator,
if you start

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.320
to prepare the system here, this
is position, this is momentum,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.530
the system evolves in a circle.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.630
A lot of you have seen, if we
regard photon states as states

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.030
of a harmonic oscillator,
which they are,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.690
that you have flux states,
which are just circles,

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.170
or the vacuum state is just
a tiny circle at the center.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.040
And if you have
a coherent state,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.625
a coherent state is maybe
a little blob out there,

00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:11.070
and for the coherent state,
you can determine the phase

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.610
because the angle of this little
blob relative to the origin

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.760
is well determined.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.770
I think you all have
seen a version of that.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.350
So anyway, what
is done here is I

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.300
show you this phase-space
plot for the photon field,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.550
and what happens is if
initially, the excited

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.410
state was zero, this is
just the ground state

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.100
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.880
It's a circle.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.600
If the excited
state was occupied

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.890
with unity probability, it's
a flux state with n equals 1,

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.720
and here you see the phase-space
plot of a flux state with n

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.770
equals 1.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.550
And of course, you realize if
you have exactly one photon

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.070
or one atom in an excited state.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.480
There is no phase
information left

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.450
because the phase is
actually the relative phase

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.400
in the superposition between
ground and excited state.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.150
If you have an
excited state, only

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.990
an excited state
with a phase factor,

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.490
you know if a phase factor
can simply be factored out

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.150
of the total wave function,
it's never measurable.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.470
What is measurable
are phases which

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:26.960
are relative phases between two
amplitudes which are populated.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.140
And of course, not
surprisingly, if we now

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.880
vary the excited state
fraction of the atom, that's

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.040
a probability to have a
photon in the photon field

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.330
from zero or one in
between, we sort of see

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.820
that this phase-space
distribution, it

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.580
points along the 45 degree axis
and we can measure the phase.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.880
And the most accurate
phase measurement

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.210
can be done if the superposition
between ground and excited

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.490
state is 50-50, or, talking
about the photon field,

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.795
we have a 50-50 superposition
state between no photon and one

00:08:03.795 --> 00:08:05.260
photon.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.650
But the phase here is
indetermined and the phase here

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:16.520
has quite a bit of
variance because if you

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.550
have a single photon,
there's only so much accuracy

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.580
for the phase.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.350
It would require
more discussion,

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.845
but sometimes you talk even
about an uncertainty relation,

00:08:27.845 --> 00:08:30.460
delta n delta phi equals 1.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.150
So if you have one
photon, you can only

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.090
measure the phase with
precision on the order of unity.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.070
If you had millions
of photons, then you

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.889
can do very accurate
phase measurements.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.340
So what we have is-- let me
just summarize the conclusion.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:09:07.230
So the phase phi is best
defined in the atom,

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.300
and therefore also in
the photon field, when

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:18.950
we have an equal superposition
of spin up and spin down,

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.760
of ground and excited state.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.660
And you also get that from the
Bloch vector picture, if you

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.750
have a Bloch vector which
is pointing like that,

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.000
it doesn't have a phase,
it's just pointing up.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.420
If it's pointing down,
there is no phase.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.260
But if it's a 50%
superposition state,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.040
it points in the xy plane and
you have the best definition

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.905
of the relative phase of
the amplitude between ground

00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:41.930
and excited state.

00:10:06.964 --> 00:10:09.130
So I mentioned this Heisenberg
uncertainty relation.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.070
The fact is just looking
at these phase-space plots,

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:24.980
you realize the angle
which we can determine here

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.890
for the photon distribution
will have quite a variance,

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.540
but now I want to
discuss with you

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.180
how would we
actually go about it,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.910
how would we measure the
phase of the photon field?

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:40.150
And this requires a homodyne
experiment, a beat experiment

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:44.310
where we interfere the emitted
photon with a local oscillator,

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.860
which is the laser beam which
was used in the first place

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.610
to excite the atom.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.730
And what we will find out,
and it's clear that we cannot

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:59.800
obtain a sharp
value of the phase,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.960
but these fluctuations in the
phase do not come from any

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.569
partial trace, do not
come from any fluctuations

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:10.360
in the Hamiltonian.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.280
Just to address that,
when we write down

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.030
the term in the Hamiltonian,
the e dot d term,

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.930
yes, depending on the
basis set, depending

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.270
how you define
spin up, spin down,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.920
and what phase factors you
put into your basis set,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.300
you may have a phase popping
up in the Hamiltonian,

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.750
but this phase is
purely definitional.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.950
The phase I'm talking
about is really

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.470
a relative phase
between two amplitudes,

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.590
and it is independent
of a phase which

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.997
may be your choice by choosing
the basis set in which you

00:11:47.997 --> 00:11:49.080
formulate the Hamiltonian.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:59.780
Therefore, when we
measure the phase,

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:08.530
and we find that there
are fluctuations,

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:14.560
they actually come
form the quantum nature

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.576
of the states involved.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.380
Let's talk about the
measurement and let

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.610
me set it up genetically.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:36.610
Here is our atom, here
is the laser beam,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:44.250
and we want to create a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.730
Let me just use another
color for the laser beam.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.060
Why don't we take
sodium today, which

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:03.360
has emission in the orange?

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.900
The idea is the following.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.670
We have a laser beam which
is used to excite the atom,

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.940
and here we have a switch.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:22.682
And what we let through
is only a certain pulse.

00:13:22.682 --> 00:13:24.890
Let's say if we want to have
a coherent superposition

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.420
between ground
and excited state,

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.510
it would be pi over 2 pulse.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.910
Then, after the atom
has absorbed the pulse,

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:37.090
we switch off the light pass.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:45.230
So then in the second
stage, the atom can emit,

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:50.530
and the emitted light interferes
with the local oscillator,

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:55.760
which is the laser beam, and
we can measure the beat node

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.700
on the detector.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:04.045
This is the scheme how we
do a homodyne measurement.

00:14:10.439 --> 00:14:12.480
And so we assume we have
a very short pulse which

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.490
excites the atom.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.980
Then we switch off the laser
in the upper pass and the light

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.860
which reaches the
detector for homodyne

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.270
is only the light
which has been emitted

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.130
by the atom maybe
a nanosecond later.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:33.940
So we do a homodyne measurement
of the phase of the wave

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.635
or the wave train
emitted by the atom.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.190
And the distribution of
measurements for the phase,

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.326
I don't want to give you
mathematical expressions,

00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:53.700
but it's pretty
much what you can

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.200
read from the drawing
I've shown you.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:13.024
So for a pi over 2 pulse,
we retrieve the phase phi,

00:15:13.024 --> 00:15:13.940
but with fluctuations.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.590
Let's now come to
the interesting case

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.790
that we have a pi pulse.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:31.530
The pi pulse prepares the
atom in an excited state,

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:36.170
and at t equals 0
after the excitation,

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.370
there's absolutely no coherence.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.600
The density operator
for the atom

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.930
has just one in the column
and row for the excited state.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.060
There's no off diagonal
matrix element.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.010
There is no phase information.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:55.230
So at t equals 0, no
coherence, no phase.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.200
So now we have excited
the atom with a pi pulse,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.190
but there is no
phase information

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.470
in the atomic system,
and that would also

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.500
mean that when we now
start mapping the quantum

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.560
state of the atom onto the
quantum state of the light,

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.900
there won't be any specific
phase for the light.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.810
We could say after the
spontaneous emission is over

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.860
before we do any
measurement process,

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.980
we have mapped a flux state
of the atom onto a flux state,

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.450
n equals 1, of the
photon field, and there

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:37.470
is no phase associated
with a number state.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.090
But let's be a little
bit more specific here.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.820
Let's assume we can have
an ensemble of atoms,

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.330
we can repeat the
measurement many times,

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.880
and let's ask the question, what
happens after the atom which

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.840
was originally in the excited
state has decayed to 50%?

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.510
Well, then we have a
wave function which

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:09.550
is a superposition of
ground and excited state,

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:18.760
and there is a phase phi
now, but this phase phi

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.845
is completely random.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.609
So for those of you who are
concerned that I call it a wave

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.690
function, you can
be more specific

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.710
in the sense of
quantum Monte Carlo,

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.400
that at any quantum Monte Carlo
wave function, at any given

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:43.250
moment you have a wave function,
but the ensemble of your atom

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.320
is now an ensemble
of all those wave

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.650
functions with a
random phase phi.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.360
This is a way how
you can decompose

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.120
the statistical
operator of the system,

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.460
but the result is
the phase is random.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.520
If the phase is random,
that means no coherence.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.070
The statistical
operator does not

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.510
have an off diagonal
matrix element.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.610
It also means that,
if you would ask

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:14.640
what is the ensemble average
of the dipole moment,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.870
the dipole moment is
given by the Bloch vector.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:23.920
Well, if all phases are equally
populated in your ensemble,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.960
the dipole moment
average is 2-0.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.190
But, of course, you
have a d squared value,

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.890
a value of the dipole
moment, which is not zero.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:45.530
So here we have now a situation
where the photon field has

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:50.990
a random phase because
we lost the phase

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.690
information of the
laser beam when

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.080
we put the atom into
an excited state,

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:03.907
and you may now ask, what
is the origin of this phase

00:19:03.907 --> 00:19:04.406
uncertainty?

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.490
And at least the
qualitative answer

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.896
is it's vacuum fluctuations.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.540
You can take the concept
of vacuum fluctuations

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.680
a little bit further.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.240
I'm just mentioning it,
but I will not work it out.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.020
The fact that the phase of
this photon which is random

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:37.750
is somewhat associated
with vacuum fluctuations,

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:42.165
you can address this question
when you talk about two atoms.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.060
So we have two atoms.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:52.190
We excite them both with our
pi pulse into an excited state,

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:57.300
and then, as time
goes by, we will

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:03.320
have atoms which create photons.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:08.510
And at least as
long as the atoms

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:13.320
are well localized within
optical wavelengths,

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.180
you could play with the
idea that if they're

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.290
vacuum fluctuations,
maybe the two atoms

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.600
will see the same
vacuum fluctuations.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:35.144
And therefore, indeed, you will
actually observe correlations

00:20:35.144 --> 00:20:36.060
in the relative phase.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.940
So if you measure the phase of
the light emitted spontaneously

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.150
by the two atoms, you
will find a correlation

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.220
which is due to the fact that--
I'm waving my hands here,

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.750
but that the spontaneous
emission was triggered

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.370
by the same random
vacuum fluctuations.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.670
So the absolute phase will be
completely random from time

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:06.444
to time, but the relative
phase will be correlated.

00:21:06.444 --> 00:21:07.860
But what we are
talking about here

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.670
is correlations
between two atoms.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:20.430
We will talk later
about superradiance,

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.400
and maybe this will
make it much clearer

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.140
what it means if several atoms
emit spontaneously together.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.520
Any questions?

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.494
Yes, Colin?

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:36.994
AUDIENCE: Are there
any requirements

00:21:36.994 --> 00:21:40.396
on these two atoms being located
within an optical wavelength

00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:42.840
of each other?

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.910
PROFESSOR: Yes and no.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.610
In the simplest example
of superradiance,

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.900
we want to put them to within
one optical wavelength,

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.330
and then we do not
have any phase vectors,

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.420
but we will talk about it
next week, that we also

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.890
have superradiance
in extended samples,

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.210
and then we only get the
superradiance, the coherence

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.010
between atoms, into
a smaller solid angle

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:14.010
where the are different
phases are very well defined.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.180
If you would now average
the spontaneous emission

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.160
over different directions, you
would get propagation phases

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.370
and the atoms would only be
coherent in one solid angle

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:28.339
but not be coherent in
another solid angle.

00:22:28.339 --> 00:22:29.005
Other questions?

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.320
That's, to the best
off my knowledge

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.320
at the most fundamental limit,
what spontaneous emission is,

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:44.390
how accurately a spontaneously
emitted photon carries forward

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.550
the phase of the laser beam
which excited the atom,

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.050
and then eventually when we
have completely lost the phase

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.990
because we excited the
atom to an excited state.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.310
Everything that we discussed
will be actually carried

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.440
to the next level when
we discuss superradiance

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.650
because then we have n atoms--
n can be a big number-- which

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.180
excite together, and
if they emit photons,

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:15.500
the phase of this n photon field
can be very precisely measured.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.880
So some of the
uncertainties we have here

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.327
simply come from the fact
that, if you have only one

00:23:20.327 --> 00:23:22.660
photon or one atom,
there are naturally

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.710
quantum fluctuations of
any phase measurement.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:30.745
But that part will go away when
we go to ensembles of atoms

00:23:30.745 --> 00:23:34.890
where we have many atoms,
and superradiance is then

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.230
the way how we can
revisit the subject,

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.520
how well can you retrieve
the phase of the laser field

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.170
from the spontaneously
emitted photons.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.130
Other questions?

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:47.711
Nancy?

00:23:47.711 --> 00:23:49.184
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
single atom?

00:23:49.184 --> 00:23:53.603
So pi over 2, I can see that
we do a homodyne measurement

00:23:53.603 --> 00:23:55.567
and get the phase out.

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:59.249
Do we need dipole moments
for pi [INAUDIBLE], or this

00:23:59.249 --> 00:24:01.131
is just a science
that we're going

00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:03.029
to use for many other things?

00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:04.320
PROFESSOR: What's the question?

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.471
We have pi over--

00:24:05.471 --> 00:24:06.846
AUDIENCE: What
measurements do we

00:24:06.846 --> 00:24:08.694
need if we have just one atom?

00:24:08.694 --> 00:24:12.600
Do we make any measurements,
or no phase information?

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.470
PROFESSOR: I think the
measurement is, in a way,

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.860
what I indicated here.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.580
We excite the atom, then
we switch off this pulse,

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.760
and then we take this
short pulse of light.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.440
It's a wave train
which has a duration

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.660
on the order of the natural
lifetime of the atom,

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.770
and this wave
train is interfered

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.500
with a local oscillator,
and the interference term

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.720
allows us to retrieve the phase.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.700
And if you use a strong
local oscillator,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.820
then we pretty much
retrieve the quantum limit

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.690
of the measurement,
and the quantum limit

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.060
of the measurement
is what I showed you

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.083
in these cartoon drawings of
the phase-space distribution.

00:24:57.083 --> 00:24:58.958
AUDIENCE: So essentially,
we can [? read a ?]

00:24:58.958 --> 00:24:59.833
flux state like this?

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.090
PROFESSOR: If you
have a flux state

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.165
and you repeat the
measurement many times,

00:25:16.165 --> 00:25:17.900
we will measure random phase.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.820
So what happens here is--
let me put it this way.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.540
The homodyne
detection is a way how

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.940
we want to measure the
phase, and whenever

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.650
you want to measure
the phase, you

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.370
get a phase because
the number you

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.480
get from a phase
measurement is a phase.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.440
But if you have a
flux state which

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.740
has not a specific phase
but an equal probability

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.850
for all phases
between zero and 2 pi,

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.570
then, if you repeat a
phase measurement many,

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:50.300
many times, you will get a
random result for the phase.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.049
AUDIENCE: I think that's what
my question originally was.

00:25:53.049 --> 00:25:54.465
What measurement
would you perform

00:25:54.465 --> 00:25:57.260
for this [? pi phase? ?]
Would you still do a phase

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.784
measurement?

00:25:58.784 --> 00:25:59.950
PROFESSOR: It's your choice.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.825
If you want to do a
phase measurement, that's

00:26:01.825 --> 00:26:03.730
a way to do it, and
then for flux state,

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.400
you will get a random phase.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.720
But maybe for the flux
state, of course, you

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.690
can say in hindsight, the flux
state doesn't have a phase

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.960
so maybe you shouldn't
bother measuring the phase.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.580
The special thing
about the flux state

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.400
that it has exactly one
photon, and so maybe you

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.240
want to have a measurement
which is measuring

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.190
the special character
of the flux state,

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.300
namely that you have
sub-Poissonian distribution

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.100
of the photons.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.570
Of course, this aspect of
just having one photon gets

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.220
completely lost when
you have a beam splitter

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.425
and you have zillions of
photons in your laser beam

00:26:38.425 --> 00:26:39.925
with all the
Poissonian fluctuations

00:26:39.925 --> 00:26:42.600
in the coherent state
and you superimpose it.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.937
But this is nothing else
than complementarity.

00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:47.520
You can either measure the phase
or you can measure the photon

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.050
number, and the question is,
what are you interested in?

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:06.410
This is one aspect of coherence
in a two level system,

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:12.280
namely that we have a phase
in the two level system

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.796
and the question is,
how can we measure it?

00:27:15.796 --> 00:27:17.920
And the answer is we can
map it on the photon field

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.730
and then perform a quantum
measurement on the photon

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:21.230
field.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.340
I want to continue with some
other aspect of coherence

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.150
in single atom.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:37.790
Let me just point out
one important aspect

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:44.860
about coherence in
a two level system,

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:55.720
and this is related to something
very mundane, the precession

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.470
of spin-- when it's
a two level system,

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.730
it's spin 1/2-- in
a magnetic field.

00:28:07.617 --> 00:28:09.200
In other words, I
just want to quickly

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:15.100
remind you in a few minutes
that for any two level system,

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.340
we can always map
it on spin 1/2.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.100
I was really
emphasizing this message

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.780
throughout the whole course.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.220
But for spin 1/2, if you
think of spin up or down

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.752
in a magnetic field, there
is a very clear visualization

00:28:28.752 --> 00:28:29.460
of the coherence.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.000
If you have a coherence of
position of spin up and down,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.210
the phase of the
superposition decides

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.030
whether the spin
points in x or y.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:42.510
So the precession of a spin
in the transverse xy plane

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.690
is actually the
manifestation of coherence,

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.880
and it's not just
the special coherence

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.810
of spin 1/2 in a magnetic
field because all two level

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:52.670
systems are isomorphic to that.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.785
You can always use it as
an intuitive visualization

00:28:55.785 --> 00:28:59.250
of what coherences are.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.080
So what I just want to
point out is the relation

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.130
to the quantum mechanical
or classical precession

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:13.150
of spin in a magnetic
field, that it is simply

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:19.480
an effect of coherence
within one atom, coherence

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.790
between two levels in an atom.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:31.760
So if spin points
in the x direction,

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.280
it is a coherent superposition
of plus z and minus z,

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:41.810
spin up and spin down, but
this is a situation at time t

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.660
equals 0.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:49.320
If we let time evolve,
spin up and spin down

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.230
evolve with the Larmor
frequency, actually

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:56.730
effect of 1/2, but
with opposite phases

00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:00.730
because one has plus the Larmor,
h bar omega Larmor over 2.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.595
The other has minus h bar
omega Larmor over 2 as energy.

00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:11.750
In other words, if you
look at the relative phase,

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.890
it's a beat node with
the same unsplitting

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:16.290
between spin up and spin down.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:20.430
But that means now, due
to this coherent time

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:26.630
evolution of the two
amplitudes, that the spin

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:31.110
precesses in the xy plane.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.990
The statistical operator
for the spin 1/2,

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:45.850
we have 50-50 population
in spin up and spin down,

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:57.050
but now, the phase
here precesses

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.520
as e to the minus
and e to the plus

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:09.630
i omega lt, which means, if you
use the statistical operator

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:15.160
and find the expectation
value for the x spin.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.710
It means we take the
statistical operator describing

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.120
the pure state of
a two level system,

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.580
we multiply with a
Pauli matrix in x,

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.840
and this is a prescription
to get the expectation

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:34.930
value for sigma x, and we
find it's cosine omega lt.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:41.930
So the spin is precessing
the x component changes

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:42.555
cosinusoidally.

00:31:42.555 --> 00:31:47.570
That would mean the y
component changes sinusoidally.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:53.280
Let me just contrast it to
the case of no coherence,

00:31:53.280 --> 00:32:07.660
and this would mean off
diagonal matrix elements are 0.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.085
then if you have a
statistical operator where

00:32:11.085 --> 00:32:15.490
the off diagonal matrix elements
are zero, in one minute,

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:19.890
you can show that
then any expectation

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:24.700
value for the x or y component
of the spin vanishes.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.560
In that case, if you have a
statistical mixer between spin

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.940
up and down, of course there
is no phase determined,

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.600
and it is the phase of
the superposition state

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.030
which tells you where
between 0 and 2 pi

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:48.010
the spin is pointing
in the xy plane.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.720
I want to come
back later on when

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:56.680
I discuss an example of
coherent spectroscopy,

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.540
that if you excite coherently
a superposition of spin

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.890
up and spin down,
you can perform

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.530
some form of coherent
spectroscopy, which I want

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:08.230
to explain first in
general and then come back

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.460
to the spin as an example.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.680
When we talk about
coherent spectroscopy,

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.470
I want to just in 10
minutes or 15 minutes

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:40.930
show you some spectroscopic
techniques which

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:45.695
exploit the coherence between
several quantum states.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.340
I do it for a number of reasons.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.690
One is coherent
spectroscopy actually

00:33:54.690 --> 00:34:01.550
allows us to obtain information
about the level structure

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:06.120
even if this level structure is
much narrower than the Doppler

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.010
width.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:11.989
So it is a sub-Doppler
technique to exploit coherence.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:15.610
And before people had lasers,
before people invented

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.449
sub-Doppler laser
spectroscopy, often,

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.070
coherent spectroscopy
was the only way

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:25.150
how you could obtain detailed
structure of the atom.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.730
The reason why I explain
coherent spectroscopy

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:31.600
is to just give you a little bit
idea about that you appreciate

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.590
how smart people were before
lasers were developed,

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:40.100
but also, it illustrates
what coherence can do for us.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:45.090
It's a nice example for
the concept of coherence.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.780
When I was a graduate
student, textbooks

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.949
had dozens of pages, 50 pages
on coherent spectroscopy,

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:55.650
the Hanle effect, quantum
beat measurements.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:35:00.130
It's all old fashioned because
with a laser, and especially

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:03.210
cold atoms and the laser,
we have such wonderful tools

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:05.815
to go to the ultimate
fundamental precision

00:35:05.815 --> 00:35:07.330
of quantum measurements.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.976
But still, coherence
is important.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:21.520
Let me talk about
one method, which

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.790
is called quantum
beat spectroscopy.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.110
The selling point
about quantum beat

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:44.400
spectroscopy is that it allows
the measurement of narrow level

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:49.110
spacings-- just think
about Zeeman splitting

00:35:49.110 --> 00:36:01.541
in a magnetic field-- without
any form of narrow band

00:36:01.541 --> 00:36:02.040
excitation.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.380
You can also put it like this.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:14.241
If you don't have any way to
selectively excite levels,

00:36:14.241 --> 00:36:16.240
but you're interested
what is the level spacing,

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.910
but you cannot have
a narrow band laser,

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:23.500
have atoms which stand still and
scan and get peak, peak, peak,

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.130
what you can still do is you can
just excite all of the levels

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:28.450
at once.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.210
In other words, you hit
the atom with a board laser

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.440
like with a sledgehammer,
and then you see a beat node,

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.790
you see some blinking,
a quantum beat

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:40.250
between the excitation
of the levels.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.980
That's the idea.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.110
We assume we have a
ground state and then we

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:52.030
have an excited state manifold,
and in this excited state

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:57.930
manifold, we have several
levels distributed

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.180
over an energy interval delta.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.680
Yes, we don't have a
narrow band source.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.430
We may just have a
classic light source,

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:17.620
but if we use a short pulse
that the pulse duration is

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.530
much smaller than the splitting
between energy levels,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:31.990
then we create a coherent
superposition of those levels.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.720
So therefore, what
we create at time t

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:44.620
equals 0 is a
coherent superposition

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.530
of energy eigenlevels.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.930
And the important thing is that
this is at time t equals 0,

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:57.790
but now, when time goes
on, each amplitude,

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:02.650
each part of the wave function,
evolves with its frequency

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:13.820
omega i, and if we would
then look at, let's say,

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:19.576
the emission spectrum
as a function of time,

00:38:19.576 --> 00:38:25.570
we will find that-- I will give
you a little bit more details

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:31.560
later-- that yes, there
is a decay approximately

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.530
with the natural
spontaneous emission

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:40.210
time with the inverse of
the natural line widths.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:45.040
But we observe some
oscillations which

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.340
is the interference term of
the different terms in the wave

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:48.840
function.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:56.180
So therefore, if we
would take this spectrum

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.590
and perform a
Fourier transform, we

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:08.810
will actually observe
different peaks.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.280
This is frequency, and
the frequency peaks

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.550
are at discrete frequencies
corresponding to frequency

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.750
differences between
the excited state.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.320
And ideally, the
widths of these is

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.930
determined by the
natural line widths.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:38.620
So in other words, what
we have actually done

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:43.950
is we have done a version of
the double slit experiment.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:49.630
We have ground state, we
had our excited states,

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:58.860
e sub i, and our
broad band source

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.370
was creating a
coherent excitation,

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:07.300
and then we were observing
the light which came out.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.560
We were performing a
multi-slit experiment.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.890
We had a laser pulse and then
we see photons coming out,

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.790
but it is fundamentally
not observable

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:21.410
which intermediate state was
responsible for the scattering.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:25.530
So therefore, we have
in the Feynman sense

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:34.730
several indistinguishable
paths going

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:37.090
through different
internal states.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:41.254
And therefore, we get
an interference effect.

00:40:41.254 --> 00:40:42.920
Some of what I'm
saying we will retrieve

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.580
later on when we talk
about three level systems.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.215
We will also have
situations that sometimes we

00:40:48.215 --> 00:40:51.710
go through two possibilities
for the intermediate state,

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:54.860
and if we have no way,
even in principle,

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.890
to figure out which
intermediate state was involved,

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.672
we have to sum up
the amplitudes,

00:41:00.672 --> 00:41:02.130
and that's when we
get a beat node.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:20.030
This technique is a
Doppler free technique

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:24.730
because, even if you
take a single pulse

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:28.070
from a light source, you have
a Doppler broadening, which

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.960
is k dot v, v, the
thermal velocity,

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.340
and this can be
much, much broader.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:38.300
You will still see
the quantum beats,

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.610
maybe I should say in principle,
because the beat happens

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.395
at the much smaller
frequency delta.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:55.200
Or maybe I should say that
the Doppler shift is reduced

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.930
by the splitting of the excited
states over the frequency

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.550
of the exciting laser.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:04.550
Of course, if you have your
different atoms emitting

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.120
at different frequencies,
you have a Doppler shift,

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.490
but since you measure
the difference frequency,

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.090
you only get the Doppler shift
associated with the difference

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:12.589
frequency.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.170
Now let me come back
to the previous example

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:23.920
I had about the spin 1/2 system.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.890
If you assume you have a spin
1/2 system, spin up and spin

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:31.310
down, which is excited
with a laser, which

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:33.790
is linear polarization,
you would then

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:38.560
create a superposition of up
and down which, let's say,

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.270
is now a dipole moment which
points in the x direction.

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.020
A dipole moment which
points in the x direction

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.810
will not emit light along
the axis of the dipole moment

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:53.230
because of the dipolar
emission pattern.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.290
It will only emit to the side.

00:42:55.290 --> 00:43:02.320
But I mentioned to you that
the dipole moment or the spin,

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.700
which is originally
in x, will now

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.470
oscillate with a Larmor
frequency in the xy plane.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.240
So the picture you
can actually have

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.260
of such a quantum beat
and quantum superposition

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.970
is like the lighthouse.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.450
You have a searchlight
at the lighthouse,

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:21.360
and the searchlight
is just rotating

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.040
at the Larmor frequency.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.030
For instance, you wouldn't
see light right now,

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.470
now you don't see light,
now you don't see light.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:30.520
It's really like a
classical lighthouse

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:34.000
which is emitting light
at the Larmor frequency.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.980
So if you have a
fluorescence detector which

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.290
looks at the atoms from
a certain direction,

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:41.720
you will pretty much see
the lighthouse effect

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.470
that the fluorescence of this
coherent superposition of atoms

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:48.420
goes on and off, on
and off, on and off.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.420
This is sort of a very
nice visualization how

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:57.090
you obtain what I
showed here, a beat

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:58.820
node in your detected signal.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.820
Let me talk about another
aspect of coherence.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:17.830
And of course, they
are all related.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:20.520
Coherence is always related
to the phase, to beat nodes,

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.780
to superposition.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.880
Let me now talk about
one aspect which

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.430
is related to delayed detection.

00:44:36.522 --> 00:44:37.980
When I was a graduate
student and I

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.060
learned about spectroscopic
techniques, somehow

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.120
I was so fascinated
by techniques

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.840
which could measure
spectroscopically transitions

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.019
better than the
natural line widths.

00:44:51.019 --> 00:44:51.560
I don't know.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.190
Maybe from what I
had read before,

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:55.980
what I learned as
an undergraduate,

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.640
the natural line
widths appeared to be

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.430
the natural fundamental limit.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:04.260
So the topic I'm
teaching right now

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.360
has always had a certain
fascination for me,

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.090
but you will, of course,
also realize that in the end,

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:12.629
the answer is rather simple.

00:45:12.629 --> 00:45:14.920
Once you know the answer,
most answers are very simple.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:26.070
So we want to talk
about delayed detection.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:30.485
Let's say we excite the system.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:37.370
You can think about a
quantum beat experiment.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:41.192
You have a short pulse and
then your quantum beats happen.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:00.280
And now the question
is, normally,

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.450
when you do a measurement
on a decaying system,

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.880
you're always limited by
the natural line widths,

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.220
by the inverse of the lifetime.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.550
But now, maybe you
want to be smart

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:20.980
and you say, well, I start the
detection, I only detect atoms

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:27.400
after a time t0, which
is much, much larger

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.270
than the natural line widths.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.965
And the question
I have is, can you

00:46:33.965 --> 00:46:45.470
obtain, with such a measurement,
a spectral resolution which

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:54.200
is narrower than the
natural line widths?

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.850
Well, we can give
two possible answers.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:01.170
One is yes, because
you're looking

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:04.850
at atoms which have survived
for a long time, so to speak.

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:07.346
These atoms are longer lived.

00:47:07.346 --> 00:47:08.720
We have just
selected atoms which

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.920
happened to survive
for several lifetimes.

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:25.510
But then there should
some lingering doubts.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:29.080
If you have a sample which
undergoes radioactive decay,

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.720
and you would go to
your favorite supplier

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.620
and buy uranium,
which has already

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.850
decayed for a
billion years, it's

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:42.060
the same uranium which
existed a billion years ago.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.990
You will not be able to
perform any measurement

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:48.990
on your well aged uranium,
which has a higher

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:52.420
resolution than if you had
lived a billion years ago

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:56.690
and had done your measurement
with younger uranium.

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:59.540
So in other words,
the exponential decay

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:00.260
is self similar.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:04.390
It starts at any moment
and it looks exponential

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.540
no matter where you start.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:21.770
I didn't bring clickers
today, but with which

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.350
answer would you side?

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:26.770
Is it possible or
it's not possible?

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.230
Maybe just hints
of who thinks it

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:34.890
is possible by taking advantage
of the longtime survivors?

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:36.070
OK.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.890
Who thinks it's impossible?

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:39.630
A few.

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:41.050
Good.

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.120
The answer is actually depends.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.910
If you would go and just look
at the longtime survivors,

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:50.470
you would not be able to do
a more precise measurement.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:52.630
You need a little
bit of information

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.060
from the earlier time.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:49:00.840
So in that sense, the question
is a little bit deliberately

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:04.280
confusing, and I want to show
you how the mathematics work.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:08.100
It's just five minutes to show
the mathematics of a Fourier

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.400
transform, and
the result will be

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:16.270
if you have information about
something at t equals 0,

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:20.150
and then you look at the long
time survivors, you in essence

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:23.500
have a longer integration
period for your measurement,

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.750
and then the Fourier
transform of that measurement

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:27.440
can be very narrow.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.430
But if you do the dumb thing,
you just go to the store

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:34.405
and buy very well aged uranium
or very well aged atoms,

00:49:34.405 --> 00:49:35.905
and you then start
your measurement,

00:49:35.905 --> 00:49:37.070
you have no chance.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.880
You are always back to
the spontaneous decay

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.040
to the natural line widths.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.350
All I have to do is
actually just a few lines

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:58.380
of mathematics and
Fourier transform.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:02.950
Let us assume we have the
situation we discussed earlier.

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:10.810
We have a quantum beat where we
have a beat frequency omega 0.

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.620
Just think about the
searchlight, the atoms which

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.750
oscillate with a
Larmor frequency,

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:18.870
and you have some
cosine omega Larmor t

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:23.440
factor in the intensity
of the light you observe.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.830
But now, because the atom in
the excited state is decaying,

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:33.970
everything will decay with
the natural line width.

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:37.300
This is sort of what we
observe, and the question

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.980
is, if you observe
that in real time,

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:43.980
can we then retrieve
spectral information from it

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:46.130
which is more
accurate than gamma?

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.000
All I want to do is I want
to discuss the Fourier

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.670
transform of this
function, s of t.

00:50:54.670 --> 00:51:00.480
Let me use
dimensionless variables.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.910
We measure frequencies
in units of gamma.

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:08.795
We use a Lorentzian, which
is just 1 plus x squared.

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:23.440
We just said we want to start
the measurement at time t0.

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:27.370
So the question is, if you
start later and later and later,

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:29.314
do we get higher
accuracy because we're

00:51:29.314 --> 00:51:30.355
talking to the survivors?

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:41.660
So let's perform the
Fourier transform,

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.710
and let's use complex
notation, e to the i omega t.

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:51.620
I will measure times in units
of the inverse line widths.

00:51:55.940 --> 00:52:01.120
So we performed the
Fourier transform,

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.110
and by doing e to the
i omega t, I actually

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:10.400
performed the Fourier transform
for the cosine and for the sine

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.970
by using the real part
and the imaginary part

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:14.750
of the complex number.

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.090
So we will actually
be able to look

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:18.960
at the real and imaginary part.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:30.960
The Fourier transform has
a real and imaginary part,

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:36.220
so let me call the real part
F of x and the imaginary part

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.560
G of x.

00:52:48.247 --> 00:52:49.080
You can do the math.

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:53.040
It's a straightforward integral.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:57.450
In both cases, will we find
that if you do our measurement,

00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:01.680
well, the longer we wait,
the more signal we lose.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:04.970
This is common to all
delayed measurements.

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:07.710
You're really now talking
to an exponentially smaller

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:09.340
and smaller signal.

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:13.190
Also, because of the
exponential decay,

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.750
we get an envelope
which is a Lorentzian.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.250
But then, and this is
the interesting part,

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:36.570
we have cosine xT
minus x sine xT.

00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:55.110
So now we have factors
which depend on capital T,

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:59.260
and t is larger
the longer we wait.

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:05.140
It is actually those
parts with sine and cosine

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:21.040
which determine whether
we can get resolution

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.830
below the natural line widths.

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:29.530
What is important
is-- and this should

00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:31.710
be sort of an eye
opener for you--

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:36.980
if you simply measure intensity,
if you look at the power

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:40.900
spectrum, you take the real part
plus imaginary part and just

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:46.850
look at the absolute
value, then,

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:51.020
because of cosine squared
plus sine squared equals 1,

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:56.430
all the cosine and sine part,
the last part of the expression

00:54:56.430 --> 00:55:00.680
above cancels out
and you find that you

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.570
have an exponential
loss of signal

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:07.690
but your spectral distribution
is always a Lorentzian.

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:14.900
So you always have a Lorentzian
line shape completely

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:20.420
independent of the
delay time, capital T.

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.420
And this is what some
of you maybe thought.

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.680
If I start the
measurement later and all

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.760
I can do is look at the
power of the emitted light,

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.750
I have no advantage.

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:29.830
I cannot go sub-natural.

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:42.735
However, if you
look at the function

00:55:42.735 --> 00:55:52.275
F of x for large values of
x, you find oscillations.

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.750
So if you look at the sine
or cosine Fourier transform,

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:01.660
the real or imaginary
part separately,

00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:06.830
you find oscillations,
and those oscillations,

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:11.420
similar to Ramsey fringes,
have a central peak.

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:16.410
The central peak is
narrow and the width

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:20.540
is now given by not the
inverse of the natural lifetime

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:22.711
but the inverse
of the delay time

00:56:22.711 --> 00:56:23.960
you wait for your measurement.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:37.700
So the fact is now we
had a signal s of t which

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:45.030
we assumed was a quantum beat
with a well defined phase,

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:48.980
and then it was
exponentially decaying.

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:52.210
If we would now perform
a Fourier transform where

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:57.290
we do a Fourier transform
with cosine omega t plus phi,

00:56:57.290 --> 00:57:01.410
we can get a narrow signal,
but we have no idea what phi is

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:04.500
or if, in repetitions
of the experiment,

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:09.050
phi would be random, then this
is sort of what the math does.

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:12.770
If phi is random, it is the
same as if we simply measure

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:15.610
the power spectrum because
we cannot distinguish between

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:17.840
the cosine and sine
Fourier transform.

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:25.872
So if the phase
phi is random, that

00:57:25.872 --> 00:57:40.920
means you only measure
what was F plus IG before.

00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:53.460
In other words, the situation
is extremely in the end

00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:54.170
very simple.

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:55.730
If you have quantum
beats which start

00:57:55.730 --> 00:58:00.140
with a well defined phase,
and you know the phase was,

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:04.230
let's say, zero here, and now
you have the decaying function,

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:08.070
and now you look at the
quantum beat over there, well,

00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:13.810
in a way, you had
n beats between t

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:16.370
equals 0 and your
measurement, and then

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:18.950
your resolution
goes with 1 over n,

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:22.370
but you have to know what
the phase was at t equals 0,

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:25.420
and then, by looking
at delayed detection,

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:31.440
you can do spectroscopy below
the natural line widths.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.250
So therefore, what
is crucial here

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:53.470
is knowledge, or at
least reproducibility,

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:59.490
of the phase phi, and then
you can get narrow lines.

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.870
Examples for techniques where
you excite the system at t

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:09.850
equals 0 and then you
can do delayed detection

00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:12.440
of quantum beats.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.400
I mentioned earlier
in the course

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:22.080
the Ramsey spectroscopy where
you have one Ramsey zone where

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.520
you prepare your Bloch vector.

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.850
Then the Bloch
vector oscillates,

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:28.715
and if you simply look at the
phase angle of the Bloch vector

00:59:28.715 --> 00:59:32.970
after a very long time, you
have very high precision

00:59:32.970 --> 00:59:35.540
but you're dealing with an
exponentially small signal.

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:48.970
Another example are heterodyne
or homodyne techniques,

00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:51.770
but you need something which
is phase sensitive in order

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:58.320
to obtain sub-natural
line widths.

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:04.490
A final comment is if you
want to get higher resolution

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:08.260
with delayed detection,
yes, you can get it,

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.420
but you was
exponentially in signal.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.220
And what does it
mean in practice?

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:18.310
Well, if you know
your line shape,

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:22.120
you know it's well
described by a Lorentzian,

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.150
it is better to take
your full signal

01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:27.880
and use then an
excellent signal to noise

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.060
to find the line center
and split the line.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.030
However, if there's
any ambiguity,

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:38.170
there may be different,
not fully resourced lines

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:40.260
under the Lorentzian
and you don't

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:43.310
know how to split the
line, then it may be better

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:45.600
to do delayed
detection and clearly

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.395
see the structure of the lines
with sub-natural resolution.

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:53.345
Any questions?

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:08.210
This was coherence with two
levels, coherent excitation,

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.925
coherent observation, some
spectroscopic techniques.

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:19.530
Now we are ready to do
the next step, namely,

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:23.840
to talk about coherence
in three level systems.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:46.410
If we have three levels,
we could think about it,

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:49.910
we have terms which
connect level one to two,

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:53.270
level two to three,
and level three to one

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:55.890
in all possible
ways, but that's not

01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:59.180
what we want to assume here.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:03.460
The situation where we can
discuss some fundamentally new

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:08.530
effects is when we have
two states connected

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:11.600
through a third state.

01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:28.000
In other words, if
we have two levels,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.470
we are not allowing any
transition matrix element

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:33.040
connecting the two.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:39.060
They are only connected
through a third state.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.560
This is for obvious reasons
called the lambda type system.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:49.000
You can turn it upside down
and you have the V type system

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.920
or, if the intermediate
state is between the first

01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:02.590
and the second state, you
have a ladder type system.

01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:06.860
But once you start driving
it, it may not really matter.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:10.160
There may be a dressed
atom description

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:15.060
where, if you drive two states
coherently in the dressed atom

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:18.900
picture, you have degeneracy
between this level

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.389
and one more photon
and this level.

01:03:21.389 --> 01:03:22.930
And then in the
dressed atom picture,

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:24.890
which includes a
number of photons,

01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:27.070
the two levels have
become degenerate.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:29.910
So therefore, it's
very important

01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:32.490
for practical applications
or how to implement it

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:35.640
in an atom what kind
of system you have,

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.210
but for the description
of those systems,

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:40.960
some of the
differences may simply

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.930
disappear if you formulate
it in the dressed atom basis.

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:47.770
Of course, there's an
important practical reason.

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:50.120
Usually the lower states
are ground states,

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.120
the upper states
are excited states.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.560
And here you have the
opportunity, and that's

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.220
why the lambda type system
is the most important one,

01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:00.380
to have some coherent
superposition mediated

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:03.080
by the third state, and
the coherent superposition

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.385
is stable because it's
a coherent superposition

01:04:05.385 --> 01:04:07.180
of ground states.

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.770
If any form of
coherent superposition

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:14.340
involves an excited state, then
you have short lived states,

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:19.164
and they are often not so
useful for certain phenomena.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:29.760
So if you think you know already
everything about how atoms

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.356
interact with light
from two level atoms,

01:04:34.356 --> 01:04:39.670
I have to tell you that's not
the case because a three level

01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:42.270
system has many new effects.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:56.900
One, of course, is
that atoms can now

01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:06.160
interact with two
electromagnetic fields,

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:20.470
and those two electromagnetic
fields can affect each other,

01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:26.480
and this can happen through
coherent or incoherent

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:26.980
mechanisms.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.100
In other words, you
can say it simply.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.350
If you hit an atom with light
and you have a two level

01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:45.860
system, there is no way
how the atom can hide.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.770
It's always excited
by the laser.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:51.110
But if you have a
three level system,

01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:53.330
you may have a
situation where you

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:56.490
have destructive interference
between what the two lasers can

01:05:56.490 --> 01:05:58.770
do to the atom,
and suddenly, there

01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:02.640
may be a state where the atom is
in the dark where the atom can

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.160
hide from the laser beam.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.100
This is something which
is fundamentally new

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.470
and has no counterpart
in a two level system.

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:18.220
I've already pointed out
that the lambda system

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:29.080
is the most important one
because it has two ground

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:35.410
states which can be in a long
lived superposition state.

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:56.500
What we want to discuss as
possible consequences is that

01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:08.960
in a three level system, you
can realize a lasing operation

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.135
without having inversion
of the population

01:07:12.135 --> 01:07:14.140
of the ground and excited state.

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:17.190
So if you always thought,
if I want to build a laser,

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:18.990
the first thing I
have to do is make

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:21.360
sure I have more atoms in the
excited than in the ground

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.090
state, yes, this is valid
for two level system,

01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:28.300
but it is no longer valid
for a three level system.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.670
The reason why you want to
invert a two level system

01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:38.540
is you want to have stimulated
emission from the excited

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.830
state which is stronger
than absorption

01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:42.620
from the ground state.

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:46.340
But if you take advantage
of quantum coherence,

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:49.760
you may have a situation
where two possibilities

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.870
for stimulated emission
add up coherently,

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:55.090
but the two possibilities
for absorption

01:07:55.090 --> 01:08:02.350
add up destructively.

01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:05.380
And therefore, you
can avoid destruction.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.240
You have only
stimulated emission,

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.000
but you have not achieved
that through inversion.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.230
You have achieved that
through quantum coherence,

01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:16.189
a fundamentally new effect.

01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:19.160
So we have lasing
without inversion,

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.609
we have the phenomenon
I mentioned already

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:25.740
that atoms can hide in the
dark if the two laser beams

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:29.910
in the excitation mechanism
destructively interfere.

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:31.990
This is called
electromagnetically induced

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:34.370
transparency.

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:37.960
Systems which have sharp
resonances in three level

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:45.540
systems are used for reducing
the group velocity of light,

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:49.430
which goes under the
name slowing light,

01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:54.660
or even bringing light to a
standstill, stopping light.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:58.210
And three level
systems are also used

01:08:58.210 --> 01:09:01.410
for quantum mechanical memories
for quantum computation.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:12.580
Any questions?

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:18.075
This is an introduction.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:37.420
Let me connect special effects
in a three level system

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:43.458
to something which is very
basic and you've heard about it,

01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:44.624
and this is optical pumping.

01:09:49.069 --> 01:09:57.740
If we set up a system which
has two ground states, g and f,

01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.890
you may just think about
two hyperfine states

01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:03.330
in your favorite atom,
and then they are only

01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:06.890
coupled through
an excited state,

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:14.360
you can now drive the
system with laser fields

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.210
omega 1 and omega 2.

01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:21.810
Let me also use that
example of optical pumping

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:28.060
to introduce some notation
which I will need to describe

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:32.260
the system with a few equations.

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.840
We will use energy
level diagrams,

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.030
and the energy is referred
to the lowest ground state.

01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:44.240
So here, we have an energy
splitting which is by omega gf,

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.000
and the excited state
has a splitting of eg.

01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:55.930
We will call the photons in
one laser the photons created

01:10:55.930 --> 01:11:00.150
and annihilated with the
operator a and a dagger,

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:04.360
and for the photons for
the other laser beam,

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.215
we use c or c dagger.

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:14.690
Now, there is a
very simple solution

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:19.030
for this situation, a very
simple equilibrium situation,

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:22.650
if you have only one laser beam.

01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:30.330
If you have only one laser
beam, omega 1 or omega 2,

01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:32.200
it's clear what happens.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.760
If you have only one laser
beam, let's say omega 1,

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.640
it doesn't talk at all to
the atoms in the state f.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.390
They are left alone.

01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:45.440
But the atoms in the state g are
excited to the excited state,

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.110
and then there may be a
certain branching ratio

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:53.915
for spontaneous emission,
but let's rather call it

01:11:53.915 --> 01:11:55.760
fluorescence, two
photon scattering.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:59.010
So there be a branching ratio
to go back to that state

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:02.020
or to go to the state f.

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.842
If the latter happens,
the atom doesn't

01:12:03.842 --> 01:12:05.425
interact with the
laser light anymore.

01:12:05.425 --> 01:12:07.720
If it goes back to
the original state,

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.749
the atom will try again and
again until after a while,

01:12:10.749 --> 01:12:13.040
all the atoms have been
optically pumped into the state

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.300
f.

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:19.010
And the same would happen if
you have a laser, omega 2,

01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:22.220
then you would pump all
the atoms into the state g.

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:25.790
So if you have only one laser
beam, omega 1 and omega 2,

01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:32.090
then in equilibrium, the
equilibrium population

01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:39.760
is 100% of the atoms are in
state f or g respectively,

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.990
and this is nothing
else than the phenomenon

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:44.408
of optical pumping.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.010
We have a very simple solution.

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:05.470
We pump all the atoms
into one quantum state

01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:07.970
if we have only one
of the laser beams.

01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:12.410
But the question is now, can
we have a similar situation

01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:13.950
when both laser beams are on?

01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:40.740
And what I mean by
that is, is it possible

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:56.000
now to pump all the atoms
into a state which does not

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.940
scatter any light, which does
not react with the light, which

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.235
is never excited to
the excited state?

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:17.340
The answer is yes,
and this is what

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.130
we want to derive right now.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:34.420
Before I go into any equation,
the result is pretty clear.

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:38.970
If you have, say, g and f
and they are both excited,

01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:46.540
if the amplitude which you
put into the excited state

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:50.160
is the same but
has opposite sign,

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.560
the two amplitudes which
are added in a time delta t

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.110
destructively interfere
and you have not

01:14:56.110 --> 01:15:00.250
put any amplitude into
the excited state.

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:03.050
And that means, if you have
this initial superposition

01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:06.210
state where this complete
destructive interference

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:09.200
happened, this state will
be dark all the time.

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:14.770
But we want to assume--
also it doesn't matter--

01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:17.430
that the two states,
the two lasers

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.350
have two different frequencies.

01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:23.360
So you cannot say, this is just
the two lasers have a certain

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.660
phase and then the laser field
interferes and they reach

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.680
a space which is dark.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:32.380
We assume that the atom
is sitting at the origin.

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.420
Again, we're not putting
in motion effects,

01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:37.290
so it's an atom
with infinite mass.

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:39.490
Then we shine two
laser lights on it

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:41.645
and the atom is not in the dark.

01:15:41.645 --> 01:15:45.310
It's not at a dark fringe of the
interference of the two laser

01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:47.940
beams because if you have
two laser beams with two

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:50.940
different frequencies,
there will not

01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:54.150
be any place in space
which is dark all the time.

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:55.920
You create maybe
interference fringes,

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.220
but the interference
fringes are rapidly

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.520
running with a beat node,
omega 1 minus omega 2.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.570
So the atom is not in the
dark, but nevertheless, it

01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:07.920
will not scatter light
if it is prepared

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.910
in a suitable coherent
superposition state.

01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:33.070
We describe this situation
with a dipole Hamiltonian,

01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:34.905
and we make the rotating
wave approximation.

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:53.588
The Hamiltonian has
three lines, three parts.

01:16:57.950 --> 01:17:12.400
One is we describe each of the
laser fields as a single mode.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.970
I call the frequency
now omega a and omega c,

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.600
just to connect it with
the operator c dagger, c.

01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:37.120
For the atom, we use the
matrix, two by two matrices,

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:45.530
so this is the matrix if the
atom is in the ground state.

01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:50.270
Coherences are
described by that.

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:55.930
And of course, without any
interaction with the laser

01:17:55.930 --> 01:18:01.405
field, the atomic Hamiltonian is
atoms are in the ground state.

01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:16.150
the state f has zero energy.

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:18.500
We use that as the
origin of the energy.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:23.620
The state g has an
eigenenergy of omega gf,

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:31.590
and the excited state e has
an eigenenergy of omega ef.

01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:38.120
But now the important
part is that we

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.100
want to have the coupling.

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:43.630
And actually, I realized I
was not saying it correctly.

01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:50.220
Omega 1 and omega 2, these are
the Rabi frequencies of the two

01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:54.960
fields, and the two fields are
at frequency omega a and omega

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.220
c.

01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:03.470
So now we have the coupling
between the excited state

01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:07.800
and the ground state via
photons a and a dagger.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:18.940
And the coupling happens at
the Rabi frequency omega 1.

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:22.110
And then we have the
second laser field,

01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:23.770
which is at Rabi
frequency omega 2.

01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:41.930
We have the atomic raising
and lowering operator,

01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:45.900
and we have the
photon c and c dagger.

01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:50.860
That's a nice Hamiltonian.

01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:52.105
It has three lines.

01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:02.130
The important part here, which
we have explicitly assumed

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:08.610
is that each of the lasers, a
and a dagger, c and c dagger,

01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:13.160
are only driving one transition.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.490
One field is responsible
for connecting the state f

01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:18.950
to the excited state.

01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:21.440
The other field is responsible
for connecting the state

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.470
g to the excited state.

01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:26.020
In practice, this
can be accomplished

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:28.340
by you have maybe polarization.

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:31.510
This is a plus one state,
this is a minus one state,

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:33.810
and the excited
state is m equals 0.

01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:36.610
Then one laser
beam is sigma plus,

01:20:36.610 --> 01:20:39.860
the other one is sigma
minus, so it can be polarized

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:42.040
and the two laser
beams can only talk

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.790
to one of the ground states.

01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:48.050
Or you can have a situation
that you have a huge energy

01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:49.030
separation.

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:51.140
Let's say you have a
large hyperfine splitting

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:53.215
and the two lasers are
separated by frequency.

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:01.970
I think I've set the stage,
but I think I should stop here

01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:04.650
and on Wednesday, I'll show
you in the first few minutes

01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:07.520
of the class that
this Hamiltonian has

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:10.610
a simple solution, which
is a dark state, which

01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:13.540
is a superposition
state of g and f.

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:14.240
Any questions?

01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:19.402
See you on Wednesday.

01:21:19.402 --> 01:21:21.610
A few people haven't picked
up their midterm quizzes.

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:24.550
If you want them,
I have them here.
