00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.600
PROFESSOR: OK,
let's get started.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.780
Last class, which
also means last week,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.465
we discussed what
happens when atom

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:34.560
are exposed to external fields.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.550
Well, you would
say, isn't it enough

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.190
if you understand
atoms in isolation?

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.470
Well, not quite.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.670
Because whenever we want to
talk to the atoms, whenever

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.150
we want to manipulate them
or find out in what states

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.680
they are, we have to
apply external fields.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.555
The way how we
communicate with atoms

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.071
is through electric, magnetic,
and electromagnetic fields.

00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:00.570
And therefore, we
have to understand

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.630
what happens to the
structure of atoms

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.330
when we expose them
to such fields.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.690
We started out with
structure in magnetic fields.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.060
And if I just show
you this picture,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.010
this is what we
discussed last week.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.160
However, I noticed
that our discussion

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.850
with the different
coupling cases--

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.990
fine structure plus magnetic
field, hyperfine structure,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.900
strong fields, weak fields.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.490
I noticed that when I was
teaching, it's a lot of details

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.040
and it looks a little bit messy.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.680
So what I want to do, therefore
at the beginning of today,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.380
is I want to give
you sort of a summary

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.130
that you see the bigger picture.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.060
That you see beyond the details,
that what I actually taught you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.360
about atoms in magnetic field
is some paradigmatic example

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.620
of quantum physics.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.540
What happens if you have two
different terms in Hamiltonian

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.570
and you have to interpolate
between one and the other?

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.790
But before I do that, do
you have any questions

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.754
about magnetic fields,
magnetic structure?

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.965
Well, then let's try to
summarize as follows.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.300
What we have is we
have a Hamiltonian.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.740
And it has one part, the
hyperfine interaction,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.970
which depends on
I dot J. And then

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.860
it has an external
magnetic field part.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.360
And what couples to the
magnetic field, which we assume

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.565
is in the J-direction--
in the z-direction

00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:20.310
are the z-components
of the magnetic moment.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.210
And the z-component
of the magnetic moment

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.410
are proportional to the
mJ or mI quantum number,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.590
to the magnetic quantum number,
of the atom and the nucleus.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:55.130
So in a weak field, it is
the hyperfine structure

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.690
which dominates.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.970
So in a weak field,
we first solve

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.470
for the hyperfine structure.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.830
And then we use
the eigenfunction

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.570
of the hyperfine structure.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.530
And the eigenfunction of
the hyperfine structure

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:23.660
have the quantum number F where
J and I have coupled to F.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.530
And then we treat the
magnetic Zeeman Hamiltonian

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.510
perturbatively.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.350
And that led us
to the formulation

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.890
of the Lande g-factor, gF.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:49.040
The other case is
the strong field case

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.775
where the magnetic
field dominates.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.470
Then, we simply solve for
the hyperfine structure

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.430
in the magnetic field.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.070
It's one of those rules in
quantum physics, or in physics,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.740
or maybe even in life,
first things first.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.170
You should first take
care of the big things.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.450
And this is now
the magnetic field.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.450
And since the magnetic
field Hamiltonian

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.520
is diagonalized when we
have eigenfunctions where

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.900
mJ and mI are good
quantum numbers,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.430
this is sort of-- if you
ignore the hyperfine coupling,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.130
this is the exact [INAUDIBLE]
of the Zeeman term.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.770
And then in
perturbation theory, we

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.250
look for the hyperfine coupling.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.100
And well, we do
perturbation theory

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.060
in eigenfunctions
with mI and mJ.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.600
And that means if you
have the I dot J term,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.340
it is only the component
mI mJ which remains.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.650
So I've given you
those two cases.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.540
Now, what you should also
learn here in this example

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.390
is the language which we use.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.240
And sometimes, I would
say, the language

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.270
can be more confusing
than the equations.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.960
What we say here is we
say that the angular

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.980
momentum of the electron
and of the nucleus

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.580
are coupled to the
magnetic field axis.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.350
They are quantized.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.520
The approximate
eigenstates are those

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.710
which have a specific quantum
number in the z-direction

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.620
because the magnetic field
points to the z-direction.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.500
So we're saying I and J are
strongly coupled to the z-axis

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.010
by the magnetic field.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.340
And then we treat
the coupling of I

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.085
and J with each other
in perturbation theory.

00:06:48.085 --> 00:06:52.660
Whereas in the previous case,
we say I and J strongly couple.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.800
And when I and J
strongly couple,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.760
F becomes a good quantum number.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.970
And that means I
and J both precess

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.070
around the axis of the
total angular momentum f.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.920
And therefore, we say
I and J couple to F.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.790
And then we solve for
this coupling of F

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.360
to the magnetic field
in a second step.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.100
But I hope you see that
there's two limiting cases.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.840
We can exactly
diagonalize one term,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.520
and then we perturbatively
add on the result

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.120
for the second term.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.570
Of course, in the
age of computers

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.230
I could have simply written down
for you a Hamiltonian and said,

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.400
well, it has to be
numerically diagonalized.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.880
What I discussed instead
were the two limiting cases.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:55.650
Now, this discussion
now allows me

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:02.470
to discuss what happens when
we go to even stronger fields.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.940
Well, when we go to
even stronger fields,

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.440
then we may have
fields which are

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.230
even stronger than the
fine structure coupling,

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.770
the coupling of the
orbital angular momentum

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.970
of the electron and the
spin angular momentum to J.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.550
And well, without even any
deviation, which is obvious,

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.500
you know what happens now
is that each component which

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.580
provides magnetic moment--
the spin, the orbital angular

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:37.130
momentum, and the nucleus-- the
dominant term for each of them

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:43.490
is the coupling to
the magnetic field.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:51.726
So in strong magnetic fields,
these are the eigenstates.

00:08:51.726 --> 00:08:57.490
The eigenstates are
labeled by mI, mL, mS.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:03.100
So we have taken care of
the strong coupling term.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:09.900
And now in addition, we are now
treating in perturbation theory

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.860
some fine structure coupling,
but the quantum numbers

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:22.770
are already distributed,
mL, mS. There

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.870
is a coupling
become between mI mS

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.310
and a coupling
between mI and mL.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.690
So this is sort of
the limiting cases.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.140
But as a general illustration
of quantum mechanics,

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:59.100
I thought this was a nice
example for a Hamiltonian

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:08.990
where we have different scalar
products, like B times S,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:19.360
B dot L, S dot L, I dot J.
And the question is, how do we

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.460
take care of those
different parts

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.050
because they do not commute?

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.820
Of course, the theorist
would just say,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.860
I simply diagonalize
it and that's it.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.210
But if you want to
develop intuition,

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.410
then you have to discuss
the limiting cases.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.860
And in particular, the approach
which allows an intuitive

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:44.210
understanding is
first things first.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:52.020
And we first treat the
stronger terms and then

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.480
the weaker terms.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.040
And we can quantitatively
derive, analytically derive

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.800
expressions, for instance,
for the Lande g-factor

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.000
in this vector model.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.720
This vector model
assumes, so to speak,

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.760
that a state which has
an eigenfunction of mJ

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.080
rapidly precesses
around the z-axis.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.550
And this vector
model actually allows

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.530
you to do easy
calculation without

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.655
Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.060
So the concept of
the vector model

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:39.490
is rapid precession for
transverse components

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:47.590
and projecting of vectors
onto the axis around which you

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:48.610
have rapid precession.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:12:00.190
But this is simply a
tool to do calculations

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:06.615
without the explicit use of
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.870
OK, so this is what
I wanted to tell you

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.660
about atoms in magnetic field.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.315
Any questions?

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:36.290
OK then, we can actually move
onto atoms in electric field.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.750
But before we do that, we
should have some clicker

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.670
questions about atomic
structure and atoms

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.110
comes in external
magnetic fields.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.960
So get out the clickers.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.900
So the first questions take us
back to electronic structure.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:27.440
It's a question about,
how do wave functions,

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.880
how does density, and
how does inverse size

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.440
scale with principal
quantum number?

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.340
So the first
question is, how does

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:44.180
1/r, 1 over the size of the
electronic wave function,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.490
how does it scale with n?

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.852
1/n, 1 over n squared,
1 over n cubed.

00:14:01.851 --> 00:14:02.350
OK.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.980
OK, yes.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.720
It's 1 over n squared.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.780
But I would have
hope that 100% of you

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.210
would know it because 1
over is the Coulomb energy.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.460
The Coulomb energy is
1/2 of the total binding

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.480
energy because of
the Virial theorem.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.610
So when you see 1/r, there
should be a flash in your head

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.320
which says energy.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.980
And Rydberg energy
is 1 over n squared.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.721
The energy levels of hydrogen
are 1 over n squared.

00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:41.220
OK.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.030
Yeah, next question.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.130
How does psi 0 of
0 square, how does

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.580
the density of the
electron at the origin

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.570
scale with principal
quantum number?

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.890
1/n, 1 over n squared, 1
over n cubed, or 1 over n

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:04.540
to the sixth?

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.940
OK, yes, very good.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.040
So what I try to
remind you here is

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.790
that there are two
different radii.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:31.270
There is one radius which
scales with n squared.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.240
But if you calculate the
density at the origin,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.790
if you would say, well,
r scales with n squared.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.741
The volume scales
with n to the sixth.

00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:41.740
And then you would say
the density scales with n

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.660
to the minus 6, you're wrong.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.460
And we had a discussion that
there are two different lengths

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.325
case in the hydrogen atom and
in hydrogenic wave function.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.010
One scales with n squared and
the other ones scales with n.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.310
And therefore, the density at
the origin is n to the minus 3.

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:03.460
Good.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.210
Next question, from
hydrogen to helium.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.892
In helium, for the same
electronic configuration, ,

00:16:13.892 --> 00:16:17.310
are singlet or triplet
states more tightly bound?

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.910
So we talked about a shift
or splitting between singlet

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.430
and triplet states.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.970
Which way does it go?

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.720
You want to try again?

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.610
For the same electronic
configuration--

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.531
the ground state has
only one configuration.

00:16:59.531 --> 00:17:01.280
It has only one state
in the ground state.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.660
But now we go to the excited
state, to the excited states,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.480
and there are a number of
excited states because they

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.109
have the same
configuration, but they

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.100
can be classified by
singlet and triplet states.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.566
OK, we are converging.

00:17:26.566 --> 00:17:29.270
It is the triplet state.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.400
Some people are confused when
they think about molecules.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.530
usually, in molecules
the singlet state

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.090
is more tightly bound
than the triplet state.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.790
But the magic word is for the
same electronic configuration.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:45.780
You can have one orbital
filled with two electrons only

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.390
in a singlet state because of
the Pauli exclusion principle.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.890
It is only in the
first excited state

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.000
or in an excited
state of a molecule

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.590
or of the helium atom that you
have two orbitals, 1s and 2s.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.670
And you can now put the
electrons in with the same spin

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.660
or with opposite spin.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.590
So usually, it's only
in an excited state

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.840
that the question singlet
versus triplet arises.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.430
And then in the
excited state manifold,

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:18.640
the triplet state is lower
because it has a symmetric spin

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.450
wave function and anti-symmetric
spatial wave function.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.716
OK, the next question.

00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:30.590
OK, so we understand
now there's a difference

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.110
between triplet
and singlet state

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:36.030
in excited states for the
same electronic configuration.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:42.170
And the question is, what is
the origin of the energy which

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.600
is splitting the singlet
from the triplet state?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.010
Magnetic energy,
spin-spin interactions,

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.315
or electrostatic interactions?

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.280
Yes, the Coulomb interaction
is electrostatic interactions.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.560
We discussed the singlet-triplet
splitting and the structure

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.640
of helium without any magnetic
or spin-dependent interaction.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.570
All we had is the
Coulomb interaction.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.320
And in the triplet state, which
is the symmetric spin state,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.500
the spatial wave function
has to be anti-symmetric.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.300
In the singlet state,
the spatial wave function

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.640
has to be symmetric.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.700
And the symmetric and the
anti-symmetric spatial wave

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.300
function have a
different Coulomb energy.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.820
So the spin through the
anti-symmetry through the Pauli

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.000
exclusion principle
determines the symmetry

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.730
of the electronic wave function.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.320
And it is then purely
the Coulomb energy.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.090
That's why the singlet-triplet
splitting is so big.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.140
Because it's not magnetic,
it's Coulomb in origin.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.930
OK, next question.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:10.000
Which interaction
reflects-- oops,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.510
maybe you want to still read it.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:23.890
Which interaction reflects that
the potential between nucleus

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:28.260
and electron is not exactly
a Coulomb potential 1/r?

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.440
We've usually discussed
Schrodinger equation, hydrogen,

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.060
Bohr model for an
exact 1/r potential.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.550
But then we discussed
a lot of phenomena.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:43.835
And I want you to figure out
now, which of those choices

00:20:43.835 --> 00:20:47.430
mean, in essence that you
do not have a 1/r potential?

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.330
OK, we have three choices.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.610
So the volume isotrope
effect, I think,

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.200
is a no-brainer, is trivial.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.130
It means explicitly
that the nucleus is not

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.910
a point, has an extended
volume, and that

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.940
means inside the nucleus
the electron is not

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.500
experiencing a 1/r potential.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.010
So it's clear that
C is always correct.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.740
The Lamb shift is
actually causing

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:51.030
a deviation from a 1/r
potential because-- well,

00:21:51.030 --> 00:22:00.220
both the vacuum
polarization and the-- well,

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.150
you can go ahead
and say, the fact

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.940
that we have QED, that
we have other modes

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.920
of the electromagnetic
field mean

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.940
that there's a deviation
from the 1/r potential.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.960
The interesting question
is the Darwin term.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.840
And the people who clicked
D included the Darwin term.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.600
That's a little bit trickier
because I explained the Darwin

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.970
term as Zitterbewegung,
as this trembling motion

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.470
of the electron which smears
out the 1/r potential.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:32.250
So you would think coming
from the non-relativistic

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.810
Schrodinger equation, that
there is an effect which

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:38.350
is smearing out
the 1/r potential.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.650
On the other hand,
the Zitterbewegung,

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.490
the Darwin term,
is just one term

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.890
which is included in
the Dirac equation.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.680
And the Dirac equation,
which includes fine structure

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.830
and relativistic energy
corrections and the Darwin term

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.910
is an exact
relativistic formulation

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.960
of the 1/r potential.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:15.470
So in other words, I would say
the correct answer is E. The

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.970
people who included
the Darwin term,

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:24.210
I would say the
Darwin term is not

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.730
a deviation of the 1/r potential
because it's simply a way

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.070
to explain what is the
result of the Dirac equation.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:36.650
The Dirac equation uses
exactly the 1/r potential

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.180
without any corrections.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.340
So you can say that if
you want to understand

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.010
the relativistic solution
to the 1/r problem,

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:50.150
you include a term which in
the non-relativistic equation

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.820
slightly changes the
Coulomb potential.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.970
Questions about that?

00:23:57.665 --> 00:23:58.165
OK.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.820
Fine structure.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.810
The fine structure
affects only states with L

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.235
equals 0 through
a coupling term L

00:24:16.235 --> 00:24:23.965
dot S. Is this statement,
the way how it is written,

00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:24.960
true of false?

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:54.420
I would say it's false
because the fine structure has

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.700
three contributions--
the Darwin term,

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:03.621
the relativistic kinetic energy
contribution, and this L dot S

00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:04.120
term.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.920
And it effects all
states, also the S states,

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.590
through the Darwin term
and the relativistic energy

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.120
contribution.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.659
So the fine structure is more
than just an L dot S term.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:32.490
Next question is for L equals
0, the orbiting electron

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.390
creates a magnetic field.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:38.140
And spin orbit interaction
can be simply regarded

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:44.460
as the energy of the electron's
spin in this magnetic field.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.810
Would you say that this
sentence is true or false?

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.210
I thought it's true,
but maybe people

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.430
want to tell me what is
false about the statement?

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.790
Maybe the first sentence
people did-- tell me,

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.340
the orbiting electron
creates a magnetic field.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.148
Yes.

00:26:34.148 --> 00:26:38.594
AUDIENCE: I said false for
this because I normally

00:26:38.594 --> 00:26:41.558
would picture that from the
electron's frame of reference,

00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:43.534
the nucleus creating
a magnetic field

00:26:43.534 --> 00:26:45.487
is the magnetic
field [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:45.487 --> 00:26:48.070
PROFESSOR: OK, the second part,
that there is a magnetic field

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.569
and it's been
orbiting the action is

00:26:49.569 --> 00:26:52.410
the energy of the electron
spin in this magnetic field

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.210
is probably generally accepted.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.860
But the first question is,
does the orbiting electron

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.050
create the magnetic field?

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.510
Well, we have the two options.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:06.650
We can say the electron
moves and in its own frame

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.670
there is a v cross e term.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.870
And therefore, magnetic field.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:14.010
So we can say that the
electron's motion creates

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.930
a magnetic field
in its own frame

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.850
for the relativistic
transformation.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.600
So in that sense, it is correct.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.870
but I would also side
with you that there

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.800
is an alternative view of
saying in the electron's flame,

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.250
the nucleus rotates
around the electron.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.102
And it's the nucleus which
creates the magnetic field.

00:27:32.102 --> 00:27:34.310
In the end, it's the relative
motion between the two.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.110
Well, isn't it a good
thing that we are not

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:42.310
giving scores on that?

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:46.110
So yes, if you
want, you everybody

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.320
can feel that you have
given the right answer.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.210
Oh, yeah.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.710
In Dirac-- that should
be easy, but it's just

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.030
a warm-up question for the
next one-- which states

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.850
are degenerate in Dirac theory?

00:28:03.766 --> 00:28:04.890
And you have a few choices.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.150
That should be easy.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.700
Yeah, it's the S 1/2 and P 1/2.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.950
Dirac theory does not lift
the degeneracy between states

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.910
with the same J, 1/2 and 1/2.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:50.118
But between 1/2 and 3/2
states, there is, actually,

00:28:50.118 --> 00:28:52.493
the fine structure splitting,
which we've just discussed.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:00.380
OK, the next question
is, what effects lift now

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.866
the degeneracy between the 2
S 1/2 and the 2 P 1/2 term?

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.770
OK, we have three candidates--
the Lamb shift-- well, the Lamb

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:43.050
shift is famous and the Lamb
shift was discovered because it

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.620
splits the degeneracy
between the two.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:52.000
QED corrections have different
effects on S 1/2 and P 1/2.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.130
The size of the proton
does also shift it,

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.520
because the size of the
proton-- the volume effect

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.630
is more important for S
states than for P states.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.760
Maybe the question is,
does the mass of the proton

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.030
lift the degeneracy?

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.660
No, it doesn't.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.650
It would just mean if your
nucleus has a finite mass,

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.790
you simply have a
two-body problem

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:21.005
with a reduced mass, which is
different from the bare mass

00:30:21.005 --> 00:30:22.160
of the electron.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.510
But nothing else is
changed, no degeneracies.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.190
It's as if the electron
has a different mass, which

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.880
is the effective mass.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:40.250
So the correct answer here is D.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.300
OK, four more questions.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.935
And this is about
hyperfine structure.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:31:03.810
So the question is, what-- well,
hydrogen in the ground state

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:05.280
has four states.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.560
Because the electron has a
spin up and down and the proton

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.570
has a spin up and down.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.600
And 2 times 2 is 4.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.930
So we're talking about
multiplicity of 4.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:20.770
And I'm asking you now about the
limits of high and low field.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.180
First at high fields,
then at low fields.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.680
And the question is, what
are the magnetic moments

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.550
of those hyperfine states?

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.650
And we neglect the
nuclear magneton

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:35.090
compared to the Bohr magneton.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:39.100
So what are t magnetic moments
of those hyperfine states

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.780
in units of the Bohr magneton?

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.110
Oh, yeah.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.470
What happens at high
magnetic fields?

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.800
Remember, at high
magnetic fields,

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.760
this is actually
the simpler case.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.960
Often, you think the low
magnetic field is simpler

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.590
because it connects more
with the isolated atom.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.520
But you should take
away the message

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.640
that high magnetic
fields are simple.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.830
Because in high magnetic
field, each spin

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.220
couplets to the
magnetic field by itself

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.830
because the coupling to the
strong magnetic field-- that's

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.780
the definition of a
strong magnetic field--

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.580
is stronger than the coupling of
the two spins with each other.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:05.240
So the problem I'm giving you
is that you have an electron

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.950
spin which can be
up and down and it

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.930
couples to the magnetic field.

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:11.830
And then we have
the nucleus spin,

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.725
but the magnetic
moment of the nucleus

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:17.920
is so small that we neglect it.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.520
So what are the
possibilities now?

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.310
Well, we have four
states of hydrogen

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.750
at high magnetic field.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.780
Two have the electron spin
up, nucleus spin up/down.

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.000
Two have the electron spin down.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.400
And then when the nucleus
spin is up or down

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.810
in those two states.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:37.250
So all the states at
high magnetic fields

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.890
have either the electron spin
up or the electron spin down.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.580
So therefore, the
correct answer is

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.930
A. We have two states where
the electron spin is up

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:50.600
and two states where the
electron spin is down.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.340
It's just a complicated
way of asking you,

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.260
what are the possible
energy levels

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.000
of an electron in
a magnetic field?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.150
And the answer is, well,
plus-minus 1 Bohr magneton

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.950
times the magnetic field.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:05.880
Questions about it?

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.389
OK.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:18.209
Now, we go to the
more complicated case,

00:34:18.209 --> 00:34:20.310
to low magnetic fields.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.007
And again, same question.

00:34:22.007 --> 00:34:24.340
What are the magnetic moments
of those hyperfine states?

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.870
So you have four states.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.870
The number of states, of
course, doesn't change.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.760
That's the dimension
of our Hilbert space.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.900
But now we are at
low magnetic field,

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.750
and what is the
magnetic moment, which

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.850
is nothing else than the
derivative of the energy

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.370
with respect to
the magnetic field?

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:09.310
Yes, the correct answer is
B. We have two manifolds,

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.620
one is F equals 1,
where one slope is 0

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.080
and one slope is plus-minus 1.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.340
And then we have an
F equals 0 state.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.930
So it is 1, minus 1, and 0, 0.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.320
OK.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.550
Let's now make it
more interesting.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:35.920
Let's replace the
proton by a positron,

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.580
the anti-particle
of the electron.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:42.610
So now we have a similar
situation, but what happens

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.260
now is, of course,
the contribution

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.440
to the magnetic moment form
the nucleus, which is now

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.975
the positron, is as
important as the contribution

00:35:50.975 --> 00:35:52.510
of the electron.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:56.320
So you have two spin
1/2's coupled now.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.620
One is positive,
one is negative.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:06.460
And you should figure out
again, what are the energies?

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.930
But before we talk about the
energies, let's first talk

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.860
about, how many
hyperfine states do

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.130
we have in the ground
state-- 1, 2, 3, or 4?

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.830
Yes, we have four
states because we

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.670
have two particles--
positron, electron.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.600
Each of them has
spin up, spin down.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.290
2 times 2 is 4.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:56.460
And therefore, we
have now four states.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:01.710
And the question is again, at
high and low magnetic fields,

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.710
what are the magnetic
moments of those states?

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.370
So we have four
states-- spin up,

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:12.600
spin down-- of the
electron and the positron.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.320
And the question is, what
are the magnetic moments

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.510
of those hyperfine states?

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.312
D is correct.

00:37:45.312 --> 00:37:50.040
We have 1/2, spin 1/2.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.210
If the two couple like
up-up and down-down,

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.500
we have the maximum spin.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.800
But since one particle is
positive, one is negative,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.280
when the spins are aligned,
the angular momenta

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.900
are anti-aligned.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.730
And therefore, the
magnetic moment is 0.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:12.440
So when they couple parallel,
the magnetic moment is 0.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.980
When they couple anti-parallel,
the two magnetic moments

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.520
of one Bohr magneton
each add up,

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.007
and we have either 2 or minus
2 as the magnetic moment.

00:38:25.577 --> 00:38:26.160
Any questions?

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.020
Then finally, the last question.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:38.680
Same situation, positronium,
but now at low magnetic fields.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:50.270
What are the magnetic moments
of the four hyperfine states

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:52.750
of positronium at
low magnetic field?

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.770
All right.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:28.210
Let's discuss it.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.910
What is the structure
of the ground

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:33.101
state at low magnetic field?

00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:35.350
What is the good quantum
number at low magnetic field?

00:39:39.823 --> 00:39:40.820
AUDIENCE: F.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.489
PROFESSOR: F. It's hydrogen.

00:39:42.489 --> 00:39:43.280
It's like hydrogen.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.230
1/2 and 1/2.

00:39:46.775 --> 00:39:50.850
If we have an S of 1/2 of the
electron, the I of the positron

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.000
is also 1/2.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.960
And 1/2 and 1/2 couple to F.
And what are the values for F?

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.990
F equals 1 and F equals 0.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.570
OK, what is the magnetic
moment of the F equals 1 state?

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:22.700
In order to get F equals
1 out of 1/2 and 1/2,

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.450
you have to align the spin of
the electron with the positron.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:29.660
So the F equals 1/2
state is the state where

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.440
the two spins are aligned.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.111
What is the magnetic
moment or this state?

00:40:35.111 --> 00:40:35.610
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:36.290
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.920
How many states are in
the F equals 1 manifold?

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.630
What's a multiplicity
of F equals 1?

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:47.520
3.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.360
Plus, minus 1 and 0.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.930
So we have an F
equals 1 state which

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.560
has angular momentum
but no magnetic moment,

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.480
and it has a multiplicity of 3.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.230
So three states have
0, 0 magnetic moment.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:05.180
In other words, you
would expect an F equals

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:13.280
1 state to have this
kind of Zeeman structure.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.260
But because of the special
situation in positronium,

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.580
the Zeeman structure
is like this.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.010
There is no linear effect.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.380
It's a quadratic effect.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:26.710
All three states
start out with 0 slope

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:30.450
because as long as the
spins couple to F equals 1

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:32.610
and we don't have a
magnetic field messing up

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.660
with the coupling, the
magnetic moment is 0.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.000
OK, now what happens in the
fourth state, which is F

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.670
equals 0?

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:45.240
In the fourth state,
which is F equals 0,

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:50.540
the two spins couple in
an anti-parallel way.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.340
So now, what is
the magnetic moment

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.540
when the two spins couple
in an anti-parallel way?

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:00.950
The spins subtract.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:04.200
But because of the different
charge, plus and minus,

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.690
the magnetic moments
would add up.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.290
That's what we just discussed
in the high field case.

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:13.860
So you would think the F equals
0 state has a magnetic moment.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.840
But in an F equals 0 state,
it cannot point anywhere

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.560
because the angular
momentum is 0.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.990
And therefore, in a most
trivial way, this is hydrogen

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.360
and this is positronium.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.700
So positronium has
four hyperfine states.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:36.210
And the slope of all four,
for the reasons discussed,

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:37.080
is all 0.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:44.790
So sorry, A is the correct
answer, without any ambiguity

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:45.530
this time.

00:42:57.635 --> 00:42:58.135
OK.

00:43:12.877 --> 00:43:13.460
Any questions?

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.010
OK, then let's talk about
atoms in electric field.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:34.220
We start out in--
we put the atoms

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:40.590
in a uniform electric field.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:43.870
Again, we assume that it
points in the z-direction

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.790
and its magnitude is epsilon.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:56.750
And we want to ask, what
is the electrostatic energy

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:59.770
in this electric field?

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:07.980
And we are using the fact
that electrostatic energy can

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.265
be expanded in a
multi-pole expansion.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:24.760
We have a monopole term,
we have a dipole term,

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.470
and we have a quadratic term.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:44.180
So the charge, of course,
is-- the atom, itself,

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.020
is a neutral atom.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.620
So there is no monopole term.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.970
The linear term in
the electric field

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:58.260
would correspond to a
permanent dipole moment.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.940
And I will remind you in
a moment that this is 0.

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:07.030
And then the term which
provides us with a stark effect,

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:11.950
with the energy shift of
atoms in electric field will

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:18.260
be the third term here,
which is characterized

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.520
by the polarizability alpha.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:30.620
And it corresponds to an
induced dipole moment.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.770
That there is an
induced dipole moment,

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:35.940
which is alpha times epsilon.

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.420
And then the induced
dipole moment

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.400
interacts with the
electric field.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.800
And that gives then, epsilon
times epsilon-- epsilon

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.300
squared.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:53.090
So this would be a classical
multi-pole expansion.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:46:00.190
And we will now derive
results quantum mechanically.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:09.230
The perturbation operator for
us is the dipole operator.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:10.870
And that could, in
principle, include

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:13.240
a permanent or an
induced dipole moment.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.100
So it would take care of
the second and third term,

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.910
the dipole operator and its
projection on the z-axis.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.380
So the dipole
operator is the charge

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.960
of the electron
times the position.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:40.150
And as long as
the polarizability

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:41.620
and the situation is isotropic.

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:46.940
A minus sign.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.270
Minus E is the charge.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:51.910
If you apply an electric
field in the z-direction,

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:55.050
all the relevant dipole
moments are in the z-direction.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.290
For anisotropic materials, you
could have an electric field

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.850
in the z-direction and
the dipole moment points

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:05.055
at an angle, but we do not have
such a situation for our atoms.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:13.190
OK, so the operator
is then simply

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.170
charge of the electron,
the z-coordinate times

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.010
the electric field.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:24.760
And this has o parity.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.280
And that leads us
immediate to the result

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:32.740
when we have an atom
in an eigenstate n

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:38.800
and we ask, what is the
expectation value of H prime?

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.580
It is 0 because of parity.

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:50.390
So the answer is, we
have no permanent dipole

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:54.620
moment until we have
degenerate energy levels.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:58.140
If n is a non-degenerate
level, this matrix element

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.260
is 0 by the parity
selection rule.

00:48:05.606 --> 00:48:09.640
OK, now we want to do
perturbation theory.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.154
So our perturbation
operator is this.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.600
And since we have
the clickers, I just

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.100
want to ask you two
quick questions.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.740
I will do the
perturbation theory

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:48.840
and I will explain
everything, but maybe you

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.280
want to predict
the result, which

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.900
I want to derive in
the next 10 minutes.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:49:01.650
And the question is,
what will we actually

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:10.730
get for the expectation
value of H prime?

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:21.990
Will we get the expectation
value of the dipole operator

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:25.280
times the electric
field or will we

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.080
get the expectation value
of the dipole operator

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.520
times the electric field over 2?

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:39.590
And the next question
would be the same,

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:42.130
but what do we get for
the total Hamiltonian?

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.240
So these are the questions.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:49.200
I want to discuss with you
in the next 10 minutes,

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.020
simply using perturbation
theory, expectation values.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:57.030
Expectation values of the total
energy each, not plus H prime.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:01.170
But also, expectation values
of the electrostatic energy,

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.680
which is H prime.

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.630
And the question
is-- I mean, you

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:07.920
can say for
dimensionless units, what

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.360
we get is a dipole moment
times an electric field.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:17.130
And this is one of the
situation where factors of 1/2

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:18.920
are not just bookkeeping.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:24.340
Factors of 1/2 really
reflect interesting physics.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.210
And I want to sort of
highlight it by asking you,

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.970
what would you
expect what we get

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:38.550
for those expectation values
when we solve for atomic energy

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:44.140
levels in electric fields?

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.350
So we're discussing
first question 1.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.707
OK, let's go to question 2.

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.200
OK.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.460
Anyway, now I know
I'm not boring you

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:38.050
with the derivation I want
to give you in the next 10

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:38.890
minutes.

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.330
I want to give you
the answer right away

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.370
by drawing up
another problem where

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:46.860
maybe the answer
is more intuitive.

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:54.920
And this is we have a mass on a
spring with spring constant k.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.040
And now the equivalent
to the electric field

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:03.070
which we switch on is--
we switch on gravity.

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:10.800
And due to gravity, the object
zags by an amount delta z.

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:14.250
So the question is,
what is-- and delta z

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:16.160
is like the dipole moment.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:22.830
What is the gravitational
energy gained by the object

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:24.590
because it has fallen down?

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:28.160
It is zagging down
due to gravity.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:32.260
Well, I think you would
agree that the answer is,

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.590
it is mg times delta z.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:38.680
This is the work done by
gravity with a minus sign.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:43.320
So the expectation value of
the perturbation operator

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:45.340
is minus mg times delta z.

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.540
Or in electrostatic
units, it's simply

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:51.500
the dipole moment times
the electric field.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:58.800
But what happens is the-- so
this is gravitational energy.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:05.900
How much is the
total energy affected

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.396
when we switch on the
gravitational field?

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.620
1/2 of it, because
the negative energy

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:22.820
which is gained in the
gravitational field, 1/2 of it

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:25.790
is used to stretch the spring.

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:29.900
1/2 of it goes into the
internal energy of the system.

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:41.820
So therefore, the electrostatic
energy H prime-- H prime

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.520
is the operator of the
electrostatic energy.

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:48.700
The answer here is A.
But the total energy

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:52.090
is B because part
of the energy is

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:56.610
needed to stretch the spring.

00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:00.260
And as I want to show
you, stretching the spring

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:04.190
is-- we admix to the ground
state some excited state.

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:07.330
This costs energy, like
stretching the spring costs

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.150
energy.

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:12.300
And this is responsible for the
fact of which is exactly 1/2.

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.590
Well, I could stop here.

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:33.670
I think I've explained
it all, but let's follow

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:38.900
the usual-- the
standard approach.

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.140
And let's do second-order
perturbation theory

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:45.380
and calculate the energy,
calculate the dipole moment,

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:49.246
and see that everything
is as we expect now.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.500
So we want to do second-order
perturbation theory.

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:03.210
We know already the
first-order term is 0.

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:06.090
This was a discussion
about parity.

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:12.040
And in second-order
perturbation theory,

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:17.700
the state n has an energy,
which is the unperturbed energy.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:23.320
And then in second-order,
we have the matrix element

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.450
to all other states.

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:27.880
We square it.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:33.960
We divide by the
energy denominator.

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.930
We sum over all states m,
but I make a prime here.

00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:41.240
Of course, we are
not summing over

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.390
the state-- we exclude
n from the summation.

00:55:51.236 --> 00:55:57.900
And the prefactor here
is electron charge

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.910
squared times electric
field squared.

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:04.730
OK, pretty much
that's the resulting

00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:07.270
second-order
perturbation theory.

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:09.690
So this is the
energy and we want

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:15.270
to relate the energy
to the dipole moment.

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:19.080
So the next step is
now we calculate d.

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:26.180
and we calculate d from the
first-order wave function

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:29.350
because we already get an effect
in first order and everything

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:32.360
here is about leading order.

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:46.580
So the expectation value
of the dipole operator--

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:51.040
so we take the expectation value
of the dipole operator and we

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:58.600
use the 0-th order,
the unperturbed state,

00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.660
plus the first-order correction.

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:09.990
And we know already that
the diagonal terms do not

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.880
contribute.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.930
This is a parity selection rule.

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:21.110
So we get contributions
from the course term,

00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:26.845
which is n0 the dipole
operator with n1.

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:36.166
So let's just suppress
vectorial notation.

00:57:36.166 --> 00:57:37.790
We know everything
is along the z-axis.

00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:47.620
So we have the 0-th
order wave function.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.790
Our operator is z.

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:54.540
And now we have to write down
the first-order correction

00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.970
to the wave function.

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:58.860
And the first-order
correction is

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:02.940
the sum over all other states.

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:06.440
We make an admixture
of the state m,

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:13.890
and this admixture
uses a matrix element.

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:15.740
And here, we have the
energy denominator.

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:28.070
So what we obtain is-- we
have the electron charge here

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:29.160
from the dipole moment.

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:33.790
We have the electron charge due
to the perturbation operator.

00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:36.430
So it's electron squared.

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:39.370
We have the electric field.

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:50.030
And then, this is due to
the admixture of the wave

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:52.120
function with the
dipole operator.

00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.640
And now because we
take the matrix element

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.950
of the dipole operator,
we get another occurrence

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:00.690
of the dipole operator.

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:03.840
So therefore, we do first-order
perturbation theory,

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.860
but we take the
first-order result

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:10.150
and ask, what is the expectation
value for the dipole moment?

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:12.450
And that means the
dipole operator,

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:16.140
or the perturbation
operator appears twice.

00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:18.230
And our result is as expected.

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:26.330
Quadratic in the
matrix element and it

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.650
has this energy denominator.

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:36.410
So the definition is that
a dipole moment is alpha

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:38.460
times the electric field.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.170
So therefore, all
that equals alpha.

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:52.360
And if you compare now the
result for the dipole moment

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.340
with the second-order
perturbation

00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:59.200
theory for the electric
field, for the energy,

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:05.620
we find-- here's a factor of
2, but there is no factor of 2

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:06.880
up there.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:23.530
We find that the energy or
the energy shift delta En,

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:26.960
it has exactly the same matrix
element as the polarizability.

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:36.560
It is-- yes.

01:00:39.885 --> 01:00:45.402
It is this, 1/2 alpha
epsilon squared.

01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:00.800
Since the perturbation operator,
I'm just writing it down here,

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.320
was dipole moment
times electron,

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:08.120
that means that the
energy shift is-- and this

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.820
is what we expected
now, is 1/2 times

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.350
the expectation value
of the dipole moment

01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:17.237
times the electric field.

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:28.220
So now we have obtained with a
quantum mechanical calculation

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:28.780
the result.

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:36.200
I told you that the energy
shift of the energy levels

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.158
is 1/2 the dipole moment
times the electric field.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:51.280
Let me just redo the
calculation in a way I like.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.790
And this is I want to
determine now the total energy,

01:01:56.790 --> 01:02:01.470
but sort the terms in a
little bit different way.

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:06.660
So I want to know, what is
the energy in our result?

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:13.370
And what we do is we are
calculating the energy

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:14.620
using our wave functions.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:34.890
We take the total Hamiltonian
and take the wave function.

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:48.120
So this leads us to three terms.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.470
One is the unperturbed energy.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:13.060
The unperturbed energy,
the energy contribution

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.460
of the first-order correction.

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:24.170
This is the part due to H0.

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:34.690
And the part due to
H prime is simply

01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:37.790
the dipole moment times
the electric field.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:48.420
So the first part is, of
course, simply the energy E0

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:52.760
times the norm of
the wave function n0.

01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:10.320
For the second term, we use the
first-order perturbation theory

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.040
for n1.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.250
This is our sum over m.

01:04:21.304 --> 01:04:24.130
Em minus E0.

01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:26.565
m H prime 0.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.410
Because n1 is on
either side, this

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:36.360
is the amplitude
of the state n1.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.860
We have to square it.

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:44.490
And since we calculate what is
the expectation value of H0,

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:46.420
we multiply with the energy Em.

01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:54.630
OK, so we are done.

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:56.700
We calculate the total energy.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.230
We get three terms.

01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:00.770
One is the unperturbed
energy, one

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:03.760
is the dipole energy
in the electric field,

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.100
and one is the extra term,
which I want to discuss.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:11.120
Actually, this term is
the internal energy,

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.015
which would correspond
to the stretching

01:05:13.015 --> 01:05:16.020
of the spring in Hooke's law.

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:21.890
Now, in order to show
it to you explicitly,

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:27.890
I want to use E0 equal
0 for the energy.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:31.210
Because then this term is 0.

01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:33.520
I can neglect this.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:39.520
And one of the squares,
1 over Em squared,

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.650
cancels with the Em.

01:05:51.396 --> 01:05:53.145
It confused me for a while.

01:05:53.145 --> 01:05:57.410
If I don't set E0 to 0,
the result looks different.

01:05:57.410 --> 01:06:01.950
But what happens is, if
you do perturbation theory,

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:05.100
there are certain issues with
the normalization of the wave

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.300
function.

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:11.720
And the wave function
n0 has to be--

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.420
the contribution if
you look at the wave

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.470
function in perturbation
theory of a state,

01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:21.960
the 0-th order wave function
has an amplitude of 1.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:26.230
And this amplitude of 1 only
changes in second order.

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:29.670
So since I'm doing a
second-order calculation here,

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:32.290
I have to include those
non-standard terms.

01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:36.640
But I can also bypass
it by setting E0 to 0,

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.720
then the second-order term
in the norm doesn't matter.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.440
So in other words,
if you set E0 to 0,

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.920
you make your life easier.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.652
If you do not set
E0 to 0, you have

01:06:46.652 --> 01:06:48.610
to include some more
terms in your calculation.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:07:04.344
But the result is--
just one second.

01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:14.270
But yeah, the result which
I wanted to emphasize

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:15.820
is this one here.

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.770
It is a positive energy.

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:23.910
You can immediately inspect
that t positive energy

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:29.170
is the dipole moment times
the electric field over 2.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:45.900
This is exactly
analogous to the energy

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.270
of the spring in the
gravitational problem.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.360
So in other words, this is
the energy, internal energy,

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.050
because we admix excited
states to the ground state.

01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:00.400
This crosses energy
and it exactly

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:07.638
accounts for the occurrence
of the factors of 1/2.

01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:13.580
Anyway, this is just
the standard theory

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:17.600
of the DC stark effect of
the atomic polarizability,

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.260
but I put a little
bit of emphasis

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:21.439
on those factors
of 1/2 and tried

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:25.130
to explain in greater
detail the contributions

01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:28.010
to the AC stark effect--
to the DC stark effect

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:30.339
which come from the
electrostatic energy

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:34.000
and which come from
the internal energy.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:34.500
Questions?

01:08:38.955 --> 01:08:39.980
Yes.

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:40.604
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:08:40.604 --> 01:08:42.915
I have a study question.

01:08:42.915 --> 01:08:49.350
What is allowing you to use
non-degenerate perturbation

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:51.825
theory?

01:08:51.825 --> 01:08:55.330
What's the operator
that [INAUDIBLE]?

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:57.296
PROFESSOR: Well,
I'm looking-- what

01:08:57.296 --> 01:08:59.420
allows me to do non-degenerate
perturbation theory.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.250
Well, I assume we don't
have degeneracies.

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:05.200
If you would go to very high
Rydberg states-- and actually,

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.229
we do that not today,
but on Monday-- we

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:15.474
are looking at a situation where
the splitting between states

01:09:15.474 --> 01:09:20.720
of different L become so small
that the electric field mixes

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.920
them.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.290
Then, we have to do degenerate
perturbation theory.

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:29.240
And that means we get
now a linear term,

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.529
linear stark effect, not
a quadratic stark effect.

01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:35.505
Here, I would say we
are doing perturbation

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:37.020
theory of the ground state.

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:37.970
It's an S state.

01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:38.803
It's not degenerate.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:44.410
Maybe your question
is also addressing,

01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:46.569
but we have multiple
ground states.

01:09:46.569 --> 01:09:48.490
We have hyperfine structure.

01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:52.240
However, the electronics--
the stark effect,

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.040
the electric field does not
couple to the spin at all.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.460
So therefore, all the
magnetic energies--

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:02.420
the hyperfine energies
are completely unaffected.

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:05.690
And also, if we apply
an electric field,

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:12.280
all the hyperfine states
experience the same shift

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.850
and there is no
coupling between them.

01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:16.910
So also, we have
multiple ground states.

01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:18.660
We have hyperfine structure.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.995
It's a non-degenerate
problem because there

01:10:20.995 --> 01:10:24.550
is no coupling between the
different hyperfine states.

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:28.610
In other words, the theory
or the discussion of the DC

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:31.820
stark shift is you
have an S state,

01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.370
you couple with
an electric field,

01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:38.022
and there is no
degeneracy in the S state.

01:10:38.022 --> 01:10:38.970
Other questions?

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:48.450
Well, then we've
talked about alpha.

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:55.310
The only parameter which comes
out of this treatment is alpha.

01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:58.440
And now we want to
discuss, how big is alpha?

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.730
Or first, what are
the units of alpha?

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:12.280
Well, the units of alpha
were-- you can go back

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.230
to the second-order
perturbation result.

01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:18.630
But the units of alpha were
the charge, time [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:20.765
This was the dipole operator.

01:11:20.765 --> 01:11:23.330
It was squared.

01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:26.790
And in perturbation theory,
we divided by energy

01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:28.490
because we had an
energy denominator.

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:46.190
Well, we can write that as q
squared over l times l cubed.

01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:49.740
But q squared over l
is the Coulomb energy.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:53.180
And therefore, when I'm
interested in the units,

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:55.270
the units cancel.

01:11:55.270 --> 01:12:05.020
So therefore, we find that the
unit of the polarizability,

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.720
at least in [INAUDIBLE]
unit or atomic units, which

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.750
I've chosen here, is
simply the volume.

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:13.460
The question is, what volume?

01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:35.570
Well, if you would calculate
the polarizability for hydrogen,

01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:39.230
and simply make the assumption
that the only important matrix

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:42.490
element goes from
the S to the P state,

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:46.130
then we have a matrix element
which is on the order of

01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:47.400
[INAUDIBLE].

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.270
And the energy splitting
between the first ground state

01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:54.807
and first excited
state is three quarter

01:12:54.807 --> 01:12:55.807
of the Rydberg constant.

01:13:00.972 --> 01:13:14.470
So for hydrogen in the 1s state,
if you only use the coupling

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:22.410
to the 2p state, we find that
alpha is the Bohr radius cubed.

01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:27.380
And the prefactor is 2.96.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.820
If you do the summation
over all states,

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:33.430
the prefactor would
be 4.5 because there

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:36.620
are higher states, especially
continuum states, which

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.720
contribute to the sum.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.400
We have only five
minutes left, but that

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:09.320
allows me to show you that this
is not a coincidence that we

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:13.400
obtain-- here, what we obtain
is the Bohr radius cubed, which

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.590
is pretty much the volume
of the hydrogen atom.

01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:21.580
But we can now do
an approximation.

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.980
It's not really relevant,
but it has an historic name--

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.840
[INAUDIBLE] approximation.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.975
It's just nice to show
how things work out.

01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:36.105
We have a second-order
matrix element,

01:14:36.105 --> 01:14:41.360
so we couple the state n with
the operator z to a state m.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:47.720
But if we assume that all energy
denominators can be taken out

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.420
of the summation by
assuming that we have

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:57.170
some kind of average
excited energy,

01:14:57.170 --> 01:15:00.590
then the sum of--
maybe I should have

01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:11.670
said it the sum m z
n, which we sum over m

01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:15.020
and it just cancels out.

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:19.270
So what we have is, if
you take the energy,

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:23.170
an average energy denominator
out of the summation,

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:27.530
what we find is
that what matters

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.560
is the matrix element z squared.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:39.340
And we can even assume that
in the energy denominator,

01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:42.370
the excited state
energy is negligible.

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:45.790
The hydrogen atom has a
binding energy of 1 Rydberg

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:48.910
and the first excited state
has a quarter Rydberg.

01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:53.590
So at the 25% level,
we can set that to 0.

01:15:53.590 --> 01:16:07.160
So I'm waving all my hands, but
I'm getting a simple expression

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.090
for the polarizability
in the ground state.

01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:15.330
And this goes as follows--
the ground state energy is--

01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:18.110
we have discussed
Coulomb energy, Virial's

01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:20.870
theorem, and all that.

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:24.360
We need just 1/r in
the ground state.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:30.010
And for the z squared
matrix element,

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:35.290
we can simply say for
an S state that it

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:38.350
is x squared y
squared z squared.

01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:42.090
It is 1/2 of r squared
in the ground state.

01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:47.530
So therefore, continuously
waving our hands

01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:53.940
and making approximations, we
find that the polarizability

01:16:53.940 --> 01:17:00.500
is r squared expectation
value divided by an r

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.800
to the minus expectation value.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.720
So this is some r
cubed expectation

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.916
value which is an atomic value.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.710
So you see the nature of
the perturbation expression

01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:27.350
suggests that cannot be anything
else than the atomic volume.

01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:30.940
I sort of like that because when
people discuss, for instance

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:34.340
in my group, does
lithium or rubidium

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.600
have a bigger polarizability?

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.170
Well, the bigger atom
has a bigger volume

01:17:40.170 --> 01:17:43.410
and the more fluffier atoms
have the larger polarizability.

01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:46.412
And that's pretty much
based on that result.

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:56.790
Now, let me finally
do a comparison.

01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:59.230
There is another
system for which

01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:01.320
you have done calculations
of the dipole moment.

01:18:04.170 --> 01:18:11.862
And this is in classical E
and M for conducting sphere.

01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:24.070
For conducting [INAUDIBLE]
electric field,

01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:27.320
you can exactly solve
the boundary conditions,

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.360
the boundary value problem,
get the electric field,

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.605
and find the dipole moment.

01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:44.580
And the exact result is
that the dipole moment

01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:52.900
is the electric field times
the cube of the sphere.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:56.960
So in other words, the dipole
moment, or the polarizability

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:00.170
of this sphere,
is-- and neglecting

01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:02.590
factors, which are
only factors of unity.

01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:08.180
The dipole moment-- sorry, the
polarizability of a conducting

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:11.890
sphere is the volume
of the sphere.

01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:15.040
The dipole moment
of a hydrogen atom,

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.250
or using [INAUDIBLE]
approximation

01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:21.030
for all simple atoms is
the volume of the atom.

01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:22.910
So I find it sort of
interesting that when

01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:25.710
it comes to dipole moments
and to polarizability,

01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:29.230
that atoms pretty
much behave like

01:19:29.230 --> 01:19:31.960
metallic-conducting
spheres of the same volume.

01:19:45.277 --> 01:19:45.860
Any questions?

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:53.310
OK, then let's stop here
and we meet again on Monday.
