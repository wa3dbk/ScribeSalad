00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.730
PROFESSOR: --afternoon.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.490
Our main subject for today
is the fine structure

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.450
of atoms, when spin couples and
we bring spin into the picture.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.750
And if time permits,
a Lamb shift.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.650
But before I get
started, I just want

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.512
to finish up our topic of the
last class, which was helium.

00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:53.020
And I said for many,
many years, we only

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.240
discussed single electron atoms,
but I introduced the helium

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.840
atom into the curriculum because
there are two aspects which

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.680
are really new and
which we can learn

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.780
from helium with a
more simple example.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:17.080
One was the fact of
how the spin leads

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.540
to interactions even if nothing
couples directly to the spin.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.275
And we discussed it last
class that because we

00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:29.610
have singlet and triplet
states, they impose symmetry

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.440
or anti-symmetry onto the
spatial wave function.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.910
And that makes a big
difference in the energy.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.370
And it is sort of this
big Coulomb energy, which

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.810
is connected to spin,
which is actually

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.590
responsible for
magnetism in nature.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.190
The second aspect, the
second new feature,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.230
which is, of course,
also related to spin

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.400
is the presence of singlet
and triplet states.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.390
And it gives me an
opportunity-- and this

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.830
was the last point we
discussed on Wednesday--

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.490
to raise the question,
what can cause

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.400
a transition from
triplet to singlet?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:19.330
And at the end of
Wednesday's lecture,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.600
we discussed the question,
what kind of couplings

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.185
would allow you want to drive
a transition from triplet

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:28.860
to singlet?

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.060
And at least based on the
clicker result, for most of you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.080
the surprising answer was none.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.320
Optical fields, not.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.670
Rotating fields, not.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.980
Within the approximation
we have so far-- namely,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.060
just a Hamiltonian with
Coulomb interaction--

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.620
there is nothing
in the system which

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.100
connects the singlet
to the triplet world.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.050
Well, there is a
very weak transition,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.960
but the lifetime of
the triplet counts

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.750
it in helium, as I will
tell you a little bit later,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.220
is 8,000 seconds.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.760
It's extremely long life.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.770
We have an extreme form
of metastability here.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.300
Just an anecdote.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.920
In the early days
when people learned

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.380
about the structure of atoms,
they looked at spectra.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.050
And they never
found any line which

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.370
was connecting the singlet
states with the triplet states.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.780
So it looked like if there were
two different forms of helium,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.750
orthohelium and parahelium.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.690
So people even
believed for a while

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.880
there were two kinds
of helium in nature

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.290
because they seemed to be
completely disconnected.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.910
But as we know now,
of course, this simply

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.485
reflects the high
degree of metastability.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.750
I want to emphasize
before I give you

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.020
the general framework and the
symmetry, spatial symmetry

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.890
and spin symmetry,
and we discuss all

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.680
that in exchange
symmetry-- I want

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.960
to emphasize what I said
at the end of the lecture

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.900
on Wednesday.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.550
If you try to drive a transition
between singlet and triplet,

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.440
if you use a rotating magnetic
field, you can't do that.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.380
Because a rotating magnetic
field couples to the total

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.130
spin.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.375
It just makes the
total spin precess

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:34.080
around the axis of
the magnetic field.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.460
But what the magnetic
field will never do

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.570
is break up the relative
angle between the two spins.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.900
And in a triplet state,
the two spins are aligned.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.250
In the singlet states,
they are anti-aligned.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.590
And with a magnetic
field, you address

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.520
both spins simultaneously.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.840
They precess together,
and you can never

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.240
change the angle
between the two.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.120
So a singlet-triplet
transition really

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.630
requires that you go deeper.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.590
You really have a handle on the
spins relative to each other.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.530
Let me make a second comment
about the possibility

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.253
of doing an optical transition.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.610
An optical transition, at least
in the dipole approximation,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.530
has an electric field
acting on the dipole moment

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.710
of the electron.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.190
There is no spin involved.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.860
And let me sort of accentuate
it by saying, you should really

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.520
have in your mind that, at
least in dipole approximation,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.350
the laser, the light, optical
beams, do not couple to spin.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.350
The only couple to the spatial
part of the wave function.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.830
And that has important
consequences.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.900
In a lot of our research,
we do Raman transitions.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.700
And with a Raman transition,
we do spin flips.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.780
So how can a laser, or two
laser beams through a Raman

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.140
transition, flip the
spin if the laser is not

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.820
talking to the spin
degree of freedom?

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.255
Well, if you have
a Raman transition

00:06:18.255 --> 00:06:22.730
and you excite a state which
has spin orbit coupling,

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.360
you excite the atom.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.850
The spin does nothing
during the excitation.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.270
But then in the
intermediate state,

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.410
spin and angular momentum may be
coupled by spin orbit coupling.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.710
And the spin is
starting to precess

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.600
due to spin orbit coupling.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.160
And then the spin
rotates, and then

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.620
the second leg of
the Raman transition

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.810
transfers the atoms back
to the ground state,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.450
but now the spin has rotated.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.410
But it is never the laser
which rotates the spin.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.880
What should be immediately
clear from that

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.910
is if you try to
have a spin flip

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.820
Raman transition in an atom
which has no spin orbit

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.440
coupling don't
even look for that.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.230
It doesn't exist.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.330
Anyway, we just
encountered it here

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.660
and I want to tell
you that there is even

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.130
more general
consequences of that.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.750
But let's now go back
to the helium atom

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:24.310
and look at the
spatial symmetry which

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.250
comes, of course,
because operators

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.715
are symmetric with regard
to the two electrons.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:39.860
So what we have is we
have the total spin

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:45.650
is the sum of the spins of
electron 1 and electron 2.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:08:01.970
And all spin operators--
the spin operator s

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:09.566
and its components-- are
symmetric against particle

00:08:09.566 --> 00:08:10.065
exchange.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.150
In other words, if
you couple to the spin

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.860
through a magnetic field, you
couple to the two electrons

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.670
symmetrically.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.360
And therefore, you
have the selection

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.780
rule that only symmetric and
symmetric and anti-symmetric

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.559
and anti-symmetric
states couple.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:47.110
Or, to express the same result
in different words, both

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:56.540
the spatial and the spin
symmetry, each of them

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.249
can be symmetric
and anti-symmetric.

00:08:59.249 --> 00:09:01.540
Of course, the product of
them has to be anti-symmetric

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.600
because we're talking
about fermions.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.910
So both of these symmetries
are good quantum numbers.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:25.396
Or more formally, all
observables commute

00:09:25.396 --> 00:09:26.895
with the particle
exchange operator.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.230
So any arbitrary
observable commute.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.540
So the commutator of the
particle exchange operator

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.040
vanishes.

00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:04.755
OK.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.530
But now, what is special
to the approximation

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.970
in which we have treated helium?

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.130
As long as wave
functions and operators

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:22.200
separate into spin-dependent
and space-dependent parts.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.930
The wave function
had a spatial part,

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.180
and then we multiplied
with a spin wave function.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.180
So the wave function
factor-wise separated

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.810
into a spin part
and a spatial part.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:40.921
Also, the operators.

00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:42.420
If you have operator
for total spin,

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.200
if you have operator
for dipole moment,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.120
the operators are
either addressing

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.790
the spatial degree of freedom
or the spin degree of freedom.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.520
So as long as this
is the case, we

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.420
have an even extended
conservation law

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.800
for both spin exchange for
an exchange of the particles

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.030
in the spatial domain
and in the spin domain.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:21.560
So as long as wave
functions and operators

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:36.910
separate into spin and
space-dependent parts,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.080
then the particle
exchange operator

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:47.180
can be regarded as the product
of an exchange operator which

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.926
only acts on the
spatial wave function

00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:51.675
and on the spin part
of the wave function.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:04.450
And both quantum numbers
for spin exchange--

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.730
symmetric/anti-symmetric--
and for exchange of particles

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.960
in the spatial part
of the wave function,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.220
symmetric or anti-symmetric--
are conserved.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.750
So often, we discuss
symmetries and the reason

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.550
why something is
conserved because then we

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.770
can think about
how to evaluate it.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.480
Often, you can say,
conservation laws

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.350
are often written down just
as a way to think about.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.900
How can we break them?

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:53.020
And in this case, we can
break this symmetries

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.050
which doesn't allow transitions
between singlet and triplet.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.660
We have to break them to
get intercombination lines.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:08.490
So in order to get a singlet
to triplet transition,

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.401
it's only possible
when we violate

00:13:10.401 --> 00:13:12.025
the assumptions we
have just discussed.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.590
And of course, an assumption was
that the wave function factors

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.580
into spin part and spatial part.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.930
But when spin and
spatial wave functions

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.320
are mixed-- for
instance, by spin

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.630
orbit coupling-- then the
assumptions we have discussed

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.630
are no longer valid.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.000
So what we need
is, for instance,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.770
a mixing of spin and
spatial wave functions

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:56.905
by spin orbit coupling.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.800
Well, as we will
learn later today,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:13.270
spin orbit coupling
is, actually,

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.600
a relativistic effect.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.010
It naturally arises
in the Dirac equation.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:23.690
And it scales with-- the
nuclear charge is z to the 4.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.230
So therefore in helium,
it is very, very weak.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:46.000
Therefore, the triplet ground
state is extremely long-lived.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.860
The lifetime in helium
is 8,000 seconds.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.480
It's one of the most
longest-lived metastable states

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.250
you can imagine and which
you find in atomic physics.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:03.730
Now, since spin orbit coupling
becomes rapidly stronger

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:09.010
with nuclear charge, you would
expect the metastable lifetime

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.390
to be much shorter
for the analogous

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.100
state in the other rare gases.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.500
And indeed, the
other rare gasses

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.300
are on the order of 40 seconds.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.510
You have other atoms where you
have singlet and triplet lines.

00:15:34.832 --> 00:15:38.100
We need two electrons
and the two spins

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.920
can form singlet or triplet.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.670
So that naturally
also happens in atoms

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.470
which are in the second
column of the periodic table.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:54.360
Magnesium, calcium, strontium
have intercombination lines.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:05.910
And they are actually very
relevant in current research

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:11.625
because these are candidates
for atomic clocks.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.040
In those atoms--
magnesium, calcium,

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.130
strontium-- physics
is more complicated.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.660
The line width is
typically kilohertz.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.250
But that's probably
just what you want.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.270
If the line width is kilohertz,
the lifetime is millisecond.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.850
You still have a
matrix element that you

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.180
can drive the transition
and observe it.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.580
For an atomic clock, you
don't want a transition

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:50.270
which is thousands of seconds
or half the age of the universe

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.330
because it's too weak to be
observed, to weak to be driven.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.402
So intercombination
lines of kilohertz,

00:16:57.402 --> 00:16:59.110
line widths of few
hundred Hertz or such,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.200
are almost ideal for
optical atomic clocks.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.619
Any questions?

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:19.619
So maybe then I should just
entertain you for a few minutes

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:26.086
about, how do you measure
an 8,000 second lifetime?

00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:33.818
Well, there is a recent paper.

00:17:33.818 --> 00:17:34.460
Insert Picture.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:34.960
Desktop.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.730
There's a recent
paper a few years ago,

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.900
Physical Review
Letters, determination

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.570
of the lifetime of
metastable helium.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.970
Traditionally, people
have measured the lifetime

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.330
of metastable helium
in the following way.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.550
No, they haven't observed
helium for 8,000 seconds.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.400
Because if you have helium
in the metastable state,

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.200
maybe after a few seconds there
is some collisions-- collision

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.410
or deactivation.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.080
8,000 seconds, you
would just have

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.940
many, many systematic effects.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:19.960
What people did is
they put some atoms

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.420
into the metastable state,
measured the number of excited

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:28.550
atoms, and then-- maybe
during 100 milliseconds,

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.000
1 out of 80,000
atoms should decay.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.070
And by determining what
small fraction of the atoms

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.695
has decayed, or how
many photons you observe

00:18:37.695 --> 00:18:41.350
in 100 milliseconds divided
by the total number of atoms,

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.690
that's how you can
measure the lifetime.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.600
Of course, the
problem is, yes, you

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.020
can measure the
number of photons.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.061
But if you want to divide
by the number of atoms,

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:52.310
you have to know very accurately
how many atoms you have.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:59.430
And this Australian group
used the very clever trick

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.570
to eliminate this uncertainty.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.680
And this is as follows.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.400
We have this extremely
long-lived 8,000 seconds

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.580
lifetime here.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.450
And this is the transition.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:33.920
But you can now excite the atom
to the triplet P0 state, which

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.195
is also sort of--
it's a triplet state.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.980
Well, I assume because
it is a P state,

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.430
it has been orbit coupling.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.150
The lifetime is-- well,
for an atom is very long.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.000
Typically, atoms
decay in nanoseconds.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.180
But this lifetime
is milliseconds.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.690
So what they did is they
just excited all the atoms

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.870
with a strongly saturating laser
to the triplet P0 transition.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.890
And then within a
few milliseconds,

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.850
all the atoms emitted.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.380
And so all they had to
do is measure accurately

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:12.360
the ratio of the VUV photons
emitted by the triplet ground

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.330
state and by the
triplet P0 state.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.950
And then the number
of atoms canceled out.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:26.830
All they had to do is measure
the ratio of 2 VUV intensities.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.180
So based on that research
now, we have higher accuracy

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:36.930
on the lifetime of
metastable helium.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:44.860
The question is
when I said we have

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.710
to violate the above
assumptions to get

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.850
any decay between
singlet and triplet.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.450
Metastable helium,
pretty much everything

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.690
you can think about
it is forbidden.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:03.360
So for a long time,
people believed

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.690
it was a two-photon transition.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.830
One-photon transition
was forbidden,

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.960
but a two-photon
transition was allowed.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.790
We know now that
the decay path is

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.970
one photon in one transition.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.880
Magnetic dipole transition.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:26.050
If you don't know what M1 is, we
discuss it later in the course.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:33.480
But you may find it interesting
that until rather recently,

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.320
it was not clear what
the decay path is.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:41.260
Well, recently means
probably a few decades ago.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:52.010
But for a long time,
it wasn't even clear

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.110
and the calculations
were not accurate enough

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.740
what was the mechanism by
which the metastable count

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.380
state of helium could decay.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.780
When I prepared the class,
I wanted to sort of give you

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.260
a simple picture
and say, hey, it

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.230
is this mechanism which
causes the transition

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.080
from the triplet ground state
to the singlet ground state,

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.700
but I couldn't find
a simple operator.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.600
It seems a little
bit more complicated.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.630
The best I can tell you is
that the decay path requires

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.610
higher-order terms using the
Dirac equation with coupling

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.850
to the electromagnetic field.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.600
Any questions?

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.515
Yes, Nancy.

00:22:36.515 --> 00:22:43.445
AUDIENCE: In the measurement
of the lifetime of that state,

00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:48.395
what is the limiting factor?

00:22:48.395 --> 00:22:51.860
What makes this measurement
to be not more precise?

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.804
PROFESSOR: Here
is the reference.

00:22:57.804 --> 00:22:59.720
I mean, this was a
highly-accurate measurement

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.250
for that it improved all
previous measurements.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.250
What the current limit of
accuracy is, I don't remember.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:14.610
But for instance, they had to
put all atoms into the excited

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:19.460
state or by strong saturation.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.245
Of course, saturation
is never complete.

00:23:21.245 --> 00:23:23.270
Maybe there's a
limitation to that.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:28.240
Finally, you have to
measure the ratio of photons

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.190
emitted by that state and
emitted by that state.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.240
Well, they're both
in the vacuum UV,

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.220
but you may have a
systematic effect

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.190
if your photo-detector has a
slightly different detection

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:42.180
efficiency for 58
nanometer and 62 nanometer.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.170
Nothing is perfect,
but I really have

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.751
to refer you to the
reference for details.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:50.510
OK.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:56.480
So that's pretty
much what I wanted

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.640
to tell you about electronic
structure, the hydrogen

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.050
atom and special features
about the helium atom.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:15.450
So we can now proceed from
electronic energies, which

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.510
were on the order of Rydberg.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:23.250
Or remember atomic units, fine
structure constant squared

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.780
times rest mass of the electron.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.260
So we've taken care
of those energies

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.210
and now we want to take
care of smaller corrections.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:43.200
And what we discuss next is
the fine structure and the Lamb

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:43.700
shift.

00:24:49.616 --> 00:24:56.480
So this is now the title of our
next chapter, Fine Structure

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.270
and Lamb Shift.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:14.010
The fine structure energies
are alpha square times smaller

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.030
than the Rydberg.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:21.330
So they're on the order of
alpha to the 4 mc squared.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:27.850
And well, if I write that as
alpha square Rydberg, which

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:32.090
is the same, but it may--
this explains to you

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:35.180
why alpha is called the
fine structure constant.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:40.280
People had learned about the
hydrogen spectrum, Bohr's model

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.780
and all that, and then they
found finer corrections.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.140
And those finer
corrections were on a scale

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.270
alpha square times smaller.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.090
And the constant
which appears here,

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.040
alpha, was called the
fine structure constant

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.780
because it described the
structure of the fine structure

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.390
corrections and the fine
structure splittings.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.900
Of course if you want, you
can make the fine structure

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.060
constant already appear
for electronic energies.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.970
But this simply
reflects that I have

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.910
used the rest mass
of the electron

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.660
as a reference energy,
which unless you want

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.710
to discuss fundamental
units doesn't make

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:22.765
any sense because c,
the speed of light,

00:26:22.765 --> 00:26:25.370
it does not appear in
the electronic structure

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.830
as we discussed earlier.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.100
So therefore, the fine
structure constant

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:35.996
does enter the picture only when
we now discuss fine structure

00:26:35.996 --> 00:26:37.620
corrections, fine
structure splittings.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.630
The Lamb shift, which
we will then discuss,

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.710
is even higher order.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.775
It's alpha to the fifth.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.290
But just to tell
you, the Lamb shift

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.930
is on the order of a gigahertz.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:03.750
And you know that standard
precision in all of your labs

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.400
is now megahertz or better.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.310
So the lamb shift, also
it's alpha to the fifth,

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:12.742
is a big effect on the scale
of how we understand and prove

00:27:12.742 --> 00:27:13.950
the structure of atoms today.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.900
OK, so let's talk about
the fine structure.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:39.460
You will actually find
a complete discussion

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.720
of the fine structure
in several textbooks

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.430
on quantum mechanics--
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:51.150
What I want to do here is
to have a careful discussion

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.890
of the physical origin and
provide a clear understanding

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:59.170
what is responsible
for the fine structure.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:04.230
So if you just want to
get an accurate result,

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.190
there's only one
thing you have to do--

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.620
solve the Dirac equation.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.580
The solution of the Dirac
equation for the hydrogen atom

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.830
gives us the
electronic structure,

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.030
the same as comes out
of the Bohr model,

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.450
but now including
the fine structure.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:26.200
So it's nice.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.260
It just comes out.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.920
You don't have to put in the
spin of the electron by hand.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.470
It comes out automatically.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.430
But it also comes
out as a result

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.930
and you don't fully understand
what is the origin of that.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.682
Because you've just
treated everything fully

00:28:39.682 --> 00:28:40.390
relativistically.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.760
So what I want to
show you here is

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.680
I want to show you
that we can distinguish

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.940
three contributions.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.390
There are three
physical effects which

00:28:55.390 --> 00:29:00.450
all come in at the level
alpha to the 4 mc squared.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:08.410
One is relativistic corrections
to the kinetic energy.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:13.040
The second one is
spin orbit coupling.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.480
And then there is
a third one, which

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.130
goes by the name Darwin term.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:27.500
And we can get this
physical insight

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:36.160
and obtain those
three terms separately

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:41.410
when we use what
is called the Pauli

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.315
approximation to
the Dirac equation.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.760
If you do the so-called
Pauli approximation

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:55.470
to the Dirac
equation, you simply

00:29:55.470 --> 00:30:01.820
expand the Dirac equation
in powers of v/c.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:05.390
And then you get the Schrodinger
equations plus correction

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:06.660
terms.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.770
And what you obtain
then is a Hamiltonian,

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:15.480
which is the rest energy,
which is constant;

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:22.020
the non-relativistic kinetic
energy, the Coulomb energy.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.820
But then, we have
three more terms.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.790
And these are the
three contributions

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.420
to the fine structure.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:33.890
One is kinetic
energy is p squared,

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:37.050
but now there is a higher-order
relativistic contribution,

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.030
p to the 4.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:49.610
Then, there is a term,
spin orbit coupling term.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.630
And then there is
the third term,

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:07.546
which will we identify
as the Darwin term.

00:31:07.546 --> 00:31:10.634
Laplace operator
e squared over r.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.470
So we have a kinetic
energy correction.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:23.590
We have a spin orbit correction
and we a Darwin term.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.360
And what we want to do in
the next 45 minutes or so is

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.430
we want to look
at each of those.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.556
Any questions?

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:56.850
The kinetic energy contribution
is the simple expansion.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.430
You can get it from the
Pauli approximation.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.010
You take the Dirac
creation and deal

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.540
with all the operators
in the Dirac equation

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.050
and do an expansion.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:09.940
But you can also just
lean back and say, OK,

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.600
what is the kinetic energy?

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.070
And use the relativistic form
of the kinetic energy, which

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.980
is rest energy and pc squared.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.000
The square root of it.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.720
And if you say the kinetic
energy is the energy minus mc

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:41.620
squared, and then you take the
full relativistic expression

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:46.770
for the total energy minus 1.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:50.930
And now you do a Taylor
expansion of the square root.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:55.970
You find the non-relativistic
kinetic energy.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:01.270
And the first correction term
with all the correct prefactors

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:01.870
is this one.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:11.680
So this is the relativistic
energy correction

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.730
in the Pauli equation.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.860
That's all we have to say.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:27.730
The second term is
spin orbit interaction.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:36.440
And as such, it is, I would say,
more interesting because it now

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.240
really addresses the spin.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.850
So yes, the term comes
from the Dirac equation

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:48.900
and appears separately
as an identifiable term

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.600
if you do the
Pauli approximation

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.800
to the Dirac equation.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.920
So I could just stop there and
say, here, that's what it is.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.190
But I think it's insightful if
I re-derive this term for you

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.100
by using a physical picture.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:06.250
What do we have to add to the
Schrodinger equation to get it?

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.770
What we have to add to the
Schrodinger equation is,

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:13.500
of course, we have to put in
that the electron has a spin.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.639
The Dirac equation is
formulated in spin.

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.502
It's automatically formulated
for spin 1/2 particles.

00:34:18.502 --> 00:34:20.460
But if you start with
the Schrodinger equation,

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.199
you can first write it down
for a spin-less particle,

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:26.639
and now you have to
add the spin by hand.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:30.380
So we have to add to the
Schrodinger equation,

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:36.130
or to the Bohr
model, that we have

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:40.360
an electron with
an intrinsic spin.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:46.590
And the spin will couple
to the rest of the world

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:52.350
because it has a magnetic
moment which is the g factor.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.570
We'll talk about g factors
later in more detail.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.910
The Bohr magneton
times the spin.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.460
If you add it to the
Schrodinger equation,

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.170
we have to assume the
experimental value

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.720
or you can see the
value of which--

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.810
the approximate value
of the exact value

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:22.750
from the Dirac equation,
which is a g factor of 2.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.850
So if you put in by hand
that the electron has a spin,

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:30.370
the spin is associated
with the magnetic moment.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:36.600
Now we have a coupling
because an electron which

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.970
moves in the Coulomb
field of the nucleus

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:45.290
sees in its moving
frame a magnetic field.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:47.440
And this magnetic field
couples to the spin.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:36:12.040
So the moving electron "sees"
a motional magnetic field.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.830
Well, you know when you
have an electric field

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:23.140
and you look at the-- you have
an electric field in one frame

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.400
and you have a second frame,
spatial relativity, which

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.060
moves with a velocity v.
Then, in the moving frame,

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:36.040
you observe a motional
magnetic field.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.365
Well, our moving frame
is now the electron.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:47.290
So that looks like coupling
to the Coulomb field,

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:51.745
but we can immediately
write it in a form

00:36:51.745 --> 00:36:54.800
where we recognize
angular momentum.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.660
So this is the Coulomb field.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:07.020
And it involves now v cross r.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:11.088
And v cross r is just minus L,
the orbital angular momentum.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:24.530
So this is now our
motional magnetic field.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:28.740
And then the spin couples to it
and we get spin orbit coupling.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.600
By the way, an
equivalent picture

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.990
because you will
read about it or hear

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.390
about it is you can get the
magnetic field which couples

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.780
to the spin by simply
transforming the Coulomb

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.750
field into the frame
of the moving electron.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:48.740
But there is a more naive
picture which is correct, too.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.090
If you are in the
frame of the electron,

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:54.570
then the proton is
orbiting around you.

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:58.670
And the orbiting proton
is a ring current,

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:01.180
which creates a magnetic field.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.430
And this magnetic
field is or it has

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:06.460
to be the same as
we just got by doing

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.217
the relativistic transformation
of the Coulomb field

00:38:09.217 --> 00:38:10.800
into the frame of
the moving electron.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:23.487
So therefore, let me
just leave some room

00:38:23.487 --> 00:38:24.820
because I have to add something.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:32.022
If we want the spin
orbit Hamiltonian,

00:38:32.022 --> 00:38:39.211
it's now the magnetic moment
of the electron times this B

00:38:39.211 --> 00:38:39.710
field.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:47.360
And just collecting the terms,
e squared, h bar squared,

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:53.220
m squared, c squared,
1 over r cubed.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.790
The magnetic moment is
proportional to s, the spin.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.604
The motional B field
is proportional to L.

00:38:59.604 --> 00:39:01.770
And now we have the famous
spin orbit coupling term.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.100
OK, that would be too simple.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.810
So we have to now
consider one more thing.

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:14.870
And this is-- I told you
that we can transform

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.740
the electric field into the
moving frame of the electron,

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.150
but those transformations
from one Lorentz

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:25.780
frame into the other are simple
when you go from one frame

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.930
to another and they move
with a constant velocity

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:30.140
relative to each other.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:33.940
The electron is not moving
with a constant velocity.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.980
It actually has a
constant acceleration

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.500
because it's on
a circular orbit.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:50.370
So therefore, we have to use
the relativistic transformation

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:55.080
between coordinate frames.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.360
And it is in textbooks
on spatial relativity.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:07.920
What happens is if
you have-- if you

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:16.260
do relativistic transformations
between different moving

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:21.640
coordinate systems,
then you find

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.140
that if you have a velocity
like this, velocity like this,

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.160
and you do subsequent
transformations,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.900
you are not just going
into a Lorentz frame which

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:35.110
has very solid and relativistic
addition of the velocities.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.090
In addition, your
final Lorentz frame

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.990
is rotated against
the first frame.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:46.715
So adding a number of velocities
which are not collinear--

00:40:46.715 --> 00:40:48.840
and this is what we have
to do if the electron goes

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.340
in a circle.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.150
We have to sort of
follow the electron,

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.900
follow different
velocities and do

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.880
relativistic transformations.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.280
Several relativistic
Lorentz transformation

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:06.140
executed in sequence are not a
simple Lorentz transformation,

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:10.010
they are Lorentz
transformation plus rotation.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:18.160
And that means that if
we go-- and the result

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.270
can be summarized as follows.

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:28.250
There is a rotational
angular velocity

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:38.630
which can be written as follows.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.630
You see immediately
that this term

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:46.270
is 0 when a, acceleration,
and velocity are the same.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.820
So if you have a moving frame
and you accelerate the moving

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.470
frame, you don't get
this term if everything

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:52.690
is in one dimension.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:57.160
But if the acceleration
is not in one dimension--

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.020
and that's the case when the
electron goes on the circle,

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.680
you get an additional
contribution.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:08.050
And if the acceleration
is constant,

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.050
you get-- and this is
on the left-hand side--

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.720
a constant angular velocity.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.540
A precession velocity.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:21.180
And the letter T indicates that
it's the Thomas precession.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.840
Now, we have
learned-- and that's

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.550
nice to come back to the
beginning of this course.

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:34.480
We have discussed that if
you have a magnetic field,

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.270
we can go into a rotating
frame and the magnetic field

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.670
disappears.

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:41.700
Well now, due to
relativistic kinematics,

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.690
we have an additional rotation.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.600
But using the same
argument we used

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.430
at the beginning of the course,
this additional rotation

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.320
corresponds to an
additional magnetic field.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:57.300
So therefore, this precession
is identical to the effect

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:01.430
of an additional magnetic field.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:04.970
So there is an
additional magnetic field

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:09.370
with the letter T, the
Thomas magnetic field.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:13.510
Those magnetic fields are
related to the precession

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:18.780
frequency by the
gyromagnetic ratio.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:26.930
And if we use the value for the
electron's gyromagnetic ratio--

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:30.980
and in addition, we use the
fact that the acceleration

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:35.080
term for this
relativistic kinematics

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:44.620
is nothing else than the
Coulomb acceleration,

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:54.000
then we find that the
Thomas magnetic field is

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.940
just minus 1/2 the
motional magnetic field we

00:43:58.940 --> 00:43:59.671
derived earlier.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:07.800
So therefore, if
we go back and want

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.870
to find an expression for
the spin orbit coupling,

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.710
we have to use the
magnetic field, which

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:20.210
is the sum of the two
contributions we discussed,

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:25.300
the motional contribution for--
as if the electron would move

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.730
in a linear way, plus
the Thomas precession

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:33.590
due to the rotational motion
due to relativistic kinematics.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:38.000
And this will just
reduce the final result

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.988
by a factor of 1/2.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:47.908
Yes.

00:44:47.908 --> 00:44:49.580
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:55.380
Small one, what letter is the
gyromagnetic ratio denoted by?

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.930
PROFESSOR: Sorry
for the handwriting.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:02.370
We have usually used
lowercase gamma.

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.210
And the e means the electron.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:06.330
So gamma electron is
the gyromagnetic ratio

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:07.876
of the electron.

00:45:07.876 --> 00:45:08.822
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:08.822 --> 00:45:11.832
And then my other question, or
more substantively concern--

00:45:11.832 --> 00:45:13.580
or confused, I guess.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.410
I wasn't sure where
the h bar comes

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:19.890
from in the expression
for angular momentum.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:21.375
One line up.

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:30.338
You go from v cross
r to h bar over mL.

00:45:30.338 --> 00:45:33.320
And I wasn't sure where
the h bar came from.

00:45:37.296 --> 00:45:38.780
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:39.405
It now depends.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.470
You're correct, angular
momentum is r cross

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:50.440
v. r cross v gives
angular momentum.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.610
And because it's r cross
v and not v cross r,

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.750
the minus sign is
absorbed into it.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:57.290
Now, the angular
momentum-- it depends now.

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:58.730
It's just purely definitional.

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.760
If you wanted, the
angular momentum

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.550
has eigenvalues of
L times L plus 1,

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:06.240
which are dimensionless, then
we have to account for h bar

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.290
explicitly.

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:10.930
So question is, do we want
the angular momentum operator

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:15.910
to have this kind of
integer, or L times L plus 1?

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:16.420
Yeah.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.230
This integer spectrum,
or do we want

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:21.290
to measure-- or, do we
want to use operators

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:23.050
which have units of h bar?

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:26.434
That's where the
h bar comes from.

00:46:26.434 --> 00:46:27.100
Other questions?

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.160
OK.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.540
So this is spin orbit coupling.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:47.640
Finally, the last contribution
to the fine structure

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.910
is the Darwin term.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.920
The Darwin term is
sort of peculiar,

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:03.480
but there is sort of
an intuitive picture

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.640
in which I can derive it.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:17.920
Well, it starts by saying
that an electron-- well, we

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.490
know an electron is, as far
as we know, a point object.

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:25.330
But in order to derive
the Darwin term,

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:29.350
we assume that the
electron is not

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:33.250
arbitrarily
accurately localized,

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.570
but it is smeared out.

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:43.720
And you may remember
when I discussed

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:48.900
fundamental units and the
fine structure constant alpha,

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:53.110
and I told you that the
fact that alpha is small

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:55.500
leads to the fact
that people say

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.580
electromagnetic
interactions are weak.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.200
I discussed with
you that if you want

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.090
to do single-particle physics
and do single-particle pictures

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:05.090
and single-particle
equations, you

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:10.190
can never assume that a
particle is localized better

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:11.970
than its Compton wavelengths.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:14.260
If you would localize
the particle better

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.240
than the Compton
wavelengths, it would

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.260
have a momentum
uncertainty, which

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.540
would lead to an energy
uncertainty, which

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.310
is larger than its rest mass.

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:27.355
And you get into quantum field
theory and pair production.

00:48:27.355 --> 00:48:30.200
So at some point,
you have to be aware

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.480
that single-particle
pictures break down

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.910
when you assume a
localization of particles

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:40.240
better than the
Compton wavelengths.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.690
So therefore-- and
I'm waving my hands

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.740
because it's a
hand-waving argument.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.360
But we can derive
the Darwin term

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:52.390
by assuming that the electron
is sort of smeared out

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:56.200
over a dimension.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:07.920
And this dimension can only
be the Compton wavelengths,

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.640
which is h bar over mc.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.040
And there is a nice
German word for it,

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.790
how you can imagine that
the electron is smeared out.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.720
It goes by the word
[SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.880
I think the German word is much
nicer than its translation,

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.970
which is trembling motion.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.630
So at least in this
picture you assume

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.200
that the electron is
sort of smeared out.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.440
It's not because the
electron has a size.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.650
It just trembles.

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:47.670
It just trembles and that leads
to a smear-out over the Compton

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:49.850
wavelengths.

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:53.110
But that implies now that
if this trembling motion is

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:57.620
sufficiently fast, we should not
use in our Schrodinger equation

00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.040
the Coulomb potential.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.242
You should use the Coulomb
potential which is spatially

00:50:02.242 --> 00:50:03.825
averaged over the
Compton wavelengths.

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:21.430
So therefore, the
phenomenological derivation

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:25.430
of the Darwin term goes by
replacing the Coulomb potential

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:29.100
in the Schrodinger equation by
the spatially-averaged Coulomb

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:30.570
potential.

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:34.410
So let me now derive
what this means.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:42.370
So if we assume there is a
very small displacement s,

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:44.620
now we can take the
Coulomb potential

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:55.670
and expand it into its Coulomb
potential plus derivative times

00:50:55.670 --> 00:51:05.580
s plus the second-order
Taylor expansion

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.040
the xi, the xj component.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:15.070
And then we need the
second-order derivative xi

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:18.801
xj of the Coulomb potential.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:28.750
So the correction is now--
well, if you ever reach it

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:32.015
in an isotropic way,
the gradient term,

00:51:32.015 --> 00:51:33.650
a linear term
doesn't contribute.

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:35.580
It just averages to 0.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:41.500
So the leading correction
comes from the curvature term.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:50.720
So therefore, we have to take
the curvature or the Laplacian

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.310
of the Coulomb potential.

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:58.870
The scale of sx squared,
sy squared, sz squared

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:05.450
is the Compton
wavelength squared.

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:08.810
And well, maybe I'm taking
the argument of the Compton

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:10.060
wavelengths now too literally.

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:13.460
But at least if I want to
carry it through, sx squared,

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:21.120
sy squared, sz squared, each
of them 1/3 of s absolute value

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:21.620
squared.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:35.030
So if I now use the
Coulomb potential,

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:46.680
I obtain the result where I
have the Laplacian of 1/r.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.910
And as you, of course,
know is the 1/r function

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:54.150
has a non-vanishing
Laplacian only at the origin.

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.560
So therefore, the
correction is only valid

00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:01.550
for s electrons which have
a non-vanishing probability

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:04.534
to feel the origin of
the Coulomb potential.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.020
OK, I did a lot of
hand-waving here.

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:19.700
And yes, those
factors of 1/2 are

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:24.990
the fact that the electron is
smeared out over the Compton

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:27.010
radius and maybe prefactors.

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:29.680
But OK, this is the
physical picture.

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:33.170
You can get an exact
result by simply taking

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:36.660
the Dirac equation, doing the
non-relativistic approximation,

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:42.170
and the term which appears
in the Pauli equation

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:44.430
is actually the same.

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:47.805
The only thing
which is different

00:53:47.805 --> 00:53:50.840
is that the
prefactor is not 1/6.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.980
The exact prefactor is 1/8.

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:56.810
So the exact results
actually validates

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:58.800
that the physical
picture we have used

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.520
is at least a reasonable
approximation.

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:19.040
OK, so we have now--
let us summarize.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:29.090
For the fine structure, we
have three different terms.

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:32.895
And they all have a
different signature.

00:54:32.895 --> 00:54:36.330
We have the relativistic
kinetic energy correction,

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:40.289
we have the spin orbit coupling,
and we have the Darwin term.

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:49.430
We can now ask, which term
contributes for an s electron?

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:55.970
Well, relative kinetic
energy, of course.

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:58.950
The Darwin term is
only for s electrons.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:04.076
LS does not contribute because
an s electron has L equal 0.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:16.190
So if we go to p and d states,
to states with finite angular

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:20.555
momentum, then we get
contribution of LS.

00:55:20.555 --> 00:55:24.580
We always get a relativistic
kinetic energy contribution.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:29.500
But for finite angular momentum,
we don't have the Darwin term.

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.580
And finally, we
can also classify

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:35.980
those different contribution
by asking, what is the sign?

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:43.770
Do those corrections lower
or increase the total energy?

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:51.000
Well, the Darwin term
reduces the binding energy

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.410
because it sort of
takes a cusp away

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:57.020
from the Coulomb interaction.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:01.190
The kinetic energy has the
opposite sign and spin orbit

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:06.110
coupling is L dot S. And S can
be parallel or anti-parallel

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:09.530
to L. So therefore, the
spin orbit interaction has

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:10.540
plus or minus sign.

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:23.095
Any questions about
those three terms?

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:30.200
OK.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:34.110
The fact that we
have spin and we

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:39.720
have spin orbit interaction
means that the spin orbit

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:57.250
interaction, L dot S is
not diagonal in L or S.

00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:00.980
So what we have to do is
we have to introduce now

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:16.150
the total angular momentum
J. And since L plus S squared

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:24.630
equals J squared, we
can write the product LS

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:32.660
as 1/2 J squared minus L
squared minus S squared.

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:42.030
So therefore, the LS interaction
is diagonal in the J basis.

00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:49.730
So if you couple L and S to J
a given state of the operator

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:52.650
J has a definite value for LS.

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:56.980
OK.

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:06.810
Let's put in things together.

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:10.190
So at the beginning
of this class,

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:13.020
we started out with
a hydrogen atom

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:19.390
where-- let me just focus on
n equals 2, where we had n

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:20.840
equals 2.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.840
All n equals 2 states have
the same energy, that's

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.980
what comes out of the
non-relativistic Schrodinger

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.000
equation with a
Coulomb potential.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.880
And that means we had a
degeneracy for the 2p 1/2,

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:37.940
for the 2p 3/2 and
the 2s 1/2 state.

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:58.890
If you now put in spin
orbit interaction, well,

00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:01.460
nothing of course happens
to the s 1/2 state

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:04.700
because it has no
orbital angular momentum.

00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:09.950
And then in the P
3/2 state, L equals

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:14.540
1, 1 unit of orbital angular
momentum, and the spin aligned.

00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:17.810
In the p 1/2 state,
they are anti-aligned.

00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:22.870
So therefore, the two
terms have opposite shifts.

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:30.170
So the p 3/2 state is shifted
up and the p 1/2 state

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:31.655
is shifted down.

00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:39.150
But then in the
second step, we want

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:44.850
to add in now the two
other contributions

00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:49.185
to the fine structure, the
kinetic and the Darwin term.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:56.740
And then, something happens
which is really remarkable.

00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:59.300
We have split the three levels.

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.780
We have lifted the degeneracy
between the three levels.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:05.310
But if you now add the
kinetic and the Darwin term,

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:21.560
it turns out that the s
1/2 and the p 1/2 state

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.180
become exactly degenerate again.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.670
So there is still a
degeneracy in the spectrum.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.540
If we would use a
non-relativistic approach

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.260
and derive the Darwin
term, the spin orbit

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.939
term, and the relativistic
correction separately,

01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:42.980
there would be no reason.

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:46.820
It would just look like a
freak accident in nature

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.190
that those two levels
come out equal.

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:51.390
However, it's not
a freak accident.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:54.070
It's the symmetry of
the Dirac equation.

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:59.140
So all those corrections
have a deep connection

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:01.100
in relativistic physics.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:07.910
And relativistic physics
preserves the degeneracy in J.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.650
So let me write that down.

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:26.930
So the fine structure does
not lift the degeneracy

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.960
between s 1/2 and p 1/2.

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:39.450
It turns out that when we
use the Dirac equation,

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:49.320
we can get an exact expression
for the fine structure

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.370
into the [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:53.430
And it's a principal
quantum number.

01:01:53.430 --> 01:02:01.831
And then the fine structure only
depends on J and not on L and S

01:02:01.831 --> 01:02:02.331
separately.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:14.510
So that tells us that
eventually the spin

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.940
of the electron and
the fine structure

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:21.720
really have deep origins
in the relativistic nature

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.860
of the underlying physics.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.620
Any questions about
fine structure?

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:46.240
Let me get a white
page and draw you

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.510
sort of an energy-level diagram,
put in a few numbers which then

01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:53.330
leads us to the discussion
of the Lamb shift.

01:02:56.795 --> 01:03:02.160
So we have hydrogenic
energy levels with n

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.570
equals 1 and n equals 2.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:16.240
We have s states and
we have p states.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:28.060
We just discussed the fine
structure which shifts down

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:37.810
the energy of all those levels
in the ground-- I mentioned

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:43.370
that the fine structure is
alpha to the 4 mc squared.

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:47.550
And for the ground state,
the prefector is minus 1/8.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:56.266
And this is the one-- the
term designation is s 1/2.

01:03:56.266 --> 01:04:09.610
Here, we get the 2s 1/2 level
and the shift is minus 5/128

01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:16.570
in the same unit alpha
to the 4 mc squared.

01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:21.220
We have the exact
degeneracy between the s 1/2

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:25.150
and the 2p 1/2 state.

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:47.780
Whereas, the p 3/2 state is
only shifted by minus 1/128.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:55.130
To put in some numbers
in electron volt,

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:58.490
the fine structure in the ground
state is on the order of 10

01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:00.560
to the minus 4 electron volt.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.680
The splitting here, which is
the fine structure splitting

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:12.600
of the p 1/2 and the
p 3/2 state is 4 times

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.620
10 to the minus 5 electron volt.

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:22.370
So that means at the level of
10 to the minus 4 electron volt,

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:24.284
we understand atomic structure.

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.990
Well, but we want to go further.

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:36.180
And the next thing
we want to discuss

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:42.270
is that-- what is the exact
degeneracy between s 1/2

01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:50.890
and p 1/2 is actually lifted
when we introduce photons.

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:53.410
When we allow the
electrons to couple

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:55.460
to the electromagnetic
field, that's

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:58.360
QED, Quantum Electrodynamics.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:03.140
And that introduces the
Lamb shift, which in the n

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:07.640
equals 2 state is
10 to the minus 6

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.790
electron volt, which is
approximately 1 gigahertz.

01:06:11.790 --> 01:06:14.430
And that's what we
want to derive next.

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.200
Since I have this
nice, level diagram

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:26.150
I want to also indicate to
you what we do next week.

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:32.570
And this is when we
bring in the proton.

01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:34.910
So far we have said
there is a point charge,

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:38.310
but the proton is a particle
which has finite size.

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:41.270
But also, it has finite
angular momentum.

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:44.380
And then we have to
bring in fine structure.

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:47.990
And we will learn
that the s 1/2 ground

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:53.190
state splits into two
hyperfine components.

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:59.310
And the hyperfine structure
will be at a similar energy

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:03.400
scale as the Lamb shift.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.170
And actually, this fine
structure splitting

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:12.350
is the famous 14--
it's about 1 gigahertz.

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:14.950
It's the famous
1,420 megahertz line,

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:18.150
which everybody who does
astrophysics knows about it.

01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:22.100
It's also, in other units,
the famous hydrogen measure,

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.330
which has an emission
line at 21 centimeter.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.650
Anyway, this is
sort of our roadmap.

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:34.360
We have taken care of
everything down to 10

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.760
to the minus 5 electron volts.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:43.470
And now we want to proceed
today and in the next lecture

01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:45.170
to 10 to the minus 6.

01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:48.830
First, the Lamb shift, where
we are still holding on

01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:53.120
that the nucleus is a point
charge, has no structure.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.560
Then, we have done
everything we can do.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.140
What happens in the Coulomb
field of a point charge?

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.000
We have the spin
of the electron.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:00.550
We have QED.

01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:02.000
We have done everything.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.400
And then what remains is to put
in the structure of the proton,

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.150
which will lead us to
hyperfine structure.

01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:11.405
Any question?

01:08:28.696 --> 01:08:38.859
OK, then let's get started
with the Lamb shift.

01:08:46.450 --> 01:08:51.069
Just to make sure that
you're not getting confused,

01:08:51.069 --> 01:08:54.880
there is also a lamp shift.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.660
This is actually an
old-fashioned word

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:00.569
for an AC Stark effect.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.399
People in the '50s
and '60s found

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:06.540
that spectral lines
in a mercury discharge

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:10.279
shifted when you took
another mercury lamp

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:14.810
and illuminated the mercury with
a strong light of another lamp.

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:17.620
So a lamp shift
is simply a shift

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:21.950
due to the electromagnetic
radiation emitted by a lamp.

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:23.819
But that's what we
are talking about.

01:09:23.819 --> 01:09:25.700
We want to talk about
the Lamb shift, which

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.660
is named after Willis Lamb,
who received the Nobel

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:33.630
Prize for the discovery that
the 2s 1/2 and the 2p 1/2

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:36.109
level in hydrogen
are not degenerate.

01:09:36.109 --> 01:09:38.220
And he wouldn't have
gotten the Nobel Prize

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:40.890
if it would have been
simply of one little feature

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:42.580
in the spectrum of hydrogen.

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:47.180
But the discovery of this
lifting of the degeneracy

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:50.560
actually opened up the
field for the development

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.620
of quantum electrodynamics.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:54.860
So this was the
experimental discovery

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:56.510
which led to quantum
electrodynamics.

01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:59.940
And this is why it's a
very famous effect done

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:02.185
by a now very famous
man, Willis Lamb.

01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:21.110
The full description of the
Lamb shift would require QED.

01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:24.830
And later in this course,
we are developing the tools

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:25.555
to do that.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:26.680
I don't want to do it here.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.530
I want to give you a simplified
physical picture which actually

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:34.780
nicely relates the Lamb shift
to the Darwin term which

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:35.890
we have just discussed.

01:10:35.890 --> 01:10:39.130
But sort of just in full
disclosure, what you have to do

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:42.440
is, if you fully quantize
the electromagnetic field,

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.250
you have a vector
potential which

01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:46.320
describes the vacuum mode.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.910
And you have a vector
potential, which

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.630
is the operator of the
fully-quantized field.

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:58.670
And if you now carry out
second-order perturbation

01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:02.700
theory in this operator A of
the quantized electromagnetic

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:03.530
field.

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:06.360
In other words, you allow
the atom or the electron

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.440
in the atom to couple to all
the empty modes of the vacuum,

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:15.910
then you obtain the Lamb
shift in its full beauty.

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:19.380
This is discussed nicely in
"Atom Photon Interaction"

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.700
by Claude
Cohen-Tannoudji, et al.

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.800
So this is the nature.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.430
The nature of the Lamb
shift is the coupling

01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:28.370
to the vacuum modes.

01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:32.470
But I want to capture that now
in a semi-classical picture.

01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:43.130
So the picture I
am presenting here

01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:45.058
is due to Welton
and Viki Weisskopf.

01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:54.920
And yes, it has to address
the nature of the Lamb shift.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:00.900
And this is the coupling of
the electron to the vacuum,

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.670
but the vacuum is not empty.

01:12:03.670 --> 01:12:06.280
The vacuum is filled
with a zero point

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.140
energy of the
electromagnetic field.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:20.530
What we need is that we
have electromagnetic modes

01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:22.823
and they have a
zero point energy.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:29.360
And each mode has a zero
point energy of h bar omega.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:36.305
And maybe before I do
any equations, which

01:12:36.305 --> 01:12:38.890
will take five minutes
and about one page,

01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:41.080
I should just give you
the physical picture.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.500
I think it's much clearer
to understand that.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.310
So the moment each
mode has an energy,

01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:50.740
then each mode has a
fluctuating electric field.

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.610
Now what we have
to do is we have

01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:58.440
to multiply the contribution--
the energy of each mode

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.920
by the density of modes.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.770
We have to sum over all modes.

01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:04.950
But then in the end what
we get is an expression

01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:08.040
for the fluctuating
electric field.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.390
And remember, in
the Darwin term,

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:14.210
we assumed that the electron
is trembling by itself

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:17.970
and is smeared out over
the Compton wavelengths.

01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:21.250
But now in addition to
its own trembling motion,

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:25.490
the electron is now shaken
by the electric field

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:26.610
of the vacuum.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:30.280
And this leads to an
additional smear out.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.990
And this is the Lamb shift.

01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:35.160
So that's what we
want to put together.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.690
So we want to calculate
an additional contribution

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:41.180
to a trembling motion
of the electron.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:46.440
But this time, it is driven
by the electric field which

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.910
persists even in the vacuum.

01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:52.830
So that's the Lamb shift.

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:58.620
OK, so it's 1/2 h
bar omega per mode.

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:02.930
We have to use the
density of modes.

01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:08.360
And the density is, of
course, per unit volume

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:14.130
and frequency interval.

01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:15.410
So we have a density.

01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:20.510
mu is the frequency
and you probably

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:27.196
remember that the density of
modes scales with frequency

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:27.696
squared.

01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:46.440
So that means the density
of the zero point energy

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:54.080
is 1/2 h mu per mode
times the mode density.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:59.239
And this means it scales
now with mu cubed,

01:14:59.239 --> 01:15:00.616
the frequency cubed.

01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:07.290
And since we want
to introduce now

01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:12.460
the electric field, the
[INAUDIBLE] electric field.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:17.210
If you go from electric
field to energy,

01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:19.950
the energy density
of the electric field

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:23.740
is proportional to e Squared.

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.270
So therefore, what we
derive from this picture

01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:32.790
that the vacuum is filled with
an oscillating electric field.

01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:35.060
And this oscillating
electric field

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:40.840
is characterized by a value, by
a spectral density E squared,

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:44.730
which is proportional
to mu cubed.

01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:52.554
And if I collect the constants
h and speed of light, it's this.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:58.010
So the question is, what
does this electric field

01:15:58.010 --> 01:16:00.250
do to the electron?

01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:08.000
Well, let's not discuss the
electron in a hydrogenic orbit.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.260
Let's, rather, discuss
in a simplified picture,

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:17.230
what is the effect of such
a field on a free electron?

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.170
And we will later discuss that
for very high-frequencies,

01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:27.910
an electron can be
regarded as free.

01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:35.170
So therefore, if s is the
coordinate of the electron,

01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:41.230
and you drive it with an
oscillating electric field

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:50.670
at frequency mu, then the
driven amplitude of the electron

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:56.758
is the electric field.

01:16:56.758 --> 01:16:59.830
I just want to make sure we
keep track of the powers of mu.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.180
Because we take the
second-derivative acceleration,

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:08.160
we get two powers of mu.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.576
So we have an extra
mu squared term.

01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:23.640
Of course, the phase
is random, so we're not

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.690
interested in the amplitude.

01:17:25.690 --> 01:17:29.530
We are interested in sort
of an average amplitude

01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:33.700
square or an RMS
amplitude, which

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:37.120
is-- the amplitude
was proportional

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.710
to the electric field.

01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:41.820
The amplitude squared is
proportional to the square

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.590
of the electric field.

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:54.460
And our prefactor
involves now mu to the 4.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:04.080
Just in the equation
at the top, we

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.770
had an expression for
the spectral density

01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:11.060
of the electric field E
squared which goes mu cubed.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.400
So that means now that
the spectral density

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:21.390
of the motion of the electron
s mu squared goes as 1 over mu.

01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:34.780
And yup, e squared h bar pi
squared m squared e cubed.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.330
And now, yes, I wanted to
do it in the same lecture

01:18:37.330 --> 01:18:41.260
as the Darwin term
because we know

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:44.270
that there was a change to the
Coulomb potential in the Darwin

01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:49.380
term which came because the
electron was smeared out

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.130
over an area s squared.

01:18:51.130 --> 01:18:55.120
Remember, this was the
Compton [INAUDIBLE] squared.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:00.710
And it involved the Laplacian of
the potential Taylor expansion

01:19:00.710 --> 01:19:03.760
second order, second
derivative in three dimension

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.070
is the Laplacian.

01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:09.250
And for the Coulomb
potential, this

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:12.604
is non-vanishing, of
course, only at the origin.

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:20.970
So therefore, we
have now executed

01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:22.690
what I discussed before.

01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:27.380
We calculated the
sort of displacement

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.880
of the free electron
driven by the vacuum

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.400
fluctuations of
the electric field.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:40.190
And these smear
out of the electron

01:19:40.190 --> 01:19:45.980
leads to a change of the-- of
the average Coulomb potential.

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.883
We average the Coulomb
potential over the first motion

01:19:48.883 --> 01:19:51.340
of the electron.

01:19:51.340 --> 01:20:01.270
And that means now that we
get a change of the binding

01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:11.630
energy of the electron, which
is nothing else in perturbation

01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:17.770
theory than the matrix element
of the perturbation operator.

01:20:17.770 --> 01:20:23.340
But this perturbation
operator was a delta function.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:32.240
And we have the prefactor,
which is the spectral density

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.250
of the displacement
s mu squared.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:37.840
So let's wrap up.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.260
So we know because of
the delta function,

01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:45.249
it only affects s electrons.

01:20:51.476 --> 01:20:54.930
And remember I discussed
at great lengths

01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:59.360
that for an electron with
principal quantum number n,

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:05.150
the probability to be at
the center was n cubed.

01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:07.650
So here again, we have
the n cubed factor,

01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:10.440
which we discussed for the
hydrogenic wave function.

01:21:14.530 --> 01:21:19.520
And the only thing which is
non non-trivial we have to do

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:28.990
is we have to integrate
over all modes mu.

01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:32.850
So therefore, what we
had so far was the shift

01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:36.540
caused by one frequency of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:40.360
But now we have to integrate
over all frequencies.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:56.940
So what we have to do is-- our
spectrum s squared goes as 1

01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:57.840
over mu.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:01.730
And if you integrate 1 over
mu over all frequencies,

01:22:01.730 --> 01:22:03.240
you get a logarithm.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.250
You get logarithmic divergences.

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:13.910
So therefore, our result is--
and I'm using now atomic units,

01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:20.460
alpha cubed z to the
4 the n cubed factor.

01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:24.480
Everything is in
units of atomic units.

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.990
The atomic unit of energy
is 1 Hartree or 2 Rydberg.

01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:32.270
But the factor which
is now non-trivial

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:37.160
is from the logarithm,
we integrate.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.310
And we have divergences
at both ends.

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:44.035
So we need a cutoff at a minimum
and at a maximum frequency.

01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:51.910
For the maximum
frequency-- well,

01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:54.480
there is a natural cutoff.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.980
We have to cutoff at the
rest energy of the electron,

01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:02.620
otherwise we are no longer
doing single-particle theory.

01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:06.080
And the cutoff, the lower
cutoff, is the following.

01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:14.610
We have used a picture
here for free electron,

01:23:14.610 --> 01:23:18.550
but we can regard the
orbiting electron only as

01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:20.800
a free electron on
time scales which

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:23.420
are much faster than
one orbital period.

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:28.220
So therefore, we have
to use as a lower cutoff

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:38.330
the frequency of the
orbiting electron, which

01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:46.120
is z squared n cubed
in atomic units.

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:52.880
So with that, then I should
stop because time is over.

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:58.290
We have a little
bit hand-wavingly,

01:23:58.290 --> 01:24:01.360
but it appears in
a logarithm anyway.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:07.890
We have gotten for the ratio of
the upper and the lower cutoff

01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:15.670
an expression which is n cubed
over z squared times alpha

01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:17.480
squared.

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:20.227
And if we apply it
to s state where

01:24:20.227 --> 01:24:21.770
it's most important
because there

01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:25.810
is the degeneracy between p
1/2 and p 3/2 to be lifted,

01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:29.390
we get a result that
the energy splitting is

01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:37.410
now-- and with the
assumptions we have made,

01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:41.630
the logarithm is 8 over
a squared, alpha squared.

01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:44.310
And from that, we
would have derived

01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:48.100
a Lamb shift of 1,600 megahertz.

01:24:48.100 --> 01:25:04.314
Well, the exact value
is 1,058 megahertz.

01:25:04.314 --> 01:25:07.400
I'm missing five minutes to
discuss the result in terms

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.430
of vacuum polarization,
but that's

01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:11.970
something we do on Monday.

01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:15.380
Any quick question?

01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.100
OK, great.

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:17.950
See you on Monday.
