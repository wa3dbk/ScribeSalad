00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.430
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.310
Let's get started.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.189
So we continue our
discussion today

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.320
about light atom interaction.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.952
And just to sort of
remind you where we are,

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:43.410
we started last week,
even before spring

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.620
break, to talk about
the matrix element which

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.410
provides a coupling.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.090
So now we have a coupling
between the two states.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.150
And we want to
understand what is

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.990
the coupling doing
to the system.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.310
What is a dynamical
evolution of the system?

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.100
How does the atomic
wave function

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.020
evolve when we couple two
states using optical fields?

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.230
And well, as usual, we start
with the basic phenomena.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.720
And this is we do
perturbation theory

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.500
with a dipole Hamiltonian.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.170
And we have done that on Monday.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.190
We've done perturbation theory.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.830
And I made an
important distinction

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.570
between a monochromatic
case and [INAUDIBLE] case.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.190
The monochromatic case gave
us in perturbation theory

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.640
this result.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.450
And if you stare
at it for a while,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.940
you see, well, these are
just Rabi oscillations.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.720
It's not the formula
of Rabi oscillations

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.670
with the generalized
Rabi frequency

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.650
and power broadening because
it's perturbation theory.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.160
So these are Rabi oscillations
in the perturbative limit.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.690
But also on Monday I showed
you that for interactions

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.920
with monochromatic light, we can
just rewrite the Hamiltonian.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.800
That it not just looks
like, it is exactly

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.670
the Hamiltonian for spin
1/2 in a magnetic field.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.090
And we have already
discussed the solution.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.611
So, therefore, we know for
monochromatic radiation,

00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:19.360
we can just go beyond
perturbation theory.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.380
We can solve it exactly.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.970
OK.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.675
So monochromatic
radiation we understand.

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:29.910
At least as long as we have
just the coupling of the atom

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.270
to a single mode of the
electromagnetic field.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.174
And now we come back
to the broadband case.

00:02:36.174 --> 00:02:38.340
I give a little bit more
of a summary and an outline

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.690
after I finish the
broadband case.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.770
So what we have right now is
we have Rabi oscillations,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.310
which we derived
for a single mode.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.670
And the broadband case
is such that we now

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.940
assume that we have a
spectrum of frequencies.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.620
And we assume that to be
flat and broad in a moment.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.580
And what we have to
do now is we have

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.470
to substitute in
this formula the Rabi

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.100
frequency by the electric field.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.200
And the electric field
becomes using the connection

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.070
between electric field
and energy density,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.280
eventually the Rabi
frequency squared

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.150
gets replaced by an integral
over the spectral density.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.800
It looks mathematically exact.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.650
But, of course,
you all recognize

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.170
that I've made a very
important assumption here.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.630
Namely, that there is no
correlation whatsoever

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.550
between the different
frequencies.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.400
Because by integrating
here, I'm just

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.410
summing up the e
squares assuming

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.034
that there's no interference,
no coherence, no correlation

00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:51.450
between the different
frequencies.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.840
OK, so with those
assumptions I can now just

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.970
formulate the
mathematics exactly.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.080
I calculate now the probability
to be in the excited state

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.550
by assuming we have this kind of
pertrubative Rabi oscillations

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.500
at every frequency component.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.209
But we integrate
over all frequencies.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.790
Any questions?

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.465
So now-- and this is where
I ended the last lecture.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.257
And there are actually now, this
is really an interesting case.

00:04:31.257 --> 00:04:32.840
I know I sometimes
spend a lot of time

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.230
on sort of where
the math is simple,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.280
but the physics is
really interesting.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.440
So the probability to find
an atom in the excited state

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.510
is now this function
which replaces,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.610
which are the
Rabit oscillations,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.290
convoluted integrated
over the spectral density.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.005
And now we have to
consider two cases.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.870
If this function is flat and
is spectrally very broad,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.030
we can pull it out
of the integral

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.040
However, this function
here, which are your Rabi

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.240
oscillations-- sine squared
of an [? augument ?] divided

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.630
by the [? augument. ?] I've
plotted it here for you.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.900
This function is
actually very peculiar.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.660
It has a height of t square.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.280
If you're doing Taylor
Expansion for short times t.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.380
But the width is
t to the minus 1.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.570
So as time goes by, it
gets narrower, and taller,

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.910
and taller.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.510
And if you take t squared by
t to the minus 1, you get t.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.530
So the integral
over it is just t.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.780
So in other words,
we have a function

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.350
which goes as t square.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.430
But the integral is t.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.280
And if the width is so narrow
that the width doesn't really

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.430
matter, we can say this function
has become a delta function.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.900
But the integral over
the function is t.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.530
So it becomes t times
the delta function.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.400
And now we the two
limiting cases.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.250
If very short times t-- this
Rabi oscillation function

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.420
is extremely broad.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.250
And at infinitesimal
times t, it is

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.120
broader than any
spectral bandwidths.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.870
So actually what we
are doing is when

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.780
we solve this integral at very
short time, this is broader.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.000
And we pull this
out of the integral.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.940
And this gives us a
prefect of t squared.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.053
So, therefore, the
excitation probability

00:06:35.053 --> 00:06:38.995
is t squared times the integral
of the spectral function which

00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:40.245
is just the totally intensity.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.810
However, if you
wait a little time,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.050
and eventually if
the time is such

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.530
that the time is longer
than the inverse bandwidths

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.290
of the spectral radiation,
then the spectral radiation

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.470
is broader than
this function, f.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.150
And we pull this
out of the integral.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.270
And then what we have is we
have simply the integral here

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.250
over the delta function
which gives us a factor of t.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.770
So we have two functions.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.910
And whichever is broader can
be pulled out of the integral.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.010
And that means in one
case, we have a probability

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.090
which is t squared times
the total intensity.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.310
And in the other case,
we have a behavior

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.270
which is the time times the
spectral density at 0 detuning.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.360
OK.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.180
So now let's-- just a side
remark before I interpret this

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.590
result, this function you
would recover actually the Rabi

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.330
oscillation.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.050
I plotted it in
that way emphasizing

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.680
the amplitude and the width.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.150
But if you look for fixed
detuning and you vary the time,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.390
this function is
sort of spreading out

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.580
and at a fixed detuning,
you'll go up and down.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.100
And these are the
Rabi oscillations

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.720
we have discussed for
monochromatic radiation before.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.070
So these two limiting cases
are actually very important.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.830
At very short times, the
behavior is, you know,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.210
we have broad
spectral radiation.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.600
But if the time is shorter
than the inverse bandwidth

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.630
of the radiation, even
the broadband radiation

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.070
is like monochromatic wave.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.680
And the short time behavior is
t squared times the intensity.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.670
That's exactly what we got
for monochromatic light.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.256
In other words, if
you're broadening,

00:08:30.256 --> 00:08:31.630
you have a broad
spectral source,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.980
but if your inverse
time is broader

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.020
than the broadening of
the spectral source,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.409
you're back to the
monochromatic case.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.030
So a lot of people get confused.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.370
I mean, I see that often
in part 3 oral exams, that

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.080
no matter what your
spectral bandwidth

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.050
is-- unless it's infinite.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.140
But let's discuss a
pathological case.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.530
For any broadband
light, at short moments,

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.080
the system evolves as t square.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.050
And t square is the hallmark
of coherent time evolution.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.890
The amplitude goes with t.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.350
The probability
goes with t square.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.400
And only when the bandwidth
of the spectral light

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.200
dominates when we can replace
this by the delta function.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.390
Then we are in the
regime, which you all

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:18.350
know is Fermi's Golden Rule,
where we [INAUDIBLE] equation.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.540
And it all comes
from this formula.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.540
It all comes from assuming
Rabi oscillations.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.820
But then performing
the spectral integral

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.380
over the Rabi oscillation.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.960
This takes us from
the narrowband case

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.471
to the broadband case.

00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:34.800
Any questions about that?

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.300
Yes?

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.920
AUDIENCE: So what says
the bandwidth here?

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.097
Because we assume
its narrowness arises

00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:42.680
just because of the
short [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.140
PROFESSOR: I will
use an LED which

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.860
has a few nanometer bandwidths.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.540
Use sunlight which has a few
hundred nanometer bandwidths.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.850
Whatever your light source is.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.930
At this point, it's
a general discussion.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.996
And I'm not going beyond
the two limiting cases here.

00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:02.870
Of course, if you have
a complicated spectral

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.170
distribution, well,
you're on your own

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.700
to solve this integral.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.895
But at short times,
we have this behavior.

00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:13.560
At long times, we have this.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.920
And the two regimes
are separated

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.410
by the time where I have
a crossover in one case.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.310
This is broader and I can
pull it out in the other case.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.370
This function is broader and
I pull it out of the integral.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.480
And just where
this happens, this

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.710
is where we have the transition
from t squared to t behavior.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.895
From coherent evolution
to rate equation.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.290
OK.

00:10:57.595 --> 00:10:58.095
Yes.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.230
So let's now look at the
situation of broadband light.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.600
Because later today I
want to discuss with you

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.380
Einstein's a and b coefficient.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.860
A very classical topic
of atomic physics.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.980
A very famous concept
introduced by Einstein.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.870
And actually I want to use
the perturbation theory

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.710
for broadband light which
we have now formulated

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.120
to derive for you the b
coefficient of Einstein's a

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.780
and b coefficient theory.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:33.280
OK.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:44.375
So for large time, we
can now talk about rate.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:54.420
Which is the probability
which increases linearly

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.180
with time per unit time.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:04.160
And this was the
matrix element squared.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.470
2 epsilon 0 h-bar squared, 2 pi.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.260
The 2 cancels.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.690
And then we have from the delta
function, the spectral density

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.690
at 0 detuning.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.755
Which is the spectral density
at the resonance frequency.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.250
So we have a rate equation now.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.760
That the rate equation
is the b coefficient.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.240
Einstein's famous b coefficient
times the spectral density.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.530
And the b coefficient is
now the proportionality

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.640
constant between in
the equation above.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.280
Which is pi d squared.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.500
But now in all the formula
for the b coefficient,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.790
there's a factor of 3.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.770
Because the assumption is made
that we have isotropy of space.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.160
The atom are randomly oriented.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:20.310
And, therefore, dx squared
for given polarization,

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.230
the dipole moment projected on a
polarization of the light which

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:27.462
is dx squared is just
1/3 of the absolute value

00:13:27.462 --> 00:13:28.670
of the dipole moment squared.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.640
So in other words,
just to remind you

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.300
what I have actually
discussed is nothing else

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.820
than Fermi's Golden Rule.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.030
And I could've reminded
you of Fermi's Golden Rule

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.490
where the rate is given.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.330
I just use a standard
notation of textbooks.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.580
You take the matrix element
squared, you multiply by 2 pi,

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.135
and then you have
a delta function.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:12.659
And the delta function implies
a delta function is always

00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:14.200
a reminder that it
needs integration.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.305
So whenever you have a delta
function in Fermi's Golden

00:14:21.305 --> 00:14:24.980
Rule, you have to integrate.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.760
And there are two possibilities.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.710
You have to integrate over the
spectrum of external fields.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.550
That's what we just did.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:38.610
The other possibility is, which
doesn't apply to what we just

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.350
discussed, that you
have to integrate over

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.120
a continuum of final states.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.790
This will be important when
we use a Fermi's Golden Rule

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.350
expression to talk about
spontaneous emission

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.574
where we have a continuum
of final states.

00:14:56.574 --> 00:14:57.990
So anyway, I could
have just said,

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.700
let's start with
Fermi's Golden Rule

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.030
and let's jump to
the final result.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.990
But I really wanted
to emphasize here

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.880
the sort of intimate connection
between Rabi oscillation,

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.090
the t square
dependence, and how this

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.730
turns into a rate equation.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.030
OK.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:33.106
Let's just summarize what
we have done in a table.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.955
We have seen two
different regime.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.990
In one case with
the Rabi resonance,

00:15:50.990 --> 00:16:01.850
we are discussing a single
final state of the atom.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:06.720
A single mode of the
electromagnetic field.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.070
All energy levels, all
states are discrete.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:18.650
We are talking about unitary
reversible time evolution.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.650
When we had rate
equations, we are

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.750
talking about many final states.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.720
We integrate over them.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:36.870
Or and/or many modes
of the external field.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.750
We are naturally dealing
not with a discrete number,

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.225
but with a continuum of states.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.360
The time evolution has
become irreversible.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.090
And is therefore no
longer unitary evolution,

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.450
but it's a
dissipative evolution.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:07.520
And all this came
about not because we

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.970
have spontaneous emission.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.919
I will tell you
throughout this course

00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:15.300
that spontaneous emission
is not as spontaneous

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.200
as everybody assumes.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.349
Spontaneous emission is
actually unitary time evolution.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:22.770
Unless you discard information.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.480
But a lot of people think
rate equation irreversibility

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.370
comes from something
which is genuinely

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.737
spontaneous and irreproducable.

00:17:31.737 --> 00:17:33.320
I don't know anything
in physics which

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.736
is spontaneous and
irreproducible.

00:17:34.736 --> 00:17:35.890
But we come to that later.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.740
And this is an example where
we obtain rate equation

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.570
by simply driving a system.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.292
And the irreversibility comes
by performing the integral

00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:44.375
over the spectral density.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.290
So let me just write that down.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:55.150
Due to integration.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.980
Since we integrate
over an infinite number

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.735
of modes or states.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:14.640
Any questions?

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:20.310
OK, great.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:25.250
I wanted to make sure
that this is very clear.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:29.130
OK, at this point,
let me just summarize

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:33.650
where we are in our discussion
of atom light interaction.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.110
We've actually made
a lot of progress.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.855
We have discussed
matrix elements.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:48.450
We have discussed the coupling
of atoms to an external field

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.349
at the level of the
Schroedinger equation.

00:18:51.349 --> 00:18:52.890
And we have done
perturbation theory.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.310
And in perturbation
theory, we found

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:05.665
Rabi oscillations and
we found rate equations.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.340
That's where we are right now.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.720
So the feature now
which is missing

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.500
is, of course, damping
spontaneous emission

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.790
irreversability-- another
form of irreversibility.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:27.290
Right now our Rabi
oscillations are undamped.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.290
Whether we obtain them
in perturbation theory

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:34.440
or whether we use the
spin formalism to get them

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.600
in the resonant in the
strong coupling case.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.780
And here, for the rate equation,
the way how we have solved it,

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.250
the probability to be
in the excited state

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.164
just increases forever.

00:19:48.164 --> 00:19:49.830
The system will never
reach equilibrium.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.726
But that means in both cases,
we have a missing element.

00:20:00.726 --> 00:20:02.100
And this is
spontaneous emission.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.720
So for the next
hour or two, we'll

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.140
talk about aspects of
spontaneous emission.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.190
Spontaneous emission
will actually eventually

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.560
lead to damping of
Rabi oscillation.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.070
And to a saturation
of the excitation.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.330
OK, so we're now discussing
spontaneous emission.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.490
And we will discuss it
in actually three levels.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:48.180
One is I will discuss
Einstein's a and b coefficients.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.390
I sometimes hesitate.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.489
Should I really discuss
Einstein's a and b

00:20:52.489 --> 00:20:53.030
coefficients?

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.890
It's sort of old fashioned.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.680
And I have already in
perturbation theory

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.660
given you a
microscopic derivation

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.620
of Einstein's b coefficient.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.960
But everybody who is
an atomic physicist

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.060
knows about Einstein's
a and b coefficient.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.490
It was really a stroke
of a genius to do it.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.920
And it becomes sort
of our language.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.801
So what I'm doing here is
I'm not beating it to death,

00:21:15.801 --> 00:21:17.425
but I give you sort
of a short summary.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.450
It's also sort of I make a
few comments which is actually

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.040
amazing.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.280
How Einstein actually got
results from the a and b

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.280
coefficient which you
can only get otherwise

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.590
if you quantize
electromagnetic field.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.560
So it's also sort of
historically interesting

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.480
that Einstein actually developed
the theory of the a and b

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.810
coefficient before the
Schroedinger equation.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.970
Before quantum
mechanics was developed.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.820
And often you call Schroedinger
equation the first quantization

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.180
and the field quantization,
the second quantization.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.000
So in some sense,
Einstein actually

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.490
preempted or had already the
results of second quantization

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.450
before first quantization
was developed.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.780
Anyway, it's a landmark
paper, how Einstein did it.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.170
And that's why I
want to discuss it.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.150
But it's partially also
in order to give you

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.180
the historical context.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:19.000
But then, of course, we want to
use the modern formalism of use

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.680
of quantization of the
electromagnetic field.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.295
And we have already
obtained just now the result

00:22:27.295 --> 00:22:31.650
for Einstein's b coefficient
by just looking at the induced

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.440
by the absorption rate
or the stimulated rate.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.340
But then eventually having
a microscopic quantization.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.260
By having a quantization of
the electromagnetic field,

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:49.060
we can also do now microscopic
fully quantum first principle

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.760
calculation of
the a coefficient.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.510
So then we have already
the b coefficient,

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.730
we get the a coefficient out
of microscopic calculation.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.187
So we don't really need
Einstein's treatment of a and b

00:22:59.187 --> 00:22:59.770
at this point.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.840
But it's nice to
see the connections.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.340
So anyway.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.740
So this is the agenda.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.870
Einstein's a and b
coefficient to pull out

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.350
spontaneous emission
without even putting it in.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.000
Then we'll talk about
field quantization which

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.960
automatically leads
us to a treatment

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.070
of spontaneous emission.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.830
Any questions?

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:28.935
So how was Einstein
able to show that there

00:23:28.935 --> 00:23:33.540
is spontaneous
emission without sort

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.975
of knowing the quantum
character of fields?

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:43.714
Well, the point was
he knew and understood

00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:45.380
that there would be
thermal equilibrium.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.060
He said, I know what
thermal equilibrium is.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.330
Thermal equilibrium is
the Boltzmann coefficient.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.246
A Boltzmann
probability for an atom

00:23:58.246 --> 00:23:59.370
to be in the excited state.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.830
The probability to be
in the excited state

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.780
is just the Boltzmann
factor and depends

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.360
on temperature in the usual way.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.710
And he also knew that
the spectrum of light

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.210
would follow a
plank distribution.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.500
And if you put those things
together, you go beyond that.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.750
Because you are in
thermal equilibrium.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.470
This here what we
derived so far does not

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.580
have thermal equilibrium.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.950
And thermal
equilibrium only comes

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.460
through the damping of
spontaneous emission.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:31.010
So, therefore, by Einstein just
using Boltzmann distribution

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.880
and Planck law, he got
spontaneous emission.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.456
And this is what I
just want to show you.

00:24:37.456 --> 00:24:38.830
For most of you,
it's a reminder.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.010
OK.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.680
Einstein's a and b coefficients.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.660
I will post one of Einstein's
papers on the website.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.450
He was also the first
to actually discuss

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.750
mechanical forces of light.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:18.710
He realized that if you have
a gas at a temperature which

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.830
is different from the
temperature in the womb,

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.040
the gas has to equilibrate.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:29.270
And the gas can only equilibrate
loose, excess velocity

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:34.480
by transferring its
momentum to the photons.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.360
So some equations of
laser cooling, the fact

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.240
that light can exchange
momentum with a particle.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.610
And this is eventually
what leads to equilibrium,

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:48.232
was already in papers at the
beginning of the 20th century.

00:25:48.232 --> 00:25:50.190
And it's just amazing if
you read those papers.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.530
How modern the language is
and how clear the language is.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.520
But here, I'm not talking
about the mechanical effects.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.540
But the mechanical
effects of light

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:05.590
which many people in this
class use for a living, this

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.340
is actually part
of this equation.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.410
Because the equilibrium
between-- again,

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.970
I discuss here Einstein's
a and b coefficient--

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:17.410
the equilibrium between
the electronic structure,

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.060
the ground and excited
state with a photon field.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.740
But Einstein also
considered the equilibrium

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.360
between the motional
degree of the atom.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.390
And equilibrium between
the motional degree

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.800
of the atom and
the radiation field

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.140
requires the spontaneous force.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.830
The spontaneous radiation force.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.120
I'm not discussing it here.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.580
But I'm discussing here is now
an equilibrium between ground

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.250
state and excited state.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:03.520
So the probability to find
an atom in the excited state

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:10.390
is simply described by
the Boltzmann factor.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.450
Now it's traditional
in the discussion

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:16.960
of Einstein's a
and b coefficient

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:24.260
to allow for degeneracy factors
at ground and excited state.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.620
I have to say I
usually hate that I

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.960
try not to talk about levels.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.900
I just talk about
quantum states.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.800
Non-degenerate individual
quantum states.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.720
So in that sense, I try
to characterize population

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.070
in a quantum state,
not in a level.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.230
But it is standard to
follow Einstein's concept

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.270
where we have degeneracies.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.920
I'm not emphasizing them
here, but I will just

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.610
write them down
where they belong.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.430
OK, so this takes care.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:58.240
We know what is a fraction of
atoms in the excited state.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.890
So this is the equilibrium.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:10.720
The next thing we
need is the light.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.080
And Einstein assumed that
it's a spectral density

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.740
in a black-body cavity.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:27.710
So we need the energy density
per frequency interval.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.210
And this is nothing else
than the occupation number

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:36.730
of the mode times the
energy of the photon.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:41.185
Times the density of states.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.360
The photon number
per mode is just

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:57.650
given by the
Bose-Einstein factor.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:01.040
Bose-Einstein statistics factor.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:10.710
The mode density is, as you
know, in three dimension.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:14.720
Omega squared, pi
square over c cube.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:28.470
So, therefore, the spectral
density of black-body radiation

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:33.430
has-- and we need that,
and omega cube dependence.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:47.380
And then it has this
Bose-Einstein denominator

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.810
in the well-known form.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:52.460
So this is now Planck's
black-body spectrum

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.190
in the units where we need it.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:07.110
So all we need is now to find
the famous Einstein a and b

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.090
coefficient.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.270
We have to write down a
rate equation for the atoms.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.820
So the fact is we know
already what equilibrium is.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.050
Excited state versus
ground state population

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.310
is the Boltzmann factor.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.100
But now we write
down a rate equation

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.040
which involves a
black-body field.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.410
And then we compare the
solution of the rate equation

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.520
to the solution we already know.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.170
And from that, we get
Einstein's a and b coefficient.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:47.860
OK, so the change in the
population of the excited state

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.270
has three different terms.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:58.360
One is the energy density
of the black-body radiation

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:04.080
can cause stimulated emission.

00:31:11.004 --> 00:31:12.920
So, therefore, it's
proportional to the number

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.460
of atoms in the excited state.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.480
The energy density of
the black-body radiation

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.464
can cause absorption.

00:31:25.464 --> 00:31:26.880
This is proportional
to the number

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.280
of atoms in the ground state.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:49.800
And then this
equation as it stands

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.700
would lead to contradiction
when I compare

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.040
the solution of this equation to
the Boltzmann factor we already

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.220
know.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:01.800
And the only way to fix it
is to add an extra term.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.450
Which is spontaneous emission.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:09.800
If spontaneous emission
were not necessary,

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.550
this a coefficient could in
the end turn out to be 0.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.320
Or it can be undetermined.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.355
But as we see, it is
necessary for consistency.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.955
So this is pretty much
the famous rate equation.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:38.005
And we are interested in
the equilibrium solution.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:50.640
In equilibrium, all
derivatives vanish.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:33:02.120
And then by setting
the derivatives to 0,

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.980
I have one equation.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:11.970
And I will rewrite the equation
by putting the spectral density

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:13.740
of the light on one side.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:19.280
And everything else
on the other side.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.976
And what we have here
is the a coefficient.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.660
The ground state population,
the excited state population.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.423
The b coefficient.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.570
So this is the spectral
density of-- it's

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.340
just an expression for
the spectral density.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:52.570
We want to put in now that
the excited state fraction is

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.640
given by a Boltzmann factor.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:04.650
So, therefore, Ne over Ng
becomes the Boltzmann factor.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.310
And, yes, there are
these degeneracy factors.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.060
So I've pretty much divided the
denominator and the numerator

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.120
by the population in
the excited state.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.350
And here I get Beg

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:26.170
OK, so this is the result
for the spectral density.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:31.409
But we know already that
the spectral density

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.570
has to be of the Planck form.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.870
So now we can
simply compare what

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.170
we know to what we obtained
from the rate equation

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.435
and make sure that it matches.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:53.580
So it's good we have
the exponential factor.

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.580
And by bringing this
expression to the form

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.720
of the other
expression, we actually

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.730
have to fulfill two conditions.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:07.060
One is in order to
make sure that kind

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:10.440
of the total expression is
OK, it gives us a ratio.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.290
The Planck body
spectrum is normalized.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.080
There is no unknown prefactor.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.250
So this determines
the ratio of a and b.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:21.910
And also since we have
this functional form

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.730
of the Bose-Einstein
statistics which

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.930
has this exponential
factor minus 1,

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:29.640
it gives us also a relation
between the 2B coefficient.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.697
That one is the b coefficient
for stimulated emission.

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:34.280
And the other one
is the b coefficient

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.155
for force absorption.

00:35:40.791 --> 00:35:41.290
OK.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:45.880
So with that, we
have the relation

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.460
between the a coefficient
and the b coefficient.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:05.950
And we find that the B
coefficient for absorption

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.537
and emission are the same.

00:36:08.537 --> 00:36:10.370
Well, we know it's the
same coupling matrix.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.340
I mean, the Hamiltonian
which connects ground

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.840
to excited state, excited
state to ground state.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.650
But if you really want to
deal with degenerate states

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:22.720
and not formulated for states,
you have degeneracy factors.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.820
OK So I could stop here.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.960
This is sort of the
textbook result.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:34.150
But I want to rewrite the
result that we recognize

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.120
the quantization of the
electromagnetic field.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.300
So instead of just looking at
the power in Planck spectrum,

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.990
spectral density, and such.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:49.790
I want to bring in
the photon number.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.140
I've already given you the
Bose-Einstein distribution

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.140
for the photon
number in the mode.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:59.795
So I take now equation
a and multiply it

00:36:59.795 --> 00:37:02.640
with the average photon
number in a mode of omega.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:23.420
This gives me on
the left hand side--

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.230
I'm multiplying this
with a photon number.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.650
So on the left hand side, I
have a times the photon number.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:32.990
On the right hand side, when
I put in the photon number,

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:34.800
the photon number
with this expression

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.800
just give me the
Planck distribution,

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.950
the spectral energy.

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:47.550
So yes.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:53.840
This gives me the
spectral energy density

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.850
times the b coefficient.

00:38:05.245 --> 00:38:05.745
Yes.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.590
And this is nothing else
than stimulated emission.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:18.340
So we realize that
stimulated emission

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.660
is nothing else than n
times the photon number.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:28.510
The photon number n times
spontaneous emission.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:39.700
Similarly, we know that
the rate for absorption

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:46.040
becomes now, well,
the same unless we

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.340
have degeneracy factors.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:54.030
But just for the
fundamental discussion,

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.130
let's avoid the [? p ?]
counting how many

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.760
degenerate levels a level have.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.970
Let's just assume we have
a situation that we just

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.320
count every state individually.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.220
Then I can summarize this
result saw in the following.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.010
That the total rate
for emission was

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:35.700
proportional to n for
stimulated emission.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:40.350
And then we have the extra
1 for spontaneous emission.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:45.180
Whereas the rate
for absorption was

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.970
n times the
spontaneous emission.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:57.510
So we find that this important
formula that emission

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:00.140
has an n plus 1 factor.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.560
Absorption has an n factor.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.030
And it is, of course,
this extra plus 1

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.340
which was absolutely crucial to
establish thermal equilibrium.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.850
If a had been 0, no
thermal equilibrium

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.980
would have been reached.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:20.480
So in other words,
what is already

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.350
in Einstein's treatment
of the a and b coefficient

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.600
is that if you understand
absorption, which

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.780
you can understand with
the Schroedinger equation,

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.260
and you understand
and you write it

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:36.610
in the fundamental
way in photon numbers,

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.780
then spontaneous
emission is just

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.180
the rate of absorption
divided by n.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:49.010
Spontaneous emission is like
induced emission in its rate.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.680
But by just one single photon.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.636
So as I pointed out, this
is a result which is usually

00:40:57.636 --> 00:40:59.010
obtained with
second quantization

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:02.440
and it is already included in
Einstein's a and b coefficient.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.270
So we could stop here.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.420
We have already a major
result which is usually

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.000
obtained in field quantization.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.639
But there is one deficiency
and we want clearly

00:41:13.639 --> 00:41:15.680
fix it and move on to the
microscopic derivation.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.300
And this is the following.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:20.350
Right now, we really assume
black-body radiation.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.170
And this ratio n plus
1 over n was only

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.920
derived for average
photon numbers

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.330
in a spectrally broad field.

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:32.070
And what is left for
microscopic treatment which

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:36.530
I want to present now is even
if you have just a single mode,

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.170
the atom can only interact
with a single mode.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.670
We find that stimulated
emission and absorption

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:45.330
is proportional to n, the number
of photons already present.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:49.110
And then there is plus 1
for spontaneous emission.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:53.700
So in other words, we do it now
sort of microscopically again.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.480
And what we get out of
it is that everything

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.470
we learned from Einstein's
a and b coefficient

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.400
is not just valid in
thermal equilibrium.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.560
It's not just valid
for average numbers.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.101
It's really valid for
single mode physics.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.110
OK, so the agenda
is what is next.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:27.410
Is valid.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.180
4n.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.590
So this expression
is valid not only

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:46.280
for an average over many modes,
but for each single mode.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:01.644
Questions about Einstein's
a and b coefficient?

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:11.180
OK.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.680
So we spend now the
rest of today and parts

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.880
of next Monday in a
microscopic derivation

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.260
of spontaneous emission
using field quantization.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.825
But I just want
to make you aware

00:43:22.825 --> 00:43:25.040
that we know already what it is.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.615
We have a semi-classical
derivation

00:43:26.615 --> 00:43:28.550
of the b coefficient.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.600
And Einstein's treatment
gives us the ratio of a and b.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.610
So we know already
at this point what

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.720
the rate of spontaneous
emission is.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.150
But it is nice.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.900
I think also important
for our education

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.200
to obtain it in
a microscopic way

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:54.110
where we really show how we
have to-- sum overall modes

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:56.866
and such to obtain
the expression.

00:43:56.866 --> 00:43:58.240
Also I want to
ask you questions.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.775
I want to ask you clicker
questions afterwards.

00:43:59.775 --> 00:44:01.630
And one clicker
question for you is

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.180
what happens to
spontaneous emission

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.210
in one and two dimension?

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.130
Certain things will change.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:11.200
And it's much clearer
what will change

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.300
if you have a clear
understanding how we sum up

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.060
all of the modes.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.630
How all the possible
modes contribute

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.530
to spontaneous emission.

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.930
And, of course, in two
dimension and one dimension,

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.270
you have a different
density of modes.

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:31.150
So with that motivation, we
need a quantized electromagnetic

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:32.666
field.

00:44:32.666 --> 00:44:35.480
Where we quantize the
field for each mode.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.456
And then we go back, we do
the summation of all modes.

00:44:38.456 --> 00:44:40.080
And we've really
understood in the most

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.855
fundamental and microscopic way
how photons and light interact.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.990
OK, so our next chapter
is the quantization

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:52.280
of the radiation field.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:06.785
We do-- yes, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:06.785 --> 00:45:09.260
AUDIENCE: I just
have a question.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:12.725
So when we compare the rate
equation and the distribution

00:45:12.725 --> 00:45:17.675
of the photons, so there is a
parameter, t, in both of them.

00:45:17.675 --> 00:45:20.645
So we just assume two
t's are the same because

00:45:20.645 --> 00:45:22.625
of their reaching
thermal equilibrium.

00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:23.730
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.230
Absolutely.

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:28.430
I mean this is, of course,
what Einstein assumed

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.770
that the thermal equilibrium
for atoms with the Boltzmann

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.850
factor.

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:36.690
And the thermal equilibrium for
photons described at the Planck

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:39.305
distribution have to be reached
at the same temperature.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.860
It was a
thermodynamical argument

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.240
assuming which
is, of course, one

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.490
of the tenets of statistical
physics of thermodynamics.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.200
If you have two systems and
they interact with each other,

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.817
they equilibrate at
the same temperature.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:03.540
Yes, this is very important.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.081
This was a very
important assumption.

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:16.100
Of course, as we know, when we
have ultra cold atoms in a room

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.690
temperature vacuum chamber,
the atoms do not equilibrate.

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:25.850
But if you would trap them for
an infinite amount of time,

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:28.180
they would equilibrate.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.512
It's just that we lose
the atoms from our trap.

00:46:31.512 --> 00:46:33.595
They're knocked out by
[INAUDIBLE] gas collisions.

00:46:33.595 --> 00:46:35.650
A lot of other things happen.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:39.750
But if you could isolate just
ultra cold atoms in a trap,

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.350
they would stay in
this trap forever.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:46.060
There would be no other effect
shortening our observation

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:46.660
time.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.800
Eventually, the atoms would
just boil out of your trap

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.590
because black-body radiation.

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.390
Momentum transfer from
black-body photons

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:58.815
heats the atoms up
to room temperature.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.210
And this is, of course, one of
the things which really amaze

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.520
people when laser
cooling came along.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.610
You know, everything at low
temperature was cryogenic.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.110
If you want to
keep a sample cold,

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:17.640
you had to put liquid nitrogen
shields, helium shields.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.934
You had to put multiple
shields around--

00:47:20.934 --> 00:47:22.350
if you had an
optical [INAUDIBLE],

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:24.830
you had a window of liquid
nitrogen temperature.

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:26.900
One window at
helium temperature.

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.690
Just to make sure that
the black-body radiation

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.410
is absorbed and blocked.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:34.090
Because it would've been
absolutely detrimental

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.670
if you had a sample at
very low temperature

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:40.520
and it would've been exposed
to black-body radiation.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.720
So it's really a unique
feature of the atoms

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:48.255
that they are, and this
is what you will calculate

00:47:48.255 --> 00:47:52.380
in this week's problem set, that
the atoms are almost completely

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.720
transparent to the
black-body radiation.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.970
They only react if the hyperfine
frequency or they react far,

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:01.300
far, far, far, far
off in the tail

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.810
of the black-body radiation
with an electronic transition.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:07.850
But nevertheless, as
Einstein has taught us,

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:10.840
and as we know from
general principles,

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.020
this will not mean
that the atoms

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:17.940
stay cold and are decoupled.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:23.260
It just means that it takes
maybe the age of the universe.

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.990
I've never calculated
the number.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:28.415
It would really take forever
until the atoms in the atom

00:48:28.415 --> 00:48:35.320
trap reach the
ambient temperature.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.180
So Einstein's argument
was an idealized argument

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:39.740
which in practice
would never happen.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.310
But if you exclude
all other processes,

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.490
you have a consistent
system by saying

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:47.100
I only have atoms with
their kinetic energy.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.740
I have black-body radiation.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.320
And everything has
to equilibrate.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.130
And as I said
before, the argument

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.160
for Einstein's a
and b coefficient

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.770
simply assumes that the ground
and excited state population

00:48:58.770 --> 00:48:59.850
equilibrium.

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.010
But you can carry the
argument even further

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:05.230
and say even the
Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:08.090
distribution of the
atoms has to equilibrate

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.120
at the ambient temperature.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.200
Beautiful argument.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.700
And what you find
from this argument

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.700
is it's really amazing.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.560
You find the photon
recall is h-bar k.

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:24.300
Einstein pulled it out simply
by making this assumption.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.240
I will post the paper on that.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.960
OK, field quantization.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.190
We discuss the quantization
of the electromagnetic field

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.200
really from first principles.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.990
From vector potential,
radiation field, Coulomb gauge,

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:45.480
transverse vector
potential, in 8422.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.240
So we dedicate
one or two classes

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.770
to just discuss all
the steps to have

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.800
full quantization of the
electromagnetic field

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.080
with all the bells and whistles.

00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.910
So sometimes when I
teach this course,

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.647
I say, well, you've heard
about field quantization,

00:50:02.647 --> 00:50:03.480
I can refer to that.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.080
Or I can refer you to 8422.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:09.420
But in the end I thought,
why don't I just give you

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.425
a 10 minute derivation.

00:50:10.425 --> 00:50:14.160
Just sort of focusing on
the essential because this

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.005
makes this cause
more self-contained

00:50:16.005 --> 00:50:18.060
and more complete.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.280
So I give you now a
ten minute quantization

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.820
of the electromagnetic field.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:26.100
Pretty much going
straight to showing you

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.297
electromagnetic field
isn't harmonic oscillator.

00:50:28.297 --> 00:50:30.005
And now let's use the
quantum description

00:50:30.005 --> 00:50:31.280
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.060
And then we have a
quantum description

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.990
of the electromagnetic field.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:38.855
So this is not rigorous,
but it is logically compete.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:45.450
So we focus in the discussion
of the quantization

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:48.040
of the electromagnetic
field, we focus just

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:51.180
on a single mode of the
electromagnetic field.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.450
Each mode will be an
harmonic oscillator.

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.549
And then we have many
harmonic oscillators

00:50:59.549 --> 00:51:01.090
comprising the
electromagnetic field.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:11.150
So a even single mode, we
assume that we have plain waves

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:13.170
with a polarization,
with an amplitude.

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.730
The electric field
is the derivative

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:32.950
of the vector potential.

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:37.520
And the shortest way
to show you an analogy

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.940
with the harmonic
oscillator is to remind you

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:45.570
that the total energy--
which is actually

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:48.610
if you're wondering
about a factor of 2,

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:52.870
the electric and the magnetic
part, the total energy

00:51:52.870 --> 00:52:02.090
is quadratic in the amplitude
of the vector potential.

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.210
By the way, there
is a factor of 1/2

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:12.250
because if you have a
sinusoidal variation,

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:15.130
you take the time average,
cosine squared, which is 1/2.

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:24.920
Well, if the total energy is
quadratic in the amplitude,

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:31.160
this immediately allows
us to draw analogies

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.095
to an harmonic oscillator.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:39.170
And we can use the
vector potential

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:42.920
of the single mode of
the electromagnetic field

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:46.090
to define two
quantities, q and p.

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:51.490
Let me write it in that way.

00:52:51.490 --> 00:53:08.580
Omega q, plus ip, is related
to a in the following way.

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:18.330
And yes, I was just
ranting about this.

00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:20.730
v is the volume.

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:24.030
We assume everything happens
in a finite volume of space.

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:30.650
Value would say I have two
new quantities, q and p.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:32.680
So I need two equations.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:37.885
And the two equations involved
a and a complex conjugate.

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:45.600
So now we had an expression
for the total energy

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.760
in terms of the amplitude
of the vector potential.

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.830
So now I can rewrite it the
amplitude square of the vector

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:56.910
potential is a times a star.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:02.700
And with that I get
the total energy

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:07.500
to be proportional to
q square plus p square.

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:10.350
And that should remind you,
and if everything was set up

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:13.910
to remind you, that this looks
like a harmonic oscillator

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:16.420
where q is the
position variable.

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.930
And p is the momentum variable.

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.730
So now, I mean all
this is classical.

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:27.720
All this is just
clever definitions.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.330
But now we have to do a
leap to quantum physics.

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:31.780
We cannot logically derive it.

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:33.140
We have to make a leap.

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:43.034
And the leap is that we
postulate that this should now

00:54:43.034 --> 00:54:44.950
be described as a quantum
harmonic oscillator.

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:50.920
And this transition is
done by simply postulating

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.210
that the two quantities
we have defined

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:58.925
fulfill the canonical commutator
for position and momentum.

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:06.910
So we've started with the vector
potential, expressed the energy

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:08.890
as a vector
potential, and now we

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:12.670
say we recognize through
those definitions

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:15.470
that this is an harmonic
oscillator with variables q

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:18.606
and p which are defined in
terms of the vector potential.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.520
So then you know if you have the
quantized harmonic oscillator,

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:30.155
you immediately introduce
creation and annihilation

00:55:30.155 --> 00:55:30.655
operators.

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:41.930
Which are linear
superpositions of q and p

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:44.540
in the following form.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:48.650
And a dagger has
a minus sign here.

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:52.780
And all the prefactors were
cleverly set up in such a way

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.390
that the commutator of
a and a dagger is 1.

00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:01.510
And now we can do all
the substitutions.

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:05.350
We can express p and
q by a and a dagger.

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:09.440
But p and q were related
to the vector potential, a.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.970
And the vector potential a
square defined the energy.

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:16.130
So now we have an expression
for the energy which

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:18.610
is no longer involving
a or p and q.

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:20.890
It involves a and a dagger.

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:27.260
And surprise, surprise, we
find that our total energy

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:31.040
because we have operators
now has become a Hamiltonian,

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.190
Has this well-known result
with the photon number operator

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:37.870
a dagger, a plus 1/2.

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:52.520
So this is sort of the
quickest way which takes us

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.860
in a few minutes to the
quantized electromagnetic

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.180
field.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.930
Of course, all I
need is to come back

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:02.480
to spontaneous
emission stimulated

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:07.010
emission are the matrix
elements of this operator's

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.380
a and a dagger.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.510
And this is where,
of course, stimulated

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:15.540
and spontaneous emission--
all that comes in.

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:26.720
The non-vanishing
matrix elements

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.850
in this description of
the electromagnetic field

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.690
are the ones where a
annihilates a photon

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:36.820
and the matrix element
is square root n.

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.410
Or where a creates a
photon, adds a photon

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:43.560
to n photons already present.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:47.125
And then the matrix
element is n plus 1.

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:54.250
OK, so we went from a to q.

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:55.630
And p.

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:59.050
And we went to a and a dagger.

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:04.500
But a is also related
to the electric field

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:08.350
by taking the time derivative
of the vector potential.

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:17.480
So now, of course, we can
go from our expressions

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.770
of a and a dagger
all the way back.

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:22.940
Just substitute,
substitute, substitute.

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:29.220
And find an expression
for the electric field

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.590
in terms of a and a dagger.

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:50.616
The result is that we have
a and here we have a dagger.

00:58:50.616 --> 00:58:53.750
We have a polarization vector.

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:59.440
We have the plain wave vector.

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.740
And the complex conjugate.

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:05.325
And the complex conjugate
of a is a dagger

00:59:05.325 --> 00:59:07.650
so the electric field
is a superposition

00:59:07.650 --> 00:59:09.270
of a and a dagger.

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:12.700
The electric field
becomes an operator

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:18.250
which is the sum of
creation-annihilation operator.

00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:21.850
So with that, we can go
back to our Hamiltonian.

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:24.750
Our Hamiltonian for the
interaction between light

00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:28.640
and atoms in the
simplest possible case

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.460
was the dipole Hamiltonian.

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:38.320
Which involves a
dipole matrix element.

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.020
The charge of the
electron is negative.

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.410
That's why the minus
sign has disappeared.

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:45.490
And now all we do is
from our treatment

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:47.990
before in the Schroedinger
equation where

00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:50.420
the electric field
was an external field.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.550
Now the electric field
becomes the operator

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:55.960
acting on the quantum state
of the electromagnetic field.

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:15.000
So by the way, this prefactor
here is because the rest of it

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.560
is just dimensionless.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:24.660
This prefactor has, so we
have the matrix element here,

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.370
this prefactor is
an electric field.

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:30.150
And it's something you
should always know.

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:33.090
This electric field is
actually the electric field

01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:34.490
of a single photon.

01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:35.980
This is the correct
normalization.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.660
If you want to factor out the
volume, the frequency, and all

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.390
that, you combine these
factors in such a way

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:44.830
that it's electric field
of a single photon.

01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:46.850
Then we have the dipole moment.

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:51.890
And then we have an expression
with creation and annihilation

01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:59.300
operator over here.

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:02.985
I assume now that the
atom sits at r equals 0.

01:01:02.985 --> 01:01:06.165
So why should I carry
forward an e to the ikr term.

01:01:06.165 --> 01:01:09.760
We conveniently place
the atoms at r equals 0.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.870
But I have to say a word or
two about the e to the i omega

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:16.320
t factor.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.230
I have been deliberately
cavalier about my formulation

01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:21.900
in quantum physics,
of quantum mechanics,

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.920
whether I use the Schroedinger
or the Heisenberg picture.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.770
And you know in the
Schroedinger picture

01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:29.250
the wave function is time
dependent, not the operator.

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:32.280
In the Heisenberg picture,
it's the other way around.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.590
And I have to tell you every
time I do a calculation

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.760
and look at it, I'm getting
confused about the two

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.110
pictures.

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:41.900
So anyway, trust me
that in this case when

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.260
I want to discuss the
Schroedinger picture,

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.670
the time dependent factor
should not be present.

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:50.610
But you really have to
look at the derivation

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.870
and carefully realize
the two are connected

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:55.120
with a unitary transformation.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.703
You really have to
figure out in which

01:01:56.703 --> 01:01:58.150
[INAUDIBLE]
presentation you are.

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:00.670
But I want to not focus
on the formality here.

01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:02.780
But I'm not carrying
forward this factor

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:07.070
because I want to discuss
the Schroedinger picture.

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:08.830
OK.

01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:11.050
Yes.

01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:18.081
So now we can look at the matrix
elements of our interaction

01:02:18.081 --> 01:02:18.580
Hamiltonian.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:24.850
And just to be clear,
we have written down

01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:31.400
this Hamiltonian for just a
single mode of the radiation

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:31.900
field.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.920
Depending on what we
are interested in,

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.350
we may have to sum
over many, many modes.

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:48.270
So we are looking at transitions
from an initial state

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:50.830
which may be an excited state.

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:54.660
To a final state which
may be a ground state.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.220
And since we have quantized
the magnetic fields,

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:04.570
we also have to specify the
state of the quantum field.

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:09.040
And we assume that the uncoupled
Hamiltonian, of course,

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.340
has simply number states as
eigenstates [INAUDIBLE] photons

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.310
and prime photons.

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:26.420
So the only non-vanishing matrix
elements are the following.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.880
e is a charge.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.460
e hat is the polarization.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:43.160
Epsilon 1 is the electric
field of a single photon.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.380
And, of course, we
only have a coupling

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.580
by the fully
quantized Hamiltonian

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:50.870
when we have a dipole
matrix element connecting

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:51.665
state a and b.

01:03:51.665 --> 01:03:53.790
I mean these are all sort
of things we have already

01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:56.580
discussed in another context.

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:01.750
But now the a's and a daggers
which only act on the photon

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:12.480
field, give rise value
to two couplings.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.075
One is absorption
and one is emission.

01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:22.320
Absorption takes place when
we look at the matrix element

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.410
when the final state
has one more photon.

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:34.010
And emission takes
the other way around.

01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:38.090
When the final state has one
more, which way do we go?

01:04:42.057 --> 01:04:43.140
Let me just write it down.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.014
And then read it off.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.390
I think I've inverted, but
anyway, initial and final state

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:58.840
can differ by plus one
photon or minus one photon.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.600
In one case it's absorption,
the other case it's emission.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.660
And the matrix element
is n or n plus 1.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.810
So one is absorption.

01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:12.840
And one is emission.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:24.670
So finally if we ask,
what are the rates

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:35.130
of absorption and
emission when we

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:42.940
assume we have a situation
where-- and we have now

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:45.680
discussed the matrix element
and this matrix element could

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.930
become the basis of
Fermi's Golden Rule.

01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:50.490
We just have to specify time
dependent perturbation theory.

01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:54.630
But in any case, whatever we
do when we talk about the rate,

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.650
it will involve the
matrix elements squared.

01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:04.080
So now we can ask
what happens when

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:10.060
we couple ground
and excited states.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:16.190
And let's assume we
have an excited state.

01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:20.280
And we sum over all possible
photon occupation numbers

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.502
of the ground state.

01:06:21.502 --> 01:06:23.710
Well, when we go from the
excited state to the ground

01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:29.300
state, there will be only one
term contributing to the sum.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:33.560
Where we have one photon more
because it has been emitted.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:37.330
So, therefore, because of
the square root n and n

01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:39.710
plus 1 dependence of
the matrix element,

01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:44.845
we find that for the processes
where photon is emitted, where

01:06:44.845 --> 01:06:47.700
the atomic system
gives away a photon,

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:51.930
the sum of all the possible
rates becomes simply n plus 1.

01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:54.161
And in the case of
absorption it becomes n.

01:06:57.110 --> 01:07:02.380
So in other words, we have now
done the field quantization

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:05.740
what Einstein pulled out of
a thermodynamic equilibrium

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:06.620
argument.

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:12.020
Namely that if you have a
system that the rate of emission

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:18.150
versus the rate of absorption
is n plus 1 over n.

01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:21.630
But we did not assume any
spectral distribution.

01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:23.590
We know this n plus
1 over n applies

01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:27.876
to every single mode of
t electromagnetic field.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:41.512
Questions about that?

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:05.360
I also want to tell you, just as
a side remark, a lot of people

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.320
think that when
emission is n plus 1,

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.150
the plus 1 is different from n.

01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:16.620
That this plus 1 is sort of a
spontaneously emitted photon

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.870
which has maybe
some random phase.

01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:22.170
And the n which is
stimulated photons,

01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:26.319
they go in the same
mode as they joined

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:29.880
sort of the identical to
the photons already present.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.225
I don't see any of
that in that treatment.

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:39.630
So a spontaneously
emitted photon

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:42.170
is identical to the
photon which would

01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:43.510
be emitted in a stimulated way.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.649
You just have n plus 1.

01:08:48.649 --> 01:08:51.370
This is the matrix element
for coupling to this mode.

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.990
At some point,
spontaneous emission

01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:01.979
can happen in many modes.

01:09:01.979 --> 01:09:04.410
And if it goes to
many modes, then there

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:08.859
is some integral or
some summation involved.

01:09:08.859 --> 01:09:11.479
And this can cause a
certain randomness.

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:14.060
But at the level
of a single mode,

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.689
I do not see any difference
between the one photon

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:21.790
and the n photons at
this level of discussion.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:25.040
Just keep that in mind.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.560
And actually, we'll
discuss micromasers.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.670
You can have put an
excited atom in the cavity.

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:32.750
And you have a fully
reversible exchange.

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.510
You spontaneously
emit, you absorb.

01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:36.319
You spontaneously
emit, you absorb.

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:39.649
You have Rabi oscillations
which involve a single photon.

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:43.180
And they involve
spontaneous emission.

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.380
Fully reversible.

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.184
Completely
[INAUDIBLE] evolution.

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:51.753
So we have 10 minutes left.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.780
Yes, I think this is just
enough to derive for you.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:13.250
Now to derive for you using
the fully quantized picture.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.940
To derive flow from
first principles

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:21.060
microscopically an expression
for Einstein's a coefficient.

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:28.930
So in other words,
what I'm doing now

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:31.630
is I really directly
calculate for you

01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:33.017
the rate of
spontaneous emission.

01:10:33.017 --> 01:10:34.850
And I'm not getting it
through the back door

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:38.580
by treating absorption
and then saying, well,

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.990
there's n and n plus 1.

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:43.302
Or borrowing some
argument from Einstein.

01:10:43.302 --> 01:10:44.760
It's such an
important quantity, we

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.750
should just hit the
system with a Hamiltonian

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.710
and out comes a
spontaneous emission rate.

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:50.927
And this is what we're doing.

01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:12.260
So the starting point is
what we have discussed

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.750
at the beginning of the class.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:22.470
We want to discuss
Fermi's Golden Rule.

01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:25.520
We want to use the rate.

01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:33.090
And to remind you
the rate for process

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:38.170
is the matrix element
squared by h plus square.

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:43.505
And then we have to multiply
with the density of states.

01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:59.511
So this is the
density of states.

01:11:59.511 --> 01:12:00.260
Pair polarization.

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:05.240
Actually, I made a few
corrections to my notes

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.770
because I realize I
have be very, very

01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:10.740
careful in telling you
what the states are.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.850
Because this is what
this exercise is about.

01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:17.330
And we are writing it
down for one mode by mode.

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:20.490
So the density of state
is now pair polarization.

01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:23.960
We take care of
polarizations later.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.410
Per unit frequency interval.

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:41.815
Yes.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.940
So this rate, but now I
have to add one caveat.

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:03.040
I was just thinking how
I should express it.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:06.350
This rate, if it's all
of spontaneous emission,

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:08.740
is the Einstein a coefficient.

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:10.300
But there is one caveat.

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.990
And this is the emission
of an atom which

01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:15.275
has a dipole moment
is not isotropic.

01:13:15.275 --> 01:13:16.650
So I have to be
a little bit more

01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:18.130
careful with the solid angle.

01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:20.640
I cannot just calculate a
rate and assume everything is

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.460
isotopic.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.400
If I would do that, I
would save a few minutes.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.760
But I would have really swept
something under the rug.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:33.280
So what I'm calculating first is
the rate in a given unit angle.

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.630
And then I do an integration
over the unit angle.

01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:40.720
And eventually I will integrate
over the dipole [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:47.510
So, therefore, the density
of the photon states

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:51.190
is sort of photons with their
k vectors go into all space,

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:56.210
but I wanted to have the density
of states per unit angle.

01:13:56.210 --> 01:14:08.430
And this quantity is omega
square, 8 pi cube, c cube,

01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:13.910
times v. And, of course, if
you multiply this by 4 pi,

01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:15.790
you get your normal
density of states.

01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:19.500
Because the density of
states is isotropic.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.630
But the rate which
we calculate will not

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:23.775
be isotopic because of
the dipole matrix element.

01:14:23.775 --> 01:14:25.540
And the dipole pattern.

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:29.030
So, therefore, we start with
a differential formulation.

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:31.150
Spontaneous emission
per solid angle.

01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:34.650
And then when we do, when we
integrate over the solid angle,

01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:37.050
we have to take care of a
sine square factor because

01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:40.480
of the dipole pattern.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.320
Good.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:48.015
Now Fermi's Golden Rule takes
us from an excited state

01:14:48.015 --> 01:14:50.340
to ground state.

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:55.030
And since we use the
fully quantized treatment,

01:14:55.030 --> 01:15:02.280
our product states of atomic
states and photon states.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:07.760
And so we assume we start with
an atom in the excited states.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:13.150
And all modes, mode 1,
mode 2, mode 3, are empty.

01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:22.920
And the final state, well,
one photon is emitted

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.037
and it can appear
in any of the modes.

01:15:25.037 --> 01:15:27.161
And we have to do an integral
of all possibilities.

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:33.960
Good.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.400
So we did all the
work with quantizing

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.810
the electromagnetic field.

01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:44.530
Because we want to calculate
those matrix elements.

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:47.340
Let me just carry over the
prefactors, the electric field

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.175
of a single photon.

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:57.360
Here we have the dipole moment
between the polarization

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.480
and the atomic dipole
matrix element.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.170
And now since we are talking
about an emission problem,

01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:10.470
we have from the matrix
elements squared as we just

01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:13.070
discussed, an n plus 1 factor.

01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:16.420
But the population we
start with 0 photons.

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.420
So, therefore, it's just one.

01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.300
So all the work we
did on quantization

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.610
of the electromagnetic
field is that even

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:27.660
without any photon present,
we have a coupling.

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:31.570
You can say it's a coupling
caused by the vacuum which

01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:34.310
is like the coupling
we would have gotten

01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:36.386
if we have exactly
one photon per mode.

01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:50.450
So let me just write that out.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:15.557
Yes.

01:17:15.557 --> 01:17:17.980
I think we can finish that.

01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:26.150
OK, we have now taken care
of the matrix element.

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:30.260
So we insert the matrix element
now in our Fermi's Golden Rule

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.035
expression for the ad omega.

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:40.750
Let me just keep track
of all the factors.

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:42.695
[INAUDIBLE] omega in
the matrix element.

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:50.160
This comes from the electric
field of a single photon.

01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:00.700
We have a matrix element.

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:04.592
Dipole matrix element
times polarization.

01:18:04.592 --> 01:18:10.470
And the density of states
gives us omega square.

01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:13.930
So see already we'll get a
spontaneous emission omega cube

01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:15.110
expression.

01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:19.270
One omega comes because
the electric field

01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:22.140
of a single photon, the
electric field squared

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:24.450
of a single photon is
proportional to omega.

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:27.970
And an omega square factor comes
from the density of states.

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:31.220
It's really important
to keep that apart.

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.370
The omega 3 dependence
has two different sources.

01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:50.180
It's always nice to see that we
assumed an [INAUDIBLE] volume

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:51.150
and it cancels out.

01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:55.970
OK.

01:18:55.970 --> 01:19:12.060
Let me just write it down and
then we do the final step.

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:14.350
So if everything
were isotropic, I

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:15.940
could just multiply with 4 pi.

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.830
And the last factor
would be dropped.

01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:22.940
But if you want to go from
the spontaneous emission

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:27.260
per solid angle to the
total spontaneous emission,

01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:29.010
we have to average it.

01:19:29.010 --> 01:19:32.380
And what has angular
factors is actually

01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:35.460
the projection between
the atomic dipole

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.290
moment and the polarization.

01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:48.750
So this is the relevant term.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:52.830
And now we have to distinguish.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:56.210
There are two polarizations.

01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:59.182
One polarization,
the polarization

01:19:59.182 --> 01:20:00.390
when we have a dipole moment.

01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:03.700
And you have light which
is polarized in such a way

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.810
that the light goes here.

01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:08.620
This is a dipole moment,
the light goes here.

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:10.640
And now the light
which propagates here

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.590
can have a
polarization like this.

01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:19.470
Which has a projection of sine
theta, with the dipole moment.

01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:22.520
And if the light goes there and
the polarization is like this,

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.610
it's orthogonal to
the dipole moment.

01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:27.860
So the scalar product is 0.

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:33.770
So for one polarization, we
have a sine theta factor.

01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:39.610
For the second polarization,
the scalar product

01:20:39.610 --> 01:20:43.010
for the dipole moment is 0.

01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:49.535
So, therefore, and that's
the last conclusion

01:20:49.535 --> 01:20:50.410
I want to draw today.

01:20:55.990 --> 01:21:06.890
Is this integration
over the solid angle

01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:12.340
boils down to that we can
pull the matrix element out

01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:14.760
of the integral.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.980
And what is left is
the projection factor,

01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:19.960
sine square theta.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:24.020
We have to integrate over
the whole solid angle.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:26.517
And this gives us 2/3.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.370
So, therefore, our
final result is

01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:41.586
that the microscopic expression
for the a coefficient

01:21:41.586 --> 01:21:43.210
has its factor of 3
in the denominator.

01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:45.700
And this factor of 3
only comes because I

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:49.440
correct the average
over the dipole pattern.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:53.440
Well, then we have
4 pi epsilon 0.

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.430
I mentioned the
important dependence

01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:57.708
on the frequency cubed.

01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:06.810
OK, so this is our
final result for today.

01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:12.430
And I will discuss next
week what are its units?

01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:14.110
How big is it?

01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:17.060
What is the quality factor
of the atomic oscillator?

01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:20.970
But we can start next
week with this result.

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:22.820
All right.
