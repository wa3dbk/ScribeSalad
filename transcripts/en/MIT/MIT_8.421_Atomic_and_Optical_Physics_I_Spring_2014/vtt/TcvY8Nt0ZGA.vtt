00:00:20.632 --> 00:00:22.090
PROFESSOR: We want
to start talking

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.960
about a seemingly
simple but very complex

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.620
system in physics, the
harmonic oscillator.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.400
So the next part is actually
due to Professor Vladan Vuletic,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.320
who worked out the
topic very nicely about,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.100
how precisely can you
measure frequencies?

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.860
And I don't need to
remind you that some

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.580
of the most accurate
measurements in all of physics

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.660
are done by measuring frequency.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.420
It's actually a kind
of unwritten rule.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.370
If you want to measure
something precisely,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.360
make sure that you find a
way that this quantity can

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.620
be measured in a
frequency measurement.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.270
Because frequencies,
that's what we

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.660
can measure-- with synthesizers,
with clocks, and such.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.990
So therefore, the question,
how precisely can you

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.270
measure frequency, is a
question which is actually

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.065
relevant for all
precision measurements.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.860
Well, we know we
have Fourier theorem.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:38.600
If you have an oscillator which
oscillates for a time delta t,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.370
we have the Fourier
theorem which

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:50.450
says we have a finite width of
the frequency spectrum delta

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:00.150
omega, or there is the spread
of frequency components involved

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.750
in such a way that delta
omega times delta t

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.660
is large or equal than 1/2.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.370
The case of 1/2 is realized
for Gaussian wave packets.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:24.580
And of course, Fourier theorem
should also-- this Fourier

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.035
limit should remind you of
Heisenberg's uncertainty

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:30.535
relation.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.375
Of course, Fourier limit and
Heisenberg uncertainty relation

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:43.550
are related because what
Heisenberg expressed

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.252
turns out to be simply
the limit due to the wave

00:02:46.252 --> 00:02:46.960
nature of matter.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.290
OK.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.640
So I brought the
clicker because I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.720
want you to think about some
seemingly simple question.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:12.650
The first question is whether
the uncertainty delta omega

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.630
times delta t larger than
1/2, does this uncertainty

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.790
hold for purely
classical systems?

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.464
So think about it and
answer in your clicker.

00:03:33.464 --> 00:03:36.760
A is 1 and B-- oh,
I should say that.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.190
So we now assume we have a
purely classical-- you can even

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.120
think a mechanical,
large mechanical object,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.630
purely classical
harmonic oscillator.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.350
You can observe it
for time delta t,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.590
or it oscillates
for time delta t.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.540
Can you determine its
frequency better then

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.650
this uncertainty suggests?

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.050
19, 20.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.990
Just make up your mind.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.959
As I said, your
responses are not

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.130
recorded, so nothing to risk.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.630
OK.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.610
Yes.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.820
OK, the majority gave
the right answer.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.790
The situation is that
the answer is yes,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.790
if you have a good
signal to noise ratio.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:12.940
So what happens is, if you--
we have to bring in the fact

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.600
that we have noise.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.780
So if you have a wave formed,
there may be noise around it.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:33.680
And if you look at the spectrum,
the spectral components

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.520
have a certain width.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.980
And this width, delta omega,
is given by Fourier's theorem

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.490
by the time delta t you
had for observation.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:51.230
But as you see, you can
determine the center

00:05:51.230 --> 00:06:01.250
of this spectral peak with an
accuracy delta omega, which

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.210
may be much better than the
[? width ?] delta omega.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.190
And the rule of
thumb is that you

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.630
can split a line by your
signal to noise ratio.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.600
So typically, the
accuracy of a measurement

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.640
is whatever the width
of the spectrum is,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.740
and then you can split the line
by the signal to noise ratio.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.635
This is called
splitting the line.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.486
Factor of hundred is usually
regarded as straightforward.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.060
But if you want to go
to larger than that,

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.300
it becomes a challenge.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.440
Because even if you have a very
good signal to noise ratio,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.550
you really have to make sure
that you know the line shape,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.000
that you know that it is,
for instance, symmetric,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.150
and that the line center
of the observed shape

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.640
is really where
the frequency is.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.080
I will give you some
examples in a few moments.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.720
But before that, I would like
to continue our discussion

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.700
whether we can measure
the angle of frequency

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.970
to better than the
Heisenberg limit

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.340
in case of a
quantum-mechanical oscillator.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:49.830
So the question is, can
you measure the frequency

00:07:49.830 --> 00:08:01.340
of a quantum-mechanical harmonic
oscillator in a time delta t

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:11.695
to an accuracy which is better
than the limit of Heisenberg's

00:08:11.695 --> 00:08:12.195
uncertainty?

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.570
OK, your vote, please.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.850
All right.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.220
OK.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.010
Why don't we hold
that for a second

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:06.150
and proceed to the next
question which is the same?

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.650
But now, instead of a
quantum-mechanical harmonic

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.710
oscillator, we take
something we are

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.300
very familiar with--
an optical laser--

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:24.190
and we observe a laser pulse
lasting a duration delta t.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.500
So same situation, but
instead of observing

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.260
a quantum-mechanical
harmonic oscillator,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.890
we observe a laser pulse.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.160
For the laser, can we
measure the frequency

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.950
of the optical radiation better
than this equality tells us?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.620
OK.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.780
At least people are consistent
because the first thing

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.210
I wanted to tell you is
that, is the laser actually

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.700
a classical harmonic oscillator
or quantum harmonic oscillator?

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.990
Well, we use a
quantum description

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.120
of light and the laser is
the population of photons

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.070
in the single note of the
electromagnetic field.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.340
So in that sense, the
laser is fully quantum.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.430
But in the limit that
the laser is many,

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.300
many photons-- and some of you
know about coherence states.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.890
If there's a coherent state
with a large photon number,

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.910
the laser is actually
the classical limit

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.280
of an electromagnetic field.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.300
So maybe that tells
me that the answers

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.590
to questions 2 and question 3
should probably be the same.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.620
And I want to say more about it.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.680
So at least in this class,
you were consistent.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.390
I have often seen
a big discrepancy

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.550
in the answers between
question 2 and question 3.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:09.830
OK, so the answer is yes.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.510
So both for the laser-- I
first explain the laser to you,

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.027
and then we go back to the
pure quantum system, thing

00:11:17.027 --> 00:11:18.360
has actually certain subtleties.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:25.130
But for the laser,
it is obvious,

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.180
at least if I tell you
how I want to measure it,

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.440
because I can take the
laser and create a beat

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:44.210
note with another
very stable laser.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.460
And I record this beat
note on a photodiode.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.145
I can realize by making
this other laser,

00:11:54.145 --> 00:11:57.340
the local oscillator
stronger and stronger,

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.390
I can create a
beat note which is

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.860
larger and larger
and corresponds

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.400
to a macroscopic
electric current which

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.280
can be measured with
very high precision.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.600
So you can realize an
arbitrarily high signal

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:22.000
to noise ratio by using a
strong local oscillator.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.580
And then you can actually
say the photocurrent, which

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.020
comes out of the
photodiode, is actually--

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.440
you can regard this microscopic
current as purely classical.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.440
And then of course, the answer
to the first question applies.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.740
So that takes care of question
3 by mapping it actually

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.540
on question 2.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.920
But now by saying
that the laser also

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.420
has a quantum-mechanical limit
and I'm not changing anything,

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.390
we realize that probably
the answer to question 2

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.750
should also be yes.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:08.160
So let's, therefore,
ask our self, what

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.530
is the situation when the
Heisenberg uncertainty

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.325
relation applies?

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:32.440
Well, one is we have
to be really careful.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.070
It predicts the outcome
of a single measurement

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.806
on a single quantum system.

00:13:39.806 --> 00:13:41.290
Let me write that down.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.230
Or if the Heisenberg
uncertainty relation

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.670
sets a limit, how well we
prepare a quantum system.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.132
It's about a single
quantum system,

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:54.840
and then we perform
a single measurement.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:23.680
So in a sense, if
we would say all

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.690
you have is a single photon,
which is a very special quantum

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.480
system.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.740
You have a single
photon and you measure

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.010
the frequency of the
photon only once.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.520
Then your will find the limit,
which is the Heisenberg limit.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.040
You cannot, with a single
measurement on a single photon,

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:57.540
determine the accuracy of the
frequency better than this.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.890
And of course, you can
get higher accuracy

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:12.400
by doing repeated measurements
or by using many photons.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:27.630
We talk about it more in 8.422,
but I just want to remind you,

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:32.500
if you have n
uncorrelated photons.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.810
In other words, we
perform n measurements

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:45.530
on n different objects, then
the signal to noise ratio

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:51.510
is-- just by Poisson
distribution, square root n.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.790
And therefore, the
resolution for the frequency

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:59.970
of the photons is better than
the Heisenberg or the Fourier

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.300
limit by 1 over
the square root n.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.520
Some of you-- and actually,
in Professor Vuletic's group,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.810
there is research on it that
if you have correlated-- well,

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.500
in his case, correlated atoms.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.090
But if you had
correlated photons,

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.090
then you can even do better.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:29.340
You can reach what is sometimes
called the Heisenberg limit

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.260
where you are better
than the limitation

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.950
given by Fourier's theorem or
by the Heisenberg uncertainty

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.390
relation by a factor of 1/n.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:14.369
OK.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:23.200
So as far as the question 2
where the quantum harmonic

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:33.540
oscillator is
concerned, we would

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:46.860
say the answer is
yes, if you have

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:57.785
is single photon at
frequency omega 0,

00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:08.360
which interacts with the
quantum harmonic oscillator

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.650
at frequency omega 0.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:16.710
However, the answer
would, even in that case,

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:23.270
be no if you have
harmonic oscillator levels

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:29.740
and you take a photon and
by a nonlinear process

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.250
excite the n-th level.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.995
So you have a single photon now.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:44.850
You can resolve the energy
delta E of this level.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.960
A single photon,
a single quantum

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:55.382
object, you can
define the energy--

00:18:55.382 --> 00:18:57.090
that's Heisenberg's
uncertainty relation.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:01.160
The energy is determined
to that precision.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:17.810
But your frequency omega
of the optical pulse

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:22.230
is n times omega 0
using nonlinear process.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:26.170
And then you can determine
the frequency of the harmonic

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.770
oscillator, even
for a single quantum

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:38.450
system and a single
photon with a precision

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.510
which is 1/n times better.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.470
So you have to be
also careful, but I

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.120
don't want to beat
it to death now,

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.010
to distinguish between the
accuracy at which Heisenberg's

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.520
uncertainty relation
maybe limits

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.530
the measurement of
an energy level.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.340
And how this is related
to the frequency

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.800
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.100
And by going sort of
immediately to the n-th level,

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.721
you can, of course, measure
the distance between two levels

00:20:04.721 --> 00:20:07.220
more accurately because you
have increased your [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.826
Any questions?

00:20:15.826 --> 00:20:17.700
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I just
got a little confused

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.630
about when yes means one
thing and no means one thing.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.642
So you're saying that you can
beat the uncertainty relation

00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:31.362
in questions 1, 2, and 3
if you can put it in a way

00:20:31.362 --> 00:20:34.210
where you get good
signal to noise?

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.240
PROFESSOR: OK, I gave you--
sorry for being complicated,

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.760
but the physics is complicated.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.260
I try to give it to you
in different layers.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.843
I first looked at
the classical limit,

00:20:41.843 --> 00:20:43.190
which is pretty clear-cut.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.820
Then, I used a laser.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.500
The laser has a
classical limit where

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.700
the answer is the same as
in the classical limit.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.610
But then we can talk
also in the laser

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.680
in the limit of single photons.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.490
And then I said, OK, the
single photon interacting

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.460
with a single
quantum system, this

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.200
is really when it is quantum.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.900
And if you have a two-level
system and you [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.040
it with a single
photon, then you

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.690
can make a measurement which
is limited by this inequality.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.870
But then I said
there is a caveat.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:24.000
And this is if you bring
in a nonlinear process.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.630
So if your bring in a nonlinear
process, we can go up n steps.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.366
We can drive-- we can,
by some nonlinearity,

00:21:38.366 --> 00:21:40.490
drive the harmonic oscillator
from the ground state

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.900
to the n state.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.600
Then, everything we have
said about a single photon

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.740
and the measurement of
the resonance and such

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.860
applies to this photon.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.650
But the energy level of
the harmonic oscillator

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.880
has now been measured with
n times higher precision

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.340
because we can divide by n.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:02.290
So the answer is yes, yes, then
quantum mechanics we cannot

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.500
make it more accurate
unless we pull some tricks.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.000
And nonlinear physics
would be a trick.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.860
So in general, the
situation where you really

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.470
limit it by this inequality
where your precision is limited

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:20.040
would really only apply to a
single photon, a single quantum

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.750
physics, and linear physics.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.450
Other questions?

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.422
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:25.422 --> 00:22:27.366
Maybe just the phrasing.

00:22:27.366 --> 00:22:31.254
AUDIENCE: What does delta
t mean for a single photon

00:22:31.254 --> 00:22:32.240
measurement?

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.980
PROFESSOR: Delta t
could be the time

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.790
you allow yourself to
make the measurement.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.110
You have a
measurement apparatus.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.020
You switch it on,
you switch it off.

00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:47.220
Eventually, you want to
get out of grad school.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.270
I mean, you don't want to take
an infinite amount of time

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.145
for the measurements.

00:22:50.145 --> 00:22:51.800
There's always a
window, delta t,

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.490
and there's a fundamental limit.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.859
The duration of the measurement
limits the precision

00:22:55.859 --> 00:22:56.650
of the measurement.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:03.410
OK.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:17.900
The next thing I want to
discuss is the analogy, but also

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.610
the differences between
a harmonic oscillator

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.130
and a two-level system.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.790
So what is a two-level system?

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.980
Well, it's a system
with two levels.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.760
What is a harmonic oscillator?

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.650
Well, it's a system which
has an infinite number

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.180
of equidistant levels.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.480
I will tell you tell you
later in this course when

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.330
we talk about the AC
and DC stark effect,

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.630
you talk about the
polarizability and light

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.650
scattering that you can regard
the atom or the electron

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.370
in the atom as a
harmonic oscillator.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:14.460
An atom scatters light
exactly in the same way

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:19.200
as the charge which is connected
to some support structure

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.200
with a spring.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.690
How an oscillating charge
would scatter light?

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.940
Well, you know of course, the
atom is a two-level system.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.890
And the sort of model I make
for the electron as a harmonic

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.300
oscillator at a single
resonance frequency, which

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:42.380
is 100% exact in the limit
of [? low ?] laser power.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.210
Well, this realize is
a harmonic oscillator.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.370
So therefore, what I'm
telling you by this example,

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.860
that there are situations
where a two-level system

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:58.300
and a harmonic
oscillator are the same.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.970
Or, create the same
[? observance, ?]

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.990
create the same physics.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:09.500
Do you have any idea when the
two systems may look the same

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.140
or when the two systems
react exactly in the same way

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.985
to, for instance,
external radiation?

00:25:21.375 --> 00:25:22.850
AUDIENCE: At very
low temperatures?

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.340
PROFESSOR: At very
low temperature?

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.526
Well--

00:25:25.526 --> 00:25:26.924
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:26.924 --> 00:25:27.860
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.977
Well, we assume these
are atoms and we always

00:25:29.977 --> 00:25:31.060
start in the common state.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.480
So let's assume we
have 0 temperature.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.510
We have an atom.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.940
And maybe what I'm asking is,
if I excite the atom and I said,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.240
there may be a situation where
the atom is a two-level system

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.780
but it reacts like a
harmonic oscillator,

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.269
when does it break down?

00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:50.560
AUDIENCE: When the [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:54.544 --> 00:25:55.335
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.050
When we go beyond
the perturbative

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.550
limit when we use a
strong excitation.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.460
So in other words-- and I
like to give you the answer

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.260
before I give you the full
explanation, which now comes.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.790
If you start out in
the ground state,

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.580
you can see at 0 temperature, we
have mainly all the population

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.080
there.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.580
If you start now
driving the system,

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.720
we put-- and I will say a
little bit more about it.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.200
A little bit into
the excited state.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.380
But it is the nature of a
harmonic oscillator when

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.960
you put something
into the excited state

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.280
that immediately a little bit
goes into the second excited

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.540
state.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.100
And this is, of course,
something which you can only do

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.080
in a harmonic oscillator but
you cannot do in a level system.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.410
So to the extent that
we have weak excitation

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:55.600
and we can neglect the
excitation in higher levels.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.475
To that extent, a two-level
system and harmonic oscillator

00:26:58.475 --> 00:27:00.870
are identical.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.910
Actually, what I'm
saying appears trivial,

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.210
but I really want you
to think about it.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.090
It's actually a very
profound statement.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.730
When can you describe a
quantum-mechanical system

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.090
as a harmonic oscillator?

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.290
For weak excitation
when all what matters

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:19.250
is that you have put a
small fraction of the system

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.150
into the first excited state.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:27.010
And you immediately realize that
the feature which distinguishes

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:30.360
a two-level system from
a harmonic oscillator

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.860
is the phenomenon of,
let's say, saturation.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.000
You cannot go higher.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.600
If you do not saturate
a two-level system,

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.380
it behaves like a
harmonic oscillator.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.710
And therefore, it behaves
completely classical.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.790
OK, let's work that
out a little bit.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.660
I'll give you some examples.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:59.380
So the phenomenon of a two-level
system is it has saturation.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.115
The maximum energy you
can put in is one quantum.

00:28:02.115 --> 00:28:06.780
Whereas, a harmonic oscillator
can never be saturated.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.850
Just think of the harmonic
oscillator potential parabola.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.920
You can drive the system
as high as you want.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.460
So you can go in this
classical language

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.380
to arbitrarily large amplitudes.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.450
So what I just mentioned
where the equivalence holds--

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.770
I always want you to
have an example in mind--

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:52.090
is the Lorentz model for an
atom where you describe the atom

00:28:52.090 --> 00:29:03.940
as an electron connected
with a spring to the nucleus.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.160
And as we will see
in a few weeks,

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.990
this model gives the
identical answer,

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:14.910
identical to the
quantum-mechanical treatment

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:22.940
for probabilities like
the polarizability

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:28.120
and the index of refraction
for gas of atoms or molecules.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.450
So if you have a
two-level system,

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.370
we can often think we have
an s, ground state, and then

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.620
p, excited state.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.890
And if you do a
weak excitation, we

00:29:55.890 --> 00:30:01.480
have sort of a wave
function, which is all,

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.050
lets say, positive
one side-- one sign.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:21.820
And then we [INAUDIBLE]
a p orbital,

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.650
which has a note which
is positive and negative.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.890
And now we have the
positive-negative

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:32.100
and the positive and the--
there is the resonance

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.740
frequency between the two.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.240
And that together results
in an oscillating dipole.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.880
So the simple model
of superimposing

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.980
an s state and a p state
at a certain frequency

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.810
gives us an oscillating
dipole, which

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:56.990
is the realization of
a harmonic oscillator.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:01.010
But the harmonic
oscillator, it oscillates.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:06.195
And this is, of course,
valid for sufficiently small

00:31:06.195 --> 00:31:06.695
excitation.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:12.700
So the question we
have already addressed

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.415
in the discussion,
what is small?

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:38.670
So "small" means population
of higher-excited states

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:39.260
is negligible.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:47.750
So in other words, as long as
the excitation of the first

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:57.890
excited state is small, then
we can neglect the excitation

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:01.440
in the second excited state,
which is even smaller.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.580
So let me kind of bring
out the difference

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.475
between a two-level system
and a harmonic oscillator

00:32:26.475 --> 00:32:33.099
a little bit more by discussing
the situational of cavity QED.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:33:05.190
Let's assume we want 100%
population in the first excited

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:06.826
state.

00:33:06.826 --> 00:33:08.200
If you have a
harmonic oscillator

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.660
and the system is prepared
in the first excited state,

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:18.330
this is also called Fock state
with one quantum of excitation.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:22.670
And it's a rather special state
where people have worked hard

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:28.770
to generate it because you
cannot realize it in a harmonic

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.000
oscillator.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.390
And let me sort of explain
that in the following way.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.450
If you have a
harmonic oscillator,

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.420
you start and you
would drive it.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:49.660
And you try to put 100%
in the n equals 1 state.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:54.210
Before you have accumulated
100% in the n equals 1 state,

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.660
you drive it already
to higher states.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.210
And of course, you
know when you start

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:02.630
driving a harmonic
oscillator, classical

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:06.060
or quantum-mechanically, you
create a coherent state, which

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.469
is a superposition
of excited states.

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:15.049
So we would say an n equals
1 state cannot be excited.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:27.630
We usually get a
coherent state, which

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:36.880
is a superposition of many,
or at least several, states.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:52.469
Whereas in a
two-level system, we

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.699
can just do a [INAUDIBLE] pulse.

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.600
And to put all the atoms
in the excited state

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.005
is nothing special.

00:34:59.005 --> 00:35:03.270
Whereas, to have a cavity
filled with photons

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:06.520
and selectively excite
the n equals 1 state,

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.630
this is special
because it's not easy.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.650
It's not straightforward.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:25.816
So in cavity QED,
you can do it if you

00:35:25.816 --> 00:35:27.440
have anharmonicities
or nonlinearities.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.450
So let me explain that.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:49.910
Well, it's an anharmonicity
or some form of-- so

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:54.270
if you have a
situation where you

00:35:54.270 --> 00:36:00.650
have your harmonic oscillator,
but the energy levels

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:03.790
are not equidistance.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:09.370
So the difference between this
first and second excited state

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:15.500
are not the same, then
you can drive the system.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.670
You can prepare Fock
state in n equals

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.390
1 like in a two-level system.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:26.090
And you're out of resonance
to drive it to higher states.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:31.885
So here, what you utilize is
a sort of two-level system.

00:36:31.885 --> 00:36:36.080
And that allows you to create
those special state which

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.660
are regarded as
non-classical, very

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.840
special states of the
harmonic oscillator.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.400
And one way how you
can create it-- well,

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.870
if you have an empty
cavity, each photon

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.340
has the same energy.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.190
Then you have an equidistant
harmonic oscillator.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:37:11.290
But if you put, for instance--
you add an atom to the cavity,

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.600
and the radiation is
interacting with the atom,

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.580
then you'll get-- we'll
talk about it later.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.770
The atom and the photons
interact with the Rabi

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:23.410
frequency, and then
you get a splitting,

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.850
called the normal
mode splitting.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.670
And this level splitting
is proportional to the Rabi

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.800
frequency.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.800
And we'll discuss it
later, but many of you

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.410
know that the Rabi
frequency scales

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.840
with the square root
of the photon number.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.130
So therefore, you
have a splitting

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.060
which is proportional to
square root 1, square root

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.380
2, square root 3.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.040
And you have a spectrum
which is no longer

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.700
an equidistant system.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.860
And then you can create
non-classical states

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.420
of the photon field,
non-classical states

00:37:58.420 --> 00:37:59.668
of a harmonic oscillator.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.760
So anyway, I thought I
wanted to bring it up

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.663
at the beginning of the
class, because a lot what

00:38:09.663 --> 00:38:12.130
we are discussing
in this class is

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.760
we'll rediscover in
many situations--

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.760
in atoms, in the
light, in the way how

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.070
light and atoms interact,
harmonic oscillators

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.930
and two-level systems.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.170
Often, I say they are the same.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:25.830
They behave in the same way.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:29.627
But I hope this introductory
[? mark ?] tells you, when can

00:38:29.627 --> 00:38:31.210
you think in one
limit and when do you

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:32.518
have to apply the other limit?

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:45.660
Any questions about that?

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.052
Yes, Nancy.

00:38:47.052 --> 00:38:50.496
AUDIENCE: So are we saying
here that without changing

00:38:50.496 --> 00:38:52.956
the [INAUDIBLE] of the
harmonic oscillator,

00:38:52.956 --> 00:38:55.908
we cannot use it as a
harmonic oscillator?

00:38:55.908 --> 00:38:58.977
Like [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:58.977 --> 00:39:01.351
Because when you put an atom
in that [INAUDIBLE] changed,

00:39:01.351 --> 00:39:04.280
it was no more a
harmonic oscillator.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.624
The levels changed.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.620
PROFESSOR: Maybe
all I'm saying is

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.820
this is a pure
harmonic oscillator.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:19.550
And in a pure
harmonic oscillator,

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.130
I think it's-- I don't
know a proof of it,

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.930
but it seems impossible to
prepare a system in the first

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:30.170
excited state because every
attempt to put an excitation

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.659
into the system would
carry it higher up.

00:39:33.659 --> 00:39:34.950
You would create a wave packet.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:36.792
You would create
a superposition.

00:39:36.792 --> 00:39:38.000
So you have to do some thing.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.540
You have to break the
degeneracy of the spectrum

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.310
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.990
Of course, what you can do
is you can put in an atom.

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:49.350
You can use the atom as an
aid to just put in exactly one

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:52.750
photon into your cavity, and
then you can remove the atom.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.750
Then you are back to an
ideal harmonic oscillator,

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:58.730
but you have overcome
the limitation

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.020
of the harmonic oscillator
in preparing certain states.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:13.980
Another take-home message you
may take from this discussion

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.650
is harmonic
oscillators-- yes, we

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:18.200
have quantum
harmonic oscillators.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.540
But even the quantum
harmonic oscillator

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.160
follows a classical description.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.150
So the real quantumness-- what
makes quantum optics quantum

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:33.330
optics and cavity QED a
wonderful example of quantum

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:38.120
physics is the physics
embedded in a two-level system.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.650
That we can put one quantum
excitation into something,

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:45.650
exactly one is as much
quantum as you can get.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:49.050
This is realized in
a two-level system

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.220
and this is related to the
phenomenon of saturation.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.120
You can saturate a
two-level system,

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:59.010
but you cannot saturate
a harmonic oscillator.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:02.440
So with that, let me
make the transition

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:08.020
to another simple system.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.585
And we want to spend
some time on it.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:16.150
And these are rotating systems.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.300
So a system which rotates.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.741
Well, what do you think?

00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:33.330
Will it behave, using
the discussion we just

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:35.940
had, more like a
classical system

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.870
or more like a
quantum-mechanical system?

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.170
Of course, I gave you a
very special definition.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:59.340
What brings out quantum
mechanics in a system?

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:07.240
The harmonic oscillator
is always linear.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.920
You can drive it as
hard as you want.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.520
You drive it hundred
times stronger

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.940
and the reaction is
hundred times more.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.230
Everything is linear.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.935
The quantumness of a two-level
system comes from saturation.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:24.405
What about a rotating system?

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.645
Something which
can go in a circle.

00:42:35.936 --> 00:42:36.852
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:41.772 --> 00:42:44.724
So you're not going to have
this degeneracy [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:48.629 --> 00:42:49.670
PROFESSOR: OK, very good.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.920
You're immediately applying
what is the spectrum.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.057
The spectrum is not
equidistant, so it

00:42:56.057 --> 00:42:57.265
should bring in a difference.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.700
It's sometimes hard to
ask a simple question

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.700
without giving the answer away.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.180
But what I had in
mind was a gyroscope,

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:11.350
a gyroscope which is precessing.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.550
And what I wanted
to sort of lead you

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.900
with the question is, if you
have something which rotates,

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.230
the amplitude is limited.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.530
A rotating object, let's assume
a magnetic, classical magnetic

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:25.380
moment.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:29.940
It can have a precession
angle which is 180 degrees,

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.550
but that's a maximum.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.770
In other words, the rotating
system when you excite it

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:40.070
has a maximum amplitude,
exactly as a two-level system.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:46.930
So that's what a rotating
system and a two-level system--

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:48.780
actually then, I'm
now specializing

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.380
on more rotating gyroscope.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:55.430
If you have a free
rotator, this, of course,

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.110
can rotate with [INAUDIBLE]
angular momentum

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:01.380
and the excitation spectrum
would not be bound.

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.850
So I think I have to rephrase
the question the next time

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:05.970
I teach the class.

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.540
I wanted to ask you here about
a special rotating system, which

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.330
is a precessing gyroscope.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.310
So rotating system.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:25.430
If you think about
precessing gyroscope,

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:32.460
it has a bound on the
amplitude it can be excited.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:42.640
So what I want to show you,
today and in the next lecture,

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:49.895
is the motion of classical
magnetic moments.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.300
When you think about the motion
of classical magnetic moments,

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.900
think about a compass
needle, a magnetized needle

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.025
which has angular momentum.

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.780
And then, the system is acted
upon with a magnetic field.

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.820
So this is our system.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.090
And if angular momentum,
magnetic moments, and torque

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:24.590
come into play, we have the
physics of classical rotation.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:29.070
But the excitation
spectrum here is limited

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.390
because you can flip
a compass needle

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.010
and this is a
maximum excitation.

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:35.710
When the North Pole points in
the opposite direction, that's

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.190
the maximum excitation
you can give it.

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:42.210
So therefore, it has a limited
amplitude of its excitation,

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.090
unlike a harmonic oscillator.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:50.180
And at this point you may
say, but maybe somewhat

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.825
similar or analogous
to a two-level system.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:01.190
But the surprising
result is-- at least

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:04.090
it was surprising when I
first learned about it.

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.450
That it's not just
somewhat analogous

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:08.580
to a two-level
system, it actually

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:13.050
captures exactly a
lot of the properties

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.480
of the dynamics of
a two-level system.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.710
So let me write that down.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:25.820
The motion of classical magnetic
moments provides a model.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:33.740
It's actually an
exact model which

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:47.266
captures essentially
all features

00:46:47.266 --> 00:46:49.840
of the quantum mechanical
two-level system.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:59.570
I want to show you today and
the next lecture the concepts

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:04.750
or Rabi frequency, of
generalized of resonant Rabi

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:10.190
frequency, all of that you
find in the classical motion

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:13.510
of a magnetic moment.

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:16.070
Or, for instance, the
physics of rapid [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.850
following, [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:21.010
A lot of physics
we would usually

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.180
associate with the
quantum system,

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.244
we find it here in a
purely classical system.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:37.040
What aspects of the two-level
system will we not find?

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:37.540
Any ideas?

00:47:45.224 --> 00:47:45.724
Will?

00:47:45.724 --> 00:47:47.700
AUDIENCE: Spontaneous emission?

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.050
PROFESSOR: Spontaneous
emission, definitely.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:50.950
Yes.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:53.150
But actually, in a
two-level system,

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:57.110
in a quantum-mechanical
two-level system, which

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:59.460
we drive with a
single frequency,

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.610
spontaneous emission
is also missing.

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.380
Spontaneous emission, as
we will discuss later,

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:08.690
only comes into play when we say
the excited state of the system

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:11.860
interacts with many,
many modes and not just

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.920
the one mode we apply.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.045
And typically, if you
go to high frequency,

00:48:16.045 --> 00:48:19.470
we have an optical oscillator,
we cannot avoid spontaneous

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:20.330
emission.

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:24.610
Whereas, for a
quantum-mechanical spin 1/2

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.290
interacting with microwaves,
we can completely

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:30.100
eliminate spontaneous emission.

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.480
So spontaneous
emission, I would say,

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.570
comes into play
at high frequency.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:37.830
So that's correct.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:41.070
But there is one aspect
even at low frequency,

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:44.075
one aspect of quantum mechanics
which we cannot capture.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.930
AUDIENCE: Having different
G in a magnetic field?

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:02.490
PROFESSOR: Different
G factors, yes.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.560
That's, as we see, a
more quantitative aspect.

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.830
But there is one very important
feature about quantum mechanics

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.866
you will never get in
a classical system.

00:49:12.866 --> 00:49:14.660
AUDIENCE: Spin?

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:15.913
PROFESSOR: Spin.

00:49:15.913 --> 00:49:16.829
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.037
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:23.037 --> 00:49:23.620
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.320
I think you're skirting around.

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.140
It's a quantum measurement
process and projection.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:30.930
If you perform a measurement
on a compass needle,

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:32.520
it can be at any angle.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.680
But if you do a measurement
on a quantum system,

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.360
you do a projection.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.090
After the measurement
projects a system

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:41.910
in either spin up or spin down.

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:44.910
So the probabilistic
nature, the projection

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:46.990
occurring in a
quantum measurement

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:49.070
is, of course, absent
in a classical system.

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.770
But when you say spin
1/2 and quantum levels,

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:00.790
this is sort of implied in it.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:03.330
If there are only two levels,
there's only up and down

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.840
and not an infinite
number of angles.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.560
So what we will actually see is
that we find an exact analogy

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.340
between the classic system and
the quantum mechanical system

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.130
when we compare
expectation values.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:18.450
But the individual measurement,
the individual quantum

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:22.070
measurement because it is
projective is different.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:50.990
OK, with that
motivation, we are now

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:53.300
talking about
magnetic resonance.

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:09.400
And we will later do a fully
quantum mechanical description,

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:15.460
but to get the concepts and
also understand the analogies

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:18.450
to a classical system,
we want to understand

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:27.090
what happens when we have
a classic magnetic moment

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:30.280
in magnetic fields.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:34.220
And that includes static
fields, but then we

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.280
want to excite the system.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.505
We want to drive the system,
and this is time-varying fields.

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:50.360
And we will assume that the
fields are spatially uniform.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:59.540
So let me just remind you of
the obvious equations of motion

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:04.351
that also allows me to
introduce the nomenclature.

00:52:04.351 --> 00:52:13.280
The interaction energy between
a classical magnetic moment

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:21.310
mu and the magnetic
field is mu dot B.

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:31.560
The force is the gradient
of the interaction energy,

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:36.340
but it is 0 for uniform fields.

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:40.690
So therefore, we don't
need to look at the force.

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:48.240
But the next thing which we then
have to consider is the torque.

00:52:57.150 --> 00:53:01.350
And when we think about the
classical magnetic moment,

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:03.020
you can think about
a compass needle.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:06.310
But magnetic materials
are complicated.

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:09.460
If I think about the
simplest magnetic moment,

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:19.550
I think about a loop of
current I and area A.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:24.780
And that's sort of the classical
model for magnetic moment.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:39.180
So we have a magnetic moment mu.

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:46.180
And if we now add a magnetic
field, which is at an angle,

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.380
we have a torque.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.290
But just to make
sure the torque is

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:53.760
something which is nothing
else than the Lewin's

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.760
force on the electrons.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:01.310
But since electron is
forced to go in a circle,

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:04.460
we don't have to look at the
Lewin's force microscopically.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:06.980
We just immediately
jump to the torque.

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.010
And the torque is what describes
the dynamics of the system.

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:23.620
So we have torque.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:28.230
When we have torque, we want
to formulate the problem

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:29.800
in terms of angular momentum.

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:41.550
And our equation of motion
is the classical equation

00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:45.570
of motion that the derivative
of angular momentum

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:50.420
is given by that.

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:56.590
Now, what makes those equations
immediately solvable--

00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:59.130
and to find the
very easy limit is

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:04.840
that the magnetic moment
of the system we assume

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.486
is proportional to
its angular momentum.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:13.330
Well, if you have a
mechanical object which

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:18.860
goes in a-- if you have a
charged object which circles

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:22.020
around a central potential,
then you, of course,

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.780
find immediately that
if it moves faster,

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.260
it has more angular momentum.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.600
It has a larger magnetic moment.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:34.770
So we use that as the
defining equation for what

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:37.070
is called the
gyromagnetic ratio.

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.130
Which, of course, is
very closely related

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:49.160
to G factors, which we
define later on for atoms.

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:54.750
The gyromagnetic ratio is the
ratio between magnetic moment

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:55.670
and angular momentum.

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:08.270
And then, we find that the
derivative of angular momentum

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:10.920
is given by this equation.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:16.820
And this is now
an equation which

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:18.460
you have seen in
classical mechanics

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:20.090
and in many situations.

00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:23.700
The solution of that
is a pure precession.

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:28.120
The motion is pure precession
of the angular momentum

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:33.280
around the axis of
the magnetic field.

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:43.830
So in other words, we have the
axis of the magnetic field.

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.830
We have the angular momentum.

00:56:50.830 --> 00:57:05.930
And at a constant
tipping angle, we

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:10.000
have the tip of the
angular momentum

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.430
precesses around
the magnetic field.

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:24.320
And the precession happens
with an angular frequency

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.155
which is called the
Larmor frequency.

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:38.490
The Larmor frequency, the
frequency of precession,

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:40.910
is proportional to
the magnetic field

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:42.841
and the gyromagnetic ratio.

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:53.290
So let me give you an
example for an electron.

00:57:53.290 --> 00:58:03.680
The gyromagnetic ratio is 2 pi
times 2.8 megahertz per Gauss.

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.080
And we've discussed
last class what

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.510
it means when I take out 2 pi.

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:15.290
Because the Larmor frequency
is an angular frequency.

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:18.300
And angular frequency
is not measured in Hertz

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.210
because there is a 2 pi factor.

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:24.321
And I just make it obvious
where the 2 pi factor is hidden.

00:58:24.321 --> 00:58:25.570
Now, this is for the electron.

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:33.870
But if you have an ensemble
of classical charges,

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:37.530
an [INAUDIBLE] distribution
of classical charges--

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:40.510
well, with the same
charge to mass ratio,

00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:50.840
you find that the gyromagnetic
ratio is 1/2 of that.

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:55.860
And this here is
the Bohr magneton,

00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:58.546
which we will use quite
often in this course.

00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:10.380
The third example is the proton.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:14.400
The proton is heavier,
has a heavier mass.

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:18.030
About 1,000 times heavier
than the electron.

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:20.650
And therefore, the
Larmor frequency is not

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:24.310
megahertz per Gauss, it
is kilohertz per Gauss.

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:37.130
Any questions?

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:42.190
These are more definitions
and setting the stage.

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:53.110
Let me make a note.

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:55.110
It's one of the
many notes I will

00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:58.330
make in this course
about factors of 2.

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:00.260
There are factors of 2.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:03.600
If you miss it, you
qualitatively miss the physics.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.520
And let me in that
context by talking

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.390
about precession frequencies
and magnetic moment,

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:11.460
explain a factor of
2 which is related

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.910
to the G factor of the electron.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:25.730
So if you have the electron
which has spin of 1/2,

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:27.560
in units of the
Bohr magneton, what

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.010
is the magnetic moment
of the electron?

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:34.040
1/2, 1, or 2?

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.020
What is the magnetic
moment of the electron?

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.618
1/2, 1, or 2?

01:00:41.522 --> 01:00:43.942
AUDIENCE: 2.

01:00:43.942 --> 01:00:44.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.250
PROFESSOR: I should have a
clicker question on there.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:47.940
No.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.520
It's 1.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.290
1 Bohr magneton.

01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:54.570
And let me sort of show
the level structure of it.

01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:00.510
This is [INAUDIBLE] energy.

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:05.170
You have spin up and
you have spin down.

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:13.450
The difference is 2.8
megahertz per Gauss.

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:20.870
And if you ask, what is
the precession frequency

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:22.980
of an electron in
a magnetic field?

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:26.410
It's 2.8 megahertz if
the field is 1 Gauss.

01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:28.560
And if you want to
drive the rotation,

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.705
if you want to change the
precession angle-- we'll

01:01:30.705 --> 01:01:32.080
talk about that
in great detail--

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.340
you better drive the
system at 2.8 megahertz.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:40.770
But 2.8 megahertz is the
difference of plus 1.4

01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:43.160
and minus 1.4.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.470
And therefore, the energy of
the electron in a magnetic field

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:50.420
is either plus or minus
1.4 megahertz per Gauss,

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.970
and 1.4 is 1 Bohr magneton.

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:56.590
The magnetic moment of the
electron is 1 Bohr magneton.

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:07.130
So precesses at 2.8.

01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:15.230
OK, but let us contrast this
with a classical current

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:26.000
distribution, which has
1 unit of h bar, which

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:35.040
means the magnetic moment
is 1 Bohr magneton exactly

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.300
as the electron has.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:46.330
Well, quantum
mechanically means it

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:48.330
has three different
level-- minus 1,

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:52.380
[INAUDIBLE] 0, and 1 because it
has 1 unit of angular momentum.

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:56.440
Since the system has
1 Bohr magneton, when

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.940
the system stands
up or stands down,

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:03.150
the difference between
spin up and spin down

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:06.485
is 2.8 megahertz per Gauss.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:13.920
OK, my question now is, what
is the precession frequency

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.730
of this classical charge
distribution which

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:21.850
has 1 unit h bar of
angular momentum?

01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:24.640
And I've just shown you
the level structure.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.020
If you will now create a
wave packet of those three

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:31.430
levels, which means-- a wave
packet of the three levels

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:35.420
means you have a spin which
points in one direction.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:37.998
What is the precession
frequency of that system?

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:45.630
Let's have a clicker question.

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:47.580
So what is the
precession frequency?

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.041
Oops, what happened?

01:03:59.755 --> 01:04:04.980
So let me give
you three choices.

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:15.360
2.4, 1.4, or 0.0
megahertz per Gauss.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:41.570
So please vote for A, B, or C.

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:49.510
Yes, it's 1.4.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:52.220
So they have the
same magnetic moment.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:55.870
Quantum mechanically, you would
see here is a G factor of 2.

01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:58.110
Here's a G factor of 1.

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:03.050
But the easiest explanation
is it precesses.

01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:06.400
The precession is a beat note
between two energy levels.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.040
Here, you have the beat note
between those two energy

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.350
levels happens at 1.4 megahertz.

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.036
Therefore, when you
want to drive it

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:16.536
with an external
radiation, you have

01:05:16.536 --> 01:05:17.960
to drive it at 1.4 megahertz.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.880
You want to drive
it level by level.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.380
Whereas, this system has a
beat note between two levels,

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.510
and the difference
is 2.8 megahertz.

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:28.940
Anyway, whenever you get
confused about factors of 2

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.840
with magnetic moment
and precessing system,

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.530
just think about those
two simple examples.

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:39.920
They have all the factors of 2
hidden in the simplest example

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.420
possible.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:45.735
All right.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.800
We have a rotating system.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.490
have a system which precesses.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.360
So we want to learn about
rotations in general.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:12.610
And what I want to
show you is that

01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:16.920
under very general
circumstances,

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:23.950
we can solve the equation,
the dynamics of the system,

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:27.000
by going into rotating frame.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.690
You all know about
rotating wave [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:33.360
rotating wave approximations
that's in quantum physics.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.050
I'm simply talking
about a classical system

01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:37.750
and I want to
solve the equations

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:40.630
for the classical system
by going to rotating frame.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.244
And I want to show you where
this is exact and where not.

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:50.190
OK, so this is
actually something

01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:58.530
which we do in undergraduate,
in 8.01-- definitely, in 8.012.

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:05.500
But let me remind you when we
have a rotating vector which

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:11.190
rotates with a constant
angular frequency,

01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:17.564
then the time derivative of the
vector is the cross product.

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.280
But now we want
to allow-- so this

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.000
is when the vector is
constant and it just rotates.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.950
But now, we want to assume
that there is something else.

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:43.770
There is an arbitrary
time dependence

01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:46.900
of the vector in
the rotating frame.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.690
So we have a vector
which changes

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.680
according to A dot [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.700
But it also rotates.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.810
And that means--
and this is exactly

01:07:55.810 --> 01:08:00.700
shown in classical mechanics
that in the inertia frame,

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.340
the time derivative
is the sum of the two.

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.290
It is the change of the
vector in the rotating

01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:19.399
frame plus omega cross A.
So it has this equation.

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:27.760
Has the simple
two limiting cases

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:31.859
that if there is no change
in the rotating frame,

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:35.580
then we retrieve the
kinematics of pure rotation.

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:41.370
When our rotating
frame is not rotating

01:08:41.370 --> 01:08:45.689
or it rotates at 0 angular
frequency, then of course

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:52.220
the two time derivatives
are the same.

01:08:52.220 --> 01:09:00.069
But anyway, what I derived for
you is an operator equation

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:03.720
that the time derivative
in the rotating frame

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.080
is related to the time
derivative in the inertia

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.800
frame in this way.

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:18.950
And now we want to apply it
to our angular momentum L dot.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:30.920
So this is just applying
the operator equation

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:35.550
to our angular
momentum L. And now

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:39.810
we want to specialize
that-- we just

01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:48.435
discussed that the
time [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:56.522 --> 01:09:58.870
I'm just looking
for a sign problem,

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:04.710
but it's sometimes hard to fix
sign problems at the board.

01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:07.710
The creation of motion
for the angular momentum

01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:16.091
was that it's L cross gamma B.

01:10:16.091 --> 01:10:17.090
Oh, I changed the order.

01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:19.170
There is no sign problem.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:22.630
And then, I add this.

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:27.770
So if we now describe
our precessing,

01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:31.430
classical magnetic moment,
which has the equation of motion

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:35.310
that L dot is L cross
gamma B, if you describe it

01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:40.080
in a rotating frame, then
the equation of motion

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.530
gets modified as follows.

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:50.750
Now, what happens is we--
let me factor out the gamma.

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:55.260
Gamma L cross B
is the real field.

01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:04.200
So what we observe
is that when we

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.530
go into a rotating
frame-- and this

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:14.390
is exact-- that the real
magnetic field gets replaced

01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:19.100
by an effective magnetic field.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:25.210
Because there is an
extra term added to it,

01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:27.822
which we can call a
fictitious magnetic field.

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:35.970
So this is just an
exact transformation

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:38.300
of our equation of
motion for a precessing

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.980
system into the rotating frame.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:44.700
And now, of course, we
haven't made any assumptions

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.660
what the rotating frequency is.

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:52.370
But if you would choose
the rotating frequency

01:11:52.370 --> 01:12:00.330
to be the Larmor frequency
minus gamma times B,

01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:05.010
then our effective
magnetic field vanishes.

01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:09.070
And then we know, because
there is no magnetic field,

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:15.310
that the angular momentum is
constant in the rotating frame.

01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:23.000
In other words, the
dynamics of the system

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.130
means that L is constant
in a rotating frame.

01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.840
And if you want to know what
happens in the original,

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.374
in the [? lab ?] frame,
in the inertial frame,

01:12:31.374 --> 01:12:32.540
we just have to rotate back.

01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:55.620
OK, that's something we
want to take advantage of.

01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:01.590
But we fully apply
it in the next class.

01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:05.670
I have only a few
minutes left today,

01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:09.760
and I want to spend
those few minutes to talk

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.840
about another factor of 2.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.933
Now, let me ask
you the following.

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:30.010
If you have an electron
in a magnetic field, well,

01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:37.695
you know that the
electron goes in circles.

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.380
It's the cyclotron
motion of the electron.

01:13:45.095 --> 01:13:51.334
Now, just give me one second.

01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:11.525
I forgot to mention something
for the classical system.

01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:27.400
For a classical
charge distribution,

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:35.150
the Larmor frequency is
the charge of the particle.

01:14:35.150 --> 01:14:38.240
In case of the electron, it's e.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:43.030
Divided by 2m times B.
So the Larmor frequency

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:47.630
is e over 2m times B.

01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:51.460
So therefore, we
know that when we

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:58.140
have an [INAUDIBLE] of
positive and negative charges,

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:01.800
and there is an effective
magnetic moment,

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:06.740
that this magnetic moment
would precess at the Larmor

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:22.810
frequency which is given
by this expression.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:26.800
So who knows what the frequency
of the cyclotron motion is?

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:37.920
So when we have a
free electron, what

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.694
is the frequency at
which it revolves?

01:15:40.694 --> 01:15:41.860
At which it goes in circles?

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:44.320
AUDIENCE: 2 times
the Larmor frequency.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.785
PROFESSOR: It's two times
the Larmor frequency.

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.740
OK, I just wanted to mention it.

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:58.755
There's an important factor of
2 which you should know about.

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:05.290
In previous classes, I
spent 10 or 20 minutes

01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:08.160
to teach you about
a few of them which

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.100
is called Larmor's theorem.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:17.190
But I summarized the argument
on the atomic physics wiki

01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:19.290
and I can't say
more here in class

01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:20.830
than I've written on the wiki.

01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:26.350
So please read on our
atomic physics wiki

01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:28.300
about Larmor's theorem.

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:36.860
Larmor's theorem shows you
that under certain assumptions,

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:40.900
you can transform away the
effect of a magnetic field

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.378
by going to the
Larmor frequency.

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:54.170
That looks exactly like
what we have discussed here.

01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:57.030
But what we discussed
here was exact.

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:58.450
There was no approximation.

01:16:58.450 --> 01:17:01.380
Whereas, the derivation
of Larmor's theorem,

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.040
which talks about
charge distributions--

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.370
not about magnetic moments,
about charge distributions--

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:09.780
has to make certain
approximations.

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:11.480
So just want to
point your attention

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.930
to that there are two
derivations about Larmor

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:15.930
frequency.

01:17:15.930 --> 01:17:18.600
One is exact, which
I gave to you.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.160
There is another one which
is Larmor's theorem, which

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.930
applies to isolated
charges which is not exact.

01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:29.230
But they both conclude
that you can transform away

01:17:29.230 --> 01:17:31.700
the effect of a
magnetic field by going

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:36.000
to rotating frame at
the Larmor frequency.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.520
And the fact that Larmor's
theorem is not exact

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:45.430
is actually illustrated by
this example of a free electron

01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:48.590
where you have a factor of 2.

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:53.840
And this comes
because the term which

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:58.070
you neglect when you
derive Larmor's theorem

01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:01.660
is negligible if
the situation is

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:04.520
that you have electrons
and charges forming

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.930
magnetic moments.

01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:09.300
But if you have a free
electron, the neglected term

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.410
is exactly 1/2 of
the dominant term.

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:15.910
And that is why the
cyclotron frequency is twice

01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:18.110
about Larmor frequency.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:21.730
So never confuse the cyclotron
and the Larmor frequency.

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:23.930
And the factor of
2 is not related

01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:26.260
to a G factor of the
electron or such.

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:29.280
It's really the difference
between the physics

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.115
of a free charge and the
physics of a magnetic moment.

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:35.485
Any questions?

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:42.955
OK, well, then we are
finished for today.

01:18:42.955 --> 01:18:46.240
A reminder, no class
on Wednesday, but we

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.710
have class on Friday in
the different classroom.
