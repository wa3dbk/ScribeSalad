00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:22.835
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.060
So in the last week
of this semester,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.625
we will be finishing up
the chapter on coherence.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.540
What we want to continue
to explore today

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.620
is the presence of a dark state.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.370
If you have a three
level system, and that's

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.630
what we went through
last week, we

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.800
will always find one
state which is dark,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.080
which means we fully illuminate
the atom with laser light,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.240
but there is one
state which is not

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.498
coupled to the excited state
which does not scatter light,

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.415
and therefore is dark.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.730
I showed you that for very
general conditions, if you have

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.640
two laser beams
exciting the two states,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.070
there will always be a coherent
superposition of the two

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.260
states, which is the dark state.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.840
The dark state is the novel
feature of three level systems,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.800
and I want to show you
different perspectives of it.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.650
We started out by talking
about just the existence

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.330
of the dark state.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.160
Then we talked about
dark state transfer.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.250
You can regard, for detuned
light, the dark state

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.460
as the lowest energy
state of the system.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.250
And then an adiabatic
theorem tells you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.670
that you can keep
particles in the dark state

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.000
even if you change
the laser parameters

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.300
and change what state
is now the dark state.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.700
This is the basis of
coherent population transfer,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.250
or the famous STIRAP method.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.950
There is another aspect
of the dark state

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.170
which gives us a possibility
of lasing without inversion.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.160
As I reminded you,
lasing has a threshold,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.310
which is inversion that you need
more atoms in the excited state

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.510
than in the ground state because
the atoms in the ground state

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.450
absorb the laser light
and you want a net gain.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.500
However, if you
have a dark state,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.460
you have a situation where the
atoms do not absorb the laser

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.260
light, and therefore, the
conditions for net gain

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.270
have changed.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.650
And indeed, lasing without
inversion becomes possible.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:03:00.660
I started to explain
to you the way

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.970
how lasing without
inversion could come about.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.040
It relies on the fact that
in a three level system,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.230
absorption
destructively interferes

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.050
but stimulated emission does
not destructively interfere.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.300
And therefore, you
can have lasing

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.670
without inversion in
such three level systems.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:29.090
I showed you one
possible realization,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.080
and this is about hydrogen
in a DC electric field.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.860
If we mix the 2S and 2P
states with an electric field,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.060
we have this three
level structure.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.380
And for a laser tuned right
in the middle between the two

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.720
states, the two amplitudes
for excitation cancel exactly,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.840
and therefore, you have a
zero absorption feature.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.760
However, if you put now a
little bit of population into,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.450
let's say, the upper
state, this upper state

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.150
in the wings of its
profile has still

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.190
gained for stimulated
emission, and what we get

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.270
is lasing without inversion.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.530
Now you say, OK, but
that's a hydrogen atom.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.880
Which atom is really
degenerate between two levels,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.180
and you can split regeneracy
with a static electric field.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.030
Well, you're already an expert
at this point in the course.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.500
If the 2S and 2P state
are widely separated,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.990
well, you add a
photon, and the photon,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.360
which is in resonance
with the 2S and 2P state,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.770
creates, in the dressed
atom picture, degeneracy.

00:04:47.905 --> 00:04:49.780
Maybe I should have
shown the P state higher.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.250
The 2S state with one
more photon and the 2P

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.300
state with one photon
less have the same energy,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.590
and then you create
exactly this situation.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.215
So therefore, the
way you can realize

00:05:03.215 --> 00:05:06.160
that in atoms
other than hydrogen

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:19.915
is use an AC electric field
to mix S and P states.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.090
And I'll show you in five
minutes a little bit more

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.268
in detail what I mean by that.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.470
There is a trivial
realization which

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.760
I want to mention for
lasing without inversion,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.330
and this would be if
you have a three level

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.900
system with an excited
state, two levels, g

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.065
and f in the ground state.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:19.180
You may have an inversion
for the e to g transition.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.410
And therefore,
you can get lasing

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.570
because the population in
this state f is not coupled.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:34.100
This is pretty trivial, but the
more subtle part, of course,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:41.820
is that we can realize it using
a driven system using a control

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:49.290
laser by creating the same
situation with the bright

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:55.850
and the dark state, and
population in the dark state

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.880
is hidden from the light
and does not absorb light.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.280
Let me just indicate that
in both those states,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.885
we would have no
absorption, dark state.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.450
Those examples may raise the
question whether whenever

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.140
you have lasing
without inversion,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:33.360
if you can find a basis where
you have inversion again

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.970
between the two levels
which are relevant

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.330
and the extra population
is just hidden.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.300
I want to make two
comments about it.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.920
This question is
sometimes discussed

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.740
in the literature, sometimes
in a semi-controversial way.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.150
There are two comments about it.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:53.170
One is when you
start dressing up

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.680
your system with laser beams,
you have strong control lasers.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.800
You have two lasers,
omega 1, omega 2.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.990
One is often a
strong control laser

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.940
and the other one
is the weak laser

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.990
where we want to have lasing.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.880
You have actually a time
dependent system driven

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.000
by time dependent fields, and
once you have a time dependent

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.150
system, it's no longer clear
what the eigenstates are,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.280
what the populations are,
and what are the coherences.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.760
There is no longer a
unique way to distinguish

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.770
what are the eigenstates because
every state is, so to speak,

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.789
time dependent
almost by definition.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.720
On the other hand,
I think the example

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.350
I gave you with atomic
hydrogen where you just

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.970
a little bit of mixing
with an electric field

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.669
is an example
where you genuinely

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.380
have less population
in the excited state

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.910
than you have in
the ground state,

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.090
and at least the equation tells
you, even without inversion,

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.160
you have a net gain.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.890
So my own understanding
of that situation

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.150
is that in many situations,
you can actually reduce it

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:05.970
to a simple picture where you
have simply hidden population

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:15.080
in a dark state, but without any
sort of unnatural definitions,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.350
you may not find that
in some other systems.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.535
Questions about lasing
without inversion?

00:09:24.535 --> 00:09:25.946
Nancy?

00:09:25.946 --> 00:09:27.938
STUDENT: Is lasing
without inversion

00:09:27.938 --> 00:09:32.420
important in lab, as opposed
to lasing with inversion,

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.906
or is it more about
teaching us [INAUDIBLE]??

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.190
PROFESSOR: Well, lasing
without inversion

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.880
has definitely been
touted as a way

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.130
to get lasing deeper
in the UV, to get

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:53.120
lasing for very blue
transitions because when

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.980
you want to create inversion--

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.500
this actually has been
the problem in creating

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.170
x-ray lasers in atomic systems.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.890
If you have larger and
larger energy separation,

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:10.890
spontaneous emission scales
with omega [? cube. ?]

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.790
And so therefore, it
becomes harder and harder

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.350
to fulfill the
ordinary gain equation.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.798
STUDENT: So in those
cases, even these last two

00:10:18.798 --> 00:10:21.926
methods [INAUDIBLE]
because [INAUDIBLE]??

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.900
PROFESSOR: Well, lasing
without inversion

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.460
alleviates the requirement
to build a laser,

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.505
and so people have
discussed that where

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:36.630
it's really hard to create a
laser in the conventional way,

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.770
deep, deep in the blue of the
UV or in the x-ray regime,

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.360
that lasing without
inversion may help.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.490
I'm not aware that any
practical development

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.610
has emerged from that because
there is a price to be paid,

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.010
and that is usually in
the form of coherence.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.300
You need a certain
degree of coherence

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.370
in your system to
be able to do that.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.960
It's an idea which is
powerful, but as far as I know,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.950
there was no killer
application of it.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.480
The importance of dark
states is definitely

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.320
in slow light, manipulation,
quantum computation,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.720
and concepts of storing
light, and this is

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.650
what we want to discuss next.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.940
Actually not next,
but after next.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.260
What I first want to
discuss is another aspect

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.610
of the dark state, and
this goes by the name

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.885
EIT, electromagnetically
induced transparency.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:10.320
I can introduce this topic by
a question to Radio Yerevan,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.570
is it possible to send a laser
beam through a brick wall?

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.990
And the answer of Radio
Yerevan, if you know the joke,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.725
is always, in principle yes, but
you need another very powerful

00:12:20.725 --> 00:12:22.270
laser.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.430
So in an incoherent
way, of course,

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.550
a very powerful laser can
drill a hole into the wall

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.800
and then the next laser
can go through the wall

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.740
without absorption,
but you can be smarter.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.080
If the very powerful
laser through coherence

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.230
puts all the atoms in the brick
in the beam pass of the laser

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.680
into a coherent
superposition state,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.740
and then they
become a dark state,

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.108
then your laser can go
through a brick wall.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:03.895
So can a laser beam penetrate
an optically thick medium?

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:21.285
And the answer is yes, with
the help of another laser.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.480
Original ideas along those
lines were formulated by Steve

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.310
Harris, who has really
pioneered this field,

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:38.750
and he first considered special
auto-ionizing excited states

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.160
which couple to--

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.370
there were two pathways of
coupling into the continuum,

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.230
but later work has
shown that it can

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.380
be realized in a lambda system.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.985
Let me talk about this
conceptionally simpler

00:13:52.985 --> 00:13:59.495
realization in a three
level lambda system.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:12.470
Let's assume we have again
our normal three level system

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:18.273
gf and an excited state
which has a width, gamma.

00:14:21.514 --> 00:14:32.170
And we want to send a probe
laser through a dense medium,

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.470
and it would be completely
absorbed by the resonance

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.380
to the excited state.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:57.400
But now we can have a
strong coupling laser

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.990
with a rapid frequency,
omega c, and so if we drive

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:08.610
the system very strongly, we
can create a situation where

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.730
the coupling laser does, if
it's strong enough, complete

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.890
mixing between the excited
state and the ground state,

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.640
and that means if you have two
levels which are completely

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.850
mixed, they are split by
the energy or the frequency

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.630
of the coupling.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:32.800
So in other words,
what we obtain is we

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:39.420
have now two states, e
plus f and e minus f.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.500
You know the how you should
read is the following.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.990
You can just assume
for a second the state

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.070
f will degenerate with gamma and
then I put in a very strong mix

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.470
in between the two.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.500
This is exactly the example
we had with hydrogen

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.600
in an electric
field, and then we

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.770
get two states which have
both width gamma over 2.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.630
They are strongly
mixed, and the splitting

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:09.730
is nothing else than the matrix
element of the electric field.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.150
But if you don't have
two degenerate states

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.980
and we add a photon,
then the photon--

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.820
I mentioned it again and again
in addressed atom picture--

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.520
creates a degeneracy.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.090
You can just add a photon,
draw a dashed line,

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.340
and this is your virtual
state if you want.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.480
Or if you look at
Schrodinger's equation,

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.240
you have something
which oscillates

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.460
at the frequency
of the state, f,

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.930
but now you multiply it with an
electric field which oscillates

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.920
at the resonance
frequency, and then

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.380
you have something
which oscillates

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.430
at the sum of the
two frequencies,

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.560
and this is exactly what I
indicated with a dashed line.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.310
So that's how you
create, so to speak,

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.610
a degeneracy by using the
frequency of the laser

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.970
to overcome the
energy splitting,

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.280
and the result is that
you have created exactly

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.220
this excited state
level structure.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.609
And if you now look
at the ground state,

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:17.329
and our photon is tuned right
between those two continua,

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:18.654
then we have a dark resonance.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.520
And in order to
accomplish this, I'm

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.369
not going into any
calculations here,

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.950
but you need a sufficiently
strong coupling

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.720
laser who can accomplish that.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.270
For instance,
coupling laser which

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.430
is stronger than the spontaneous
emission rate or decoherence

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.970
rate gamma in the excited state.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:18:04.140
So if we now scan
the probe laser

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:21.990
and we look for
transmission, let

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:28.620
me assume for simplicity
that there is no relaxation

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.480
between the two ground states.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:55.550
If the coupling
laser strength is 0,

00:18:55.550 --> 00:19:01.290
then we have a
broad feature, which

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.830
is simply the single photon
absorption of the probe light.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.200
If we have an infinitesimal
coupling laser strength,

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.340
we get a very,
very sharp feature,

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:22.390
and if the coupling laser
is stronger and stronger,

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:27.710
we get a window of transparency,
and the width is given.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:32.020
The width delta omega
of this central feature

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.130
is given by the Rabi frequency
of the coupling laser.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:45.340
So what are possible
applications?

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:09.930
One is you can design
non-linear materials.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.860
Usually, when you want to have
frequency conversion processes

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.110
or optical switches
at one laser beam

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.460
affects another
laser beam, you want

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.170
a very strong non-linear
response of your medium,

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.230
you usually get that if
you go near resonance,

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.790
but near resonance, you
have strong absorption.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:36.150
But now, using the concept
of EIT, you can have both.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.570
You can have the strong
non-linear response

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.190
of your medium near resonance
but you suppress absorption,

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.690
you get a window of
transparency using EIT.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:58.246
So you can have near resonant
materials without absorption.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.280
Again, in principle,
I'm not aware

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.260
that this has really taken
off in a bigger time.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.470
One would be if you want to do
very sensitive spectroscopy.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.790
Assume you want to
measure one isotope which

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.370
has a tiny little
abundance but you

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.990
have to observe it against
the background of a very

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.530
strong isotope.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.080
If you could switch off the
absorption of the background,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.210
the absorption of
the strong isotope,

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.330
you could still see a small
amount of a trace isotope

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.310
in the presence of a
strong absorption line.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:43.206
So sensitive detection
of trace elements.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.600
Questions about that?

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.800
I've given you
qualitative pictures

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.470
for lasing without
inversion and for EIT.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:12.250
I want to give it a little
bit more quantitative touch,

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.860
not by going through to the
optical Bloch equations which

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.390
would be necessary to
describe all features of it,

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:23.260
but at least I want to
give you one picture where

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.630
you can derive
and discuss things

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.710
in a more quantitative way, and
this is the eigenstate picture.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.400
I've also done here what
I've said several times,

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:44.200
that when we have splittings
between the levels,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.100
we can actually focus
on what really matters,

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.870
namely the detunings,
by absorbing the laser

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.190
frequency into the
definition of our levels,

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.680
and that's what I've done here.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:02.750
Instead of using levels g, f,
and e, I have levels with g, f,

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.450
e, but this is the photon
number in laser field one

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.950
and the photon number
in laser field two.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:13.580
So if all of the photons,
the laser field one and laser

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.730
field two, would be resonance
with their respective

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.565
transitions, then all
those three levels

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.860
would be degenerate.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.220
But now in the
three level system,

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.090
they're not degenerate
only because we

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:32.340
have a relative detuning
delta, detuning small delta

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:37.350
from the Raman resonance, and
we have a detuning peak delta,

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.700
which is sort the common
detuning of the Raman laser

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.360
from the excited state levels.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:50.760
So therefore, if I did
define the Rabi frequencies,

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.500
the Rabi frequencies over
2 are gain coefficient,

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.910
and the Rabi frequencies
are proportional

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.450
to the electric field.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.340
Therefore, they scale
with the photon numbers n

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.640
and m in the two laser beams.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:15.580
If I do that, I have a really
very simple Hamiltonian.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.645
On the diagonal, we
simply have the detuning

00:24:18.645 --> 00:24:22.440
of both laser beams
form the excited state.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.730
Here we have the Raman detuning,
and we have two couplings

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:28.130
to the excited state.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.920
One is laser field one,
g1, with n photons,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.430
and the other one is laser
field g2 with m photons.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.420
Any questions about?

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.070
Just setting up the
simple equations

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.320
which we have done a few times.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.470
Let me focus first
on the simple case

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:54.330
that everything is on resonance.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.870
Then, if everything
is on resonance,

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:06.950
we have the structure
which I've shown here.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.450
You can sort of say you
have three levels, which

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:13.480
are degenerate without
any Rabi frequency,

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.120
because the detunings
are all zero,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.880
or all the diagonal is zero.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.240
And then the off diagonal matrix
elements, the Rabi frequencies,

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.930
are just spreading the
three levels apart,

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.370
and the general
structure of this matrix

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.815
is that in the
middle, you always

00:25:29.815 --> 00:25:34.800
have a state which is just
a superposition of g and f.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.050
So it's a dark state.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.510
It has no contribution
in the excited state.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.755
And the two outer states
have equal contribution

00:25:42.755 --> 00:25:45.090
of the excited state.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.965
So the excited state has
been distributed over the two

00:25:47.965 --> 00:25:50.610
outer states, and the
widths of those levels

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.700
is therefore gamma over 2.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.940
And we know when
we had two levels

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.930
and we were driving them with
a Rabi frequency resonantly,

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.590
we had splittings
which were just

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:10.530
given by the Rabi
frequency, and now

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.370
the splitting between the
outer level and the dark state

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:18.023
is the quadrature sum of
the two Rabi frequencies.

00:26:18.023 --> 00:26:19.940
PROFESSOR: So that's a
very general structure.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.430
I want to go back
to the situation

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:32.040
where one laser
is a probe laser.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.960
Let's assume this is
our laser beam which

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.080
wants to go through
the brick wall,

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.700
and the other laser has
to prepare the system.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:45.920
Let me discuss the limit where
the photon number becomes very

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.850
small in laser one, the
photon number n goes to unity,

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.530
and this is much smaller than m.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:58.090
So we have the situation
of a weak probe field.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:09.330
If we have this limit,
then the dark state

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:14.750
has much, much more
amplitude in state g,

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:21.500
and the state g is
almost decoupled.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.720
It's in a trivial way.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.290
The dark state
and the laser beam

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.140
is very strongly mixing the
state f and the excited state.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.740
So in this limit, we have
a nice physical situation.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.190
I should actually
point out that you

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.740
can solve most of those
situations for three level

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.180
systems analytically.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.440
It's just those explanations
get long and are not

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.810
very transparent.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.780
So what I'm trying
here in the classroom,

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.820
I try to pick certain examples--

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.050
weak probe field, resonance--

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:06.270
where we can easily understand
the new features which

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.050
happen in the system.

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:10.680
So the situation we
have now prepared

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.300
is we have our dark
state, which is level g,

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.050
we said we have only one
photon in our probe beam,

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:23.050
and we have lots and lots of
photons in the coupling laser

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:30.630
which couples the other ground
state, f, to the excited state,

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:31.130
e.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.880
So we have the structure that
we have now two states which

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.580
have half of the widths
of the excited state,

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.310
and they are both bright.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:53.750
We can call one
the bright state 1

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.610
and the other the
bright state 2.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.200
The splitting is related
to the Rabi frequency.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.058
Let me just call it delta bar.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.630
This is now the level
structure which we have,

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.100
and what I want to now
emphasize in this picture

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.543
is the phenomenon
of interference.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.030
We've talked about
interference of amplitudes,

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.470
but now I want to
take the system

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:35.530
and show you how we
get now interference

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:39.740
when we send one probe
photon through the system.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.540
What we can now formulate
is a scattering problem.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:58.250
We have one photon in our
probe beam in a special mode,

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:08.230
but then, all the other
modes are unoccupied.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:12.630
And when we are asking, does
the probe photon get absorbed?

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.990
Does the weak laser beam
get stuck in the brick wall?

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:19.460
We are actually are
asking if it is possible

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.380
that we scatter the
photon out of the mode

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.880
and it gets absorbed.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.700
But you know absorption
is actually always

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.360
a two photon process involves
spontaneous emission,

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.130
and we have emitted the
photon into another mode.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:47.950
The scattering problem
is a two photon process,

00:30:47.950 --> 00:31:06.980
and the matrix element
needs an intermediate state,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:07.830
but now we have two.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:21.760
We start with one photon, we
have the light atom coupling,

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.600
we can go through
bright state 1.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.660
From bright state 1, we have
the light atom coupling again,

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.520
and eventually, we go
back to the ground state

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.560
without four photon.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.845
And here we have a detuning.

00:31:38.845 --> 00:31:41.260
Let's assume we
are halfway detuned

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:45.135
between the two bright states.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.470
And then we have a
second amplitude,

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:51.770
and it's indistinguishable.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.650
We have a Feynman
double slit experiment,

00:31:54.650 --> 00:32:01.320
and everything here is
the same except that we

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.950
scatter through bright state 2.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:15.150
This matrix element,
when it vanishes,

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.375
this is now the condition
of electromagnetically

00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:19.250
induced transparency.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.710
But we want to now
understand what happens

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.780
when we detune the probe laser.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.170
So we have set up the system
with a strong control laser,

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:39.060
we have completely mixed the
ground state f with the excited

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.535
state, and now we want to
ask, can a weak probe laser

00:32:42.535 --> 00:32:46.760
go through the brick wall
How much of the probe laser

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.680
is absorbed?

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.790
So what we want
to understand now,

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.320
and this is a new feature
I want to discuss now,

00:32:54.320 --> 00:33:04.020
what happens when we detune
the probe laser by delta?

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:09.570
Well, it's clear, and I just
wanted to show you the formula.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:17.310
We had two detunings here, and
if we detune the probe laser

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:26.420
by delta, that would mean now
that those denominators are

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:32.890
no longer opposite but equal.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.940
In one case, we add delta.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.840
In the other case,
we subtract delta.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.550
And therefore, we have no
longer the cancellation

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.870
of the two amplitudes
and we have

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:45.415
the scattering of the photon.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.380
This is sort of the
framework, and I

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.483
want to show you now
several examples.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.503
I want to show you examples
of a probe absorption spectra.

00:34:02.503 --> 00:34:04.170
It's more a little
bit of show and tell.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:09.010
I want to show you the result
if you would work that out.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.889
It's pretty interesting.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:19.170
So first, I want to discuss
the case where the coupling

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:20.989
laser is really in resonance.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.860
We are near the one
photon resonance.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:58.970
Let me assume first that the
Rabi frequency of the coupling

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.540
laser is much, much
larger than gamma.

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:17.330
Then if you look at
the probe transmission,

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.640
we have the situation
that we know

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.610
when we are right
here in the middle,

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:23.870
we have a window
of transparency,

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:30.630
but if we detune by the
Rabi frequency over two,

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:34.525
we hit the bright state 1, and
if we detune in the opposite,

00:35:34.525 --> 00:35:37.170
we hit the bright state 2.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.475
And the splitting in this
situation, delta bar,

00:35:40.475 --> 00:35:45.660
is nothing else than the
Rabi frequency omega 2.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.660
So what we have is we have
the detuning in between,

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.605
and we know already here
is our special point,

00:35:53.605 --> 00:35:54.980
and that's what
we have discussed

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:59.020
for long, electromagnetically
induced transparency.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.700
The two bright states
are at plus and minus

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.910
half the Rabi frequency
of the coupling laser.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:12.080
We know that we have very
strong absorption here.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.335
What you get is sort
of broad feature.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:27.180
But this was a situation when we
drive the system very strongly.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:35.680
I now want to discuss the case
that the coupling laser is

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.770
much weaker than gamma.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:45.880
Then the splitting between
the two bright states

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.890
was the Rabi frequency,
but the width is gamma,

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.970
so then the two bright
states pretty much merge

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:56.380
into one continuum
feature of width gamma.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:17.010
For that situation, we have a
broad feature of absorption,

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.510
which is on the order
of gamma, or if you

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:21.180
have an opaque
medium, of course,

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.190
you put the
absorption coefficient

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.995
into the exponent of
an exponential function

00:37:26.995 --> 00:37:30.480
and you get a blackout
which is wider than gamma.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:38.520
But then we have our
phenomenon of EIT,

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.872
but the width of this feature
is now much smaller than gamma.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:53.490
So what we have here
in those two situations

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.150
where the lasers are close
to resonance with the excited

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:01.710
level, we have the situation
that the strong absorption

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:04.910
feature due to
the bright states,

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:08.540
either one strong feature of
width gamma or two features

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.260
here, those broad, similar
photon absorption features,

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:17.230
they really overlap with
our window of transparency.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:21.420
And what I find very insightful
is now to discuss the situation

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.480
where we separate the two, and
I want to show you what happens.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.040
It gives a very
interesting profile.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:42.140
So what we want to discuss now
are the famous Fano profiles,

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.715
and I want to discuss two
photon absorption features.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:01.140
We have discussed the case
where the one photon detuning.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:15.630
We want to go now to a large
one photon detuning delta 2,

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.410
and the new feature
now is that this

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:27.340
will separate the window
of electromagnetically

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.695
induced transparency from the
broad absorption features.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.045
Let me just draw a
diagram of the states.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:40:02.180
As usual, we have our two
states in a lambda transition, g

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.460
and f.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.230
We have this continuum
of the excited state,

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:12.140
but now, and this is what often
is done in the experiment,

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.930
you're not using Raman
lasers which are in resonance

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:17.580
with the excited state.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.050
You're using Raman lasers--

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:24.560
here is the strong
coupling lasers--

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.480
which are far detuned.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:34.395
So here we have a detuning
for laser two called gamma 2.

00:40:34.395 --> 00:40:36.820
The Rabi frequency is omega 2.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:47.823
Here we have a weak probe laser
omega 1, and the detuning.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:56.670
Let's call it gamma 1.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:01.370
So in order to keep
the situation simple,

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.400
we use a weak probe laser.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.980
Omega 1 is small.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.620
And our Raman detuning
delta is the difference

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.350
between the two single
photons detuning,

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:14.866
capital delta 2 minus delta 1.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:29.770
For these situations, there
are nice analytic expressions,

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:33.020
and together with
the class notes,

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:38.330
I will post a
wonderfully clear paper

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.755
by [? Lunis ?] and [INAUDIBLE]
where the two authors discuss

00:41:42.755 --> 00:41:43.380
this situation.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.410
Let's just figure out what are
the features in the system.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:05.700
Let's just go through
different situations.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.980
One is if the Raman
detuning is zero,

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.570
we should always
get the phenomenon

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.620
of electromagnetically
induced transparency.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:29.050
If we don't have
any coupling, then

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:32.310
we simply have a
two level system,

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:36.070
and if we tune omega
1 into resonance,

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:37.810
we get simple single
photon absorption.

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.470
So if we look at the
system of the three levels

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:57.370
and we are asking what are
now the relevant processes,

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:02.700
one limit is, of course,
the trivial limit

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:15.960
that we have single
photon absorption.

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:20.825
This is, of course,
a trivial case.

00:43:20.825 --> 00:43:23.970
Let's now go to the
more interesting case

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:25.385
that we have a coupling laser.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:33.980
What happens now?

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.320
We have our two states.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:51.020
The excited state is
coupled with the laser

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:55.360
and Rabi frequency omega 2.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:02.490
Now we know that the laser omega
2, if it is not on resonance,

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.560
will give us an AC Stark shift.

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:11.340
This AC Stark shift, we've gone
through that several times.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:15.090
It's the matrix element
or Rabi frequency squared

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.190
divided by the detuning.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:44.550
If we now bring in
the probe laser,

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:46.280
what are the features we expect?

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.330
Well, there are two features.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:55.540
One is we've just discussed
the trivial case above.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:59.030
If we tune the probe laser
into resonance with the excited

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.860
state, we have single
photon absorption.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.220
We get a broad feature.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.770
It's almost like in
the two level system.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:09.410
But in contrast to the case
I just discussed above,

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:14.370
the excited state level e
has now an AC Stark shift

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.700
so the resonance is shifted.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.500
That's now becoming
a four photon process

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.700
because we need
two photons going

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.450
up and down with
a coupling laser

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:27.670
to create the AC Stark shift.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:30.270
And now we have a laser
from the probe beam

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.640
and the photon is scattered,
so it's a four photon process

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.050
and it will give us a
broad resonance which

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.450
is now AC stack shifted.

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:43.040
But in addition, we
have a resonance,

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.730
which is the Raman resonance.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:52.840
When the Raman detuning
is zero, then we

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:56.420
absorb from the
probe laser and we

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.040
emit in a stimulated way
with the coupling laser,

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.540
and we have a stimulated
two photon transition.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:06.670
Now, what is the width of
this stimulated two photon

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:07.170
transition?

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:14.830
Well, we go from a
stable ground state to--

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:17.480
I wanted to say another
stable ground state,

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:20.850
but this other
stable ground state

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:22.250
is now scattering photons.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:33.680
So because of the presence
of a strong coupling laser,

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.035
you have broadened this
level f by photon scattering.

00:46:38.035 --> 00:46:40.150
You interrupt the
coherent time evolution

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:44.110
by scattering photons,
and the photon scattering

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:49.140
happens in perturbation
theory by the amplitude to be

00:46:49.140 --> 00:47:02.860
in the excited state
squared times gamma.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.960
The scattering rate,
gamma scattering,

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:14.960
is Rabi frequency
divided by detuning.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.670
This is the amplitude to
be in the excited state.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:26.760
We square that, and then
we multiply with gamma,

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.322
and if I can trust
my notes, it's

00:47:28.322 --> 00:47:30.700
a factor of two, which I
don't want to discuss further.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.110
This is a quantitative argument.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.500
The analytic expressions
are in the reference

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.060
I've given to you.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:42.170
So the situation which
we have right now

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:47.470
can be in a very powerful
way summarized as follows.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:53.010
We have our ground
state, we have

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:56.610
two continua we can couple to.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:48:00.290
We can couple to the
excited state which

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:05.430
has a width, gamma,
through a single photon,

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:07.890
but there is the AC Stark shift.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:12.310
Or we can couple through a
two photon Raman transition

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:22.050
to the state f, but the
width is much, much smaller

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:24.960
because it is only the
scattering rate due

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.710
to the off resonant
coupling laser.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:33.010
Let me just write that down
because I said a lot of things.

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:41.520
So g couples now.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:44.080
When we detune the
probe laser, we

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.270
can be in resonance
with this feature

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:52.670
and we can be in resonance
with that feature

00:48:52.670 --> 00:49:07.990
to a narrow and
wide excited state.

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:11.070
One excited state, of
course, is the state f,

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:14.550
but the coupling laser puts
some character of the excited

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:17.290
states into the state f.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:21.040
And the most important
thing now is the following.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.570
This is the theme I've
emphasized again and again when

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:28.480
we discussed three
level systems.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.740
Those two states have
a width, and the width

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.760
means they spontaneously
emit light,

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.910
but they emit light
into the same continuum.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:40.530
So if you start in
the ground state,

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:44.360
your probe laser has a photon
and the photon gets scattered.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.230
You do not know through which
channel it has been scattered.

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:51.110
So in general,
and this is as far

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:55.220
as I want to push it in this
class, in three level system,

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:59.730
we have now the interference
between those two continua.

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.740
One is narrow and one is wide.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.460
Let me just write that down
because this is important,

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:26.255
but both excited states
couple to the same continuum.

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.610
And by continuum,
I mean the vacuum

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:36.940
of all empty states where
photons can be scattered,

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.940
and this is the condition
for interference.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.510
And this is, of
course, what gives rise

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.910
to electromagnetically
induced transparency.

00:50:54.565 --> 00:50:55.940
I'll take your
questions, but let

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.020
me first give you
a drawing which

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:05.110
may illustrate, or summarize,
what I've just said.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:10.490
So what we try to
understand is what happens

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:14.530
when we detune the probe laser.

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:18.950
Until now, we had always the
EIT feature, the EIT window,

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:22.300
was completely overlapping
with the one photon resonance,

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:27.910
but now, because the
coupling laser has

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:38.205
a detuning of gamma 2, we have
to use with the probe laser.

00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:00.090
I have to trace back how
the detunings are defined.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:09.930
The Raman detuning was big
delta 2 minus big delta 1.

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:13.810
If the detuning delta
is chosen to be delta 2,

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.670
we have the simple situation
that we go from the ground

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:23.520
state right to
the excited state,

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:29.380
and we have the feature
which has a width of gamma.

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:34.469
This is what you would call
the single photon resonance.

00:52:34.469 --> 00:52:35.886
It is the single
photon resonance.

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:44.290
It is due by resonantly
coupling into this continuum,

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:47.360
and the only feature
of the coupling laser

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.820
is that there's an
AC Stark shift to it.

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:55.090
Single normal resonance, almost
like in a two level system,

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:58.220
but the only addition
is the AC Stark effect.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:24.280
Now we have a second feature,
which can be very sharp.

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:40.380
This is when we do the
two photon Raman process

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.640
into the other ground state.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:52.480
Due to photon scattering,
this resonance

00:53:52.480 --> 00:54:00.060
has a width of gamma
scattering, and the position

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:05.750
is not at zero at the
naked Raman resonance.

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:09.770
It also has an AC Stark shift
because the coupling laser

00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:13.060
does an AC Stark shift to both
the excited and the ground

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.550
state.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.610
The coupling laser,
the AC Stark shift,

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:20.120
pushes ground and excited
state in opposite directions.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:24.540
So therefore, we find
that at the Rabi frequency

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:28.067
of the coupling laser
divided by gamma over 2.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:42.870
The name of this feature is
the two photon Raman resonance

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:53.080
plus the AC Stark shift,
which actually means

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.205
it's a four photon process.

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:04.958
The question is now, where is
the electromagnetically induced

00:55:04.958 --> 00:55:05.500
transparency?

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.780
We have introduced now
specifically the absorption

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:15.580
feature.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.780
We have identified a one
photon absorption feature

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.370
plus AC Stark shift, a
two photon absorption

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:25.330
feature plus AC Stark shift,
but where is electromagnetically

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:26.330
introduced transparency?

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:33.810
Here.

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:36.700
Electromagnetically
induced transparency

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.860
is always at delta equals 0.

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:46.850
You have to fulfill
the Raman resonance,

00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:51.250
and this resonance is not
affected by any AC Stark shift.

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:53.880
It's always at delta equals 0.

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.610
So therefore, what that means
is you have two absorption

00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:01.210
features, and you would think
these are two Lorentzians,

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:16.843
but they interfere and they go
to exactly 0 at delta equals 0,

00:56:16.843 --> 00:56:18.010
and this is our EIT feature.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:28.540
So there is an interference
effect between a broad feature

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.140
and a narrow
feature, and this is

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:37.200
found in many different
parts of spectroscopy,

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.270
but you also find it
in nuclear physics

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:41.960
whenever you have a
narrow feature embedded

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.480
into continuum.

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:47.880
What we have here is a narrow
feature and a broader feature,

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:49.590
but a narrow feature
and something

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:53.360
which is broader or continuum
is called a Fano resonance.

00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:00.660
You actually have
the same situation

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:04.877
when you look at
scattering of atoms.

00:57:04.877 --> 00:57:06.960
Many of you are familiar
with Feshbach resonances.

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:10.720
Well, a lot of people call
it Fano Feshbach resonance,

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:15.040
and what you have in a Fano
Feshbach resonance is two atoms

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.810
can scatter off each other.

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:18.650
This is the continuum.

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:20.820
This would be your
broad feature.

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:24.450
But then they can also scatter
through a molecular state,

00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:26.730
and this is a narrow feature.

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:29.770
And what we've identified
now for electromagnetically

00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:32.810
induced transparency
are the two features.

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:34.670
One is the single
photon absorption,

00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:36.390
one is the Ramon resonance.

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:39.400
But in general, the concept
is much more general.

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:43.870
You have a narrow feature,
you have a broader feature.

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:46.110
It's responsible for
scattering two atoms

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:48.510
or it's responsible for
scattering a photon,

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:51.300
and once the photon or the
atoms have been scattered,

00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:54.430
you have no way of telling
which intermediate state was

00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:55.310
involved.

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:57.630
And therefore, you
get interference.

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:00.930
And what I just said,
what is EIT for light

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:03.780
is the zero crossing
of a scattering length

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.470
that the atoms do not
scatter off each other

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:10.360
because the two different
processes completely

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.560
destructively interfere.

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:19.350
So what I've shown here is
two Lorentzian, two absorption

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.570
features.

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:30.720
Let me know re-plot it and
plot the index of refraction

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:31.610
minus 1.

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:40.590
Here was EIT, zero detuning.

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:44.340
We have a sharp feature here
at the two photon resonance,

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:48.430
we have a broad feature here
at the single photon resonance,

00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:56.670
and if I now transform
the Lorentzian

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:58.870
into a dispersive feature.

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:03.860
I use freehand, so this
is a dispersive feature

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.680
for the broad transition.

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.510
The narrow transition
has a much, much sharper

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:14.360
dispersive feature,
and the important part

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:28.800
is now at the EIT,
at the detuning delta

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.250
is zero where we have
electromagnetically

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:35.370
induced transparency, we
have an index of refraction

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:41.750
which is exactly one
because it's a dark state,

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:44.810
you have no absorption, you
have no light scattering,

00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:47.170
you have no reaction
to the light.

00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:50.560
And therefore, the index of
refraction of the material

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:53.174
is like the index of
refraction of the vacuum.

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.830
So you have n equals 1.

00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:02.760
It looks like a vacuum in
terms of index of refraction.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.440
It looks like a vacuum because
you have no absorption.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:12.200
But what you have is you
have a large derivative

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.890
of the index of refraction
with the frequency detuning,

01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:18.880
and that affects, and that's
what I want to tell you now,

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.776
the group velocity of light.

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:28.170
So anyway, this is maybe as
far as I want to push it,

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:30.780
and I was actually wondering
if this is a little bit too

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.780
complicated to present in class.

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:35.160
But on the other hand,
I think it sort of also

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.000
wraps up the course.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.230
We have a three
level system, and we

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:43.812
find a lot of things we have
studied separately before--

01:00:43.812 --> 01:00:47.910
two photon Raman feature,
single photon light scattering--

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:50.360
but now they act
together and they

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.520
interfere and have
this additional feature

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.670
of electromagnetically
induced transparency.

01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:57.338
Colin?

01:00:57.338 --> 01:01:02.218
STUDENT: So the way you drew the
level diagram, the f, I think,

01:01:02.218 --> 01:01:03.682
[INAUDIBLE] state [INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:09.940
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:22.550
Actually, I emphasized that
we have an AC Stark shift,

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:25.085
and what I didn't say
when I discussed it here

01:01:25.085 --> 01:01:28.610
that the AC Stark shift
pushes this level down

01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:30.820
and pushes the other level up.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:34.070
But since we are talking
about a very broad resonance

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:37.150
in the excited state, for
all practical matters,

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:39.095
the AC Stark shift
doesn't matter,

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:41.010
whereas for the narrow
Raman resonance,

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:43.760
the AC Stark shift is important.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.210
STUDENT: Also, you
showed on the plot

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:52.760
that the shift of the
excited state [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.370
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:55.090
Thanks.

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:57.880
So the AC Stark shift
for that detuning

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:03.820
would shift this level up and
would shift this level down.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.540
What's the second question?

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.480
STUDENT: You drew on the plot--

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.536
PROFESSOR: This one?

01:02:10.536 --> 01:02:12.012
STUDENT: That one.

01:02:12.012 --> 01:02:14.472
That the shift of
the excited state

01:02:14.472 --> 01:02:18.900
was much higher than the
shift of the ground state.

01:02:21.853 --> 01:02:23.395
PROFESSOR: You mean
those two shifts?

01:02:23.395 --> 01:02:23.978
STUDENT: Yeah.

01:02:29.135 --> 01:02:31.010
PROFESSOR: We have to
now do the bookkeeping.

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:37.470
We have assumed that
the coupling laser has

01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:39.400
a large detuning,
the coupling laser

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.510
is very far away from resonance.

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:45.400
And if you want to
hit the excited state,

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.990
we know we need a Raman
resonance, which is delta 2,

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:52.580
but the Raman resonance,
capital delta 2,

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:55.670
means that we are smack
on the single photon

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:57.500
resonance for the probe laser.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.405
So this feature is pretty
much we take the ground state

01:03:00.405 --> 01:03:05.010
and go exactly to the excited
state with a single photon.

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:06.650
There is an AC
Stark shift involved

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:10.370
but it's not relevant here,
whereas the other feature is

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:13.680
the two photon Raman feature.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.520
And the one thing I wanted
to point out in this context

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:21.390
is that there is
actually a small energy

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:25.820
splitting between the two photon
Raman feature by the AC Stark

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.510
effect, whereas the
EIT feature always

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:31.190
happens at Raman
resonance delta equals 0.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.140
Because, just to
emphasize that, delta

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:46.570
equals 0 is really you induce
a coherence between g and f.

01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:48.490
It's a dark state,
and when you have

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.390
a dark state in
that situation, you

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:53.000
don't have an AC Stark effect.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.470
So the EIT feature
is at delta equals 0,

01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:59.870
whereas the photon scattering
features, they suffer,

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.870
or they experience--

01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:04.140
it may not be negative to
suffer an AC Stark shift,

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.868
but they experience
an AC Stark shift.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.140
Further questions?

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:10.670
Yes?

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:13.000
STUDENT: Can we
somehow relate this

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.740
to Doppler free spectroscopy?

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.990
PROFESSOR: Can we relate that
to Doppler free spectroscopy?

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:24.760
Actually, I don't
think so because I

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:28.402
would say for the
whole discussion here,

01:04:28.402 --> 01:04:30.860
let's assume we have an atom
which has infinite mass, which

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.300
is not moving at all.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:36.310
We're really talking
about internal coherences.

01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:41.540
However, and that's
where it becomes related,

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.860
if you look at very,
very narrow features

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.320
as a function of detuning
then, of course, Doppler shifts

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.900
play a role, and if you
have very, very, very

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:56.710
narrow features, you become
sensitive to very, very, very

01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:59.290
small velocities,
and therefore, you

01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:01.950
have an opportunity to cool.

01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:05.080
So if you can distinguish
spectroscopically

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.770
an atom which moves a tiny
little bit and an atom which

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:10.780
stands still, if you
can, by a narrow line,

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.920
distinguish the two,
then you can actually

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.630
laser cool this atom.

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:21.170
The EIT feature can give you
extremely high resolution.

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:23.090
I'm not discussing it here.

01:05:23.090 --> 01:05:25.600
I've discussed the
phenomenon of EIT, which is

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.590
coherent population trapping.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:34.810
But there is an extension, which
is VSCPT, Velocity Selective

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:39.880
Coherent Population Trapping,
and VSCPT was a powerful method

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.300
to cool atoms below
the recoil limit,

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:48.070
but I've not connected anything
of coherent population trapping

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.080
with the Doppler shift.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.300
So for all this
discussion, please

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:56.223
assume the atom is not moving.

01:05:56.223 --> 01:05:56.890
Other questions?

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:10.810
Then let me just say a
few words about the fact

01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:18.850
that we have a large derivative
of the index of refraction,

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:33.350
and this, of course,
is used for generating

01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:34.670
what is called slow light.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:47.000
The group velocity of light
is the speed of light,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.290
but then it has a
denominator which

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:52.002
is the derivative of
the index of refraction

01:06:52.002 --> 01:06:53.085
with respect to frequency.

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:05.240
Towards the end of
the last century,

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:10.110
there were predictions that
electromagnetically induced

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:18.370
transparency would give you
very sharp features which can

01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:20.980
be used for very slow light.

01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:30.770
And what eventually triggered
major developments in the field

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:38.230
was this landmark
paper by Lene Hau where

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:41.410
she used the Bose-Einstein
condensate to eliminate

01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:43.290
all kinds of Doppler broadening.

01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:45.290
There are other tricks
how you can eliminate it,

01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:47.260
but this was the
most powerful way

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.850
to just take a Bose-Einstein
condensate where

01:07:49.850 --> 01:08:00.880
atoms have no thermal velocity
and, in this research,

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.970
she was able to show
that light propagated

01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:05.680
at the speed of a bicycle.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.020
So it was a dramatic reduction
of the speed of light,

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.740
and this showed the
true potential of EIT.

01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:13.240
There have been
other demonstrations

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.940
before where light has been
slowed by a factor of 100

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.340
or a few hundred,
but eventually,

01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:21.740
combining that with a
Doppler-less feature

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:25.010
because the atoms
don't move in a BEC

01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:26.790
created a dramatic effect.

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:38.430
So we have now two
ways how we can get

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:40.660
a large derivative, dn d omega.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.819
I've discussed here
the general case

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:47.800
that we have a narrow feature,
a broad feature, because we

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:55.750
have the coupling light
detuned from the excited state,

01:08:55.750 --> 01:09:07.810
but let me just point out that
even if you have the coupling

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:15.680
light on resonance, depends
what you really want,

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:23.410
but you can get an even
stronger feature in the index

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:24.804
of refraction versus frequency.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:34.174
This is now the situation where
we have the strong absorption

01:09:34.174 --> 01:09:40.670
feature, but then we
have the EIT window.

01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:44.760
So we have this superposition
of a positive Lorentzian

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.109
and a negative
Lorentzian, and if I now

01:09:48.109 --> 01:09:55.490
run it through my
Kramers-Kronig calculator

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.700
and I take the
dispersive shape, I

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:01.780
can sort of do it for the
broad feature in this way

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.460
and for the narrow
feature in this way,

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:07.760
and now you have
to add up the two.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.270
And what you realize
is at this point,

01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:21.390
you have a huge dn d omega.

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:24.340
What I'm plotting here is on
the left side, the absorption

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:28.290
of the Lorentzian, and you
can regard this sharp notch

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.040
as a second Lorentzian.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.440
So you have the positive
Lorentzian, negative

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.190
Lorentzian, and then you
take the dispersive features

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.680
and you add them up
with the correct sign.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:44.180
So whether you're realizing now
for quite a general situation

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:48.030
where you have single photon
detuning, which I discussed

01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:51.160
before, or whether you're on
the single photon resonance,

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.550
you can have extremely
sharp features.

01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:03.630
So now you can take
it to the next level.

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:06.970
You have a light pulse
which enters a medium,

01:11:06.970 --> 01:11:12.780
and now the light pulse slowly
moves through the medium.

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:17.760
But while the light pulse
moves through the medium,

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.894
you reduce the strength
of the coupling laser.

01:11:24.212 --> 01:11:25.160
What happens?

01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:32.380
So you do now an adiabatic
change of your system.

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:40.840
You do an adiabatic change
of the control field

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:55.020
omega 2 while the probe
pulse is in the medium.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:12:04.430
Well, that means that under
idealized assumptions which

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:06.810
we've discussed, this
feature gets narrower

01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:08.800
and narrower and narrower.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.850
If omega 2 goes to 0, the
strength of the control field,

01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:17.250
this feature becomes
infinitesimally narrow.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:21.480
And therefore, this feature
becomes infinitely sharp,

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:27.440
and that means that the
group velocity goes to zero.

01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:35.950
This is now in
the popular press,

01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:44.510
it's called stopped
light or frozen light

01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:46.960
because the light has
come to a standstill.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:54.450
What really happens
is the following.

01:12:54.450 --> 01:13:06.480
We have our coupling
laser, omega 2,

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.600
and we have our
probe laser, omega 1.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:19.370
When we do what I just said is
that omega 2 goes through zero,

01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:26.840
then the dark state originally,
for very strong omega 2,

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:33.590
remember the dark state was g?

01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:35.800
But now if we let
omega 2 go to zero,

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.280
the dark state will become f.

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:50.990
And that means that in a way,
every photon in the probe pulse

01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:55.820
has now pumped an atom from
g through two photon Raman

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:57.940
process into f.

01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:00.650
So therefore, what it
means to stop light

01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:05.710
or to freeze light means simply
that the photons of the laser

01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:11.860
have turned into an atomic
excitation where the excitation

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.270
is now the state, f.

01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:17.560
In other words, you
have written the photon.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.570
The photon has now put the
atom into a different hyperfine

01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:21.070
state.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.750
So if this is done
adiabatically,

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:30.400
and I can't do full
justice in this course,

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.420
but this means that
the light is coherently

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:52.760
converted into the atomic--

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.580
when I say "coherently"
say "into population," I

01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:01.940
mean all the quantum
phases, everything which

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:06.470
was in the quantum nature of the
light has now been converted,

01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:08.450
has been written
into the state, f.

01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:17.720
This is often called, because
g and f are hyperfine states,

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.880
this means that
you have coherently

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.870
converted the photon or
the electromagnetic wave

01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:30.030
in the probe beam into
a spin wave or a magnon.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:40.910
Anyway, I just want to
show you the analogy.

01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:45.440
The fact that you can put the
quantum information of light

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.930
into an atomic state
and back and forth,

01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:52.140
we've discussed that when we
had the situation of cavity QED.

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:55.840
We prepared a superposition
of ground and excited state

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.640
and exactly the same quantum
state which we had in the atom

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.950
we later found in the
cavity as a superposition

01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:06.250
of the zero photon and
the one photon state.

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:10.390
So from those general concepts,
it should be clear to you

01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:13.130
that it is possible
to coherently

01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:17.330
transform a quantum
state from light to atoms

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:19.950
and back to light.

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:22.300
And here you see the
different realization.

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:28.530
We have a quantum state of
the photon in the probe laser,

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:31.780
and we can now describe
the excitations

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:37.340
in the system in a
parametrized way.

01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:43.650
What it means is for
the strong probe laser,

01:16:43.650 --> 01:16:48.120
for the strong coupling laser,
the excitation in the system

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:51.550
travels as a photon
in the field one,

01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:56.810
but when you reduce the
coupling in the coupling laser,

01:16:56.810 --> 01:17:01.650
the excitation becomes
less and less photon-like.

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:06.520
It becomes more and more
magnon-like, spin wave like.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:09.230
And the moment you reduce the
power in the coupling laser

01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:12.370
to zero, what used
to be an excitation

01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:16.330
in the electromagnetic field has
now been termed adiabatically

01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:20.015
into a spin excitation.

01:17:20.015 --> 01:17:23.660
Coherence has been written
into the hyperfine states

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.629
or your atoms, g and f.

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.900
All this is done coherently,
and therefore reversibly.

01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:50.500
You can read out the information
by simply time reversing

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.480
the process.

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.570
You ramp up again
the coupling laser,

01:17:55.570 --> 01:18:00.170
and that adiabatically turns
the spin excitation back

01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:02.580
into an excitation of the
electromagnetic field.

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:11.520
Any questions?

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:22.600
Well, we have
three minutes left,

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.770
but I'm not getting
started with superradiance.

01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:28.070
We have one more
topic left, and this

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:31.610
will be the topic on
Wednesday, decay superradiance,

01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:36.620
and this is when we discuss the
phenomenon of coherence where

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:42.100
we have coherence not only in
one atom between two or three

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:42.890
levels.

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:45.040
We will then
discuss on Wednesday

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.280
if we have coherence
between many atoms,

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.480
and this at the heart
of superradiance.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:51.980
OK.

01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:54.130
See you on Wednesday.
