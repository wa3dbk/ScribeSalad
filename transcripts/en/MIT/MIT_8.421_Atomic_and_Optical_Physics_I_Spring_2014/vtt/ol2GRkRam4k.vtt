00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.531
PROFESSOR: Then let's talk
about exciting physics, the Lamb

00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:24.030
shift.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.170
So we discussed the
Lamb shift last Friday,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.570
and the Lamb shift is
really due to the fact

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.780
that, if you have
a atom consisting

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.600
of an electron, a Coulomb
field, and the proton,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.820
this is not the
complete description.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.040
The atom lives in a
vacuum, and the vacuum

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.010
is filled with
electromagnetic waves.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.070
So what we have to include,
for an accurate description

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.050
of atomic level
structure, is the coupling

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.390
of the atomic system, of the
electron, to all of the modes

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.350
the electromagnetic field,
and this is radiation.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.480
We will talk about the quantized
electromagnetic field later,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.230
at this point I
could introduce you

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.810
to a simple model, fairly
accurate model of the Lamb

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.190
shift, by simply
assuming, and that's

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.280
what we did on Friday,
that we have fluctuating

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.200
electric fields, those
fluctuating electric fields

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.310
shake, accelerate, the
electron and the electron

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.590
performs some oscillatory motion
and this oscillatory motion

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.890
leads to an ever reaching
of the Coulomb potential.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:56.820
And similarly what we
saw for the Darwin term,

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.580
this ever reaching of
the Coulomb potential

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.750
takes away this singularity
of the Coulomb potential

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.850
and therefore lowers the
binding energy of the electron.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.190
So today I want to just say a
few more words about the result

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.960
we derived, and
then we have done

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.900
what happens to an electron in
a Coulomb field plus radiation.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.770
The next thing is, then, to
discuss hyperfine structure.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.890
So let me first make
one comment, when

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.550
we integrated over all modes of
the electromagnetic spectrum,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.580
we needed an upper
cutoff, and a lower

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.040
cutoff due to logarithmic
singularities.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.410
Eventually, an upper cutoff
is relativistic rest mass

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.870
of the electron we
have to cut off things.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.150
I just want to say one more
word about the lower cutoff.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.220
I suggested, as a cut
off, the orbital frequency

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.940
of the electron.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.690
So the justification for that
is the following, the electron,

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:15.610
the free electron-- the free
electron, when it's driven,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.420
has an amplitude which is 1
over the frequency squared.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.990
So if you drive it
slower and slower,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.890
it's amplitude
increases because it

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.430
has more time to go
in one direction.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.640
So this divergence at
low frequency, of course,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.900
happens only for
the free system.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.000
When you have a bound system,
like a mnemonic oscillate,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.140
and you drive it at lower
and lower frequency,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.270
the response converges
to a constant

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.550
and not to 1 over high
frequency squared singularity.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.160
So therefore, when we reach the
drive and the high frequencies

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.770
on the order of-- oscillatory
frequency of the bound system,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.800
the behavior changes.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.960
So when we mimic this with
an effect cutoff because what

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.970
you want to get rid of is a
singularity, but in reality,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.870
of course, it should approach
a constant at low frequency,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.890
and that is essentially the
physics of the AC and then

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.110
the DC Stark effect.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:27.853
So that was a rational
for the cutoff

00:04:27.853 --> 00:04:32.610
and let me just
annotate it here.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.690
And let's say, for
a free particle

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.490
we had the situation that the
amplitude was proportional to 1

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.390
over the high frequency.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.750
Whereas four bound
particle is, you

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.679
should approach a constant
for low frequencies.

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:56.720
And that's what we have
introduced with a cutoff.

00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:02.950
OK.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.040
So we have discussed
the Lamb shift,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.670
but you've already discussed one
contribution to the Lamb shift.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.740
So this was a contribution
that the Coulomb potential

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:27.130
is effectively smeared
out, and the result of this

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.035
is that there is a
weaker binding energy.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:44.555
However, there is a second
contribution to the Lamb shift.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.700
I've sometimes
seen sources where

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.170
this is discussed as the main
contribution to the Lamb shift,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.710
but this is not correct.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.800
This is only 3% off the total
and contributes 27 megahertz.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.460
This is what is called
the vacuum polarization.

00:06:18.452 --> 00:06:28.570
So if you have a-- the
proton positive charge

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.460
and you have the electron, and
they scatter off each other,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:40.230
and we use this kind of
diagram to indicate that,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.060
now that there is an
additional diagram which

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.120
has this bubble which is
this production of e minus

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.100
and e plus pairs.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.420
And you can say that if an
electron and proton attract

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:03.180
each other and you create,
by virtual pair production--

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.940
because the vacuum
is alive, things

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.850
can happen in the
vacuum-- it will virutally

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.810
[INAUDIBLE] electron
positron pair that now you

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.970
create electron positron pairs,
which shield the Coulomb field.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.960
And this is a
second contribution

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.300
in addition to the shaking
motion of the electron.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.880
So I want you to just think
about it for 10 seconds

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.700
before I tell you the answer.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:33.870
Does this vacuum polarization
strengthen or weaken

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.670
the binding energy?

00:07:43.946 --> 00:07:45.320
Anybody want to
offer an opinion?

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.465
Whatever you say,
you can't be wrong

00:07:51.465 --> 00:07:53.423
because there are to
aspects to the answers so.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.240
Well then the actual
answer is you would say,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.290
if you have charged--
if you create charges

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.140
between the electron
and the proton,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.100
you have a shielding effect
and the shielding effect

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.270
should weaken the Coulomb field.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.110
But the question is,
what do we regard

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.180
as the elementary charge, e,
in our Schrodinger equation.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.645
And what we regard
as the charge, what

00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:23.530
is measured in a Millikan
Droplet experiment,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.250
is already the shielded charge.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.330
So therefore, the fact
that vacuum polarization

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.000
exists means we always
measure the shielded charge,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.970
but because vacuum polarization
happens at a finite distance,

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.419
the electron, in an s state,
can sort of penetrate the shield

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.980
and feel a somewhat
stronger Coulomb potential.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.930
So therefore,
accounting for the fact

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.720
that we have these
virtual electron

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.906
positron pairs actually
means that the binding energy

00:08:53.906 --> 00:08:57.350
is increased and the
vacuum polarization

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.480
has the opposite sign
as the dominant effect

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.480
we've mentioned earlier.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:20.910
So the sum of e is, we observe
the shielded charge and vacuum

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:29.620
polarization implies that
the s electron can penetrate

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.375
the shield and sees
a higher charge.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.910
So we normally observe
the shielded charge,

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.000
but the electron can
see the higher charge.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.740
So therefore, that means, now,
that we have, not an upshift

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:58.060
in energy, but a downshift in
energy for-- which for the two

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:03.860
is one half state,
is 27 megahertz,

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.060
as I mentioned earlier.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.290
Anyway, I'm not
really deriving it,

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:16.500
but I want to sort of uncover
certain myths, so the vacuum

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.240
polarization, number one, is
not dominant and number two,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.420
has the opposite sign as
everybody would naively assume.

00:10:25.845 --> 00:10:26.345
Questions?

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.430
I hope not because I don't
know anything more about that.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:34.600
All right.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.160
So we have dealt
with Lamb shift.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.310
So is next now, in revealing
the atomic structure,

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:48.160
is we want to go beyond
the Coulomb field created

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.970
by a point charge.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.380
And that means we want to
address the fact that we don't

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.900
have a point charge,
but we have a nucleolus.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:08.200
And we are discussing, now,
effects of the nucleus, which

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.410
also go by the name
hyperfine structure.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.610
So, just to summarize,
so far we have

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:23.580
treated, in pretty much
complete detail, what

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:30.040
happens for an atom which
consists of a point charge

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.680
and electrons.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.870
But now we want
to bring in that,

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.285
what creates a Coulomb field,
the nucleolus, has structure.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.090
And there are actually
four different ways

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:55.730
how the nucleolus has
structure and contributions

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.580
to observable effects
on the atomic structure

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.700
and atomic energy levels.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.560
The most important one
is that the nucleus

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.010
has a magnetic moment
associated with the angular

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.560
momentum of the nucleus I.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.180
The second contribution is, in
addition to magnetic moment,

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.950
there may be a
quadrupole moment.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.080
And since those effects can
lead to a splitting-- this

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.190
is actually, usually,
called hyperfine structure,

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.030
but then there are
two more effects.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:39.180
One is the nucleus
has finite mass,

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.295
and the nucleus has
a finite volume.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:51.390
Both the mass and volume
effect lead to energy shifts.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.540
But tiny energy shifts
are hard to measure

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.680
unless you have two
different shifts,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.860
and therefore those effects
go as isotope shifts

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.750
because when you
have an atom which

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.850
comes in two
different isotopes you

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.660
find that, due to
those two effects,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.580
the energy levels
are not the same.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.950
So this goes by the
name of isotope shifts.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:23.780
By far the most important
phenomenon is the first one.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.040
The fact that if a nucleus
has angular momentum,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:35.170
we have hyperfine structure,
and for the hydrogen atom

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:41.770
that means that the ground
state, the singlet S 1/2 state,

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:46.760
actually splits into two states
with total angular momentum

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:58.180
quantum number F.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:04.610
So the relevance of
hyperfine splitting

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.870
is, it's actually
a huge relevance,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.390
one is, you don't have a single
ground state of many atoms,

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.435
you have several ground states.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.470
So the lowest electronic state
has several ground states,

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:29.360
has several hyperfine states,
due to angular momentum

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.850
selection, where
you can actually

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.010
talk to them individually, you
can prepare them individually,

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.840
and many of you who do
magnetic trapping know when

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.990
need magnetic trapping
you better prepare

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.110
the atom in a single
hyperfine state,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.700
otherwise you are in trouble.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.790
So you can prepare
individual states.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:57.570
In the old days this was
done by optical pumping,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.500
and you can use several
hyperfine states

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:07.360
to great advantage for
the manipulation of atoms.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.200
For instance, if
you want to, you

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.380
can put atoms into
a hyperfine state

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.610
where they don't absorb
light, and then you

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:20.329
can have resonant light for the
other ones blast those away.

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:22.370
So you can play, sort of,
your tricks because you

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:28.270
have two states between which
you can juggle at the atoms.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:36.360
Well, what else is relevance
of hyperfine structure?

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:42.000
OK if you have two levels,
F equals 1, F equals 0,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.140
you can observe a transition.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.410
And the famous 21
centimeter line

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.335
is used for astronomical
observations.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.430
Hydrogen is the most abundant
element in the universe,

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.360
and how do you see
hydrogen out there.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.560
Well it is due to hyperfine
transition, the 21 centimeter

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.970
line.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:16.780
And finally, another aspect
why hyperfine structure

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.930
is relevant, where
people use it,

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.970
is for the determination
of nuclear properties.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.890
How do you know what the
properties of nuclei are?

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.540
Well there are techniques
in nuclear physics,

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.060
but a lot, a lot about
the knowledge of nuclei

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.440
comes from atomic spectroscopy.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.480
If you measure atomic energy
levels with high accuracy,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.320
you figure out what the
properties of the nucleus is,

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.730
and one of the most outstanding
examples we will discuss later

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.800
on, and some of which is also
on your homework assignment,

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.390
is you can use atomic
spectroscopy of hydrogen

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.350
to contain the most
accurate measurement, how

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.820
big is the proton.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.260
And the big surprise is that
there is, that there was,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.060
a surprise that
people figured out

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:09.050
that, until now, even
in 2014, we do not fully

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.869
understand how big the
proton is but we'll

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:12.930
talk about that later.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.119
So for the level of this-- the
level of this introduction,

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:27.930
we can use it for determination
of nuclear properties

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.910
and actually, you cannot only
determine properties of stable

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.370
nuclei, you can also determine
properties of unstable nuclei.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:40.340
At various accelerators,
they have a facility

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.330
when, by, you know,
energy collisions

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.050
they create unstable nuclei.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:52.490
Maybe helium six, helium
with four newtons, it exists.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:57.129
And you can take helium
six, extract it, utilize it

00:17:57.129 --> 00:17:58.670
and then you've have
a neutral helium

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.960
atom which looks like your
every days helium atom

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.270
but it has two more
neutrons in the nucleus.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.860
And by performing
atomic spectroscopy,

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.320
you can figure out what
is the deformation, what

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:14.780
is the structure, of this--
I want to say alpha particle,

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.420
but it's an alpha particle
plus two neutrons.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.440
So people have really learned
to do those atomic physics

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.910
measurements within
a few seconds

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.030
after the element
has been produced,

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.600
and such determined
nuclear properties even

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.530
of unstable nuclei.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.610
OK.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:45.980
So that's my introduction.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:54.780
So we are now discussing
the most important effect

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.050
due to the hyperfine structure.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:02.190
And this is the fact
that the nucleolus has

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:07.040
a magnetic moment, and
this magnetic moment

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.370
couples to the
magnetic field even

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.610
if you don't apply an
external magnetic field,

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.660
we talked about that
on Wednesday, there

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.090
is an internal
magnetic field created

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:26.250
by the electron with total
angular momentum change.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.450
So this is, so to speak,
the Zeeman Hamiltonian

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:35.280
of the nucleus in the magnetic
field created by the electron.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.280
And I will show you quickly
to, is a simple derivation,

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.240
what the result of that is.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.740
But before I do that, I
also want to mention out--

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.600
mention that there is--
I want to point out

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.830
that there is an alternative.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:56.290
Right now, I said we say
the nucleus experiences

00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:00.620
the magnetic field
created by the electron.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.870
But we can also take
the other approach,

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.750
the nucleus creates a
vector potential because

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.690
of its magnetic moment,
and the electron,

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.280
which goes around the
nucleus, is not only

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.760
feeling the Coulomb
potential but also

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.920
feeling a vector potential.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.910
And of course, both
different perspectives,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:21.580
whether the electron moves in
the magnetic field the nucleus,

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.520
or the nucleus experiences the
magnetic field of the electron,

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.130
both treatments have to agree.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.530
I follow the more
standard treatment,

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:38.230
but the alternative treatment,
where the electron moves

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.940
in this electric and magnetic
potential of the nucleus,

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.770
is fully elaborated on
the atomic physics wiki.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:51.870
So alternatively, electron
moves in the potential

00:20:51.870 --> 00:21:02.720
of the nucleus, which is
the Coulomb potential,

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.750
we've discussed that,
but then there is also

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:10.775
vector potential created by the
magnetic moment of the nucleus.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.090
So you simply assume this
is a potential created

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.000
with a nucleus,
and then you just

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.120
sort of Schrodinger's
equation and this approach

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.960
is carried out on the wiki.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.580
However, since it's a
little bit more standard,

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.410
and there's an easy
semi-classical derivation,

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.330
let me now discuss this one.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.590
Because what I
like about it is it

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.090
addresses one intuitive
quantity, namely the fact

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.635
that there is an
internal magnetic field.

00:21:49.635 --> 00:21:51.510
We're not just using
the Schrodinger equation

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.968
for the whole
system, we are really

00:21:52.968 --> 00:21:55.720
estimating what is the
magnetic field, which

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.228
the electron creates, at
the position of the nucleus.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:13.090
So let's now do a
semi-classical derivation

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.040
of this internal magnetic field.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.810
And I have to-- I will
immediately tell you,

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.370
this derivation
agrees quantitatively

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:28.760
with the fully
thermomechanical treatment.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:35.710
So, as often as these
semi-classical derivations,

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.240
we have to separate two parts.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.600
There are two ways how
the electron creates

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.630
a magnetic field at the nucleus.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.810
One is due to it's
orbital motion,

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.510
the electron is a ring current
and creates a magnetic field,

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:57.800
but then the electron has
magnetic moment for-- due

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.560
to it's spin.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:18.110
The spin part is simply the
potential of a magnetic dipole,

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:24.440
you will need to vector--
you will need to vector where

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:30.490
the magnetic dipole
moment of the electron

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.630
is proportional to it's
spin with a g factor.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:41.920
However, and you can find
that in all textbooks

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.820
on classical
electrodynamics but, there

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.910
is one important term
which we have to add here,

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.500
which is also part
of classical E and M,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:57.560
and this is the delta
function contribution.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.830
You've probably seen it,
you find it in Jackson,

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.190
if you haven't the
model is that you

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.440
can assume that a
magnetic moment is created

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.880
by ring current,
and the ring current

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.490
has-- creates a
magnetic moment and you

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.580
have the dipole potentially
due to the magnetic moment.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.760
However, if you
have a ring current,

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.570
there is-- you
can also ask, what

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:27.160
is the magnetic field
inside the current loop

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.350
and then eventually do
the transition where

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.320
you allow the current
loop to go to 0.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.090
That's how you make a point
model of a magnetic dipole,

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.770
but what remains is, sorts
of-- as a delta function,

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.480
the location inside the loop.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.330
I'm emphasizing it
because it will be,

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.460
eventually, the delta
function contribution,

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.090
which is important
for s electrons,

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.900
and therefore it is
this contribution

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.555
which is the dominant
effect in many situations.

00:25:03.071 --> 00:25:03.570
OK.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:07.339
So this is the magnetic
field created--

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.880
it's a classical expression,
but it's buried in [? quantum ?]

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.830
mechanics, the expression for
the magnetic field created

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.150
by the spin.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:22.890
The second contribution is
the orbital contribution,

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:28.500
and for that semi-classical,
we just use Biot-Savat.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.060
So Biot-Savat is usually
the 3-Dimensional integral

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.010
over the current density.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.590
The volume integral,
or you can rewrite it

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:59.380
as the current I, d, r
cross r, over r cubed.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:06.470
And eventually, if you now
put in the electron charge

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:13.670
distribution, velocity
course r, well,

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:18.860
velocity cross r means we
get, and that's what we want,

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.610
the orbital angular momentum.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.680
The 1 over r cubed
term means we have

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.960
to calculate an expectation
value over the wave

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.030
function which,
is 1 over r cubed.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:37.040
And the prefactor
leads us-- it's

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.130
nothing else than two
times the Bohr magenton.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:59.950
So, with those two terms, we can
now obtain our final expression

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.450
for the total magnetic
field generated

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.400
by the electron at the origin.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:11.460
And for that I use
the g factor of two

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.560
as it comes out of Dirac theory.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.120
So now we have the
total magnetic field.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:28.240
We had this contribution
L over r cubed.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.340
If you inspect the dipole
potential of the spin

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:39.310
it has a contribution
S over r cubed,

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:47.920
then it is the
second contribution

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.220
to the dipole potential.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:57.070
And finally, most importantly
for the following discussion,

00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:01.740
the delta function contribution
which I discussed earlier.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:20.250
If you have an s state,
these first terms

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:27.410
are 0 for L equals 0 because
these are, sort of, terms which

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:32.420
have dipole potential
where positive and negative

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.100
contributions cancel out when
you do a spherical average,

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.540
and the s electron performs
a spherical average.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:49.840
So it is 0 for L equals 0
due to the spherical average.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:29:01.940
Whereas the second part, it
would be 0 for L non-equals

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.870
to 0 because the probability
for a non-s electron

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.802
to be at the nucleus is 0.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.014
So pretty much this
describes that.

00:29:16.014 --> 00:29:17.680
So this describes a
hyperfine structure.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:29.520
Well, it describes the magnetic
field created by the electron,

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:36.360
and now we have to do
the usual projection

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.770
in the following way.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:45.790
That the hyperfine structure
is that Zeeman Hamiltonian

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.240
of the internal magnetic
field with a magnetic moment

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:59.050
of the nucleus, and the
magnetic moment of the nucleus

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:04.120
is proportional to the angular
momentum of the nucleus.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.510
Sort of this argument that even
if it were not proportional,

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.460
it would rapidly precess
and eventually project it,

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.090
and the only direction
which survives

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.550
is the direction of
the angular momentum.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.240
And similarly, you can--
the magnetic field,

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.640
you have a contribution
of S and L,

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.610
but S and L rapidly precess
around the result and angular

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.480
momentum, J, and
therefore, as a result,

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.720
the internal magnetic
field must be,

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.550
can only be, parallel to
the angular momentum chain.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.310
If you do a fully
[? quantum ?] treatment,

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.550
it comes out immediately.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.750
But if you do it
semi-classically, you calculate

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.560
a magnetic field, you sort of
have to fall in this argument

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.730
that you always project on
the axis of angular momentum

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:56.706
and that means that the
hyperfine interaction will

00:30:56.706 --> 00:31:00.050
be the Hamiltonian for
it, or the operator,

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:06.450
will be the dot product of
I dot J. For fine structure,

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:11.140
we had L dot S, for hyperfine
structure, we had L dot J,

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.630
this is always how we couple
angular momentum with a dot

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.080
product.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:24.320
The hyperfine constant
cause by the letter

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.830
a, and since historically a is
measured in frequency units,

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:34.530
in Hertz, I have to put
in h, Planck's quantum.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.150
No it's not h bar.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.760
For historical reasons, it's h.

00:31:43.896 --> 00:31:44.860
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:45.725
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:31:45.725 --> 00:31:47.224
AUDIENCE: Are I and
J dimensionless,

00:31:47.224 --> 00:31:49.679
or will they carry
units in h bar?

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.130
PROFESSOR: Here they
are dimensionless,

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.320
thanks for the question, because
each is in frequency units,

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.140
it's in Hertz, and if
you multiple with h

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.860
you have an energy.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.330
So therefore, I and J
measure the angular momentum

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.150
in unit of h bar.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.390
So it's not in that sense, it's
a normalized angular momentum

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.470
operator.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:18.580
The quantum numbers of I and
J are not 1/2, or 1h bar,

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.279
it's just 1/2 or 1.

00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:22.945
Other questions?

00:32:28.431 --> 00:32:28.930
OK.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:34.820
I can now take this expression
with, you know, L and S

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.650
and S.r and evaluate
further, but I

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.350
feel I'm not
providing any insight

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:43.600
and you can read
about it on the wiki.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:51.350
So for a non-s state, how
to simplify this expression

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:55.650
and get the final textbook
result, I defer to the wiki.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:33:00.730
I want to discuss the most
important part, namely for s v

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.210
electrons because hydrogen,
all the alkaloids,

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:05.660
have an s ground state.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:15.990
So, in that case, all we have to
consider is the delta function

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:21.750
part and if we project
the magnetic field

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:31.570
onto the angular
momentum axis, we

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:37.925
get the probability of the s
electron to be at the origin.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:54.060
And therefore, for s states,
the hyperfine constant

00:33:54.060 --> 00:34:06.130
is-- oh, I forgot one thing.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:11.889
We have to parametrize the
magnetic moment of the nucleus,

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:17.420
and that is done by using
a nuclear magnetron.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.620
It's the same as a
Bhor magneton, where

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:26.520
you have replaced the electron
mass by the proton mass,

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.250
and you have the
nuclear g factor.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:33.620
Just as a reminder, the g
factor of the proton is 5.6,

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.600
the g factor of the
neutron is minus 3.8.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.290
So the g factor has nothing
to do, not even close,

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:43.920
to the factor of 2, which we
obtained in the Dirac equation

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.030
for the electron.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:49.389
That just shows that the
nucleons, protons and neutrons,

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.889
are more complicated.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.080
Well, they have
quarks inside, they

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.780
have a complicated
internal structure.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:58.590
OK.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:03.930
So therefore the hyperfine
constant involves,

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:08.890
now, the g factor
of the nucleus,

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:12.580
the product of the
nuclear magnetron,

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:22.530
with a Bohr magneton,
and for hydrogen.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:43.680
This gives the famous
result of 1420 megahertz.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.670
So this is hydrogen, and this
h is now the Hamiltonian.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.900
So the hyperfine coupling
Hamiltonian, which has I

00:35:50.900 --> 00:36:02.730
dot J, by using the expression
for the total angular momentum

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:08.990
I plus J and then we square it.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.850
When you evaluate
this square you get,

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:19.010
on the right hand side,
an expression for I dot J.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:23.920
So I dot J is nothing
else than 1/2.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:32.050
F squared, minus I
squared, minus J squared.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:43.950
And therefore, for hydrogen,
where I, J and S are all 1/2,

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.970
the proton has been
1/2, the electron

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.730
has been 1/2, that's it.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:53.790
You have only two values of
the result and total angular

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:59.400
momentum, 1/2 and 1/2
can add up to 1 or 0.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:13.130
And now the hyperfine
splitting is into an F equals 1

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:17.070
and F equals 0 state.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:21.630
And one thing to remember is,
if you inspect the above formula

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:25.110
with the [? quantum ?]
numbers you find immediately

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:34.530
that, compared to
the degenerate line,

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:37.220
without hyperfine
splitting, this--

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:44.030
so what comes out of
the Dirac equation,

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:53.890
the splitting is the
fight-- is 1/4 and 3/4

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.770
of the hyperfine constant.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:01.040
Since F equals 1 has a
multiplicity of 3, 2 and F

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.860
quantum numbers,
plus minus 1 and 0,

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:09.640
the rule is that the center
of mass of this level

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.595
does not change due to
hyperfine splitting.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:24.160
So the center of mass
of hyperfine states

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.990
is not changing.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.500
So we introduce a
level splitting,

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.860
but no overall shift.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:44.950
Any questions about magnetic
hyperfine structure?

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:45.450
Yes?

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.200
AUDIENCE: Would you explain
again the center of mass

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:48.940
is not changing.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.740
Is this just for hydrogen?

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.090
Or is this a general rule?

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:53.920
PROFESSOR: No, this
is a general property,

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.330
and you could actually
show that when you evaluate

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:00.130
the product of I dot
J. So, the product of I

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:05.270
dot J means that for arbitrary
I and arbitrary J, if you

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.980
calculate the hyperfine
structure, the center of mass

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:08.560
is the same.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:14.980
OK.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:26.400
I've not done any
experiment in my life

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:33.260
where higher order
moments became important,

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:37.240
but I want to teach you about
it because the discussion

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.970
about whether those
higher moments exist

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:42.360
or not is really an interesting
discussion about what

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.580
is allowed by symmetry
and what's not.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.490
So I'm bringing in
a higher moments,

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:51.990
not so much because you need
it to understand the level

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:53.910
structure of your
favourite atom,

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:58.510
but because it teaches us a
really nice piece of physics.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:03.310
So let me now discuss higher
order moments and the leading

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.960
one is the electric
quadripole moment.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.810
So I want to raise, in
general, the question,

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:14.190
what further moments
can a nucleus have.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:19.120
What we have discussed so far
is the magnetic moment, mu.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:39.290
So beyond mu, what further
electric or magnetic moments

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:42.250
can a nucleus have?

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:46.780
Well, it's a question
about symmetry

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:58.410
and if you look at the
parity of multiples,

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:05.790
if you have an electric
multiple-- well,

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:09.300
you know if you have a dipole,
plus minus, you invert it,

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.460
the dipole becomes
minus the dipole.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:17.070
So for L equals 1, it
is minus 1, L is 1,

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.200
but in general
the it is minus L.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.030
If you have a quadripole, you
invert your coordinate system.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:25.780
It's L equals 2, plus
plus, minus minus,

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.735
you invert it nothing changes.

00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:29.860
So these I've shown you,
for dipole and quadripole,

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.040
that this formula is correct.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.630
So an electric multiple
has this parity,

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:41.990
and for, magnetic
keys-- now, you

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:46.310
know, magnetic we have axial
vectors versus polar vectors,

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:49.150
there's always an extra
factor of minus 1.

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:57.390
So therefore if you go magnetic,
magnetic multiples with L

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:59.410
have a parity of minus L plus 1.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:08.120
So this really restricts
what multiples are possible.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.020
Instead of giving you
a general discussion,

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:16.160
let me just look at the
very important keys.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.210
Whether a magnet with a nucleus
can have a electric dipole

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.430
moment, and you will immediately
see what it needs to-- and then

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:26.610
I give you a general result.

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:39.710
So let's assume a nucleus
has angular momentum I,

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:48.080
and there is a magnetic
moment, mu associated with it.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:43:02.100
So the general result is
that odd electric and even

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:18.010
magnetic multiple moments
would violate not just one,

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:28.410
but two symmetries, would
violate parity and time

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:32.055
reversal symmetry.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.920
So the argument goes as follows.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.450
Let us assume this is
the magnetic moment, mu

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.930
or the angular momentum
I, it's a vector.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:52.590
And now we are asking,
is it possible to have

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:56.560
a vector of the dipole moment.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.820
And dipole moment, you
should just think about it

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.795
as a plus minus
charge, separated.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.280
We can now do the parity
operation and the time reversal

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.590
operation.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.900
If you do the time
reversal operation,

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.120
the current, which
generates a magnetic moment

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.420
if you want to think
about it in this picture,

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.680
goes the other way.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.920
So mu flips but nothing
moves, of course,

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.880
for an electric dipole
moment, so reversing time

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.120
is not changing anything.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.410
So in other words,
time reversal symmetry

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:36.670
transforms parallel mu and d
into anti-parallel mu and d.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:41.830
And similar, parity
is not changing mu

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.250
but it is changing d.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:50.420
So in both cases, would parity,
or time reversal symmetry,

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:55.640
if you had mu-d, a
scalar product of mu

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:10.970
and d which would be
known 0, then both P or P

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:14.330
would change the sign.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:18.150
But that would mean that two
kinds of particles would exist,

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:21.330
one where the sign is positive,
one where the sign is negative.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.290
But we have assumed that we have
1 nucleus and only 1 nucleus

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:27.800
of this kind, so we cannot
have one nucleus which has

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.960
the properties of
having, simultaneously,

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.180
a magnetic and
electric dipole moment.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:42.010
So therefore, we conclude
that mu times d has to be 0.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.440
And if you generalize
this argument,

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:48.820
we have ruled out that
there is an electric dipole

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.820
moment, an odd electric moment.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:55.080
The first, the lowest,
possible electric moment

00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:04.570
is the quadripole moment, so the
leading electric moment is not

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.180
L equals 2, L equals
2, it's not L equals 1,

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:12.560
the dipole, it's L
equals 2 the quadripole.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.080
And of course if you
generalize the argument,

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.340
L equals 4, L equals
6, would be possible

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.940
but those effects
would be very small.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:29.450
Questions so far?

00:46:31.891 --> 00:46:32.390
OK.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:36.470
So we've talked about parity and
time reversal symmetry, which

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:41.190
restricts what kind of magnetic
and electric dipole moments

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:42.940
particles may have.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.650
And maybe in this
context, I should just

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:47.820
mention that John Doyle, Jerry
Gabrielse, and Dave Demille

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:51.420
at Harvard and Yale, they just
published the most accurate

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:56.800
result for the electric
dipole moment of the electron.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.920
They found a bound, which was
more than an order of magnitude

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.550
lower than the best
upper bound before

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.380
and this has really
made headlines.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:11.210
So to measure, accurately,
that the electric dipole

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:14.230
moment vanishes, in this
case of the electron,

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:17.020
but other people do
it also for neutrons,

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.530
is testing fundamental
symmetries.

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.810
In particular, it
tests whether nature

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:24.740
is time reversal invariant.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.070
And the reason why,
until now, everybody

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:35.380
has found that the results
are compatible with 0

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:40.440
is pretty much based on the
argument I just gave you.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:45.140
OK so we have discussed
those fundamental symmetries,

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:52.420
but now I want to discuss
something else related to it.

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:57.350
So let's assume
you have a nucleus,

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:01.150
and I want to discuss with
you, is a minimum requirement

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:04.830
for the nucleus for the
angular momentum of the nucleus

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:13.410
in order to have
a magnetic dipole,

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:26.220
or to have an
electric quadripole.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.700
So let's formulate it
as a quicker question.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:36.160
So here let's assume a is--
it's possible for any nucleus

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.230
no matter what the
angular momentum is.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:46.700
Here, we put in 1/2,
or larger than 1,

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:51.800
and for the electric quadripole
we have the same choices.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.820
So you should decide
if I tell you,

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.010
a nucleolus has a
magnetic dipole.

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.750
Does that imply that
there is a minimum amount

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:03.590
of angular momentum
of the nucleus there?

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.120
And then repeat
the same question

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.286
for the electric quadripole.

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.240
So please tell me your opinion.

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:24.600
So right now, what is
a minimum requirement

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.677
for I, for magnetic dipole,
and if yes, what is it?

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.630
Three, two, one.

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:38.130
Stop.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:53.950
OK, so-- and let's
immediately consider

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.650
the electric quadripole moment.

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:58.170
So this was a majority opinion.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:01.246
I gave this answer for
both of them together.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.870
So the question is, what
is the minimum requirement

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:14.881
for a nucleus to have an
electric quadripole moment.

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:31.680
OK, stop.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.180
Display.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.410
No requirement.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.570
OK.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:43.650
So the majority
onset was a here.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:47.360
So let me to discuss it,
and I know some of you

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.900
will have-- I always get into
heated discussions with it.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:54.410
I actually just had a few
minute discussion with one

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:59.310
of my colleagues about
it, who at least wanted

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:01.720
to look at it from a different
perspective than I did.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.700
So let me give you
the short answer

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.650
and we can go from there.

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:10.310
In order to the magnetic dipole
you have to take an object,

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:13.350
turn it around, and
figure out that there's

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:15.380
a different energy.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:18.270
So therefore, unless
you have an object,

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.950
which is has two orientations,
you cannot figure out if it has

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.800
a magnetic dipole or not.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:28.560
If you're in a state without
angular momentum, I equals 0,

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.650
there is no
distinguishable states.

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:35.000
You cannot orient a 0 angular
momentum object in space.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.990
So therefore you
can never figure out

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.490
that there's a magnetic
moment, and now I'll

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:41.350
make a bold statement,
and this means

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:44.300
there is no magnetic moment.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:53.120
So therefore, you
need this because you

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:59.766
need a minimum number
of true orientations.

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:03.120
OK.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:08.490
Now an electric quadripole
means that the charge density

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:10.050
is like ellipse.

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:11.178
It has--

00:52:11.178 --> 00:52:12.053
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:17.250
PROFESSOR: Oh, 1/2, sorry.

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:17.750
Thank you.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.440
So I should get larger
than 1/2 because we

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.670
need a minimum of two
possible orientations.

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:38.160
Now my question for you is, you
think something is elliptical

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:41.550
but how many different
orientations do

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:45.783
you need to figure out that it
is elliptical and not round.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.830
If I equal 0, you can only look
at it, you can't rotate it,

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:01.520
so will you never find any
energies [? breathing. ?]

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.960
It's just there and you cannot
say where it's round or whether

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.950
it has a quadripole
or deformation.

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:11.680
If I is equal to 1/2, you can
take it and flip it around

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.700
but can you tell from
that that it's an ellipse.

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:19.130
No because if you turn an
ellipse around nothing changes.

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.660
So it could be,
as well, a sphere.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.330
You can only figure
out that it's

00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:26.610
an ellipse if you have
an intermediate rotation,

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:28.840
let's say, by 90 degrees.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.090
So in order to assess that
something is elliptical,

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:36.390
you have to at least resolve
three positions, three angles,

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:40.290
and three angles require that
you have to three sublevels

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:43.700
and this requires that I is
larger, or equal, than one.

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:48.710
Sorry.

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:55.260
Then one goes-- OK.

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:03.280
I'm want to give you a
formal argument using

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:08.560
this spherical
tensor, but I guess

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.490
someone you are waiting
for something simpler.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:12.420
So.

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.770
I mean who wants to know
the answer of the question,

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:17.670
but what happens if
it has a deformation.

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:19.290
Does it just mean
we can't measure it,

00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:20.331
but it has a deformation?

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.620
Let me explain that.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:29.380
So if I have a pencil and
the pencil has zero angular

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:31.900
momentum, I can't
really figure out

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.440
that it's an elongated object,
because all I measure is

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.960
a symmetric wave function.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.150
It's completely
spherically symmetric.

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:40.840
The only way to figure
out that it's a pencil

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.540
is I have to localize
it, that I can

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.550
see that it's
pointing somewhere.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:48.680
But to localize
an object in space

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:51.070
is actually an
angular wave packet.

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.280
It's not isotropic.

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.700
It points somewhere.

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.030
And an angular wave
packet is a superposition

00:54:57.030 --> 00:55:00.870
of states of different
angular momenta.

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:04.270
So therefore, without assuming
that there is a state with

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:06.730
angular momentum, I
cannot orient this pencil.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.020
OK.

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:14.940
I know you would all agree that
even if this pencil is cooled

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.920
to the ground state with
zero angular momentum,

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.040
it is a pencil.

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.600
But what you're using
here is now your knowledge

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:25.540
that this object has higher
angular momentum states.

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.220
And those higher
angular momentum

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:30.730
states have nothing to do with
the structure or the appearance

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:33.020
of this object of
being a pencil.

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:35.670
So you sort of know that
in addition to the i

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:39.560
equals 0 state, there are i
equals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 states,

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.040
and the pencil looks the same.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.230
But if you have a
nucleus, an i equals

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:48.270
0 state requires a certain
configuration of quarks.

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:51.390
And you cannot create an i
equals 2, and i equals 4,

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:55.000
higher states without messing
around with the internal

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:55.740
structure.

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:59.540
So with a nucleus, all you
have is an i equals 0 state.

00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:03.560
And to say that this i equals
0 state has a quadrupolar

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.180
deformation doesn't
make any sense.

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:11.310
If you would know that this
nuclear state could be rotated

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:14.640
without changing its internal
structure, then you would say,

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.550
yes, it has a quadrupole
moment, I just can't see it.

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:20.745
But usually, you cannot
make this assumption.

00:56:20.745 --> 00:56:23.870
If all you have is an i
equals 0 ground state,

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:27.030
and the i equals 2 state
is very, very different,

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:29.310
because the quarks are
spinning around each other

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:31.820
in a different way,
you have to see,

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.950
i equals 0 is
completely spherical.

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.690
It doesn't couple to
anything externally.

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:40.500
And therefore, it has
no moments whatsoever.

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:46.160
So that's the story.

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.130
A lot of people get
confused, because they

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:52.610
think an object can have a
deformation without rotating.

00:56:52.610 --> 00:56:55.080
But you need the
rotation to resolve it.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.550
If you cannot create
an angular wave packet,

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:01.070
which is a superposition
state of angular momenta,

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:05.080
you can never figure out
that there is a deformation.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.980
And quantum mechanically, if you
cannot figure out that there is

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:12.140
a deformation, there
is no deformation,

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:16.680
because you can only use, in the
language of quantum mechanics,

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:21.605
where you have at least the
possibility to measure it.

00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:23.060
Questions about that?

00:57:25.881 --> 00:57:26.380
OK.

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:31.916
I think that makes it now--
let me now kind of just

00:57:31.916 --> 00:57:32.665
give you a formal.

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:41.150
A formal derivation.

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.650
But I agree.

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:43.066
I mean, the formal
derivation, I'm

00:57:43.066 --> 00:57:45.460
just throwing a few equations
at you, and say, that's it

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.870
and everything
follows from that.

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:49.160
But I provided the
insight for you.

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:55.390
Formally, you can define
the quadrupole moment

00:57:55.390 --> 00:58:01.110
by the expectation operator.

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:05.290
You take the nucleus
with maximum MI.

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:12.875
And now you calculate
the expectation value

00:58:12.875 --> 00:58:14.125
of this operator.

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:24.200
This is, of course, motivated
by just electrostatics.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:34.550
If you take an expansion of the
classical electrostatic energy

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:39.580
into multi-poles, you find
the quadrupole configuration

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:44.600
to be related to a
quadripole moment.

00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:50.200
Quadrupole moments couple to the
derivative of electric fields.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.910
And then in this purely
classical description,

00:58:53.910 --> 00:59:02.290
you have this
term, where beta is

00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:08.400
the angle between two
symmetry axis, namely,

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:23.440
between the symmetry axis of
the electric field gradient

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:30.010
and the quadrupole tensor-- just
the classic quadrupole tensor

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:31.230
as it comes out of Jackson.

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:42.130
Yes.

00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:44.390
You can see the quantum
mechanical definition

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:48.240
of the quadrupole moment,
or more generally.

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.940
So this is quadrupole moment.

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:53.800
If you have a moment
with l, the operator,

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.760
which tells you whether you
have a non-vanishing moment,

00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.460
a non-vanishing
deformation, is actually

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.726
a spherical tensor, Tlm.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.610
And what you see above
is a spherical tensor,

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:15.830
T20-- l equals 2, m equals 0.

01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:18.970
And those spherical tensors
are defined by the fact

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:22.190
that they transform as
spherical harmonics.

01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:25.300
And now you sort of
realize what it means.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:32.030
If you want a magnetic or
electric moment with l,

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:35.920
the operator for the
moment transforms

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.530
like angular momentum l.

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:41.370
And now you realize that
you have the triangle rule.

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:47.460
If you want a matrix element
where I and l overlap with I,

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.600
you want to make sure
that I, l, and I couple.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.870
And you have a triangle rule.

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:57.530
So therefore, if you
want a magnetic moment,

01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:02.800
or electric moment, of l, and
you evaluate this expectation

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.050
value, well, at least
the triangle rules

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:10.600
can only be justified like this.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.740
Or in other words, you can
only get a non-vanishing moment

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.020
if l is smaller than 2I.

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.940
And this is what we discussed
in the clicker question

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:25.520
for the two cases of l
equals 1 and l equals 2.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.490
So ultimately, it's
a selection rule

01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:31.460
which is related to
the triangle rule

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:35.470
for the addition
of angular momenta.

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:38.190
But I like much
better the argument,

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:39.870
how many orientations
do you need

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:43.970
to find out that
something is elliptical?

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.960
It's formalized here.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:47.760
All right.

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:57.930
Let's just spend one more minute
on the quadrupolar structure.

01:01:57.930 --> 01:02:04.330
So based on the expansion of
the electrostatic energy, what

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:07.410
determines the
quadrupolar structure

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:13.660
is this cosine angle,
which is the angle

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:20.100
between the axis of the
nucleus and the axis

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.966
of an electric field gradient.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.920
And that means it is the angle.

01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:35.100
It's a cosine of
the angle between J,

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:41.120
the outer environment, and
I, the axis of the nucleus.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.630
So therefore, when we would
derive-- I'm not deriving it,

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:49.480
but if we would derive an
expression for quadrupolar

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.480
structure, the
quadrupolar structure

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.290
would be proportional
to a quantity C, which

01:02:56.290 --> 01:03:03.020
is nothing else than the
dot product of I and J.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:06.460
And at least in my notes now,
I and J have units of h bar.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.150
So I'm dividing it out here.

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:14.720
And as you know, I,
dot, J can be expressed

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.730
by quantum numbers F, F
plus 1, minus I, I plus 1,

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:24.670
minus J, J plus 1.

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:32.810
So therefore, the
quadrupolar energies-- E2,

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:39.650
El equals 2-- involve
the classical expression

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:42.060
at cosine square.

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:49.260
So therefore, you would expect
there is a quadrupole constant.

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:52.640
And then it is cosine square.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.040
But well, usually,
quantum mechanic

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.460
even, we have the
square of a quantity,

01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:03.480
we have to write it as
quantity times quantity plus 1.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.780
So this is the
quadrupolar structure.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.010
And to remind you,
we just discussed

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:13.670
that for the hydrogen atom, the
magnetic hyperfine structure

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:21.480
had invoiced the same product of
I, dot, J, but in a linear way.

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:28.570
So the reason why I'm not
discussing quadrupolar

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:33.390
structure in more
detail is usually

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:36.340
the hyperfine
structure associated

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:41.040
with quadrupole moments
is much, much smaller

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.450
than the hyperfine
structure associated

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:53.050
with magnetic moment,
typically by a factor of 100.

01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:55.840
The only exceptions
are molecules,

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.960
because molecules
can have-- because

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.590
of molecular binding
mechanisms-- a much, much

01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:04.830
larger electric field gradient.

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:07.800
So therefore, in molecules,
quadrupolar structure

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.830
is more important than in atoms.

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:19.848
Questions about that?

01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:32.620
With that, we have
discussed the two effects

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:37.050
of hyperfine structure due to
magnetic moment of the nucleus.

01:05:37.050 --> 01:05:42.120
And we also discussed further
deformations of the nucleus,

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.050
in particular, the
quadrupolar deformation.

01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:48.330
Let me now use the
last 10 minutes

01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:50.525
to quickly discuss with
you isotope effects.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.900
And I know that many people
here know about isotope effects,

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.450
because if you lock your
laser to a lithium cell

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:20.000
or to a rubidium cell, you find
lithium-6 and lithium-7 peaks.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.590
And in rubidium,
rubidium-85 and rubidium-87.

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:28.440
So there are two peaks which
are spectrally very, very

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.150
well resolved.

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:34.870
And now I tell you what causes
the splitting between the lines

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:36.590
of rubidium-85 and rubidium-87.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.650
Well, the first effect
is really trivial.

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:45.200
It's the mass effect.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.270
And I have to remind
you that the Rydberg

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:56.640
formula for a single
electron energy level

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.300
contains the reduced mass.

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.900
In other words,
the energy levels

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.600
are the energy
levels-- if you assume

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:08.670
that the mass of the nucleus is
infinite, that means you just

01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:12.460
take for the electron mass
in the Rydberg constant

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.050
the electron mass.

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:23.450
But in general, you have
to take the reduced mass--

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:28.030
the big M is the nucleus.

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:29.825
And small m is the electron.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:38.020
The simplest case is if you set
the nuclear mass to infinity.

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.015
Then you simply have the Rydberg
constant with the electron

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:43.530
mass.

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:47.080
So in the limit that
the nuclear mass is

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.020
much larger than
the electron mass,

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:54.220
this correction factor is 1
minus little m over big M.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.840
So therefore, the correction
factor is on the order of 10

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.290
to the 4 or 10 to the 5.

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:06.750
Visible frequencies are on
the order of 10 to the 14.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:09.910
So 10 to the minus 4 or
10 to the minus 5 of it

01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:12.850
is between 1 and 10 gigahertz.

01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:16.446
So this is the scale
for mass corrections

01:08:16.446 --> 01:08:17.529
due to the isotope effect.

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:27.950
What is the sine of
the isotope effect?

01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:33.890
Does the fact that the
nucleus has a finite mass--

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:36.970
does that mean that the
binding energy of the electron

01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:38.290
is smaller or larger?

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:56.824
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it would be larger.

01:08:56.824 --> 01:09:02.620
PROFESSOR: The absolute
value of the binding energy--

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.990
look at your signs.

01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:06.090
I would say it in the following.

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:08.010
Let's start out with
an infinite nucleus,

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.290
and only the electron is moving.

01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:12.580
But now we make the
nucleus lighter.

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:15.290
And that means the
nucleus also has to move,

01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:16.990
because it's a two-body problem.

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:19.260
And there is additional
kinetic energy,

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.550
additional kinetic
energy of the nucleus.

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:25.500
And kinetic energy is positive
and weakens the binding energy

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.260
of the total system.

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:31.770
So therefore, the fact that the
effective mass correction means

01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:36.040
the lighter the nucleus
is, the more kinetic energy

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.810
has to be added to the system
for the nuclear motion,

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:41.284
and the more the binding
energy is weakened.

01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:50.920
The most dramatic example
is not the hydrogen atom.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:59.510
It is positronium, where your
nucleus is not a nucleus,

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:02.260
it's a positively charged
electron to the positronium.

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.610
And in this situation,
you have an effective mass

01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:11.350
which is only 1/2 of
the electron mass.

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:30.090
And the 1s-2s transition, which
is Lyman alpha for hydrogen,

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:32.260
is now not even
in the vacuum UV,

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:35.710
it just happens at
ordinary UV transitions.

01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:39.610
And that means now
the 1s-2s energy

01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:41.570
is smaller by a factor of 2.

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:44.770
That really means the binding
energy between an electron

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:49.050
and a positron is only
50% of the binding energy

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:50.710
of an electron in
the hydrogen atom.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:54.540
OK.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.630
That's all I want to say
about the mass effect.

01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:04.235
Let's now talk about
the volume effect.

01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:16.420
So if you would look at
the charge distribution

01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:27.410
in a nucleus as a function of
r, if we go from one isotope

01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:30.810
to a heavier isotope
with more neutrons,

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:34.450
the nuclear radius
becomes larger

01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:36.521
and the charge becomes
more spread out.

01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:50.040
So if I plot now the
electrostatic potential,

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:54.780
the electrostatic potential
is, of course, the Coulomb

01:11:54.780 --> 01:12:01.770
potential, 1 over r, until we
enter the charge distribution.

01:12:01.770 --> 01:12:10.130
And then, as you know from
electrostatics, it continues.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.770
This is 1 over r.

01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:16.995
And then it's flattened off.

01:12:16.995 --> 01:12:21.230
It continues quadratically
for the heavier-- oops,

01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:22.940
I wanted to change color.

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.800
For the heavier nucleus,
it is like this,

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.630
and for the lighter
nucleus, it is like this.

01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:32.160
So in other words, the
finite size of the nucleus

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.960
is cutting off the
Coulomb potential

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.250
where it is strongest.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.870
And this happens the
earlier, the larger,

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:40.900
or the heavier the nucleus is.

01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:47.195
So therefore, what you
obtain is you obtain,

01:12:47.195 --> 01:12:51.250
in perturbation
theory, a level shift.

01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:53.880
Since it only affects
the electron when

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.990
it's very close to the
origin, this level shift

01:12:56.990 --> 01:13:00.750
is, as other effects we
have discussed today,

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:03.130
proportional to the
probability of the electron

01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:04.900
to be at the center.

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:09.320
This is only s
electrons are effected.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:23.040
What is the effect
in terms of energy?

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.690
Well, it's clear the Coulomb
potential is weakened.

01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:32.740
Therefore, this effect,
the volume effect weakens,

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:42.380
decreases the binding
energy of the electron.

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:48.090
So we have two effects now-- we
have the volume effect, which

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:52.180
is the stronger the bigger and
the heavier the nucleus is.

01:13:59.710 --> 01:14:06.760
So it's largest
for heavy nuclei.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:12.020
And the mass effect, or
the effective mass effect,

01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.715
is of course largest
for the lightest nuclei,

01:14:14.715 --> 01:14:17.210
with the extreme
example of positronium.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.485
Any questions?

01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:43.880
Well, we have five minutes left.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.496
But Cody.

01:14:44.496 --> 01:14:45.870
AUDIENCE: What
sort of scales are

01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:46.690
associated with
the volume effect?

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:47.582
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

01:14:47.582 --> 01:14:48.920
AUDIENCE: What sort
of energy scales

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.503
are associated with the volume
effect? [INAUDIBLE] comparable?

01:14:51.503 --> 01:14:55.130
PROFESSOR: What energy is--
no, it's actually-- wait.

01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:56.902
Let's estimate it.

01:14:56.902 --> 01:14:58.110
You're working with rubidium.

01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:01.270
What is your isotope shift in
rubidium between 85 and 87?

01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:04.336
AUDIENCE: I actually don't know.

01:15:04.336 --> 01:15:08.171
PROFESSOR: Isn't
it 170, 90-- no,

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:09.920
I'm getting confused
now with [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:13.694 --> 01:15:15.110
So many people
work with rubidium.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.810
What is the difference
in transition frequency

01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:20.114
between rubidium-85 and -87?

01:15:20.114 --> 01:15:21.922
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:21.922 --> 01:15:24.558
PROFESSOR: It's much
more than gigahertz.

01:15:24.558 --> 01:15:26.480
You really have to
tune your laser.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.370
I think if you look
at the wave per cell,

01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:32.400
you will never accidentally
see a rubidium-85 line.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.206
I just don't recall the number.

01:15:35.206 --> 01:15:36.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:42.094 --> 01:15:46.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] together,
you can see both of them.

01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:49.490
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:51.840
And for the mass
effect, we said it's

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.980
sort of-- then they
would be comparable.

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.980
The mass effect is
easy to estimate,

01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:01.730
because the mass correction
is one part in a few thousand.

01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:06.530
So that would mean on the order
of 10 to the 10 gigahertz.

01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:08.880
So the volume effect--
it really depends.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.520
It's tiny for light elements.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.510
Rubidium is already heavy.

01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:17.170
So right now I would
say they are comparable.

01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:20.170
But since it's of
interest, I will give you

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:23.070
more accurate
numbers on Wednesday.

01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:24.745
Any other questions?

01:16:24.745 --> 01:16:25.245
Yes?

01:16:25.245 --> 01:16:25.911
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:16:25.911 --> 01:16:28.040
Could you explain the
graph of the previous page,

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.992
how the lines are joined off?

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.090
PROFESSOR: The potential?

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.374
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:16:35.374 --> 01:16:36.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:41.900
So what happens is-- so
if we're being cryptic,

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.540
this is the charge distribution.

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:47.710
And what I'm doing now is
I'm solving Laplace equation.

01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:50.000
I'm solving Laplace
equation and integrating

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.720
from r equals infinity.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.980
And as long as I'm
outside the charge radius,

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.540
I get the 1 over r
Coulomb potential.

01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.370
But the moment I heat the
surface of the nucleus,

01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:04.600
I continue to indicate
Laplace equation.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:12.040
But what is now inside is a
smaller and smaller charge.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.280
I can also say I use
a form of Gauss's law.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.670
So I'm therefore not
continuing on the 1 over r.

01:17:18.670 --> 01:17:20.750
And if you look at
Jackson, or if you

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:26.460
look at maybe a PSET you have
solved, the 1 over r potential

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.260
becomes now a parabola.

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:31.270
And so what I wanted to
sort of indicate here

01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:34.360
is once you heat the
surface of the nucleus,

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.030
you're not continuing on
the 1 over r trajectory.

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:41.640
You have in a wave which
is continuous and has

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:45.900
a continuous deriviative--
you have to fit in a parabola.

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:47.640
And for the heavier
nucleus, this

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:51.460
leads us to this potential.

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:54.490
As for the lighter nucleus,
the potential is deeper.

01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:58.040
And that explains why the
binding energy for heavier

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.140
nuclei is smaller than
for lighter nuclei.

01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:03.430
Yes?

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:05.406
AUDIENCE: So for the
other orbitals, is it

01:18:05.406 --> 01:18:07.382
exactly zero or
[? near to ?] zero?

01:18:10.346 --> 01:18:11.420
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.970
For the other orbitals,
what we have to do

01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:18.370
is-- and actually, you
have a homework assignment

01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:20.720
to do it for hydrogen
and the proton.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.530
You take the difference
between the actual potential

01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:26.630
and the Coulomb potential.

01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:28.710
So you take the difference.

01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:31.950
And the difference is
your perturbation operator

01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:34.230
for the finite size
of the nucleus.

01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:36.730
And now you take this
perturbation operator

01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:39.385
between your wave function
and calculate the lowest order

01:18:39.385 --> 01:18:42.230
of the expectation value.

01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:44.900
For the s electron,
you can immediately

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:49.280
factor out the probability
for the electronic s equals 0.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:53.430
But s-- we discussed, if you
have orbital angular momentum,

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:56.510
let me just scribble
it down here,

01:18:56.510 --> 01:19:00.961
the wave function is
proportional to r to the l.

01:19:00.961 --> 01:19:04.730
So therefore, you
have actually an r

01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:13.320
to the l-- the wave function is
exactly 0 only at r equals 0.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.830
And then it slowly grows.

01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:19.370
So therefore, given the
finite size of the nucleus,

01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:23.590
you will get a tiny, an
absolutely tiny effect

01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:26.180
if you integrate a wave
function, r to the l,

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:29.290
over your perturbation operator.

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:31.520
So it's not mathematically zero.

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.300
But for all practical
purposes, it vanishes.

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.328
Nancy.

01:19:37.328 --> 01:19:40.590
AUDIENCE: For the different
nuclei-- for example,

01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:43.789
in rubidium-- is mass and
volume affecting anything?

01:19:43.789 --> 01:19:48.719
Or is [INAUDIBLE] structure also
important in these isotopes?

01:19:48.719 --> 01:19:52.170
Because the nuclear structure
would be different [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:55.128 --> 01:19:56.390
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:58.850
When we talk isotope
effects, I was

01:19:58.850 --> 01:20:01.360
talking about the isotope
effects of mass and volume.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.530
But different isotopes
will, in general,

01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:10.470
have different magnetic moments
or different quadrupolar

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:11.370
deformations.

01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:14.630
So what I discussed about
hyperfine structure also

01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:16.420
applies to isotopes.

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:19.140
I only separated it,
because usually when

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.790
you don't have isotopes, you
don't talk about, like, sodium.

01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:24.300
Who has ever talked about
the mass shift or volume

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:25.820
effect in sodium?

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.780
Usually you don't,
because sodium

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:31.590
has 100% natural
abundance in sodium-23.

01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:33.890
So therefore, the
hyperfine effects,

01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:36.200
they lead to
observable splittings

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.710
even if you have
only one isotope.

01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:42.490
But in general, yes,
different isotopes

01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:45.516
differ in all four effects-- the
mass effect, the volume effect,

01:20:45.516 --> 01:20:47.807
the deformation effect, and
the magnetic moment effect.

01:20:47.807 --> 01:20:52.101
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] mass and
volume effects are used more

01:20:52.101 --> 01:20:54.586
than [INAUDIBLE] splitting?

01:20:54.586 --> 01:20:57.071
Because I find there
is a different rate

01:20:57.071 --> 01:21:00.053
for different isotopes.

01:21:00.053 --> 01:21:02.041
Like, in the starting
of the lecture,

01:21:02.041 --> 01:21:04.526
you were talking about
adding two positrons

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.017
to the alpha particles.

01:21:06.017 --> 01:21:09.496
That would change [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:09.496 --> 01:21:11.510
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah,
this would change.

01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:14.080
But you can separate
those effects,

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.070
because I mentioned that
in hyperfine structure,

01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:20.560
the center of mass of the
energy levels is the same.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:24.180
So if you see a splitting
but take the center of mass,

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.310
then the center
of mass will only

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:28.800
depend on volume
and mass effects.

01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:32.290
OK.

01:21:32.290 --> 01:21:35.560
Let's continue on Wednesday.
