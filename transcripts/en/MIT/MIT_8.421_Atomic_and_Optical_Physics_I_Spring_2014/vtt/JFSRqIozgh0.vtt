00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.890
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.440
Well, the result of which
we obtained on Wednesday

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.299
for spontaneous emission for
the Einstein A coefficient

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.250
regarded as an accomplishment
as a highlight of the course.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.700
We've worked hard
to talk about atoms

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.800
and electromagnetic fields.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.680
And ultimately, to deal
with spontaneous emission,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.140
it was not enough to put a
semi-classical light atom

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.620
interaction, dipole Hamiltonian,
Rabi oscillation and such

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.570
to put that into the picture.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.240
We really needed a
quantized version

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.900
of the electromagnetic field.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.050
And this is a result when an
atom is excited and interact

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.430
with all of the empty
mods of the vacuum.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.970
And be summed up the
probability that photon

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.610
is immediate in
any of those modes.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.550
And by doing, kind
of, all of the ever

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.340
reaching with
intensity of state,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.430
and for all the possibility
of actions we obtained.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.870
The famous result for the
Einstein A coefficient,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.895
which is also the
natural aligned width

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:36.895
of the atomic excited state.

00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:41.250
Do you have any questions
about the derivation

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.760
or what we did last week?

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.435
Then I think I will just
continue and interpret

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:55.100
the result.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.520
So we go to result for an
Einstein A coefficient.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.690
And well, the question
is, how big is it?

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.830
Well it has a
number of constants.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.930
And if it is-- let's discuss
it now in atomic units.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.990
Well, if we assume the
frequency or the energy

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.260
is on the order of
Rydberg-- that's

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.330
sort of the measure for
an electronic excitation

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.070
in the atom-- we assume the
dipole matrix element is one.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.530
That means one per radius.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.330
Since we have pretty much set
everything one and expressed

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.580
everything in atomic units, it
means that the speed of light

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.600
is-- remember?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.040
The velocity of the atom
in any correspondent

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.110
was alpha times smaller
than the speed of light.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.190
But the velocity of the
atom is one atomic unit.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.370
So therefore, the speed
of light in atomic units

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.070
is one over alpha.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.290
And that means that if
you look at the formula,

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.110
there is the speed of
light to the power of 3

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.740
in the denominator.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.120
And that means that
in atomic units

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.920
the Einstein A
coefficient is alpha

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.370
to the 3, which is 3
times 10 to the minus 7.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.600
So that means that the ratio
of this spontaneous emission

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.610
rate, which is also
the inverse lifetime

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.867
and, therefore, the natural
alignments of the excited

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:37.366
state.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.880
Relative to the transition
frequency, so the damping

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.970
of the harmonic oscillator
or the two level

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.340
system relative to the NFC
spacing of the oscillator.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.260
It's small.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.770
It's actually alpha cube.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.850
So if you take this 3
times 10 to the minus 7

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.790
and multiply it with the
atomic unit of frequency,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.690
which is 2 Rydbergs.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.180
We obtain on the
order of 10 to 9.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.390
And it's a rate of 10
to the 9 per second.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.290
And that means that the lifetime
of a tubercle atomic level

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.770
is on the order of 1 nanosecond.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:41.880
Well, often it's
10 200 nanosecond

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:49.150
because many transition
frequencies are smaller

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.870
by quite a factor than the
atomic unit of the transition

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.000
frequency.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.950
Remember, the Rydberg frequency
would be deep in the UV.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.245
But a lot of atoms have
transitions in the visible.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.380
I highlighted already
when I derived it

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.540
that the spontaneous emission
has this famous omega cube

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.420
dependents.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.560
And that this actually
important to understand

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:37.130
why lower lying levels--
excited hyperfine levels--

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.470
do not radiate.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.250
So let me just, kind
of, formalize it.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.210
If I would now estimate what
is the radiative lifetime

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.782
for a transition, which is not
as I just assumed in the UV

00:05:52.782 --> 00:05:53.680
or in the visible.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.370
Let me estimate what is the
radiative lifetime to emit

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.300
a microwave photon
at a few gigahertz?

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:14.410
Well, the microwave frequency
of the gigahertz 10 to the nine

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.990
is five orders of magnitude
smaller than the frequency 10

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.930
to the 14 of an
optical transition.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.640
So therefore, this is 10
to the 15 times longer.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.880
And if you have,
typically, one or ten

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.400
nanosecond for an
electronic transition.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.360
That means that this spontaneous
lifetime for a microwave

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.180
transition is seven months.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:50.250
If in addition we factor in
that hyperfine transitions have

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.950
an operator which is a Bohr
magneton and magnetic type

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:04.230
of operator, not an
electric dipole and we

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.210
discussed that the Bohr
magneton is actually

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.020
when we discuss multiple
transitions we discuss

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.820
that the Bohr magneton
is alpha times smaller

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.360
than a typical
electric dipole moment.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.840
So therefore, a magnetic
dipole transition

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:27.160
is alpha times weaker than an
electronic dipole transition.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.880
And that means now, if
you multiply months, which

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.100
we obtain by the
frequency scaling,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.400
again, by alpha square
for the weakness

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.340
of the magnetic dipole, we find
that atomic hyperfine levels

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:48.630
have a lifetime, which is
on the order of 1,000 years.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.034
And this is why it's
very safe to neglect

00:07:51.034 --> 00:07:52.450
those transition
in the laboratory

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.970
and assume that all hyperfine
states in the ground state

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.750
manifold pretty much don't
decay and are long lived.

00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:07.976
Questions?

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.330
OK, so with that we have
discussed spontaneous emission.

00:08:24.444 --> 00:08:26.110
Let's go through a
few clicker questions

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:39.630
to discuss the subject and
verify your understanding.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:56.540
So the first question
is can an E2 transition,

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:07.920
which is a quadruple
transition, can you

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.885
drive it by a plane wave?

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.700
Or does it need a
laser beam which

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.150
has an intensity gradient
such as a focus laser beam.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.240
Yes or no?

00:09:59.836 --> 00:10:00.335
OK.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.790
Well the answer is yes.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.330
You can just use
your laser beam.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.460
If a quadrupole transition
would require a gradient,

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.550
it would really
require a gradient

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.010
over the size of the atom.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.400
And that would be
extremely hard to achieve.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.860
Fortunately, this is not the
case because what happens

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.980
is we actually assumed
in the derivation

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.370
that we had a plane
wave into the IKR.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.680
And then do the
tailor expansion.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.920
And it was these part
of the tailor expansion

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.950
of a plain wave, which gave
rise to the matrix element

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.000
for the quadrupole transition.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.679
So a plane wave laser beam
is sufficient to drive

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:47.845
higher multiple transitions.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:51.180
Next question.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:06.240
Can spontaneous
emission be described

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:18.185
as a stimulated emission
process by the zero point field.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.539
So by the zero point field, we
know the electromagnetic wave

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:27.580
is a harmonic oscillator.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.565
And a harmonic oscillator
has a ground state.

00:11:28.565 --> 00:11:31.270
And in the ground state
you have zero point motion.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.250
So there is an electric
field, even when

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.830
we have the vacuum state.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:42.010
And the question is,
can spontaneous emission

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:49.850
be described as simply being
stimulated emission but now do

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.170
to the silver point fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field.

00:12:17.331 --> 00:12:17.830
OK.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.690
The answer is it depends.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.260
It depends if you just want to
make a qualitative hand waving

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:26.760
argument.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.500
Then I would say
you are correct.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.090
You can say that the
electromagnetic field

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.630
of the vacuum
stimulates a transition.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.340
But when I said
described, I meant

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.290
if you can get it
quantitatively correct.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.090
And there the answer
is actually no

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.030
because the energy of
the electromagnetic field

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.660
is n plus 1/2 h bar omega.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:02.910
Whereas, this spontaneous
emission of eight is n plus 1.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.580
So you have half a photon
verse of extra energy.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.690
But this spontaneous
emission is sort

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:13.240
of like the spontaneous
emission is the rate, which

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.320
would be stimulated by an
extra energy of h bar omega.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.240
So in other words, you
would get the answer

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.760
wrong by a factor of two.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.400
I think decoding deeper in the
electrodynamics description

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.180
of spontaneous
emission you would

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.560
identify two terms for
spontaneous emission.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.030
One is actually the stimulation
by the vacuum field.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.610
But there is another term
called radiation reaction.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.830
So there's, sort of, two terms.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:42.370
Trust me.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.590
If not, there are
hundreds of pages

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.780
in [INAUDIBLE], which is
books written about it.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.910
And in the ground state, the two
terms destructively interfere.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.740
Therefore, you have no
spontaneous emission

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.690
in the current state,
which is reassuring.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.730
But then in the excited
state the two terms

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.580
constructively interfere.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.530
And therefore, you get
spontaneous emission,

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.100
which is twice as much as
you would get if you just

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.380
look at the stimulation
by the vacuum field.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.150
So the answer is not
quantitative but half of it,

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.770
yes, can be regarded
as stimulated emission

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.410
by the vacuum fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field.

00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:27.360
OK.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.920
We emphasized that
spontaneous emission

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.930
is proportional to omega cube.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:53.720
The question is now what is the
dependence in one dimension?

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.860
If everything the atom can
only emit in one dimension,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.090
everything is one dimensional,
put the atom into a waveguide.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:17.330
So your choices are omega cube,
omega square, or omega-- well,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.082
if you press D,
none of the above.

00:15:21.082 --> 00:15:23.750
But I can already tell you
it's one of those three.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.590
So everything the same.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.510
But we are in one dimension.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.804
The world seen by the atom and
by the electromagnetic waves

00:15:43.804 --> 00:15:44.595
is one dimensional.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.100
Yes, it's correct.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.730
As you remember, out of
the omega cube dependence.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.200
Omega square came from
the density of states.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.580
And what is omega square
in three dimension

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.300
becomes omega in two
dimensions and constant density

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.250
of state in one dimension.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.800
So therefore, in
one dimension, we

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.875
are only left with
the omega dependence.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.530
OK, so there is one
factor of omega,

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.460
which does not come from
the density of state.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:45.560
And the next question is where
does the other power of omega

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.210
come from?

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.500
As we discussed, it's not
the density of states.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.530
So we have three choices.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:04.430
One is it comes from the
atomic matrix element,

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:09.550
it comes from the
dipole approximation,

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.640
or it comes from
the quantization

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.130
of the electromagnetic field.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.560
OK, the majority got it right.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.766
It's a field quantization.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.490
Sort of remember when you
write down the electric dipole

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.830
Hamiltonian, in the
quantized version,

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.870
there is a perfecter,
which is electric field

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.430
of a single photon.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:13.860
So if you have a
single photon, it

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.450
gives rise to an
electric field squared,

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.262
which is proportionate
to h bar omega.

00:18:20.262 --> 00:18:22.220
And this is, sort of,
the normalization factor.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.890
Two more questions.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.910
We talked a lot about the
rotating wave approximation.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.710
And we also talked about
it for a spinning system

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.560
driven by magnetic field.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.460
If you have a rotating
magnetic field,

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.180
we do not need the
rotating wave approximation

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.490
because if you drive a
spin system with a rotating

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:06.820
magnetic field, we have
only the co-rotating term.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:11.680
The question I have now for you
is whether the same is correct

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.520
or not for an
electronic transition.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:23.640
So therefore, the question
is for electronic transitions

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:35.025
do we always get the
counter rotating term.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.890
And if you want to have
a simple Hamiltonian,

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.640
then we do the rotating
wave approximation.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.680
So the question is is the
rotating wave approximation

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.560
necessary because we always
get the counter rotating

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.610
term for the
electronic transition,

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.530
then the answer is yes.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:02.390
Or are there examples
where the system is exactly

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.160
described by only one term?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.444
The core rotating term.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.987
I will come back to
that later in the class.

00:20:28.987 --> 00:20:30.445
But I thought it's
a good question.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.290
OK, let me give you the answer.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.680
I actually coincide with
everybody in the class

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:49.420
here because I would tend to say
no because there are situations

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.910
where the counter
rotating term can be zero

00:20:53.910 --> 00:21:00.620
due to angular momentum
selection rules.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:08.380
However, if you have an
electronic transition

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.050
and you have a sigma plus
transition to one state,

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.090
there's always a possibility
for sigma minus transition.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.370
So you usually get both.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.550
But if you apply an infinitely
strong magnetic field,

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.060
then the m equals
minus 1 state can

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.690
be moved out of the picture.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.530
You have only, let's say,
the m equals plus 1 state.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.500
And then selection holds mean
that the counter rotating

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.690
term is vanishingly small.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.130
But it's an
artificial situation.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:44.630
So you can all claim
credit for your answer.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:52.140
Finally, the last question
is about the Lamb shift.

00:22:00.062 --> 00:22:04.720
We are now talking about
electronic transitions.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:14.960
And the question is
Lamb shift-- if it's

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.660
due to the counter
rotating term.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.450
In other words, if you have
a situation where the counter

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.700
rotating term is
zero, as we just

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.340
discussed in the
previous example

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.960
that there may be situations.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.210
Somewhat artificially but
you could arrange for it.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:40.640
The set then implies that
there is no lamb shift.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.060
So yes or no.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:52.610
Is the lamb shift caused by
the counter rotating term

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.100
involved in electronic
transitions?

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:06.870
OK.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.440
OK, well what else
is the lamb shift?

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.290
It is the AC stock effect of
the counter rotating term.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:32.300
So is it due to the
counter rotating term?

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.125
Yes, of course.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:44.950
The lamb shift is
the AC stock effect

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.530
caused by the
vacuum fluctuations.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.720
That's what it is.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.880
But we come to
that because I want

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.270
to discuss later today
some aspects of the fully

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.560
quantized Hamiltonian.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.390
And we will, again, in the
fully quantized picture

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.930
see the operators,
which are responsible

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.217
for the core rotating for
the counter rotating turn.

00:24:14.217 --> 00:24:15.800
And then I will point
to the operator,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.460
which causes a lamb shift.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.920
But before I continue, any
questions about the questions?

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.420
Collin.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.980
AUDIENCE: When you derive the
amplitude in the electric field

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.390
due to the single photon--

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:31.082
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:24:31.082 --> 00:24:33.040
AUDIENCE: I always get
the factor of two wrong.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:38.326
So you wrote h bar omega is 2
epsilon 0 [INAUDIBLE] squared.

00:24:38.326 --> 00:24:42.041
Now there's a contribution that
comes from the electric field

00:24:42.041 --> 00:24:44.290
and magnetic field because
you have one factor of two.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.272
Then there's always that
other factor of two.

00:24:47.272 --> 00:24:50.162
Are you getting that
from using one half h

00:24:50.162 --> 00:24:51.745
bar because of the
vacuum fluctuation.

00:24:55.224 --> 00:24:57.160
PROFESSOR: I'm not going
back to the formula

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.670
because I run the risk
that it was wrong.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:04.620
But all I want to say is what
I really mean is use Jackson.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.540
Put in a volume V-- an
electromagnetic field--

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.530
with h bar omega energy.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:15.840
And the electric field
squared of this photon,

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.220
that's what I mean.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:22.450
And if you find a factor of
two mistakes in my E square,

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.110
I can still, you know,
get out of theory exit

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.480
by the rear-entrance door
by saying that there is also

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.420
a difference whether E
square is E square RNS

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.356
or whether E square
is the amplitude.

00:25:35.356 --> 00:25:37.730
You know I mean there are risk
factors of two everywhere.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.150
But what I mean is
really the electric field

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.090
caused by one photon.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.340
And of course, the
argument stands.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.070
I don't need any factors
of two or any subtleties

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.080
of the electromagnetic
field energy.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.040
We know that the energy is
n plus 1/2 but emission is

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.110
n plus 1.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.670
And these shows that the
stimulation by the vacuum field

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.340
cannot quantitatively account
for spontaneous emission.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.268
AUDIENCE: So the quantity
that you set equal to

00:26:06.268 --> 00:26:11.669
is h bar omega 1/2, not the
fluctuation but the real--

00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:14.627
PROFESSOR: OK, if
you want to know,

00:26:14.627 --> 00:26:16.210
let's not compare
apples with oranges.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.334
You want an electric field.

00:26:17.334 --> 00:26:19.540
And you can pick whether
it's the RMS field

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.150
or whether it is the
maximum amplitude.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:23.430
You can pick what you want.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:27.470
But now we are comparing
what is the e-square

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.940
for the vacuum-- for
single-mode-- vacuum.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.860
And what is the e-square
for single photon?

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.250
The two answers differ
by a factor of 2.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:38.520
A single photon
is twice as strong

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.130
in e-square as the vacuum
fluctuations in the same mode.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.750
That's what it means.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.250
Yes?

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:50.218
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the quantum emission

00:26:50.218 --> 00:26:51.210
rate.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.186
The explanation that it had--
quantum mechanic derivation

00:26:54.186 --> 00:26:59.146
that we have, do people
not know the formula,

00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:02.122
how to describe spontaneous
emission [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:08.074 --> 00:27:09.880
PROFESSOR: I think so.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.690
I have not gone deeply
back into the story.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.510
But a lot of credit
is given to Einstein.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:19.770
And as I mentioned last
week that Einstein actually

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.443
had spontaneous emission in his
derivation for the Einstein A

00:27:23.443 --> 00:27:26.680
and B coefficient in
this famous paper.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:32.270
And so he found that there must
be spontaneous emission based

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.160
on a thermodynamic argument.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.520
It's only spontaneous
emission, which

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:42.820
brings the internal population
of an atom into equilibrium.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.758
So I think it is correct to say.

00:27:45.758 --> 00:27:48.091
AUDIENCE: Can you derive it
from that stagnant condition

00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:49.959
of getting [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:51.590
PROFESSOR: That's
what Einstein did.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.980
And the answer is, by
comparison with the Planck law,

00:27:54.980 --> 00:28:00.330
you get an expression for the
Einstein A and B coefficient.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:05.390
Now of course, you can
go the other way around.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:11.140
You can see if you just use
classical physics you would

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.300
actually expect--
now it depends.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.880
If you use the Bohr
model, you would

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.920
expect that the electron is
radiating and it was a mystery.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.360
How can you have an atom
in the ground state, which

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:28.090
is circling around a nucleolus,
and not radiating at all?

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.280
On the other hand,
in quantum mechanics,

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.030
we are not assuming that
the atom is circulating.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.320
And we have an
accelerated charge

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.820
and then we have a time
dependent charge distribution.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.090
We use the steady
state wave function.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.860
So I'm not sure
if there is maybe

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.770
an argument, which
would say there should

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.090
be some spontaneous
emission based

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.220
on a purely classic argument.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.470
But this would not
be the whole story

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.910
because a classic argument would
then deal with the difficulty.

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.630
Why is there
difference between n

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:03.830
equals 1, which does not radiate
in n equals 2, which radiates.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:07.130
So my understanding is
that it is only the physics

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:10.640
either through the
perspective of Einstein

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.430
by just using equilibration
or our microscopic derivation

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:20.320
using filed quantization,
which allows us to understand

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.490
the phenomenon of a
spontaneous emission.

00:29:28.254 --> 00:29:28.920
Other questions?

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:43.830
OK, then before we talk about
some really cute and nice

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:47.750
aspects of the fully
quantised Hamiltonian,

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:54.090
I want to spend a
few minutes talking

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.760
about degeneracy factors.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.920
I've already given
you my opinion.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.180
You should not think in
almost all situations

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.470
about levels, which
have a degeneracy.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.680
Just think about states.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.880
A state is a state,
and it counts as one.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.500
And if you have a level which
has triple degeneracy, well,

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.510
it has three states.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.600
Just kind of count the states
and look at the states.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:30.880
However, there are
formula for which

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.600
involves degeneracy factors.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.860
And just to remind you,
when we had the discussion

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.500
of Einstein's A
and B coefficient,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:44.650
the Einstein A coefficient
was proportionate to the B

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.460
coefficient responsible
for stimulated emission

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.560
from the excited to
the ground state.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:56.930
But the Einstein B
coefficient for absorption

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.210
was related to the
Einstein B coefficient

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:04.710
for stimulated
emission by involving

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.390
these degeneracy factors.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:19.580
So degeneracies appear
and in some formal layer

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.320
that it makes a lot
of sense to use them.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:28.010
So I've always said for a
fundamental understanding,

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.910
you should just assume
all degeneracies are one.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.410
This is how you
can avoid, sort of,

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.310
some baggage in
deriving equations.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.680
And I'm still standing
to my statement.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.320
I want to show you
now a situation

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.140
where it becomes useful to
consider degeneracy factors.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.490
So let me give you an example.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:52.150
We can now look at the situation
where we have an excited P

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.660
state and a ground
state, which is S.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:01.520
Or I can look at the
opposite situation

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.630
where we have an S state,
which can radiate to a P state.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:14.890
Well by symmetry, the
different p states

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:18.020
and plus 1 and minus
1 m equals 0 are just

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.340
connected by spatial rotations.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:26.920
So therefore, their
lifetime of the 3 P states

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.430
and the rate of spontaneous
emission are the same.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:41.050
But if you now assume
that you have absorption,

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:45.030
you go from the S
state to the P state.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:51.126
Then you find that the
Einstein B coefficient there

00:32:51.126 --> 00:32:53.090
are now three possible ways.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.270
Not just one polarization
or 3 polarization.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:33:03.370
And you will find that this is
proportional to three times r.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:15.964
However, in this
situation, it's a reverse

00:33:15.964 --> 00:33:17.130
but let me just finish here.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:26.140
So here the natural
align rates and the rate

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:30.150
of stimulated emission
described by the coefficient

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.460
from the excited state
to the ground state

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.330
is proportionate to R.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:39.665
Whereas, in the other situation,
if you have absorption now,

00:33:39.665 --> 00:33:43.590
well, each of those levels,
there's only one transition,

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.830
one pass way.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:51.540
Therefore, you will find that
the coefficient for absorption

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:57.680
is proportionate to
R. Whereas, gamma

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:05.410
and the stimulated
emission, which is now BSP,

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:08.138
is proportionate to
three R because there

00:34:08.138 --> 00:34:08.929
are three pathways.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:22.239
So depending what the situation
is, you have to be careful.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:27.330
And you would say-- but if
it's an S to P transition,

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:31.550
it maybe connected by
the same matrix element.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.880
And therefore, you would
say shouldn't there

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.679
be align strings,
which is independent

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:40.429
whether you go from S to P or
P to S, which just describes

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:43.909
in a natural way what is really
the coupling between S and P

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.050
state?

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:49.639
And yes indeed, there
is in the literature

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:57.650
some definition of line
strings where the lines strings

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:05.760
S would be proportionate
to the sum of all

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:12.310
of the eights between an
initial and the final state.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.200
And do sum over all.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:20.320
So therefore, when you use this
formula for the line strings,

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:26.910
whether you have the
situation on the left side

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:35.610
or on the right side,
you will do always

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.880
the sum over the 3
possible transitions.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.010
So the lines things is the
same for both situations.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:43.825
It's just generic for
an S to P transition.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:52.470
So if you use this
definition but then you

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:56.990
have the situation that
spontaneous emission is always

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:00.060
given by the line
strings but you

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:04.340
have to multiply now by the
multiplicity of the excited

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.420
state.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.440
If you have a P state,
the whole line strings

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.650
is distributed
over three states.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:15.030
And each state has only a
spontaneous emission rate,

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.130
which is a third of what
the line strings gives you.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.550
I don't want to
beat it to death,

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.590
because I hate
degeneracy factors.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.210
But I just thought this
example with the P to S

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:29.470
and S to P transition tells
you why they necessarily

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:33.070
have to appear in derivations
like Einstein's A and B

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:33.570
coefficient.

00:36:40.386 --> 00:36:42.760
I hope there are no further
questions about degeneracies.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:48.780
But you know, making
this comment also

00:36:48.780 --> 00:37:04.285
allows me to say, well, when
I derived the Einstein A

00:37:04.285 --> 00:37:08.240
coefficient-- what we did
last class-- I did not

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.600
use any degeneracy factors.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.520
Well, this is correct.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.740
Our derivation
assumed that there

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:26.890
was-- we assumed that there
is only one final state.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:29.730
We did not include
degeneracy factors.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:33.290
We also assumed that
we had a dipole matrix

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:41.160
element, which was
along the z-axis.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:46.120
And so by those definitions,
I have implicitly

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.710
picked a geometry,
which can be represented

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.270
by that we have
an exciting piece

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:57.580
state in the m equals 0 state.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.960
And we have a pie transition
with linear polarization

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.690
to this s state.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.657
And by doing that,
I did not have

00:38:05.657 --> 00:38:06.990
to account for any degeneracies.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:26.200
But in general, if you
derive microscopically

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.570
an equation for
spontaneous emission,

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.520
you may have to take into
account that your excited

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.680
state has different
transitions-- sigma plus

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.510
and sigma minus transitions--
to different states.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.380
And you have to
be careful how you

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.370
do the sum over all
possible finer states.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:48.957
And this is where degeneracies
would eventually matter?

00:38:48.957 --> 00:38:49.456
Questions?

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:58.970
OK, so then lets go from
P counting or accounting

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.940
for the number of
states to something,

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.920
which is hopefully
more exciting.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.880
We want to talk about the
fully quantized Hamiltonian.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.710
So what we are
working towards now

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:36.660
and it may spill over
into the Wednesday class

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:42.750
is I want to give you the
sort of paradigmatic example

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:47.690
of cavity QED where an atom
within an excited state

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:50.020
is in an empty cavity.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.920
And now it can emit a photon
into the mortification

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.140
mode of the cavity.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.890
But these photon
can be reabsorbed.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:01.490
So this is a phenomenon of
vacuum Rabi oscillations.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:04.180
And so I want to set up
the Hamiltonian and then

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.380
the equation to
demonstrate to you

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.890
the vacuum Rabi oscillations.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:11.250
And for me, the vacuum
Rabi oscillations

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:16.050
are the demonstration,
that spontaneous emission,

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:19.550
has no randomness,
no spontaneity,

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:25.260
so to speak because you can
observe coherent oscillation.

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:30.070
A coherent time evolution
of the whole system

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:36.380
and which is possible only
due to spontaneous emission.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.570
So let's go there.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:51.600
So just to make the
connection, a few lectures ago,

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.380
we had a semi
classical Hamiltonian.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.170
This is when I
wanted to show you

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:06.170
that the two level electronic
system can be mapped

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:12.360
onto a spin one half system
driven by magnetic field.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.565
So this was when we only
looked at the stimulated term

00:41:15.565 --> 00:41:18.990
when we only did
perturbation theory.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:26.040
And in that situation, we had
the electronic excitation.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:31.540
And then we had the
drive field, which

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:35.940
was assumed to be purely
classical like a rotating

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:40.390
magnetic field which drives
spin up spin down transitions

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:42.250
magnetically.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:47.980
And we concluded that, yes,
if you use a laser field,

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:51.520
it does exactly the same
to a two level atom what

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.250
a magnetic field does
to spin up spin down.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.140
But now we are one step further.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.310
We've quantized the
electromagnetic field.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:00.100
And we have
spontaneous emission.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.960
And this is something, for
reasons I just mentioned,

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.260
you will never find
in spin up spin down

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.790
because it will take 1,000
years for spontaneous emission

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:08.750
to happen.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:13.080
So now we want to actually
go beyond this semi classical

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.500
picture, which is fully
analogous to the precession

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.064
and rotation of the spin
in a magnetic field.

00:42:18.064 --> 00:42:19.730
And we want to add
spontaneous emission.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:35.360
So what we had here
is the Rabi frequency

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.000
was a matrix element--
the dipole matrix

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.790
element-- times a
classic electric field.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:47.760
And we want to replace that
now by the electric field

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.550
at the position of the atom.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.500
But we want to use the
fully quantized version

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.520
of the electric field.

00:42:56.929 --> 00:43:04.930
And it also becomes useful to
look at the sigma x operator,

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:11.480
which actually has two matrix
elements of [INAUDIBLE], which

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.830
connects ground excited
and excited ground state.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:21.980
And one of them is going from
the excited to the ground

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.910
state.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:25.460
So this is, sort of,
lowering the energy

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.700
to sigma minus operator.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.780
And the other one will
be a raising operator.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.510
It raises the
excitation of the atom.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.430
And we will refer
to it as sigma plus.

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:45.370
So the electric
field is replaced

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:49.567
by the operator obtained from
the fully quantized picture.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:59.240
Here we have the
prefactor, which

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.400
is the electric field of a
single photon or half a photon,

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.160
whatever.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.789
But it's factors of
2 r square over 2.

00:44:07.789 --> 00:44:08.830
We have the polarization.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:17.280
And now if you would
take the previous result

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.210
and would look at it.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.430
Well we want to go to
the Schrodinger picture.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:24.760
And I mentioned that in
the Schrodinger picture

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.010
the operators are
time independent.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.970
So we cancelled the e
to the i omega t term.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:33.490
If you would go to the
result we had last week

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:37.320
and would simply get rid of
the e to the i omega t term,

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:43.220
you would now find
operators a and dagger.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:47.220
But they would have factors
of i in front of it.

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.810
That's a equation we
had when we derived it.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:56.220
Well I prefer note to use
something which looks nicer.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.970
Just use a and a dagger.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:09.750
And you can obtain it by
shifting the origin of time.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:17.790
So we're not looking e to
the i omega t or t equals 0.

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:22.430
We wait a quarter period into e
to the i omega t just gives us

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:26.800
factors of i, which conveniently
cancel the other factors of i.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.300
So what I'm doing is
just for convenience.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:40.296
And let me write down that this
is in the Schrodinger picture.

00:45:48.336 --> 00:45:48.835
OK.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:46:02.980
So we want to absorb all
constant by in one constant

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:07.600
now, which is the single
photon Rabi frequency.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:12.730
We have the type or matrix
element of the atom.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:16.920
There's a dot product with
the polarization of the light.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.570
And then we have the
electric field amplitude

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:20.770
of a single photon.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:25.170
h bar omega over 2 epsilon 0 v.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:29.210
So this is what appears
in the coupling.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:35.200
And we want to write it
s h bar omega 1 over 2.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:40.930
And this omega 1 is the
single photon Rabi frequency.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:44.730
And with that, we have
now a Hamiltonian,

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:47.700
which is really a classic
Hamiltonian, written down

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.430
in the standard form.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:59.820
It has the excitation energy
times the sigma z matrix.

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:04.712
It has the single
photon Rabi frequency.

00:47:04.712 --> 00:47:13.150
The single photon Rabi
frequency appears.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:16.690
You know, this is the single
photon Rabi frequency.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.650
But then the operator
for the electric field,

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:23.520
after getting rid off the i's,
is simply h plus h dagger.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:33.510
h plus h dagger.

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:37.130
So this takes care
of the photon field.

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.680
And the operator which
acts on the atoms

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:43.920
are the raising and lowering
operator sigma plus and sigma

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.390
minus.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:50.420
And finally, we have
the Hamiltonian,

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.870
which describes the
photon field which

00:47:52.870 --> 00:48:01.170
is h bar omega times a dagger
a the photon number operator.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:06.330
Any questions?

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:07.770
Yes?

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:08.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:20.076 --> 00:48:21.450
PROFESSOR: I mean,
we are looking

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:24.870
at the interaction with an atom,
which is at rest at the origin.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.040
Therefore, e to the ikr is 0.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:31.900
We will only consider
the spatial dependence e

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:36.230
to the ikr when we
allow the atom to move.

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:38.830
As long as the atom is
stationary for convenience,

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:41.090
we put the atom at i equals 0.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:46.370
But in 8.422 when we talk about
light forces and laser cooling,

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:51.130
then it becomes essential
to allow the photon to move.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:55.040
And this is actually where the
recoil and the light forces

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.704
come into play.

00:48:55.704 --> 00:48:57.870
But as long as we're not
interested in light forces,

00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:01.570
only in the internal dynamics--
calm and excited state--

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:06.550
we can conveniently neglect
our spatial dependencies.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.216
Other questions?

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.430
So this is really a
famous Hamiltonian.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.490
And you also see how
natural the definition

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:28.180
of the single-photon
Rabi frequency.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:33.010
So we have one half h bar
omega for the diagonal sigma z

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:33.680
matrix.

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.280
This is the atomic excitation.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.740
This is the unperturbed
Hamiltonian of the atom.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.290
This is the unperturbed
Hamiltonian of the photon.

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:43.340
And now the two are coupled.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:46.640
And the coupling is a
product of an operator acting

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:50.250
on the photon field
plus minus one photon.

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:54.730
And the other one is an
operator acting on the atoms.

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:58.910
And it is plus, minus,
and atomic excitation.

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:01.570
So let me just
remind you of that.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:04.130
The sigma plus and
sigma minus operator.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.620
The sigma plus is the
atomic raising operator,

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:12.440
which takes a ground
to the excited state.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:17.360
And the sigma minus operator is
the atomic lowering operator,

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.910
which takes the atom from the
excited to the ground state.

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:24.860
So this is our Hamiltonian.

00:50:28.696 --> 00:50:34.500
And to hear about space on
which this Hamiltonian acts

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.520
is the product
space of the atom.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:43.050
Direct product of the
states of the light.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.310
Or in other words,
the basis state

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:53.360
would be that we
use for the atoms.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.700
The states which have zero
or one quantum of excitation.

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:02.110
So we use excited
state or ground state.

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:08.500
And for the photon, we can
just use the Fock states

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:13.140
where the occupation
number is n.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.510
Questions about that?

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:25.860
So it's a very-- just look
at it with some enjoyment

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.100
for a few seconds.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.970
I mean, this is a Hamiltonian,
which has just a few terms.

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.640
But what is behind
it is, of course,

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.560
a power of all the definitions.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.980
I mean, each symbol
has so much meaning.

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:44.360
But in the end, by having
this formalism of operators

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.570
quantized electromagnetic field.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:52.170
We can write down-- we can
catch many, many aspects

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:55.640
or we can, pretty much, fully
describe how a two level

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.510
system interacts a quantized
electromagnetic field

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:00.646
with that set of equations.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.340
Of course, the fact is not
that everything is so simple.

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:11.200
The fact is that we have, by
understanding the physics,

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.410
we have skillfully
made definitions,

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:17.160
which allow us to
write everything down

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.205
in this compact form.

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:23.380
So often something is
simple to write down.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.050
But if there's a lot
of physics insight,

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:28.470
we spend some time
in discussing it.

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:31.380
And the first thing I want
to just point out and discuss

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.730
is this interaction term.

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:36.240
We have the product of
sigma plus and sigma

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.560
minus with a and a dagger.

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:43.724
So what we have here is we
have an interaction term.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:53:00.320
And this interaction part
has actually four terms

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.494
in a very natural way.

00:53:03.494 --> 00:53:06.960
Well, let me just
write them down.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:12.080
It's sigma plus with a.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.260
Sigma minus with a dagger.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:20.490
Sigma plus with a dagger.

00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:25.590
And sigma minus with a.

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:29.880
OK, so let's discuss those.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:33.050
Sigma plus with a dagger.

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:38.980
Sigma plus is actually
an absorption process.

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:44.850
a reduces the photo
number by one,

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:48.860
and increases the
atomic excitation

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.560
from the column to
the excited state.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:01.790
The other term looks naturally,
intuitively like emission.

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:06.690
The a dagger operator takes
us from n to n plus 1.

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:10.800
And sigma minus takes us
from the excited state

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.820
to the current state.

00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.580
So these are the
two terms, which

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:25.590
we would call intuitive terms
because they make sense.

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:29.050
The other terms are
somewhat more tricky.

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:34.450
Sigma plus and a dagger
means we create a photon

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:37.240
and we create an excitation.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:40.530
So in other words, it's not
that, like the other term,

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:44.110
quantum of excitation disappears
from the field, appears

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:46.080
in the atom, and vice versa.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:52.150
Sigma plus a dagger means
we have an atom excitation

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:55.980
takes us from the ground
to the excited state.

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:59.600
Plus, we emit a photon
at the same time.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:02.520
And sigma minus a
dagger means that we

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.470
go from the excited
to the ground state.

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:09.065
So we have an atom d excitation.

00:55:09.065 --> 00:55:10.530
And I would say,
well, if the atom

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:13.990
is d excited it
should emit a photon.

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:20.765
But instead, the
photon disappears.

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:31.170
So we have those processes.

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:37.520
The last two are
sometimes referred to

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.490
in the theoretical literature.

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:42.450
They are off shell.

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:44.750
Under shell is
energy conservation.

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:48.860
Off shell means they
cannot conserve energy.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.510
But nevertheless,
these are terms

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:52.855
which appear in the operator.

00:55:57.828 --> 00:56:00.385
But you should be used to
if you have often terms

00:56:00.385 --> 00:56:03.900
in the operator which cannot
drive a resonant transition.

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.740
When you looked at the DC
stock effect or when we looked

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.970
at the AC stock effect
for low frequency photons,

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:13.945
those low frequency photons
cannot excite an atom

00:56:13.945 --> 00:56:15.960
to the excited state.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.960
So they are not
causing a transition,

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:22.500
but they led to energy shifts
in second order perturbation

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.260
theory.

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:32.280
So therefore, those terms
this language now cannot drive

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.340
transitions.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:37.111
They can only drive transitions
to virtual states, which

00:56:37.111 --> 00:56:39.610
would mean they can only appear
in second order perturbation

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:42.840
theory that you go up to
a so-called virtual state

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.460
but you immediately go down.

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:49.590
And those terms give
only rise to shifts.

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.230
No transitions because you
couldn't conserve energy

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:57.750
in the transition.

00:56:57.750 --> 00:57:00.540
But you can do shifts
in second order.

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:07.850
And one example, which we
discussed in the clicker

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:16.720
question is that those shifts
are actually lamb shifts.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.770
And in other places,
especially in the context

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:29.770
of microwave fields, they are
called Bloch-Siegert shifts

00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:35.380
And let's just look
at one specific state.

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:39.030
And this is the simplest of all.

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:42.670
We have the vacuum no photons.

00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:45.980
And the atom is in
the ground state.

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:49.380
If you look at the
four possibilities

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:54.830
of the interaction term, there
is only one non vanishing term.

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:58.220
The photon is at the bottom
off all possible states.

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.890
The atom is at the bottom
of the possible states.

00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:04.250
So when we act with
the four terms on it,

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:05.820
the only term which
contributes is

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:08.360
where those is where
those are raised

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.840
because all the others are 0.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:23.120
The only non vanishing
term is where

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:30.030
we create a virtual
atomic excitation and also

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:34.090
a virtual excitation
of the photon field.

00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:37.870
And we know that when we
have an atom in the ground

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:42.650
state in the vacuum that
the only manifestation

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:45.600
of the electromagnetic
field is, of course, not

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.720
spontaneous emission
but the lamb shift.

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:56.050
So therefore, if you
would apply this operator

00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:59.910
to the bound state of
an electron in an atom,

00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:04.550
the complicated 1s wave
function of hydrogen and sum

00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:08.500
this operator over all modes
of the electromagnetic field.

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:12.070
Then you would have done
a first principle QED

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:14.500
calculation of the lamb shift.

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.480
I'm not doing it but
you should understand

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:20.490
that this operator--
sigma plus a dagger--

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:23.052
is you operator
for the Lamb shift.

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:28.610
Questions?

00:59:31.471 --> 00:59:31.970
Yes?

00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:32.962
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:41.500
PROFESSOR: Oh,
no, everything is.

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:45.050
If you have a two level
system, this Hamiltonian

00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:50.180
captures everything
which appears in nature

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.710
if you have a two level
system interacting

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:55.870
with the electromagnetic field.

00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:58.220
That's it.

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.410
A radiation reaction
is just something

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:02.040
we can pull out of here.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.520
Stimulated emission we
can pull out of here.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:08.190
The way how vacuum fluctuations
create a lamb shift or the way

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:12.150
how vacuum fluctuations affect
an atom in the excited state,

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.460
everything is included in here.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.820
The question is just
can we solve it.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.260
And the calculations
can get involved.

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.280
But this is the
full QED Hamiltonian

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.110
for a two level system.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:27.150
That's a full picture.

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:30.070
I mean, that's why I sort of
said before be proud of it.

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:34.220
You understand the full picture
of how two level systems

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.660
interact with
electromagnetic radiation.

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:40.280
The only complication is, yes,
if you put more levels into it

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.530
and such and things can
get richer and richer.

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:57.190
And-- yes, we have also made
the dipole approximation,

01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:02.674
which we're just wondering
how critical it is.

01:01:02.674 --> 01:01:04.632
Well, we use the electric
field a and a dagger,

01:01:04.632 --> 01:01:12.360
but my gut feeling is it doesn't
really matter what we have.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.015
Here is the most generic term,
which can create and annihilate

01:01:16.015 --> 01:01:17.890
photons, and we have
the a and a dagger term.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.600
Actually, I don't
know what would

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.294
happen if you don't make
the dipole approximation.

01:01:32.294 --> 01:01:33.710
Well, if you have
two levels which

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:37.340
are coupled by magnetic
dipole, then you

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.140
have the same situation.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:43.790
It is just your prefactor, the
semi photon Rabi frequency,

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:47.420
is now alpha times smaller
because of the smaller dipole

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.770
matrix element.

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:57.670
So I think you can pick, pretty
much, any level you want.

01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:01.710
And this is why I actually
discussed matrix elements

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:03.970
at the beginning of the unit.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.745
For, pretty much,
all of the discussion

01:02:05.745 --> 01:02:07.510
you're going to have,
it doesn't really

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:09.980
matter what kind of
transition you have as long

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:13.590
as the transition creates
or annihilates a photon.

01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:19.000
And all the physics of the
multiplicity of the transition,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.380
magnetic, dipole, electric,
quadrupole, or whatever

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.530
just defines what this the
semi photon Rabi frequency is.

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:29.750
You've put me on the
spot, but the only thing

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:35.010
which comes to my mind now
is if you would formulate QED

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:38.070
not in the dipole approximation
but through with the p

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:41.700
minus a formulation.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.780
Then we have an a-square term.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:46.620
And then we have the
possibility that one transition

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.440
can emit two photons.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.158
So that's not included here.

01:02:50.158 --> 01:02:53.651
AUDIENCE: So that's higher--

01:02:53.651 --> 01:02:56.670
PROFESSOR: This would be
something higher order.

01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:58.300
On the other hand,
we can shoulder

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.910
the canonical
transformation that the p

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:04.120
minus a formalization
with the a-square term

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.370
is equivalent to
dipole approximation.

01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:10.010
So the question whether
you have a transition which

01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:14.460
emits two photons simultaneously
or two photons sequentially

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:20.810
eventually by going
through an immediate state,

01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:23.610
this is not a
fundamental distinction.

01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:26.130
You can have one description
of your quantum system

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:28.830
via two photons automated
in one transition.

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:31.860
You have another description
of your quantum system where

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.980
photons cannot-- only one
photon can be emitted.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.800
And then you have to lend
an intermediate state.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.710
And you would say, well,
either two photons at once

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:42.370
or one photon at a time.

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:44.420
This is two different
kinds of physics.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.770
But we can show that the
two pictures are connected

01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:48.790
with economical transformation.

01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:52.290
So therefore, you have
two descriptions here.

01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:55.090
But anyway, I'm going a little
bit beyond my knowledge.

01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:57.380
I'm just telling you
bits and pieces I know.

01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:07.700
But this Hamiltonian is
either generally exact.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:10.740
I just don't know
how to prove it.

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.510
But it really captures
in all of the QED aspects

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:16.570
of the system we
want to get into.

01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:29.490
So OK.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:34.940
So in many situations
we may decide

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:39.270
that the off shell
terms of the interaction

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:43.480
just create level shifts, Lamb
shifts, Bloch-Siegert shifts.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.540
And we may simply
absorb those lamb shifts

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.410
in our atomic energy
levels, omega e and omega g.

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:54.546
So therefore, for the
dynamic of the system,

01:04:54.546 --> 01:04:56.170
if you include all
of those lamb shifts

01:04:56.170 --> 01:05:00.210
in the atomic description, you
do not need those off shell

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:02.120
counter intuitive terms.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.860
These are actually also
the counter-rotating terms

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.140
in the semi classical
approximation.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:11.220
We only keep the
intuitive terms.

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:17.560
And that's called, again, the
rotating wave approximation.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.600
Just to remind you, we do
not have rotating waves here.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.970
Everything is operators.

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:26.830
But the same kind of physics--
co- and counter-rotating--

01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:30.220
appears here that
we have four terms.

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.490
Two are the fully
quantized version

01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:35.230
of the co-rotating terms.

01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:37.620
And the other two--
the off shell terms--

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:41.600
are the quantized version of
the counter rotating term.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:49.600
So therefore, if you neglect
those two off shell terms,

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:58.165
we have now the fully
quantized Hamiltonian

01:05:58.165 --> 01:05:59.623
in the rotating
wave approximation.

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:07.150
So let me just write it
down because it's also

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:09.100
a beautiful line.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:13.450
We have the electronic system.

01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:19.400
We have the interaction
Hamiltonian,

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.220
which has now owned
the two terms.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.490
When we raise the
atomic excitation,

01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:28.640
we lower the photon
excitation and vice versa.

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:41.550
And we have the Hamiltonian for
the photon field a dagger a.

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:52.240
And this is apart from
those lamb shift terms.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.555
The full QED description
of the system.

01:06:57.290 --> 01:07:05.470
And if we only consider
one mode-- here, of course,

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:06.980
in general, the
general Hamiltonian

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:08.549
has to be sent over a modes.

01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:10.840
And then you'll get spontaneous
emission and everything

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.760
we want.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.160
But if you have a
situation where you only

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:21.170
look at one single
mode, then you have what

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:32.960
is called the famous
chains Cummings model

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:38.405
And very important result
of this James Cummings model

01:07:38.405 --> 01:07:40.310
are the vacuum
Rabi oscillations,

01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:42.478
which I want to discuss now.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.220
OK.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:03.280
So let me just-- it's
called James Cummings Model.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.070
So let me describe to
you why it is a model.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:09.030
Well it assumes a
two level system,

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:13.790
which we find a lot of
candidates among the atoms

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:14.710
we want.

01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:17.910
Sure our atoms have
hyperfine states.

01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:21.130
But we can always
select a situation

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.779
where, essentially, we
only couple two states.

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:26.370
We can prepare initial
state by optical pumping,

01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:28.740
and then use circularly
polarized slide

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.390
on a cycling transition.

01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:33.439
And this is how we prepare
in the laboratory a two level

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:34.540
system.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:38.890
So that's one assumption of this
model with a two level system.

01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:46.500
But the second assumption
is that the atom only

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.250
interacts with a similar mode.

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.580
And that requires a
little bit of engineering

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.420
because it means
we need a cavity.

01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:01.414
So let me just
set up the system.

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:08.240
So our laboratory is
a big box of volume

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:14.120
v. And this is where we maybe
quantize electromagnetic field

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.899
to calculate
spontaneous emission.

01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:21.020
And our atom here
may actually decay

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.990
with the rate gamma, which
is given by the Einstein A

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:25.229
coefficient.

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:28.859
And in order to describe
this spontaneous emission,

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:35.319
be quantized electromagnetic
field in the large volume v.

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:39.249
But now we have a
cavity with two mirrors.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:52.979
And those two mirrors
define one mode

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:55.300
of the electromagnetic
field, which

01:09:55.300 --> 01:10:02.460
will be in resonance on your
resonance with the atom.

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:11.200
Well there will be some losses
out of the cavity, which

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.980
eventually coupe the
electromagnetic mode

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.200
inside the cavity to the other
awards modes in the speaker

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:22.500
volume v. And this is
described by a cavity damping

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.520
constant kappa.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.770
What is also important is when
we use cavity to single out one

01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:37.790
mode of the
electromagnetic field,

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:40.850
the cavity volume is v prime.

01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:44.560
And we often make it very
small by putting the atoms

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.360
in the cavity where the mirror
spacing is extremely small.

01:10:50.995 --> 01:10:51.495
OK.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.060
We know, and I'm not
writing it down again,

01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:01.140
what the Einstein
A coefficient is.

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:05.540
The Rabi frequency-- the
single photon Rabi frequency--

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:14.120
which couples the atom to
the one mode of the cavity

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:20.710
has this important
perfecter, which

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:26.210
was or is the electric field
of one photon in the cavity.

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:29.950
And importantly, it
involves the electric field

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:34.920
of the photon in the cavity
value, which is B prime.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.480
So now in addition
to using, you know--

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.510
now you see what our
experimental handle is.

01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:45.640
If you make this
volume very small,

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:54.690
then we can enter this
strong coupling regime

01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:59.540
where the single photon Rabi
frequency for this one mode

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:05.090
selected by the cavity
becomes much larger then

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:09.410
the spontaneous emission into
all the many other modes.

01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:13.440
So the interaction with
one mode due to the cavity

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.820
and the smallness of
the volume is, sort of,

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:20.380
outperforming all these many,
many modes of the surroundings.

01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:24.520
And that would mean that
an atom in an excited state

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.580
is more likely to emit into
the mode between the two

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:34.340
cavity mirrors than to any
other modes to the side.

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:37.820
Secondly, of course,
when the photon

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.380
has been emitted
into the cavity,

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:43.270
the photon can still
couple to the other modes

01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:46.090
by cavity losses kappa.

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:51.660
And now we assume that we have
such high reflectivity mirrors

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:55.308
that kappa is smaller that the
single photon Rabi frequency.

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:07.990
And this is called the strong
coupling regime of cavity QED.

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:19.830
So then we can at least
observe for a limited time

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:25.610
the interplay between a single
mode of the cavity and a two

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:26.500
level system.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.250
And this is a James
Cummings model.

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:30.531
The James Cummings model.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:40.510
So in that situation,
the Hamiltonian,

01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:49.200
the fully quantized Hamiltonian,
and the QED Hamiltonian couples

01:13:49.200 --> 01:14:00.670
only pairs of states
which we label

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:03.390
those states the manifold n.

01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:08.440
So we have an excited
state with n photons.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:17.060
And it is coupled to the ground
state with one more photon.

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:22.320
Our Hamiltonian has
two coupling terms.

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.600
Remember the other tool where
you clicked it in the rotating

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.060
wave approximation and we
can go from left to right

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:33.620
with sigma minus a data plus.

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:39.590
And we can go from right to left
with the operator sigma plus

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:41.907
and the annihilation
of the [INAUDIBLE] a.

01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:55.560
So as long as we have
a detuning delta,

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.875
which is relatively small.

01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:08.250
As long as detuning is small,
the rotating wave approximation

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:09.960
is excellent.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:19.960
So let me just conclude
by writing down

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.770
the Hamiltonian for the
situation I just discussed.

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:25.445
And then we'll discuss the
Hamiltonian on Wednesday.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:35.680
So if this is energy,
we have two levels.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.130
The excited state
with n photons,

01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:42.780
the ground state with
n plus 1 photons.

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:47.270
If the photons are on resonance,
the two levels are degenerate.

01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:50.881
But if you have
a detuning delta,

01:15:50.881 --> 01:15:52.975
the two levels are
split by delta.

01:15:56.650 --> 01:16:00.350
And what we are doing right
now is for the [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:02.840
the Hamiltonian,
we shift the origin

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.290
so the zero of the
energy is just halfway

01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:06.770
between those two states.

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:09.240
That's natural.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:19.470
So this avoids just off
sets in our equations.

01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:22.730
So our Hamiltonian
has now the splitting

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:28.930
of plus minus delta over two.

01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:32.770
The coupling has the perfecter,
which is the single photon Rabi

01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:34.430
frequency.

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:51.470
And then the a
and a dagger terms

01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:54.030
depends on n square
root n plus 1.

01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:56.980
So what I wrote down now is
the Hamiltonian rotating wave

01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:00.450
approximation, which
interacts, which

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:03.490
describes only one
pair of states.

01:17:03.490 --> 01:17:05.970
But we have sort of a
cause in our Hilbert space.

01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:09.610
One pair of states
for each label n.

01:17:09.610 --> 01:17:11.600
But each of them is,
sort of, described

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.510
by the decoupled Hamiltonian.

01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:19.520
So that's what I wanted
to present you today.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.210
And I will show you on Wednesday
how this Hamiltonian needs

01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:28.310
to Rabi oscillations not
induced by an external field

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.440
but induced by the vacuum.

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.590
Any questions?
